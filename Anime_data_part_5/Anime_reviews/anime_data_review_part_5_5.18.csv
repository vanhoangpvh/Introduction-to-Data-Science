Huan Jie Wang,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37887/Huan_Jie_Wang,"['Hey everyone!I have just finished this show and since there is no synopsis for this show, I have decided to write a short review.To warn all of you, the review may contain some minor spoilers, but not something that should ruin the enjoyment ( since there is none at all :) )To be honest, the reason why I chose this show was only for practicing my Chinese. I expected nothing. And what I got from this show? Yeah! Exactly what I expected ... Nothing !The story was horribly plain, not even mentioning the characters. But first things first. Let\'s start with the...story!As I said, the story was plain and had no depth at all. Do not expect any storybuilding, worldbuilding or explanation of the basic facts. Where the show takes place? What is the history? What is the country\'s name? and so on, you will never learn the answer. Everything is rushed and the story keeps skipping from one thing to another, the pacing is just not appropriate!I will add some brief summary of the story. Basically, in one episode there was an explanation about the demon king Ku Longwang (Dragon King) and how he tried to overtake the world, but failed and afterwards he was sealed forever.... Then there is a boy called Chu Lingxiao. The boy that aims to be the best martial artist (or just a fighter if you want) in the whole world. He is simple-minded and dumb. Since there is no background story of the main character, I can only keep wondering why he decided out of blue to be the world\'s biggest hot shot, but my guess it was out of his pure stupidity.So, since there is no background story, no character development is to be expected. Our MC left his home with his (totally unimportant) best friend Bai Feng to enroll the academy of magic and martial arts. On his way, he met a pretty girl and saved her from the ""bad guys"". But of course, stupid plot-twist was to be expected, she actually is a bad girl involved in movement for reviving the demon king. After that, more than half of the show was spent about useless describing of how is MC desperatelly trying to enroll the academy and about his ""funny"" fails.But of course, he was stupid enough to get involved with the demon king himself, who bought his body in exchange for some OP powers. What the hell was the MC thinking? Oh, demon pops up out of nowhere, tells me he wants to give me his power. Not shady at all, let\'s accept! And so he became some kind of super over-powered hotshot using the power of the demon king and have not raised any suspicion at all. How surprising it was, when in the end he learned the identity of the ""mysterious"" demon.It pains me a lot to see how many plot holes the show had. They even did not try to make the show properly. Of course, the mysterious girl ( Lan Ruobing ) he saved was an agent (as I said before) and was on a mission to get rid of him. I was outraged by fact she needed to wear some gender-changing cloak in order to enroll the academy with him. She could have just wear some jacket or cloak, trim her hair in order not to let herself to be uncovered, but was the gender-changing necessary? To make the show more straight she only had some romantic encounters with the MC as a girl.The show also displayed how ""the straight is our only way"" and anything else is completely unnaceptable, because after knowing identity of hers, (even after falling in love with each other) the MC was disgusted when Lan Ruobing tried to kiss him while wearing the cloak that made her a boy. What the hell. ""I love you so much, but only as a girl. As a boy, do not try to approach me, please."" This way of thinking is not even logical. If you love somebody, is gender really that big problem? But well, we are talking about the Chinese show, where only straight way is correct one, so no wonder....The character were poorly displayed. For example Bai Feng ( MC\'s best friend ) was totally plot/story useless character and his only purpose in this show was to get his ass kicked all the time and serve as a comparison with the MC\'s over-powerness. The show even aimed for some love triangle, but obviously failed because they were not able to give the third person involved in triangle more screen time. The show wasted time on useless scenes which they could have used for characters and at least try to do some proper story without homophobic hints.So, everyone. I would not recommend this show to you. The ONLY reason I am not crying over 200 minutes spent over this show is because I gritted my teeth and kept telling myself it is for improving my Chinese, otherwise I would drop this show as hard as Skrillex drops his beats.... so I will only recommend this show to you only if you are here to improve your Chinese as me. And for the others? Stay back from this show, it is not worth it. Trust me.Have a nice day, everyone! :) story!As I said, the story was plain and had no depth at all.

It will both captivate and hold you spell bound till the last minute and leave you wanting more, like it did for me. It is a wonderful story full of interesting characters that have depth and great interactions with others. They are not the one sided extras found in some Anime. They each have a back story that lets you know what brought them to the school and why. They each has a weakness but it is their strengths that bring them together. What is even better is we can watch them grow and become...stronger with each lesson they learn. They don't start out with God like powers nor do they gain them. But yet they don't give up on their goals no matter how hard it is for them.  The plot is fantastic as we or lead down the path that is both engaging and enjoyable. For me I didn't know where it was going with the many surprises awaiting. Not only is it worth watching but worth watching again. stronger with each lesson they learn.

Dragon Ball GT: Gokuu Gaiden! Yuuki no Akashi wa Suushinchuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/987/Dragon_Ball_GT__Gokuu_Gaiden_Yuuki_no_Akashi_wa_Suushinchuu,"['As someone who didn\'t enjoy GT, I enjoyed this. If I were in charge of the GT project I would have done something similar to this.This anime has a ""Dragon Ball"" feel to it as instead of having an extremely strong protagonist we have a child who goes on an adventure. (Just like in Dragon Ball). I found the main character to be quite likable as he reminded me of Goku, with how caring he is.The color pallet gives the show a nice bright look, just like what you would see in GT. Which of course fits this show really well as this adventure isn\'t...as serious as the Dragon Ball Z series was.Goku.JR has the same voice actor as Goku and Gohan as kids(in the english dub). Which I honestly don\'t get, but I like the voice any way as I am quite used to it. as serious as the Dragon Ball Z series was.Goku.JR has the same voice actor as Goku and Gohan as kids(in the english dub). Which I honestly don\'t get, but I like the voice any way as I am quite used to it.', ""I mostly like a lot of things Dragon ball related in general but I do feel A Hero's Legacy is sort of a forgotten relative within the franchise.I actually think this was a pretty good special that had some good aspects about it like it's story about this Goku looking child who is the grandson of Pan. Pan obtained a illness and Goku Jr has to find out about the Dragon Balls being something he remembers knowing about from his grandmother Pan. We don't know his Father/Mother all we know is that he is part of the Son Family.I like Goku Jr a lot, He...is a timid and shy child who doesn't want to fight most of the time and was picked on and bullied by those his age and mostly wanted no trouble.But keep in mind that Goku Jr hardly has any Saiyan genes, and that he hasn't trained much but he still has Saiyan blood in his DNA that lies a Saiyan trait is deep within him like any other Saiyan even if he is mostly a novice when it comes to battle but that's why I found him relatable.He starts learning things the hard way even for a small child. The special is mostly about trying to overcome personal obstacles at heart While trying to uncover a spark of bravery to live up to his Saiyan ancestor such as Son Goku as well as rising above past events, not just a typical underdog story but finding a sense of connection during tough periods of time which you see from Goku jr along with unlikely company in Puck who is another good character in this.The villains are mostly forgetful but they do harken back to some traditional enemies we had in the past of dragon ball which in turn benefits Goku Jr's first outing into unknown horizons. Some parts are left ambiguous for the viewers while watching this since this takes place far into the future of Dragon ball GT.The artwork is really nice and the soundtrack is great.The Ending of this is also a really good one as well that honestly makes watching this worth it. is a timid and shy child who doesn't want to fight most of the time and was picked on and bullied by those his age and mostly wanted no trouble.But keep in mind that Goku Jr hardly has any Saiyan genes, and that he hasn't trained much but he still has Saiyan blood in his DNA that lies a Saiyan trait is deep within him like any other Saiyan even if he is mostly a novice when it comes to battle but that's why I found him relatable.He starts learning things the hard way even for a small child.

Yes, we could have seen this and been content with it, but it would be nothing special - perhaps even boring. It would be unnecessarily prolonging the story and rehashing the same old things we've seen before. This story is perhaps the most human and relatable story we could have gotten from the franchise. It's all about a young boy growing into a man by gaining confidence and shrugging...off his anxieties to do the right thing in the face of danger.Goku Jr is probably the most relatable Dragonball character. He is nothing like Goku at all with a fighting fetish. He's not aware of his hidden power; he is frightened of bullies, and he holds a lot of anxieties about living up to the Goku name. When Pan falls ill, she gives him a life lesson: strength isn't about having power, but the ability to do the right thing in the face of fear. Goku Jr reacts to this by running off crying, but is inspired when he is alone and depressed and sees pictures of Pan and remembers her stories about Goku. He goes through a little change and gathers up strength to find the Dragonball (he thinks you only need the 4-Star ball) to save Pan.His newfound mission earns the respect of his bullies, and he goes on a journey with one of them to Mount Paozu, facing several adversaries such as thieves and monsters. There's a wonderful scene where Goku Jr sees his friend fall off a cliff because the young Saiyan was too afraid to act - a consequence of his fear preventing him to do the right thing. Again, he is alone and depressed, but ends up protecting a bear by standing strong in the face of fear, channeling his inner strength, and putting faith in his abilities.The ending is a great touch too he finds out he can't make the wish because he only has one Dragonball and we see all the built up frustration burst out, but a familiar face comes around and gives him some reassurance, which is a very tear-jerking scene. off his anxieties to do the right thing in the face of danger.Goku Jr is probably the most relatable Dragonball character.

It's a story taking place 100 years in the future after Baby's defeat and focuses on Pan's grandson Goku Jr. A timid boy who gets bullied at school and can't defend himself for shit.One day Pan gets ill to a dangerous degree and is hospitalized to the point he builds up courage to hunt for a Dragon Ball which suppose to be on Mount Paozu.On his way he and one of his bullies have to overcome challenges such escaping from witch.It is very adventure focused...and about learning independently. Goku Jr has not only learn to overcome his fears but also stop believing everyone.Puck may be an interesting character for the story but not someone who would want to see when you watch Dragon Ball. While he is Goku Jr's bully, he admires Pan. When he saw Goku Jr overcome his fear in one scene, he felt like helping him out with life advices. Those making him more than just a kid who uses his power to get what he wants.The enemies aren't very striking and more comic relief. Mamba is a crafty witch. Her henchmen have personality but are rather forgettable since they don't do much.During the special, Goku also awakens some weird power from time to time like any hybrid Saiyan. There is a certain mystery around it that may let you guess what is going on and at some point it seems like he is a completely different person. Depending on how you take it, it can ruin you the experience or not.While the final fight isn't anything impressive after what we have seen so far, it has some satisfaction.Animation and music is great. The quality does fit the movie standard and I did enjoy quiet a bit of it.Criticism is probably for people who this movie isn't for. This isn't your average Dragon Ball Special with a slice of life story or action packed continuation with people fighting using planet scattering punches. Especially since the final bad guy can be held at bay by an adult bear. Even compared to someone like Tao Pai Pai they don't feel like a threat.While there is comedy, it isn't the type of humor you are used to from Dragon Ball, Z or GT. And if so, they aren't funny to the level you would look back at the jokes with Master Roshi or Oolong. Nor are the characters as oblivious nor live under a rock like Goku at the start of the franchise.And the final antagonist is some generic badguy that appears out of nowhere as a final boss taking away from the challenge to beat Mamba and her goons.Lastly the ending is kinda making this adventure feel pointless, unless you see it as a reward for Goku Jr overcoming his fear and the mystical things happening when he finds the 4-Star Dragon Ball.Overall, it is a good movie for what it is. But if you want high stake fights and clashes that blow up the environment, or the clash between ideas of characters... probably skip this. and about learning independently.

This ending is THE BEST anime ending i think i have ever seen, its a cute story with Goku Jr. and his pal adventuring around. It has ALOT of emotion and feels almost too satisfying with how this movie ended compared to the GT series. The thing that makes this so good is that the MC isnt overpowered and has to overcome many things, it almost has an OG dragon ball feel to it.I believe that if you are a Dragon ball fan, this...is a must watch, i and i can guarantee you wont regret it. is a must watch, i and i can guarantee you wont regret it.', 'This might just be the strangest anime Dragon Ball has ever produced. There\'s no overarching bad guy, there is no large save the world threat, there is no over the top fights, there is no training. Basically everything you ever assiociated Dragon Ball with especially from King Piccolo Saga and onwards is pretty much not here, and it is easy to bash the movie for that, I do think if you look at it\'s own merits and as a standalone story, it\'s surprisingly compelling. It\'s impressive what they managed to pull off in less than an hour, and it\'s not your typical DB movie fare...of a big bad guy showing up, they fight for 30-40 minutes and it\'s over, this movie has as much story to it\'s bone as Wrath of the Dragon did only without the action and large scale stakes.What makes the movie interesting on it\'s own is that it feels like a decent kids fairy tale adventure movie and the film is quite comitted to telling that story. Goku Jr. starts off as a scared naive kid but slowly throughout the movie, he starts to stand up for himself and grows a backbone. Sure, none of this is super amazing but for is esstentially ""kids fairy tale movie Dragon Ball Edition"", this works pretty well.  Ironically, Dragon Ball started off as that so this movie in a sense is the story coming full circle. It start on Mount Poazu and it feels rather poetic that Goku Jr. learns about his grandfather on the very same place the DB story started. It surprisingingly feels ""grounded"" and personal for a Dragon Ball story since it\'s about Goku Jr. trying to help his dying grandma and it\'s about Goku Jr. trying to possibly grow up without her. Other positives include Pan being more of an interesting character being someone Goku Jr. aspires to be and Puck was surprisingly well done for a generic bully character, there was more depth to him that I was expecting there to be. Not only that but some of the morals the movie brings to the table like, ""don\'t trust nice people"" is rather deep for what is esstentially a story written for kids.Some negatives is that Puck somehow surviving the fall felt really forced and felt like the movie needed to end on a happy note, and it was never explained how Pan was able to survive her medical problems. The villains were also rather one note too, and they don\'t have any charisma or overly abusing the worf effect like past DB villains did. I get that the story is not about them but a good villain tends to elevate a story for me.Overall, for a movie I don\'t remember much despite renting it from Blockbuster a lot, I found it a lot more interesting than I thought it was going to be. I can even sort of reccomend this movie to those who never liked Dragon Ball at all since it is far removed from everything the series did from King Piccolo and onwards. of a big bad guy showing up, they fight for 30-40 minutes and it\'s over, this movie has as much story to it\'s bone as Wrath of the Dragon did only without the action and large scale stakes.What makes the movie interesting on it\'s own is that it feels like a decent kids fairy tale adventure movie and the film is quite comitted to telling that story.

Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2793/Hi_no_Tori_2772__Ai_no_CosmoZone,"[""Hi no Tori or Phoenix or Firebird is one of those end seventies/eighties movies which worth a look. it is a work of Tezuka (Atom/Astro, Blackjack, Leo Lion King...) whom is often regarded as the father of Manga!!  I was therefore rather curious to watch this anime.The story depicts a dystopia : A young pilot living in a society with genetic engineered individuals born for a precise purpose and belonging to specific classes has to find a mysterious being called 2772... What could that be?Obviously the story and the art itself have many influences from movies or novels  :...2001, Alien, a brave new world... which is a positive aspect.Art and animation are truly wonderful even by today's standards, and the animation can easily match Disney's movies. I was amazed by some scenes and the fluidity of the animation. Back at that time, every frames had to be drawn and colored by hand on celluloids.  Besides, some of you will recognize Tezuka classic characters (Black jack, the big nose researcher, the Walrus like old man...)The score is definitely a great feature of this movie. Wondrous classic music played by a symphonic orchestra conveys strong feelings and ideas even without word. Some parts of the movie are even speechless to let you appreciate this musical work.This anime addresses many issues and concepts even if I feel it was made for a young audience : Love, struggle for power, ecology, the superficiality of the bourgeoisie, prejudice and ignorance of politics...There are only 2 downsides : the humourous counterpart characters (2 funny creatures) which are quite often irritating and the rather Oedipal idea underlying the relation of the characters.Overall this Movie really deserves your interest, no matter your age or generation as it raises many questions and let you pondering it while listening to a magnificent melody.PS : for French speakers, the anime is dubbed very well in French. Excellent voice acting. 2001, Alien, a brave new world... which is a positive aspect.Art and animation are truly wonderful even by today's standards, and the animation can easily match Disney's movies.

Going into this, thoughts were not high from his work turned to animation, and maybe his creations were a thing of the past (60s Astro Boy). However, this is not the case. Firebird 2772 is an animation masterpiece to say the least. If anybody has seen Disney’s Snow White, know of Betty Boop 20’s animation, Fantasia; then put all the best aspects of those films and shows, put a little sci-fi anime twist, and you got yourself Hi no Tori...2772.The animation brings back the pure simplistic art with creative character designs reminiscent of the 1920’s. Sound is accompanied by full a full symphonic orchestra leading every scene to epic proportions. Even when the two cartoon comic-relief characters have their own music performances to give an ever intense movie a break from the action.2772 starts out very much like a silent movie, with only the screen and music telling the story of how our main protagonist, Godo, is created, grows, and assigned his job in the dystopian society that the world is in. What is Godo’s job, but to train in order to find and catch something? That something happens to be a firebird somewhere out in space. What is the firebird and why? One of the best aspects of this film is not just the animation, but learning as Godo learns. The struggle of Godo throughout all points in his life and the journey he must take along the way.The one major shortcoming is the lack of character reasoning. If you were raised from birth like a robot, wouldn’t you act like a robot? We never really grasp why Godo turns out the way he does as well as some of the other characters, which is only nitpicking at this point. 2772 is a fantastic work in animations, music, and story always making the anime fan want more. So go out and watch it. 2772.The animation brings back the pure simplistic art with creative character designs reminiscent of the 1920’s.

What is Godo’s job, but to train in order to find and catch something? That something happens to be a firebird somewhere out in space. What is the firebird and why? One of the best aspects of this film is not just the animation, but learning as Godo learns. The struggle of Godo throughout all points in his life and the journey he must take along the way.The one major shortcoming is the lack of character reasoning. If you were raised from birth like a robot, wouldn’t you act like a robot? We never really grasp why Godo turns out the way he does as well as some of the other characters, which is only nitpicking at this point. 2772 is a fantastic work in animations, music, and story always making the anime fan want more. So go out and watch it.', 'Even though Tezuka is held up on a high pedestal, as one of the the most important creators in all of manga and anime history, if you dig down into his works, turns there\'s plenty of bad mixed in with the good.  He was just so prolific, so many stories he produced over the years.Fortunately, 2772 turned out to be one of his better works.  And this movie is a minor cinematic gem worth watching.In the distant future, a young boy is raised with only one goal in mind:  to become a...space pilot.  Earth is slowly dying, and the world has been divided into the small fortunate elites, and everyone else.  At first tasked with a mission to capture the enigmatic space firebird (2772), but then tossed into a hellish prison for the sin of seducing one of the elites, he finds a way to escape, assemble a rag-tag group of companions in search of the firebird and Earth\'s salvation.Some of the most impressive features of this movie include the orchestral score, which works well with the animation, and the musical interludes are among the best parts to watch.  It also features a sympathetic protagonist, and a clear ""quest"" type storyline and clear resolution.However, it also suffers from some of Tezuka\'s omnipresent flaws.  For example, his tendency to re-use the same character designs over and over again in different works (e.g. Dr. Black Jack, the Professor) - I know his justification for it (as a ""cast of actors playing parts""), but no matter the justification that doesn\'t make it any less annoying.  Also, Tezuka can get a little preachy at times, but at least he is able to successfully pair death with rebirth in his Phoenix stories.  And, of course, the mixing in of the silly characters with the serious ones can also be off-putting (the worst part of this is the ""Star Wars cantina"" menagerie of creatures on his first extraplanetary visit.  Ugh.)But while an imperfect film, it remains worth watching, as one of Tezuka\'s stronger works. space pilot.

I admit I went into this movie assuming it would be some sort of mature and serious romance between two girls (the likes of which is rare in Anime as a whole) but that still doesn\'t excuse the massive letdown it is. Aside from its poor story and poor characters it also features a disgustingly high amount of fanservice, as if a relationship between two girls was just a concept to please the male eye.Where do I begin? Misuzu Moritani can stop the time at her own volition for 3...minutes a day. Not the most original concept, but you can make something out of it. Sadly, Fragtime doesn\'t. Misuzu uses this power to escape uncomfortable situations but one day she decides to stop the time and look under her classmate Haruka Murakami\'s skirt, only to find out that Haruka is not frozen in time but can actually see what Misuzu is doing. I have seen worse introductions to other stories in other movies, but this has to be among the worst.Misuzu and Haruka eventually start coming closer together because of Misuzu\'s power but the pacing of their progressing relationship is way too fast. Not even 10 minutes into the movie we find Haruka and Misuzu going on a date already because that is apparently the appropriate reaction to someone who sneak peaked under your skirt just a day before. And of course they go shopping in an underwear store because why would they even think about going anywhere else?From there on, the movie basically revolves around Misuzu messing around with her power. If this was the basic idea of the story and there was some kind of ""lessons learned"" at the end where Misuzu grows as a person and learns to not abuse it, it would have been fine. But none of her actions ever have consequences and there is nothing be learned. Misuzu stops the time during a test, Haruka starts stripping her clothes down and they have sex (it\'s implied at least) in front of everyone. Is this what I came to watch this movie for? Really this?The characters in Fragtime are painfully bland and stereotypical; none of them has any personality. If you want to be generous, you can attribute some personality to Haruka but that\'s as far as it goes. Most of the characterization happens in the last 10 - 15 minutes where ever so slight bits of Haruka\'s personality are brought to light. However, it doesn\'t make any of her actions any more believable as any person with at least some sort of common sense or dignity would have done things much different from her. This movie does a poor job at creating believable characters that anyone would care about. They are just a blank slate and an excuse to show some underwear on screen.If you are looking for an actual romance Anime, this is not the movie you should consider watching. It\'s a light-hearted scifi ... drama, I guess? But even if so, then barely. The movie focuses less on the actual relationship between Misuzu and Haruka but more so the way she handles her power to stop time. If the concept of time manipulation is something you are interested in, then you are better off watching Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo and if you are looking for a serious yuri relationship drama, then you are better off watching Aoi Hana. Fragtime is just a disgrace for the entire yuri genre. I can not recommend watching this.3/10 minutes a day. Not the most original concept, but you can make something out of it.

Don’t go and expect that there is depth dedicated towards the power, because it is more important what the two main protagonist do with it. This anime has lots of subtle and more obvious hints towards their symbolism and deeper meaning. This is the story of two girls finding each other and their selves.Given the nature of this anime I’m discussing the symbolism and characters at once.Misuzu MoritaniThe story is told as we mostly follow Misuzu and her thoughts....A quiet girl with no friends, no aspiration. Your average quiet kid of the class. Other people seem to have trouble with socializing with her because she kind of lives in her own bubble, her own world of 3 minutes silence. Her power is to stop time for 3 minutes. This is her escapism to trouble and pressure.Haruka MurakamiTop student of the class, beautiful and most loved by the class. She has a unapproachable aura as she is to perfect for other boys or girls. However due to that she is extremely popular. You can see her being very lenient and helping other classmates. She is so lenient it almost looks like she doesn’t care at all. Being haunted and driven by hear own fear, she has no personality. She selfishly keeps on giving. Her line “do whatever you want” oooh damn, that’s hot.Story:So Misuzu can stop time and Haruka can move while time is stopped. While Haruka gives the most obvious hint herself “You love me, you want to spend time with me”. This is an extremely important sentence. Both of the girl has something they want to escape and obtain. Haruka can move in the stopped time because Misuzu wants it in her own world. Without too much fuss about the working of power it gives off a strong symbol. In the second half where everything goes downhill, Haruka’s actions all makes sense. Why she wants Misuzu and why she goes crazy in those 30 seconds. There are some more hidden symbols (with sort of flashes) but I didn’t quite get that.I think this anime is easy to watch as it spells out the important aspects and quickly comes to the point. Both of the girls can take the initiative and aren’t holding back to much (unlike most romance anime). The dialogues or sometimes a bit cheesy and lacks some passion. It disappoints me that the voice actress didn’t do it as good as I hoped (they both voiced major roles) I couldn’t feel much emotions from them.

This is basically me lashing out on how the reviews doesn't understand this movie and thusly rate it low and doesn’t say anything of substance. Even though reviews shouldn’t talk about other reviewers, I feel like I should get to say something to boost its criminally low rating and popularity by mentioning something valuable about this movie that no one else does. Usually I wouldn’t review anything, but since it has such a low score...and I felt in the mood to write this review as well, I feel like going to war against these peoples opinions and tell you why you should watch this movie and how it has value since no one here seems to talk about it, even the most popular positive review didn’t. Usually I just write this out in tags in my anime list to vent a little and maybe just have it there for people to see when they consider watching it, but this time is different.Spoilers in the next paragraphs if you care (and please if you do care, but want a reason to watch it without spoilers, then I’ll say that the reason this movie is good is because of the messaging through the psychology and personalities in the main characters and how their personalities hurts them. Watch this movie with the messaging in mind and how the character interactions and character developement shows this.)Now you could argue that they didn’t need to have been that sexualized, however in a way I find some value in that considering the topic at hand here. This anime is about the people pleasers in our society and how it fucks us up and hopefully makes other people pleasers realize that they might be doing something they don’t want to. I wouldn’t say Im great at analyzing movies or media, not really, but jesus christ why are no one talking about the psychology going on? That’s like the whole point of the movie. If you don’t understand the significance in how the main characters in this movie develops, then you totally missed the point. When they learn the problems with their personalities, that's them actually realizing that their own personalities are based on lying and how bad that is for them. Now that’s the only thing important in this movie in my opinion and it is such a good message to send out when lots of people are in this situation and they might not even know they’re there and just needs a wakeup call. When you critique how these characters doesn’t have interesting personalities and that they’re passive, then that’s exactly the point. So when they with their lame personalities go about life being objectified, being taken advantage of, then I believe that you shouldn’t necessarily say that the sexualization serve no purpose at all when it shows how their lives seemed material with no meaning from the start. The first interaction between Moritani and Murakami was Moritani looking up her skirt, so we already know by virtue of our knowledge of Murakami as a people pleaser that Murakami is going to give Moritani what she wants to please her. So no I don’t find the sexualization to be irrelevant at all. In this movie I would much rather ague that it serves an important function for the message the anime is trying to portray.I know how hard it is to deal with the double edged sword which is being a people pleaser, it includes constantly thinking about what not to say and do to upset someone you don’t want to be upset. It makes you wind up a silent and passive type, unless you’re more of a sociopathic person like Murakimi in this anime who can read people pretty well. People pleasing is like lying. When you lie you try to control the outcomes of a given social conversation, in essence, you’re manipulating someone, and people pleasing is lying to others about yourself. When you agree with someone that a movie was great, but you’re actually lying, you might not even notice what you actually think of the movie, much like Murakami who doesn’t know what she wants at all. The only thing people know is that you try to be liked and desperately don’t want people to dislike you, which is unhealthy for any relationship. A lot of people go about life in this manner not even realizing it and not really having a choice when doing this, they just happened to find more comfort when people like them and avoid the discomfort when they don’t.The main character in the anime Moritani doesn’t participate in the social life of others as much as she can. She does this because she finds herself not comfortable in social conversations and because of this she doesn’t get what she needs to get more comfortable, which is talking to people, yet, despite others striking up conversation with her, she doesn't reciprocate. So when she got the power of pausing time, she abused it to get out of them. The fact that Murakami is immune to this power is a medium for conversation between two people who normally wouldn’t get along much.Would I say this movie is good? I would say so yes, I find the message to be fantastic and how they delivered it through the personalities and interactions of the characters really good. I wouldn’t say this is necessarily supposed to entertain you though, or at least I wouldn’t recommend it on that basis. The only thing I did throw skepticism for when it came to what I think the movie was supposed to do was some doubts about the characters touch with realism, but then after a while I realized that Murakami was sociopathic or alexithymic which means she is unaware of what her internal emotional state is. That made perfect sense to me, because her own slate for memorizing what people like that she wrote down was completely empty other than the fact that she wanted to please others. When Moritani confronts her, she goes nuclear by exposing their secrets to tear down the façade, her mask to hide her real self. Now she can’t be liked by everyone and so she loses her incentive to lie when confronted with her fear of having to be a person with feelings that she needs to care of.After writing this review, I realize that this movie is actually better than I thought. I was originally not sure what to give it, but it’s a 9 for this one. This movie is going to be somewhat of an inconsistency in my rating system because it doesn’t really have a story or tries too hard to make you attached to the characters or even necessarily make it an enjoyable movie, but damn the messaging and character interaction and development is just in focus in this movie to the extent that the theme necessarily has to not make it an exciting storyline or plot and almost necessarily doesn’t have us get attached to the characters. It’s simply that unique in my opinion and people who say this movie is bad is just wrong. Please show me how I’m wrong. and I felt in the mood to write this review as well, I feel like going to war against these peoples opinions and tell you why you should watch this movie and how it has value since no one here seems to talk about it, even the most popular positive review didn’t.

Watch this movie with the messaging in mind and how the character interactions and character developement shows this.)Now you could argue that they didn’t need to have been that sexualized, however in a way I find some value in that considering the topic at hand here. This anime is about the people pleasers in our society and how it fucks us up and hopefully makes other people pleasers realize that they might be doing something they don’t want to. I wouldn’t say Im great at analyzing movies or media, not really, but jesus christ why are no one talking about the psychology going on? That’s like the whole point of the movie. If you don’t understand the significance in how the main characters in this movie develops, then you totally missed the point. When they learn the problems with their personalities, that's them actually realizing that their own personalities are based on lying and how bad that is for them. Now that’s the only thing important in this movie in my opinion and it is such a good message to send out when lots of people are in this situation and they might not even know they’re there and just needs a wakeup call. When you critique how these characters doesn’t have interesting personalities and that they’re passive, then that’s exactly the point. So when they with their lame personalities go about life being objectified, being taken advantage of, then I believe that you shouldn’t necessarily say that the sexualization serve no purpose at all when it shows how their lives seemed material with no meaning from the start. The first interaction between Moritani and Murakami was Moritani looking up her skirt, so we already know by virtue of our knowledge of Murakami as a people pleaser that Murakami is going to give Moritani what she wants to please her. So no I don’t find the sexualization to be irrelevant at all. In this movie I would much rather ague that it serves an important function for the message the anime is trying to portray.I know how hard it is to deal with the double edged sword which is being a people pleaser, it includes constantly thinking about what not to say and do to upset someone you don’t want to be upset. It makes you wind up a silent and passive type, unless you’re more of a sociopathic person like Murakimi in this anime who can read people pretty well. People pleasing is like lying. When you lie you try to control the outcomes of a given social conversation, in essence, you’re manipulating someone, and people pleasing is lying to others about yourself. When you agree with someone that a movie was great, but you’re actually lying, you might not even notice what you actually think of the movie, much like Murakami who doesn’t know what she wants at all. The only thing people know is that you try to be liked and desperately don’t want people to dislike you, which is unhealthy for any relationship. A lot of people go about life in this manner not even realizing it and not really having a choice when doing this, they just happened to find more comfort when people like them and avoid the discomfort when they don’t.The main character in the anime Moritani doesn’t participate in the social life of others as much as she can. She does this because she finds herself not comfortable in social conversations and because of this she doesn’t get what she needs to get more comfortable, which is talking to people, yet, despite others striking up conversation with her, she doesn't reciprocate. So when she got the power of pausing time, she abused it to get out of them. The fact that Murakami is immune to this power is a medium for conversation between two people who normally wouldn’t get along much.Would I say this movie is good? I would say so yes, I find the message to be fantastic and how they delivered it through the personalities and interactions of the characters really good. I wouldn’t say this is necessarily supposed to entertain you though, or at least I wouldn’t recommend it on that basis. The only thing I did throw skepticism for when it came to what I think the movie was supposed to do was some doubts about the characters touch with realism, but then after a while I realized that Murakami was sociopathic or alexithymic which means she is unaware of what her internal emotional state is. That made perfect sense to me, because her own slate for memorizing what people like that she wrote down was completely empty other than the fact that she wanted to please others. When Moritani confronts her, she goes nuclear by exposing their secrets to tear down the façade, her mask to hide her real self. Now she can’t be liked by everyone and so she loses her incentive to lie when confronted with her fear of having to be a person with feelings that she needs to care of.After writing this review, I realize that this movie is actually better than I thought. I was originally not sure what to give it, but it’s a 9 for this one. This movie is going to be somewhat of an inconsistency in my rating system because it doesn’t really have a story or tries too hard to make you attached to the characters or even necessarily make it an enjoyable movie, but damn the messaging and character interaction and development is just in focus in this movie to the extent that the theme necessarily has to not make it an exciting storyline or plot and almost necessarily doesn’t have us get attached to the characters. It’s simply that unique in my opinion and people who say this movie is bad is just wrong. Please show me how I’m wrong."", 'I don\'t understand the low score in this movie... oh well.""Fragtime"" is a cozy little package of emotions. The romance is tender and nuanced. It\'s not your typical high school love story; it\'s more mature and explores the complexities of love in a way that\'s both refreshing and relatable. The lesbian love angle is handled with grace and sensitivity, which is a big win. It\'s not fetishized or overly dramatized; it\'s just two people discovering love and affection for each other.The movie has some erotic moments, but they\'re tastefully done. They serve to intensify the romantic tension rather than being gratuitous, which I think...is a good approach.Both characters go through a journey of self-discovery, which is beautifully portrayed. The time-stopping ability serves as a metaphor for those frozen moments in life where we find out something new about ourselves.The movie delves deep into the characters\' thoughts and fears. It\'s not just about the external events but also about the internal struggles, making it a rich narrative. The bravery displayed by the characters, especially in confronting their fears and insecurities, is commendable. It adds a layer of depth to what could have been a simple love story.Now, here\'s my gripe: the movie is too short! I think this story could make a good anime series.Overall, ""Fragtime"" is a well-crafted piece that touches on love, identity, and the courage it takes to be true to oneself. It\'s a must-watch if you\'re into romance and character-driven stories. But yeah, it could have been a bit longer to flesh out some more details. is a good approach.Both characters go through a journey of self-discovery, which is beautifully portrayed.

Misuzu looks up Haruka, the popular girl’s underwear, and never receives any consequences for this. In fact, she actually gets to spend more time with Haruka. The pair usually just talk or hang out when Misuzu freezes time. However, the more the movie progresses, the more it focuses on underwear. The pair go from undressing in the middle of the classroom to buying matching underwear. Fragtime is definitely very fetishy and has flat characters. The only character development happens in the last 5 minutes, and even then it’s...not very realistic. When I try to think of one good thing about the movie, I can’t. The character development is basically nonexistent, the conflicts are so dramatic and unrealistic, and the plot is just underwear. I mean, I guess the art was pretty.recommends to: people who fetishize lesbian relationships, perverts not very realistic. When I try to think of one good thing about the movie, I can’t.

It was a lot deeper than I thought it would be covering the topics it does of solitude and facing yourself without hiding behind a mask. It's really interesting though. Normally these types of thought-provoking anime just go over my head but I could understand this one.Now, Im really glad this anime didn't get dark or super dramary since most things involving time magic/powers generally go in a bad direction.The beginning of the movie was a bit quick and events seem to all happen in a short period but overall it was good. If this movie had a little...bit more time to more naturally start the movie I think it would be great, but that might just be me. The girls were pretty cute and it was nice seeing them mess around while time is stopped.I really liked the theme of not relying on a supernatural power and actually facing people and being true to yourself. The main girl has a bad habit of avoiding people so she uses her time powers and the other girl has a bad habit of not facing herself and being what others want her to be. It's really nice to follow these two as they find out more about each other and about themselves. As said previously normally animes with a theme either don't interest me or just go right over my head like 5 Centimeters Per Second but this one I fully understood (Or at least I like to think I did) the message of the anime and what the girls were trying to overcome. It was really nice to see how these two had changed over the course of just an hour. They're interesting characters I've got to give them that. They're not like most yuri girls I've seen in other shows who are two dimensional. They're fairly more complex with personal issues they need to overcome which is nice to see how they tackle it.I'm quite surprised considering most yuri anime are just wholesome comedy anime that don't really try too hard but recently we yuri fans have been getting so many good anime like Bloom into You and this. I'm glad to see yuri anime are actually trying to be more than just average shows and are rising above that. Its probably just me since I've watched every yuri anime that exists lol but it's nice to see a show like this. To be honest this reminds me a lot of Kuttsukiboshi which was also about two girls and one of them having supernatural powers.The song at the end was really nice. Just thought I'd say that.Overall it's a great anime that I recommend to yuri fans if you're a bit bored of the average yuri shows we normally get and want something a bit more thought-provoking and interesting. bit more time to more naturally start the movie I think it would be great, but that might just be me.

Moritani at the beginning was able to stop time for 3 minutes, but over time she could stop it for less until she couldn\'t stop it at all. This anime heavily focused on personal problems between both the main characters. Haruka changed herself to be the ideal girl, and always heavily focused on what other\'s wanted, and not what she wanted. Well, she didn\'t *Say* what she wanted, she never felt like she needed to admit her desires, she felt like everyone\'s personal desires were more important. And Moritani tried...to get her true feelings out of her, going as far calling her selfish (Which in a way she was) and in the end she was able to finally make Haruka tell her what she wanted, how she felt, and how she actually wanted to be. Moritani was similar to Haruka in many ways, never truly told people how she felt, and always put others before herself. (Not on the same level as Haruka but still.) I feel like the movie had a really good message, but I feel like in 1 aspect the story had flaws. And that was in the Yuri, the movie had many Yuri moments but I never truly felt it was a Yuri, even though that was supposed to be a big aspect of the movie, I still liked the plot a lot nonetheless though.Art/Animation 6/10 - It would be considered good in 2010 - 2014/2015 standards, but considering it came out in 2019 it was below many other movies in terms of art and animation.Sound 6/10 - Same as any other anime. The voices were really fitting for both the main characters and other side characters though!Characters/Personalities 8/10 - I practically explained both there personalities in the  ""Story/Plot"" part. Anyways, there personalities were so realistic and relatable for me. I often put other peoples feelings and needs before myself, and sometimes even act like I like a person even if I really don\'t. And I also sometimes don\'t even realize what I want to be, what I want to do, who I want to talk to, or how I want to act sometimes. So, I can relate to both of them in that aspect.Enjoyment/Overall 7/10 - It was a good movie with a good message. I came for Yuri for the most part though and it let me down in that aspect.

It has a very distinct idea of both what life and anime is like, and goes in extremely hard in that deeply unique concept, for better or worse.But you're reading the review, so the question is: should you watch this? Is this good?I won't say it's bad. But it's certainly nothing memorable. The key issue here is that the entire premise of this story, while fine on its own, does not roll itself into something complete by the end. Because it's extremely insistent in its exploration of...ideas (peeping toms, obsessive lovers, inability to socialize normally, and general neurodivergency), you have to really resonate with one or more of those ideas to begin to resonate with the film. And if you resonate with none of these concepts, or only one of them, then you might not like this film.This is all on top of the fact that the film is only 60 minutes long. With such a short runtime, it really has to execute in some fashion to maintain itself. And I think it does a solid job in that regard; the animation and general story is fine as it is. But it comes back to that lack of memory; this film doesn't do anything special, it doesn't stand out. It's just an emotional romp. And if that's all you want, then good for you. But if you're expecting something more than just a jaunt of upskirting, minimal yuri relationships, and weird sci-fi, you're digging too deep on this one. ideas (peeping toms, obsessive lovers, inability to socialize normally, and general neurodivergency), you have to really resonate with one or more of those ideas to begin to resonate with the film.

I actually know nothing about them. They have five listed anime and this will be the first one I\'ve seen.Story:Moritani Misuzu is an extremely introverted girl who manages to avoid social situations using a simple trick. She can stop time for three minutes at a time. Which would be just long enough to have sex with Daniel Sexbang if she was straight. Things take a turn one day when she discovers that her classmate, Murakami Haruka, is also capable of moving when...she freezes time. In Murakami\'s mind, there can only be one explanation. It\'s because Moritani wants them to have time for just the two of them.The biggest issue with the narrative is that the romance is a bit rushed. One moment, Moritani is taking a peek up Murakami\'s skirt, the next they\'re making out while time is frozen. I know that they\'re horny teenagers, but it still comes across as moving a bit oo quickly.That being said, the idea of a romance centred around two girls who use sci-fi style powers to gain time for just the two of them is interesting. I also kind of like the way the film sets things up so that their relationship may kick off very quickly, but it\'s clearly based around a mutual need. Which works quite well for a romance work. The way they assist each other in getting past their major hang ups is well done and pretty heart-warming.Characters:A lot of what defines both Moritani and Murakami are the very reasons they need each other. Morirtani\'s extreme social anxiety. Murakami\'s tendency to put others over herself. They\'re presented as equal problems that are kind of in opposition to each other which also makes them very capable of helping one another.If I can give any criticism it\'s that a lot of the side characters are just kind of bland. Like, the girl with glasses that ends up taking a friend role to Moritani. She\'s just kind of the typical friend character and I honestly can\'t even recall her name. I know the main draw in a romance work is the leads, but it would be helpful to have some strong supporting characters.Art:The artwork is pretty well done. It looks well detailed and the character designs do look good. There is kind of a weird, somewhat out of place scene around the middle of the film that involves a lot of surreal time imagery that comes out of nowhere and doesn\'t seem to serve much purpose beyond looking kind of cool.Sound:Itou Miku and Miyamoto Yume both give pretty strong performances with a lot of chemistry between them.

It\'s all well and good to focus on the heroines in a romantic work, but having strong supporting characters helps make them more complex through their interactions with those characters.2.

I rated Fragtime this way is because they really left out a lot of good parts in the manga like. There was a scene where Moritani was erasing the bad things people said to Murakami and Murakami just looked at Moritani but, in the manga Murakami leaned her head on Moritani\'s back and even say ""arigato"" or thank you.

Dont listen to the critics. They are here to critique the anime based on their own biases. Which is not constructive by any means and i dont think reviews should truly be allowed aside from the numbers. Although then there would be considerable trolls. You already know how many animes you have seen that have been underrated. Give this a go, dont think its yuri or romance etc. Its just a storytelling anime... I will simply post my comment on the site thread itself for you to get the feeling of what this will be. If this is your cup...of tea definitely watch it, if you completely despise yuri like i do yaoi then thats understandable. I always say if you go into an anime with bias or expectations you will ALWAYS be let down. Its just anime, theres tons of it. Why not enjoy it all instead of being unsightly? There is only one thing i hated about this and you will see that in my comment.iits sad because no matter the anime, even how farfetched it might be like citrus, its all realistic. even the most fantasy ridden animes have morals and stories that have at some point in time been portrayed by real life circumstances even if only similarly by the boundaries of humanity. but for the characters emotions in this. i LOVE the plain and simple because it allowed us to put our focus on this relationship and the characters around them. it didnt make the few mcs pop out with different coloured hair and makeup and drown out the rest in sepia or black and white etc. it brought realism and that amplified the feelings tremendously.

And there is a girl out there just like mc thats waiting to express herself but doesnt know how, and cant even really understand her own feelings. Though the thing this got wrong is the continuation.

And I could not FEEL her emotions when she said SHE wanted to enter mcs time. SHE loved her before mc loved Haruka. They didnt give it the time and build it.

Think of the possibilities!Story & Characters: Fragtime is a one-hour long movie where Moritani, a high schooler, can stop time for three minutes in a given day.  The concept of where you insert supernatural powers into an otherwise normal setting isn\'t super uncommon - think Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai or Erased.  Moritani uses her powers to stop time when she feels extremely uncomfortable, usually when someone\'s trying to have a conversation with her, and she doesn\'t know how to reciprocate.  She clearly gets anxious around...people and even more so when they\'re very forward with their conversations, so she seems to use her powers pretty often.  One day, she uses these powers to stop time while a classmate is talking her up and she walks outside where she sees the super-popular Murakami.  Well aware of her popularity, Moritani, for whatever reason, decides to look under her skirt.  However, there\'s a catch: Murakami isn\'t affected by the time freeze and instead, catches Moritani in the act.  We see during the course of the movie how she attempts to get closer to Murakami and eventually, to the point where they decide to secretly date.The introduction is about as weird as you can guess.  It sounds strange and it is.  However, I make a habit of not judging a series based on the introduction because I\'ve seen a lot of bad intros with good endings and vice-versa.  Once you get past this strange interaction with our two characters, the rest of the movie isn\'t half bad.  A lot of it is spent with our two girls trying to figure out how Moritani can get over her social anxieties, while also showing really sweet moments between them.  Those three minutes of absolute solitude between our two girls shows a promise they made to each other not long into the movie and I found that display to be a nice plot point.Moritani isn\'t confident in herself, but much of the movie is spent trying to prop that up.  There\'s one scene in Murakami\'s bedroom that really does push that character development along and it\'s a neat, and very different, way to show it.  She knows she\'s shy and withdrawn, but growing as a person, especially in high school, is a hard thing to do with so many eyes on you.  Murakami is a bit of a walking anime trope, in that she\'s this smart, well respected person who puts herself out there, not really caring what people think.  When she starts to date Moritani, she often relates to her and if she can help her as a person, she does.  These two characters are strong - and I honestly think people like more drawn out characters, even in a movie that only runs for sixty minutes.The way most scenes play out are pretty straight forward so there\'s nothing really surprising that happens.  They do try and mix in some minor humour here and there, though many times, I wouldn\'t say it delivers on that front.  I did find the ending scene in the mall to be funny though because it kind of shows some karma on someone that Moritani recognizes to be cheating on a significant other.  While this movie\'s story doesn\'t get crazy at all, they never seem to do anything terribly wrong, outside of maybe the introduction.  And say what you will about the weirdness of Moritani buying something to match Murakami, but it still meant something to them - and that\'s worth something.

That being said, if you\'re someone who doesn\'t really look for these things, then I would likely say this movie isn\'t for you.

Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2387/Ai_Monogatari__9_Love_Stories,"['People often remember their first love with a bitter-sweet feeling and this theme is mostly prevalent in 9 short tales from Kawaguchi Kaiji, adapted into short animations by 9 different directors.The stories vary from touching and nostalgic, to cheeky and fun and some even develop into a rather bitter ending.What they all have in common is the focus on male-female relationship in various interesting ways. You may be surprised to learn, that despite being short, these 10 minute animations tell just as much as a full featured movie, if not even more.Some of them aren\'t fully developed, so I can\'t give the movie a 10...as a whole, but most of them are quite positive, imaginative and well-crafted. We\'ll get into details of each animation in a moment.Sadly, I can\'t tell you anything about the general directors, art directors, the circumstances or the era the movie was created in, because there simply isn\'t any information available about it.It\'s a shame, really, because besides Kawaguchi\'s charismatic storytelling, the animation is most of the time also quite intriguing and it would be interesting to know about the work process that was behind it.I was especially taken aback upon seeing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and ""Let\'s Spend the Night Together"". These two have so few colors, to the point of being monochromatic, and yet they are immensely expressive due to clever animation and fitting soundtrack.Also, several times an interesting effect appears, when the animation switches to a sequence of photographs, overlapped with cells.In short, about the 9 stories.1. ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" is named after a Beatles song, which plays in the background through most of the animation and also plays an important part in the story.A boy wants to win the heart of a tough chick(she loves the Beatles), but is too afraid to even hold her hand and confess his feelings. It\'s an excellent story and together with music it brings a nice sentimental feeling.2. ""Hero"" is all about a couple, once being a part of a high school rugby team, but never confessing to each other. Some nicely animated games in this one.3. ""Let\'s Spend the Night Together"" is absolutely fantastic, even for the lack of colors. The story is incredibly fun, shady and cheeky, as we\'re following an office guy who gets himself in bed with the girl of a local gangster boss.The visual expressiveness is excellent. Is it even possible to better express the thoughts of a man, who, after a hot night, is asked by his female partner: ""Do you love me?"" To which he answers with a quick ""Yes"", while at the same time the camera shows how he closes the zipper on his pants. Brilliant, I tell you.4. ""Stop the Time"" is a bit unfinished(10 minutes is just not enough in this case) and I didn\'t fully understand the ending. A man returns to his hometown after a long time, just to find his long lost love, who now has amnesia and can\'t remember a thing.5. ""Betrayal in the City"" is another cheeky and clever tale about a man who devises a cunning plan on how to dump his girlfriend. The inner monologue creates a funny atmosphere, even though the theme of breaking up is serious.6. ""I Can\'t Stop Loving You"" is possibly the most average animation in the set, since the story is a bit loose. It tells about a man who has second thoughts before his wedding.7. ""Those Were the Days"" is a tad better, but it\'s also quite unpolished. A mafia boss wants to conquer a really brave woman, who wants none of it. The rough limit of 10 minutes also shows here, since there isn\'t enough time for deeper story and character development.8. ""Lion and Pelican"" tells an interesting story about sacrifice and goodness of a woman, who is determined to support a famous sports star all trough to the end of his career.9. ""White Christmas"" is the last tale and one of my favorite in this movie. It\'s entangled with a warm Christmas spirit, therefore I intend to watch it every year on this joyful holiday xD. What could be prettier than a combination of the famous tune ""White Christmas"", snowy evening and love (despite all differences).If you are interested in mature romantic stories and unique animation, you\'ll love Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories. It\'s not a perfect movie, but it contains some fabulous short animations. as a whole, but most of them are quite positive, imaginative and well-crafted. We\'ll get into details of each animation in a moment.Sadly, I can\'t tell you anything about the general directors, art directors, the circumstances or the era the movie was created in, because there simply isn\'t any information available about it.It\'s a shame, really, because besides Kawaguchi\'s charismatic storytelling, the animation is most of the time also quite intriguing and it would be interesting to know about the work process that was behind it.I was especially taken aback upon seeing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and ""Let\'s Spend the Night Together"". These two have so few colors, to the point of being monochromatic, and yet they are immensely expressive due to clever animation and fitting soundtrack.Also, several times an interesting effect appears, when the animation switches to a sequence of photographs, overlapped with cells.In short, about the 9 stories.1. ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" is named after a Beatles song, which plays in the background through most of the animation and also plays an important part in the story.A boy wants to win the heart of a tough chick(she loves the Beatles), but is too afraid to even hold her hand and confess his feelings. It\'s an excellent story and together with music it brings a nice sentimental feeling.2. ""Hero"" is all about a couple, once being a part of a high school rugby team, but never confessing to each other. Some nicely animated games in this one.3. ""Let\'s Spend the Night Together"" is absolutely fantastic, even for the lack of colors. The story is incredibly fun, shady and cheeky, as we\'re following an office guy who gets himself in bed with the girl of a local gangster boss.The visual expressiveness is excellent. Is it even possible to better express the thoughts of a man, who, after a hot night, is asked by his female partner: ""Do you love me?"" To which he answers with a quick ""Yes"", while at the same time the camera shows how he closes the zipper on his pants. Brilliant, I tell you.4. ""Stop the Time"" is a bit unfinished(10 minutes is just not enough in this case) and I didn\'t fully understand the ending. A man returns to his hometown after a long time, just to find his long lost love, who now has amnesia and can\'t remember a thing.5. ""Betrayal in the City"" is another cheeky and clever tale about a man who devises a cunning plan on how to dump his girlfriend. The inner monologue creates a funny atmosphere, even though the theme of breaking up is serious.6. ""I Can\'t Stop Loving You"" is possibly the most average animation in the set, since the story is a bit loose. It tells about a man who has second thoughts before his wedding.7. ""Those Were the Days"" is a tad better, but it\'s also quite unpolished. A mafia boss wants to conquer a really brave woman, who wants none of it. The rough limit of 10 minutes also shows here, since there isn\'t enough time for deeper story and character development.8. ""Lion and Pelican"" tells an interesting story about sacrifice and goodness of a woman, who is determined to support a famous sports star all trough to the end of his career.9. ""White Christmas"" is the last tale and one of my favorite in this movie. It\'s entangled with a warm Christmas spirit, therefore I intend to watch it every year on this joyful holiday xD.

It’s a bit like a style market; brief formats on which directors and animators get to enjoy themselves and go straight to the point. As for Ai Monogatari there are 9 shorts, each adapting a small love story (comedic and/or dramatic depending on the story) created by mangaka Kaiji Kawaguchi.If I were to order those shorts, I would immediately put 2 of them on top :-\t« Stop the Time » by Hiroshi Hamasaki (who also directed Texhnolyze among other things). It was one of those moments, a few seconds in and I already knew...it was gonna be exceptional. From the hallucinated editing to the use of colours. A story about amnesia (or madness?) that gravitates around a small red ear jewel and a crescent mark. As soon as She speaks, her contact is made dizzying by a brief insert shot. As for Him, he stays haggard in his boat as Her hair floats in the wind, terrifying as black snakes.-\t« Those Were the Days » by Takashi Anno (director of Yokohama Kaidashi Kiko’s first OVA), with its characteristic fade outs, fugitive cutaway inserts that imprints on the retina the nostalgic image of a past that has yet to come in the story, the plot presented as a puzzle, plays on lights and the inexplicable, peaceful beauty of this blood pouring in soft geysers. And cherry on cake: a post-mortem moment just like an ending, where Anno creates a sort of experimental clip while Mary Hopkin softly sings the eponymous jazz song. Images flash and twinkle – a trick he will use 5 years later on the YKK OVA. I admit I shivered.I would also highlight « White Christmas » (by Iku Suzuki), full of a tension that produces a lot of staging ideas, and this conclusion where everything suddenly calms down to the dragging rhythm of the slowest of all Christmas carols.« Hero » is great as well, thanks to the great Koji Morimoto who animates some great rugby scenes.« Lion and Pelican » (Koji Sawai) is certainly the most « animated » of all those films, maybe to a fault at times. Characters seem to be constantly on the verge of melting. Anyways, a memorable stylistic venture.« I Wanna Hold Your Hand » is a simple yet pretty love story with a missed timing and a soundtrack by you-know-who. Great beach scene, with hands that never meet. As for « Betrayal in the City », it goes on a way more tongue-in-cheek fashion, using mostly split-screens to show a guy’s internal monologues as he hatches a plan to break up with his gal. Both are directed by Tomomi Mochizuki.« Let’s Spend the Night Together » (Mamoru Hamatsu) is fun and notably offers lots of great car animation as the bulk of the story happens as a yakuza pursuits a young couple across town. Characters are particularly expressive as well. You can tell that they didn’t have the rights for the original song of the Rolling Stones though…« I Can’t Stop Loving You » (Hidetoshi Omori) is the only one I definitely won’t remember.

Barely, but they did. This season does feature a mild mystery but, like AiParade before it, fails to actually make it matter or be at all interesting.The new Aikatsu system is initially intriguing and fun, but is so underused it's easy to forget that anything has actually changed. Honestly, it feels like a half-hearted rip of early Pripara at times.Overall, it feels like a cut-and-paste idol with none of the charm the animated series had, most of which was due...to the....CHARACTER: 2/10The acting makes the poor girls look either shocked or horrified rather than happy sometimes. I hope they're doing okay?!In all honesty, the characters just aren't that interesting or unique. As  much as Raki's catchphrase annoyed me, she was at least sassy sometimes. As much as Ichigo's naivety could frustrate me, she was always up for a challenge. The girls of Planet, on the other hand, have everything simply handed over to them. There's no struggle, no growth, no personality to make me care about them.ART: 6Sigh. I can't deny that Aikatsu' CGI has improved over the years, but at what cost? All the texture and sparkle and prints are gone, replaced by basic flat colours and vague checkers. Where are my giant flower decals and lace tiers? I loved seeing the gorgeous designs far more than I cared about the occasionally wonky-armed dancing scenes.Their characters in animation have zero relevance to their IRL counterparts. It's a bizzare and jerking choice, and I often forget who is supposed to be who, which is a terrible problem given how often it switches between the two.SOUND: 5And here we have the worst downgrade of all this season's issues. Past Aikatsu had a bunch of bops, ballads, and rock. This series has generic pop songs and, if heard out of context, I doubt I could guess where they came from. Previous Aikatsu seasons never had this issue, nor should any idol. when the music is as much the selling point as anything else.OVERALL:  A DisappointmentEven on the completion of this series, the sad fact is, it never improved.

As someone who's spent six years of their life deeply embedded in idol culture, this show was a breath of fresh air. Both live action and animated segments blend beautifully. It always makes narrative sense when the girls are in the Aikatsu world, so the transition isn't jarring. I'm always a sucker for the cheesy idol friendship moments and this show has those in spades, but they never come off as cringey. 25 episodes is the perfect length of time to connect with the characters. No...main character is left unexplored. The show also addresses a lot of modern issues with the vtuber community. There are benefits and drawbacks to anonymity. I appreciate the show's willingness to be honest about how a double life can impact someone, especially a child, even if it does simplify the issue for it's child audience. The music is the most important part of a show like this, though, and they NAILED IT. This is the first time I've downloaded an idol soundtrack while the show was still airing. If you're an idol fan, please consider watching. The live action segments may confuse you at first, but this show is completely worth your time. main character is left unexplored.

The way it works is that the idols in this world can enter a virtual world where they perform their 'Aikatsu' (a combination word made from both Idol and activities). It may seem unappealing but I found it to be interesting as being able to put a face to the singer and because of the difference between the worlds it makes it easy to understand the double life that Mao (main MC) deals with.From a 'no knowledge' about Aikatsu perspective, I would say to...check out the first episode to get the gist of it's for you. You do not have to see the past Aikatsu series to understand this one. The main demographic is for children so it's easy to understand, is bright and colourful, and has good music.From an Aikatsu fan I think that even though they changed a lot about the system, it still has the Aikatsu vibe from it. Mao is a natural idol with her dance background and great personality. What makes this a bit more interesting (minus the new hybrid mode) is that there is the overarching plot/ mystery of Hana's past owner and her trying to live up to that expectation.

The story is very hard to follow with the live-action and anime being one of its main selling points, especially on the acting; no harm to the actresses I\'m sure they\'re lovely people but banco has a thing for hiring rookies and these girls just, simply could not act if their life depended on it, even in the anime portions of the episodes the girls sound so monotoned. Another issue I had...with this season was the shift from collecting cards to collecting monsters; one of Aikatsu\'s key points was cards, what was the reason for even changing that if no one had an issue with it? The only good point Aikatsu Planet had was the character design, but that\'s, honestly it. If you really want something that\'s more reminiscent of Aikatsu\'s older works then I recommend ""Waccha PriMagi!"", especially if you\'re an old Aikatsu fan like me. with this season was the shift from collecting cards to collecting monsters; one of Aikatsu\'s key points was cards, what was the reason for even changing that if no one had an issue with it?

The humor isn't as good as the original, it's really dull and boring.One thing I'd like to mention is that there is character growth throughout the story. One of them is Shu, as he starts to become the leader and try to get the team, you get to see him grow, where in the original he's a loud annoying kid who starts to fight whenever he wants, but here you see him start to think and care for others and learning how to become a good leader.Overall, I give it a 4/10.

A new threat arrives, dark plot twist (which in this case, the main character goes missing/is taken into a void). The pacing is painfully slow, and I\'m waiting fortnight upon fortnight to see the next big episode only for the characters to repeat the same dialogue, followed by a montage of (an attempt at) suspenseful scenes. There isn\'t much other context provided but I feel like the series is headed in the same route as the original Vanguard, just without the protagonist.Cardfight Vanguard in general retains the regular Shonen style with wacky hairstyles and...colors. The characters have more tall, straight figures. A majority of them. I found this slightly appealing to be fair. But for the most part, it is rather generic and overused.The sound isn\'t that top-notch, being done by a low-profit studio. They reuse effects from other series to say the least and I feel like some SFX don\'t really match the performed actions by characters and Vanguard alike.One damning aspect of Vanguard is its\' inability to express perplexing characters. It fails to develop them, and they\'re kept the same, damn person for the many seasons of Vanguard there are. It\'s always settled through a Cardfight. The most development I\'ve seen in the characters was in GIRS crisis and Stride Gate. This time around... not so much. Let\'s hope that with Aichi returning, we\'ll see something... unique...While the series hasn\'t even begun, I can easily perceive the many ways this anime is about to go with the opening episodes.

Choujikuu Kidan Southern Cross,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4503/Choujikuu_Kidan_Southern_Cross,"['Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross may seem like your average mecha anime from the 1980s, but in reality it\'s one of the most unique members of the genre.  Unlike the popular Gundam series, or even the other mecha titles by Tatsunoko Productions, Southern Cross is written from the point of a female protagonist.  Jeanne is brave, strong, capable, and most importantly, thoroughly entertaining.Another thing that sets Southern Cross apart is its message.  The Glorians, who colonized the planet, are so quick to assume that the Zor are hostile invaders that they launch into a war without taking the time to learn about...the mysterious race.  It is eventually discovered that the Zor are the original inhabitants of what is now Glorie, and more shocking still, the Glorians and the Zor are thought to share a common (human) ancestry.  Southern Cross takes a stance against preemptive violence and knee-jerk reactions, and the positive, anti-war message that this serious embodies is admirable.Aside from the ideologies of war, the relationships of this series are the real shining stars.  The shaky love between Jeanne and Seifreit is one of my favorites (and has been since childhood); they develop real feelings for each other through battle, trials, and hardship.  Bowie and Musica are another great love story because of what their relationship represents:  Even though their races are at war, they still fall in love because they can look past trivial, close-minded judgments.  Rivalries and family relationships are also important in Southern Cross.  It\'s certainly a series driven by the characters and their growth.The animation falls short in a few episodes but because the story and characters are so great, I barely notice anymore.  The soundtrack becomes a little repetitive by the time you\'re at the end of the series because it\'s not too terribly diverse, but what is there is notably entertaining. The opening theme, ""Hoshi no Deja Vu"" by Katori Yoko, is one of the greatest opening themes of all time - no, seriously, it is. :DThe English adaptation of SDC Southern Cross is the second saga of the Robotech series: the Robotech Masters.

I started with this one as I figured I would do all of macross at one point, and it's the closest to the original.   But this was was close, but definetly different, familuar plots and ideas, but then there was things different.Story:  Humans have colonized a planet when aliens show up and a intergalactic war starts up for the fate of the planet.   I enjoyed the plot, had a decent job of dealing with war, and questions about it,...how much of the war could have been stopped if hotheads had cooled down.Art:  It's classic 80's stuff, it works for the most part, though I did notice some reused animations, and weird animations glitches, like a gun that seems to only appear in the last frame of a transformation and such.    But I still liked it.Characters:   A fair amount of them, coming from robotech it was a bit funny seeing some chars that were differently named, like the aliens called zor, not the one of the chars that was a clone of the guy that created the SDF1 and such like he was in the original.enjoyment and overall:   I enjoyed this, this has been a goal and I'm pleasantly surprised with it and glad I got to watch it.   It isn't perfect, and has it's issues, but coming from a huge robotech fan I'm glad to finally get to see it. how much of the war could have been stopped if hotheads had cooled down.Art:  It's classic 80's stuff, it works for the most part, though I did notice some reused animations, and weird animations glitches, like a gun that seems to only appear in the last frame of a transformation and such.

It used many of the tropes of post Gundam mecha shows, but with no real idea what to say with them. As a result there were moments of great fun, but never soared to the heights of its more famous siblings.Personally, I think the show would have done better letting the silliness factor take charge more often than the action drama. My favorite episodes were definitely those which highlighted the soap opera aspects of the show and minimized the space opera. The lives and loves of the Southern Cross moments were a...ton of fun. The triple form of the Zor and the political in fights between bald bad human and dad general paled in comparison to watching Jeanne get ""in your face"" about winning a decisive battle for the sole purpose of buying a dress.The character designs were good, but the mecha designs seemed kind of chunky and didn\'t quite work. I liked the Zor ship interiors and some of the other background stuff was cool too. Overall the design was a mixed bag in my eyes.I started out loving the music but there came a point when it\'s constant recycling offered diminishing returns. I think you could fit all the background music used in the entire show into 20-30 minutes of content.Overall, I\'m an old school anime fan and don\'t regret buying the DVD and spending the time watching it. However, unless you\'re like me and love 80s anime, there\'s probably not enough here to recommend the show, ton of fun.

However, the two became artificially entwined after they were stitched together to form the first two parts of ""Robotech"", the Americanised anime TV series. ""Macross"" became the first arc, ""Robotech: The Macross Saga""; ""Southern Cross"" was adapted into the sequel arc, ""Robotech: The Masters"", and got the short end of the deal. While ""Super Dimensional Fortress Macross"" stayed mostly intact through its transition, ""Southern Cross"" underwent such drastic editing that...I was shocked to see how much it had changed.In retrospect, perhaps I shouldn\'t have been so surprised - it was forcibly joined onto the end of ""Macross"", so its story had to be heavily edited in order to fit in with the overarching story. Unsurprisingly, the result is a mess; despite the major changes, a lot of the story in ""Robotech: The Masters"" is still inconsistent with ""Robotech: The Macross Saga"". Of course, being the original series, ""Southern Cross"" doesn\'t have this problem, so watching it is quite a different experience - a better one, but that\'s not saying much. I will say though, that I was a little disappointed to find that the protagonist in the original story isn\'t actually the offspring of a certain couple from ""Macross"".""Southern Cross"" is focused on a military squadron that operates on Gloire (a planet colonised by Earth) as it comes under attack by the alien race Zor. (Note: In the ""Robotech"" version, the Zor are the Robotech Masters, the force behind the Zentradi from the previous arc). The said squadron is led by Jeanne Francaix, who, in addition to having an extremely French name (the makers even went as far as giving her a name that closely resembles the French word for ""French"" itself), also possesses an extremely annoying personality. Unfortunately for the viewers, she\'s also the main character, meaning she gets a lot of screen time in which to be annoying. I find it absurd that the army showed such tolerance for her lack of discipline. Her behaviours were probably meant to be taken as comedic, but it\'s terribly unfunny. ""Southern Cross"" had occasional moments that did make me laugh (for example a funny scene at the cinema), but the key word there is ""occasional"".The story of ""Southern Cross"" is a mixed bag. On one hand it contains some interesting developments and ideas, such as an alien race made up of triplets, and the human versus aliens issue not being as black and white (a point that was lost when the show became ""Robotech: The Masters) as it normally is. On the other hand, it\'s riddled with flaws too. The whole alien-human love subplot from ""Macross"" is found here also - perhaps they were trying to establish some common themes across the ""Super Dimensional"" franchise, but it just came off as a cheap rehash of ideas. The show also suffers from incompleteness and plot holes. Plot points like the connection between the Zor and the flowers were never really explained, and the ease with which Jeanne\'s squadron was able to hold off masses of enemy forces seems ludicrous. The ending is very abrupt and leaves things hanging. The show was apparently axed due to bad ratings, which would explain a lot. It\'s only got itself to blame though - it just isn\'t good enough to deserve better ratings.One thing that did impress me is the music; the OP/ED is especially catchy, but the sound department is let down by the voice acting, in particular Jeane\'s annoying voice. In fact, the ""Robotech"" version of this character is even more annoying, owing to the character\'s voice being more so. The animation direction is old and quirky, but I do like the nice, distinctive character designs.Overall, ""Southern Cross"" is an improvement over its ""Robotech"" counterpart, but it\'s still not very good. It has its entertaining moments, but for the most part it\'s just dull.This review was written after I\'d watched the original ""Southern Cross"". Before that I\'d watched and reviewed ""Robotech: The Masters"". As a bonus, I\'ve included below (an edited version of) that sh*tty review.

Recently, I\'ve discovered how to obtain anime from the internet, and started watching ""Robotech"" all over again, including ""The Masters"" arc just for completeness sake.Well, it still sucks.Mediocre story; criminal reuse of ideas from the preceding ""The Macross Saga"" arc; inconsistencies in the story (in every episode the Robotech Masters seem to change their mind as to what to do with ""these puny humans"") ... this is one crap anime.The main character is one of the most annoying ever, with a voice to match.

Despite these positive points though, this is easily the weakest link of the three arcs in ""Robotech"".', ""Southern Cross is an utterly forgettable show. It's only grip to relevancy is the fact that it's the third part of the super dimensional trilogy, and is the second part of the Robotech series. Even then it's a weak grip due to how niche the titles that it's in have become. There's really not much to the shows uniqueness from its plot and characters, the only thing of note is that the main lead is a woman.There are three leads actually, and they are all women. The show however is more focused on one of them the most Jeanne. A capricious, spunky, stubborn girl who...serves as commander of a squad in the southern cross army. Following her and her team's actions during the war between humans and the Zor who were once native to the planet the humans are now colonizing. The Zor basically are this series Zentradi, but instead of it being a war between a culture and culture-less society. It's more between humans and thier ability to express emotions and the emotionless Zor who focus more on logic and rationality. As the war escalate it's the emotions that some of the Zor come in contact with that becomes their undoing. The last episodes get hectic due to the show being cancelled leading to a mildly unsatisfying ending.As for characters, despite how it's lead on, the two other female leads get shafted early on. There's Marie who tries to one up Jeanne whenever she can, and Lana who comes off as being a model soldier for others. The only other characters of note are Bowie due to his implied background, his dreams and desires, and is also a fundamental figure who pushes the plot. And there's also some German named pretty boy who was brainwashed by the zors until bring freed,but becomes the less interesting part of the show. everyone else is one-note.When compared to its predecessor, Macross, Southern cross is rather average in terms of production value. Backdrops of countryside and cities look par for the course during it's time. Character designs are somewhat decent, but forgettable. The odd changing of proportions that makes things bigger or smaller from one scene to the next. The animation is ok, but has a lot of stuttering even with basic panning and zooming. The only interesting thing are the ridiculous battle suits that the characters wear despite not serving much of a purpose due to them fighting in mechas. The mechas themselves following the same philosophy as Macross with changing into three different shapes. This time Turning from a hovercraft, to a walking cannon, to finally a common mech.The soundtrack is decent 80's pop funk. It's nice to listen to, but sometimes doesn't fit well with many scenes. Mostly due to the soundtrack being mostly upbeat even during more sad or somber scenes.It's not a bad show, but It's certainly dated and doesn't have much to it that can't be found in other shows. It only seems worth watching for those who have a passing interest in seeing the little footnotes in the history of much more well known anime. serves as commander of a squad in the southern cross army. Following her and her team's actions during the war between humans and the Zor who were once native to the planet the humans are now colonizing. The Zor basically are this series Zentradi, but instead of it being a war between a culture and culture-less society. It's more between humans and thier ability to express emotions and the emotionless Zor who focus more on logic and rationality. As the war escalate it's the emotions that some of the Zor come in contact with that becomes their undoing. The last episodes get hectic due to the show being cancelled leading to a mildly unsatisfying ending.As for characters, despite how it's lead on, the two other female leads get shafted early on. There's Marie who tries to one up Jeanne whenever she can, and Lana who comes off as being a model soldier for others. The only other characters of note are Bowie due to his implied background, his dreams and desires, and is also a fundamental figure who pushes the plot. And there's also some German named pretty boy who was brainwashed by the zors until bring freed,but becomes the less interesting part of the show. everyone else is one-note.When compared to its predecessor, Macross, Southern cross is rather average in terms of production value. Backdrops of countryside and cities look par for the course during it's time. Character designs are somewhat decent, but forgettable. The odd changing of proportions that makes things bigger or smaller from one scene to the next. The animation is ok, but has a lot of stuttering even with basic panning and zooming. The only interesting thing are the ridiculous battle suits that the characters wear despite not serving much of a purpose due to them fighting in mechas. The mechas themselves following the same philosophy as Macross with changing into three different shapes. This time Turning from a hovercraft, to a walking cannon, to finally a common mech.The soundtrack is decent 80's pop funk. It's nice to listen to, but sometimes doesn't fit well with many scenes. Mostly due to the soundtrack being mostly upbeat even during more sad or somber scenes.It's not a bad show, but It's certainly dated and doesn't have much to it that can't be found in other shows. It only seems worth watching for those who have a passing interest in seeing the little footnotes in the history of much more well known anime.""]"

Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/357/Bokusatsu_Tenshi_Dokuro-chan,"['Well I thought long and hard before deciding to sit down and actually write a review on this anime.  As you can see I am not a fan.  When I sat down to view this series it was partially because I had seen references to it in other shows I had watched and a friend had recommended it telling me how funny he thought it was.  I looked it up and thought the characters looked cute and was intrigued by the alt title ""Club to Death Angel"" ...  hmm what was that about?  God, how I wish I that I...could have that moment back now.So let’s give you the premise of Dokuro-chan.  Basically she is an angel from the future who is here to protect Sakura from other angels from the future who want him dead for something he will do in the future... making all future women loli\'s.  Ooooooooook.  There have been far sillier anime plots so I can go with that.  But that isn’t all of course, because Dokuro really loves Sakura and naturally is a jealous tsundere and in her fits of rage and jealousy kills Sakura...a lot.  She beats him to death, she turns him into bloody soup, she impales, she decapitates, and dismembers in every way you can.  But she’s always really sorry and being an angel buy saying her really cute ""Pi-piru-piru-piru-pi-piru-pi!"" she can bring him back to life.  Of course Sakura is always quite upset (you think!?) and needs to remind Dokuro to stop beating him to death.  Aww.  Now I imagine this is supposed to be funny.  Well maybe I woke up on the wrong side of the bed before I watched this or I was PMSing, but I thought this blatant cruelty was about as funny as,  well being bludgeoned to death.  Oh and you think it can’t get much worse than that?  Add that an angel having his or her halo removes causes them to immediately have uncontrollable explosive diarrhea.  Nice.You’re probably thinking... aren’t you being a little harsh?  Its only cartoon violence!  I\'ve seen shows that have been pretty raw before, Inukami! comes to mind, but many other shows that involve similar character types often have some pretty crude and sometimes cruel behavior.  Such as Louise horse whipping Saito from ZnT, etc.  This is different though the amount of spraying blood and gore is just so over the top that it is hard to top.  Even some of the most violent anime out there like an Elfen Lied or Claymore were not bloodier than this one.  And those weren’t comedies.Now that I have gotten of my soapbox lets discuss the other parts of this series.  Like I said at the start the art was one of the things that initially interested me in the show.  It doesn’t disappoint there, Dokuro and all her friends are very cute and adorable, which in a way makes the way they behave so hard to accept.  The music and voice acting is pretty good too.  The OP song is pretty cute and cuddly sounding, well unless you read the translation.I made it through this anime, because it was short 12 min episodes... and I really wanted to like it.  I thought if I kept watching that eventually I would get some entertainment from it?  I even watched the even shorter second part, honestly because I had already gotten it and I figured I might as well watch it too.  This show truly disturbed me and I don’t think I have ever been more offended by something in my life.  If it was possible to give it a ""0"" in enjoyment I would have.  Reading the other reviews for this I see that I am probably in the minority on my thinking here.  I don’t know what to say to you if you liked this show.  Personally I think you need to see a shrink.  If you’re reading this and wondering if you should watch it, I recognize that we all have different tastes, if you’re a fan of dark comedy shows like South Park (I am not) then you would probably enjoy this.  Otherwise I would stay very very far away. could have that moment back now.So let’s give you the premise of Dokuro-chan.

FLCL had a deeper story (yes, there was one...watch it again) and Azumanga Daioh had greater character development, but Dokuro-chan has a charm all it's own...not to mention lots of blood. The parody of the &quot;magical girl&quot; element really adds something. I never cared for those types (Sailor Moon annoys me, no matter what language it's in), but here, it's funny.The visuals and sound were really well done considering how short the series is, but then, that's just how series like this work. Short, but high-quality...(well, the good ones, anyway). The premise alone is what got me to watch it and I wasn't disappointed. You have to take this series for what it is: brainless fun.Look, I really enjoy stuff like Cowboy Bebop, Kanon (2006), and Gundam Wing...but sometimes you just gotta let off some steam. You can't always be serious and this really hit the spot for me. Especially since my last 3 series were Air, Black Lagoon, and Kanon (2006). Talk about heavy...I really needed this!The first episode alone was almost too much...the appearance of the &quot;monkey&quot; left me almost in tears, I was laughing so hard. I'm sure my neighbors were wondering if I'd cracked! It wasn't some cerebral joke, it was just so completely unexpected, it really caught me off-guard. That, and I happen to find monkeys funny in general. Nothing afterwards hit my funnybone THAT hard, but it was still worthwhile.Kick back, let go of your rational mind for a bit, and enjoy this blood-soaked comedy for what it is and don't try to analyze it too deeply. It's just plain fun.&quot;Pipiru piru piru pipiru pi!!!!!!!!&quot; -Dokuro-chan (well, the good ones, anyway). The premise alone is what got me to watch it and I wasn't disappointed.

No, I\'m not just a flamer, or a crude one-line-reviewer, but it’s true. My first advice to all of the people who read this review: do not watch this anime unless you... 1) Are absolutely *desperate* for a brainless comedy, 2)  Do not care one whit about storyline, or 3) Are a brave person who wants to plunge into the unknown despite my fervent warnings to the contrary.First, and quite possibly most importantly, the storyline. A quote from MyAnimeList.net\'s description:""Problem is, Dokuro is very temperamental, and is constantly killing Sakura (and...lots of other people too) in incredibly bloody ways with her giant spiked club.""This *is* the storyline. The whole anime revolves around Dokuro walking around, swinging her club around in a giant grand melee, and then gasping in shock (or not) and singing her little song to bring back the person she just killed. There are other sub-plotlines describing relationships, competitions between angels, and so on, but they seem rough and thrown in to make up for the astounding lack of any other content. The main body of the anime, as stated before, is nothing but a huge bloodbath of random violence and destruction.On a slightly happier note; if, somehow, you manage to avoid being led off by the absence of a storyline, you will probably enjoy simply looking at the action on the screen. While there are animes that are undeniably drawn far better, Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan does an excellent job of matching very random animations with the action. A wide variety of styles of drawing are used for emphasis in certain scenes, although one main style dominates.Similarly, a wide variety of sound is used effectively throughout the show, drawing to mind the old radio stations of the 50\'s that often used their arsenal of bells and whistles for the entertainment of their listeners. While watching the anime, you may find that the little tune that Dokuro uses to revive people (pipiru pi!) begins to annoy you by sheer repetition.Character, however, is another weak point. All of the characters have firmly established personas, but none of them have the least bit of depth. As a story progresses, you might expect characters to acquire some bits of personality, but instead they remain almost entirely set in the personas given to them in the introduction.This anime, as stated earlier, is something you watch in the wee hours of night as a way to get a quick laugh without immersing yourself in a good story. I would not recommend anyone looking for a high quality, strong anime show to watch this.As a note to the supporters of this anime: I understand that some people will not agree with my assessment of this show. Please, instead of flaming my or posting detrimental comments, post your own review to challenge my opinion.Rating: 4/10 lots of other people too) in incredibly bloody ways with her giant spiked club.""This *is* the storyline.

It came out in 2005 and raised eyebrows with its heavy use of gore, painfully unfunny attempts at humor, insanely obnoxious characters, and sheer failure at being a ""magical girl"" genre parody. Dokuro-chan is like the poor man\'s version of Excel Saga or FLCL. Actually, the show it reminds me of most of all is Panty and Stocking, but Gainax had nothing to do with Dokuro believe it or not.Story and characters: 1/10Oh dear GOD! The plot is that a pathetic, squirming male protagonist is on the brink of discovering a...technology that will make mankind immortal. He wishes to make all women permanently 12 years old and be the only mature human so he can live as a pedophile God. The plot thickens when the real God is upset by this plan and sends angels down to Earth in order to kill the pedophile mad scientist. One of these angels is the annoying beyond all belief Dokuro Chan. Dokuro chan is so rage inducing it can\'t really be described by my meager English skills. Imagine a character that makes Jar Jar Binks look as cool as Miles Davis! Dokuro falls in love with the pedo scientist named Sakura (unusual name for a man), and the series is about their romance. What makes this series suck besides being VERY pro-loli and having the most obnoxious characters ever, is that it was created to spoof the magic girl genre and it fails miserably as a parody. It never demonstrates anything beyond a very shallow understanding of magical girl anime and therefore isn\'t able to parody the style very effectively. Imagine a version of Young Frankenstein if firstly, Mel Brooks had never actually seen a Universal Monster film before and had only heard of those films, and secondly this alternate Mel Brooks has a brain the size of a jelly bean. That is what watching Dokuro is like!Art: 5/10The art isn\'t THAT bad for 2005, but this was drawn by Genion, who did Ergo Proxy the same year! They are capable of doing a LOT better!Sound: 2/10The music sucks, but at least you have the choice of listening in English or Japanese. In the English dub, the pedophile scientist is voiced by Johnny Young Bosch in probably the single worst role of his distinguished career. WHY!?? In Japanese, the pedo is voiced by a fairly obscure actress, but she is good at voicing young male characters that piss off the audience. She also voiced that little shit that beat the puppy to death in Elfen Lied. Seriously!Enjoyment: 2/10Remember that segment of the movie Idiocracy called ""Ow my Balls!"". Really crude physical humor can be funny the first time, but if you reuse the joke where the same character gets hit in the nuts OVER and OVER, it stops being funny to all but the stupidest of audiences. This is the anime version of ""Ow my Balls!""Overall: 2/10The mediocre art that came with being backed by a major animation studio managed to save Dokuro from the unholy 1/10 rating. Everything else in this anime is feces. Oh yeah, before I forget: PIPIRU PIRU PIRU PIPIURU PIIII! God DAMN is that shit annoying! technology that will make mankind immortal.

I remember reading about it on some site long ago, but I forgot the title. Although, luckily, I asked about it on the anime section of GameTalk and someone was able to tell me.This anime is REALLY short (4 episodes) -- even shorter than FLCL. And like FLCL, I have to wonder why it isn't any longer.Dokuro-chan is an angel from the future who is sent by God to kill Sakura who is destined to create the technology that freezes all women's aging once they turn twelve.Although Dokuro-chan decides to save Sakura, she ends up killing him anyway (multiple...times) with her giant spiked club because she is very temperamental.The great thing about this anime is that every episode had something that made me laugh out loud, and I guarantee you will too.P.S.

Random, and mindless. The characters are decent, the sound is decent, art is good, but there really isn't much of a story. That aside, given that Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan is a random, mindless comedy, the story can slide a little.IMO, if you're looking for random mindless comedy, and don't mind the violence, or lack of a decent story, then Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan is perfect for you. "", '""Pipuru piru piru pipuru pi!""You\'ll hear that phrase so often in this show you\'ll want to blow your brains out. Dokuro-chan, or, excuse me, ""Club-To-Death Angel Dokuro-chan"" is a terrible \'comedy\' from the mid 2000s known for its stupid humour and the over the top gore. This anime is really strange, from its writing, to its humour and even to its art design of its characters. Everything about this anime makes me want to burn my eyes out with a candle but first, let\'s talk about the narrative... if you could even call it that.Our main character is a man of great importance in the...future and why may you ask? Did he become a scientist and cure all known disease? Nope. Did he become a ruler and unite the world in one giant country thus stopping all war and injustices? Nah. Did he grow up to become a functioning member of society at least? No! Our \'wonderful\' main protagonist invents mortality so that all women after the age of 12 will stop growing...so in other words, this guy is possibly a paedophile. God, who is naturally pissed at what he has done, sends an angel from the future called ""Dokuro-chan"" to kill Sakura (our main pedo- I mean hero!) but ends up falling in love with him and believes our main protagonist can be spared so she decides to watch over him, in an attempt to prevent him from creating this invention.And that\'s it for an over-arcing storyline. The rest of the show is made up of simple gags which are not all too funny and boring side characters who do nothing to affect the plot in the slightest. Now, I\'m not expecting too much in terms of a story, since most shows in this genre generally lack one anyway, and the OVA format with this few episodes doesn\'t exactly allow for a deep, intricate story, but that\'s fine if the comedy and characters are fun. Which they are not.I guess there is another small subplot about Sakura wanting to confess his feelings to a girl he likes but, like most other shows in the same genre, is never expanded on and is instead left in the dark.The main reoccurring gag in the show is the one in which where Dokuro will kill Sakura with her giant bat for stupid crap, like a dumb boob grab or seeing her accidentally naked or something along those lines. The first few times this happens, its so over the top that it will catch you off guard and maybe will make you smile but it gets old, really quick. Not only does Dokuro kill Sakura for such retarded reasons, every single time she does it, but we also have to listen to the same ""Pipuru piru piru pipuru pi!"" so that he can be brought back to life.There are many other gags, which are either trying way too hard to be funny or relying on gross-out humour, which I am not a fan of at all. The anime tries to rely on ""OH MY GAWD, ITZ FUNNEH CAUSE IS RANDOM!!"" type of humour, and like I said, it gets old really quickly, unless you\'re ten years old or something. Some gags were okay, such as the ""Binkan-Man"" commercial cut away but aside from that, nothing else. They also use this cheap as hell looking photoshop monkeys which they use to place on the heads of several students. I understand that the gag is all about how cheap it looks but it still is not funny none the less.The characters, in both design and personality, are boring, lacking anything to make them interesting. Sakura is the butt of every joke and the one that is always getting beat up. Dokuro-chan is a sadistic maniac who enjoys torturing the person she likes since she says that ""its the way I show my love"" according to the opening. She is selfish and a complete bitch in every sense of the word. She never learns or changes of the duration of the two seasons or ever thinks ""Hmm, maybe I should stop brutality killing the person I am in love with"". There is another angel that gets introduced but is mostly forgetful and those nothing interesting at all. Aside from a way to use a cheap toilet gag. Yeah, that reminds me. Apparently, whenever the Halo is removed from the angel\'s heads, it sorts of acts as a laxative...I\'ll let you picture how these scenes play out in your head. Furthermore, whenever these terrible scenes do arise (no pun intended) the animators make it their duty to fully showcase their pain through the disgustingly detailed expression on their faces. Honestly, it\'s creepy.Another angel includes the incredibly big breasted girl with the best curves and the one any sweaty otaku would want to do dirty things to in real life...until you learn she is nine years old. At least they\'re consistent with their themes of paedophilia.The animation and colour design is pretty typical of what you\'d expect from mid-2000s anime. Its very basic looking, the characters bodies look kind of disproportionate and overall the animation is very standard. There are a few good moments of detailed artwork and animation to help convey some jokes, but again, it feels like they\'re trying to force comedy. The opening song is pretty much the most annoying thing I have ever heard with the main catch being the damn""Pipuru piru piru pipuru pi!"" shit, over and over again.In conclusion, stay away from this anime. It tries way too hard to shock the audience with it\'s over the top comedy and bloodshed it comes across as pathetic and boring. The comedy is weak and forced and everything is a mess. Stay away from it. future and why may you ask? Did he become a scientist and cure all known disease? Nope.

She never learns or changes of the duration of the two seasons or ever thinks ""Hmm, maybe I should stop brutality killing the person I am in love with"". There is another angel that gets introduced but is mostly forgetful and those nothing interesting at all. Aside from a way to use a cheap toilet gag. Yeah, that reminds me. Apparently, whenever the Halo is removed from the angel\'s heads, it sorts of acts as a laxative...I\'ll let you picture how these scenes play out in your head. Furthermore, whenever these terrible scenes do arise (no pun intended) the animators make it their duty to fully showcase their pain through the disgustingly detailed expression on their faces. Honestly, it\'s creepy.Another angel includes the incredibly big breasted girl with the best curves and the one any sweaty otaku would want to do dirty things to in real life...until you learn she is nine years old. At least they\'re consistent with their themes of paedophilia.The animation and colour design is pretty typical of what you\'d expect from mid-2000s anime. Its very basic looking, the characters bodies look kind of disproportionate and overall the animation is very standard. There are a few good moments of detailed artwork and animation to help convey some jokes, but again, it feels like they\'re trying to force comedy. The opening song is pretty much the most annoying thing I have ever heard with the main catch being the damn""Pipuru piru piru pipuru pi!"" shit, over and over again.In conclusion, stay away from this anime. It tries way too hard to shock the audience with it\'s over the top comedy and bloodshed it comes across as pathetic and boring. The comedy is weak and forced and everything is a mess. Stay away from it.', ""Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan is one of those absolutely, totally, ridiculously non-sense anime. And this is what makes it really funny as hell.Sakura-kun is a simple boy who struggles to live a decent life after Dokuro-chan, a crazy clubbing-to-death angel that came and started to live with him, for no apparent reason.To resume, the story is stupid, as you can see in the synopsis.The students look totally normal and basic, with the exception of the one turned into a monkey and the teacher, with his weird face and goggles, well in fact most of the adults look disguting, so are Sakura's face in critical situations. Sometimes...Sakura's mind will be shown with some hilarous metaphors using an adult character, or the angel and devil thing (well, here it's a vulgar Sakura and a graduated Sakura).Well, the changes in art style are in fact most of the time the reason for the fun in the show.The opening couldn't fit better, Sae-chan sings as she voices Dokuro-chan. The voices and sounds used during every episode make the show even funnier. The ending is kinda sad compared to the delirious anime, but as it is really relaxing and cool I will forgive Sae-chan because you can't dislike her.Well, if you want to laugh after a messy day or because you're wanting to forget your hard times, BTDC is ALWAYS a good anime to watch. If you just want to see some funny random anime, no other can be better. If you want to see some serious anime or a great storyline for a funny show, don't even look for it.And the sequel is even funnier (but two times shorter), be sure to check it out.

Basically, it's the weirdest, craziest, most nonsensical, stupidest mind-f*** of a show I have EVER seen. However, I can't exactly say it's bad. Because, really, it's not.It's about a boy named Sakura (yes, he is a boy, and his name IS Sakura), a remarkably normal kid who just happens to have a murderous angel living in his room. This is Dokuro-chan, a mallet-wielding psychopathic angel from the future to protect Sakura from the other angels who want to kill him, all because (in the future) he accidentally found...the secret to eternal youth in an attempt to make a pedophiles' world. And what is this 'guardian angels' biggest pleasure in life? To mercilessly torture and kill poor Sakura every chance she gets, to distract him from studying so he will never accidentally find the secret to eternal youth! And she doesn't just kill him... She slaughters him, the most common way being lobbing off the top half of his head with her club-thingy called 'Excaliborg' in giant explosions of blood. After he has collapsed to the floor, his own blood usually decorating the surrounding walls and ceiling, she brandishes Excaliborg once again to heal him back to life with a 'Pipiru pipiru pipiru pi!'This may sound funny to you, it may not. It sounded funny to me, but in the end the sheer amount of stupidity I was hit with just baffled me and I couldn't watch it anymore.If you want plot, you're definably not going to find it here. It's just 8 jumbled episodes of unrelated stupidity, filled to the brim with Sakura's pain and misery. Actually, Sakura was the only character I actually liked, and that was mostly because I felt bad for the poor guy. He's abused by his classmates in various ways, Dokuro kills him every few minutes and he's publicly humiliated in front of the girl he likes on numerous occasions. To me, it was much more cruel than funny, considering that one time he's killed, washed down a river, had to hitch-hike his way back, and is greeted by concern and caring from his classmates only to find out the food they gave him is poisoned.That's... Just cruel.The art is cute, if not disturbing at times (and I don't mean the blood, I mean how radically the characters change from normal and cute to deformed and ugly) and the music is catchy. The voice acting is pretty good as well. I found it to be funny here and there, but the rest of the time I just felt my brain cells die as I watched it.Bottom line, I say give it a try...

I usually enjoy watching anime series like this, that don\'t really have a plot and are just parody/comedy and that\'s it. After watching the first episode (There\'s 4 eps, not 8), I just can\'t watch any more for at least a very, very long time. It is HORRIBLE, even for a comedy anime. But I do respect it for one thing. This anime manages to do something no other anime can do. It manages to be SO BAD, that it makes ALL other anime seem amazing. This must truly be the worst anime...that was ever made in order for it to accomplish this. During the whole episode I watched, I kept thinking how great those boring, slice-of-life shows like Lucky Star are compared to the sh*t I was currently watching. Oh, and by the way, blood is supposed to go DOWN not up. It\'s called gravity.Story:The story is interesting enough. The problem is, they do nothing with it. Instead of what it says on the summary, the story ends up being Dokuro-chan killing Sakura every 5 seconds for some dumb reason, then reviving him. That COULD be funny, but it gets old and loses any possible humor since it\'s repeated so often. Basically, there is no story.Art:Most of the time it\'s cute. Then the characters get all deformed and it isn\'t funny like it\'s meant to be - it\'s just outright disturbing. Maybe not quite enough to cause nightmares, but just horrible to look at.Sound:The OP theme is cute, as long as you don\'t read the translation. Everything else is mediocre.Character:Lolwhat? Characters? Oh yeah, that. Dokuro-chan is like Louise from ZnT or Shana from SnS to the extreme x10000000. She likes chopping peoples heads off with her bat. That\'s all there is to know about her. Sakura seems like the ""self-insert"" character, having no personality and all, but who the f*ck would want to be him? Oh, and there\'s this girl who Sakura has a crush on. That\'s all. Oh, there\'s a monkey too.Enjoyment:If you enjoy this show, you must be a sadist.Overall:If you end up on some deserted island somewhere and the only thing you have is this anime series, don\'t watch it.

It was quickly adapted into a manga and then an anime from Hal Film Maker, known for their work with Aria, Princess Tutu and Uta Kata. I originally watched this series in Secondary school and I don't remember much about it aside from the music being awesome. Let's take a look at the series and see what else, if anything, it has going for it.So, the setup is that a young student named Sakura is living with an angel, the titular Dokuro-chan. She came from the future to change...the past surrounding him. How? By beating him to death with a spiky club and resurrecting him multiple times. Her plan is great. You can probably already tell that it's not a serious show. So, what can you expect from the comedy? Most of it is either gross out humour, frequently involving gore  over the top reaction humour or ecchi humour. The events themselves revel from having no connection to reality. Sakura's classmates and teacher just accept everything that happens without much reaction or comment. You'd also expect Sakura to be terrified of Dokuro, given her tendency to violently murder him with little provocation, but he treats her like a childish friend who just needs to be gently corrected most of the time. I'd suggest that he should call the authorities and get a restraining order, but she is a supernatural menace. So, who should he call? Why Ktulu's Supernatural  Exterminators, of course. Our staff will use science and logic to prove within a .0005% probability that your supernatural menace doesn't exist, thereby causing them to vanish in a puff of logic. Wendy says “I had a ghost living in my house. He was friendly enough, but he was kind of an annoying tool. So I called Ktulu's Supernatural Exterminators. The representative who came to my house insulted everything from my intelligence to the décor, and when I called to complain they didn't understand what I was talking about.” To clarify Wendy's statement, we understood perfectly, we just didn't care. “But she was done in less than ten minutes and now I don't have that tool lurking around anymore.” That's Ktulu's Supernatural Exterminators. We promise efficient and effective removal of supernatural beings, but not good customer service. Our motto is “if you were smart, we wouldn't have to deal with it for you.” Call today, we're currently offering specials on sparkly vampires and green-haired kitsune stalkers. Now, back to Bokusatsu Tenshi. Another serious issue is the ending. They actually try to have a semi-serious, tense moment. Naturally, that doesn't work in a series that's already built up a very goofy aesthetic.The characters in this are really lacking in dimension. You wouldn't expect them to develop much given that the series only has eight fifteen minute episodes, but they don't even come across as one-dimensional. It's like Highschool of the Dead, the characters are so flat they would be lucky to have half a dimension to them. The characters don't even play well off of each other for comedic purposes. Pretty much every joke has the same reaction from them. Dokuro gets violent, Sakura freaks out, their other classmates watch without reaction.The art in this is pretty bad. Most of it is really undetailed. The only parts where they put in any effort are the gore effects and the occasional ecchi moment. And even then it's not all the time. Most of the gore effects consist of large quantities of blood spurting everywhere and they're pretty lazy.The sound is the best part of the series. Mainly because of the opening, which has awesome music. The voice acting itself is largely either over the top or under-stated. The variation is pretty much based entirely on the character. Chiba Saeko, Takagi Reiko and Tobita Nobuo give exaggerated performances, everyone else gives really dull, emotionless ones.The ho-yay factor is a 2/10. There's one throwaway joke involving Sakura and Zansu. It isn't remotely funny.So, who would actually like this? If you're a fan of violent gross out humour, this is certainly one for you. If you think exaggeration is tantamount to humour, you'll probably like it. If neither of those statements applies to you, check out the music but stay away from the actual series. Final rating: 2/10. Next week I'll look at Robotics;Notes. the past surrounding him. How? By beating him to death with a spiky club and resurrecting him multiple times. Her plan is great.

I may have set the bar too high by watching Punie first, but dang if I still don't enjoy a bloody meat fountain caused by a dangerous and violent, but cutesy little moe blob.Artwork and Animation: 6Despite being by the venerable Geneon, Dokuro looks pretty average. Maybe they were saving up for Ergo Proxy, which was to come the next year, but...for something made in 2005, it's not a visual feast. There's a lot of chibi style comedy and grotesque, distorted faces to spice up the otherwise bland visual style, though. Grievous injuries and gleeful beatdowns also splatter a dash of color across the screen quite frequently. And by quite frequently, I mean at least 4-5 times per 13 minute episode.Sound and Voice Acting: 7As a big Johnny Yong Bosch fan, I have to say this is not one of his better roles as the moronic ninnyboy Sakura. While he definitely puts on a show as a whining idiot, it's so grating to hear Sakura speak sometimes that I was just waiting for his next bludgeoning so he'll shut up for a few seconds, or at least scream in agony in sync with my ears.Wendee Lee likewise has been in better roles, but fills the petulant and obnoxious Dokuro's shoes very well. Honestly the best role was a supporting one from Mela Lee as Rin Tohsaka, I mean, Shizuki.On a good note... the opening song is incredibly catchy- good luck getting PI PIRU PIRU PI PIRU PI unstuck from your head after watching this.Story and Characters: 5The premise is that Dokuro-chan is sent from Heaven to kill Sakura and stop him from creating a technology that stops women's physical aging at 12. In her mind though, this mission is instead to just interfere with his everyday life so much that he'll somehow forget about the thing he's supposed to invent in the future, and only kill him when he or some outside stimulus sets her off- but promptly revive him.Well, here's basically how each 13 minute double episode goes: the idiot Sakura is minding his own business and gets put in a situation that reflects pervertedly with him and someone else, typically Dokuro. Dokuro, ever the excitable, malicious fiend that she is, then takes her bat, Excalibolg, and pummels Sakura into oblivion before resurrecting him with her angel magic. The plot is pretty nonsensical, and doesn't really go anywhere- due to Dokuro's near-constant interference in every single activity that Sakura tries to perform.Enjoyment: 7Is it funny to watch them squirm? Yeah, sometimes. Is it extremely juvenile and heavy handed with the humor? Absolutely. Is the show really obnoxious? Yes.If I wasn't a fan of ultraviolence as a source of humor, this show would have been so irritating to watch I'd probably have spooned my eyeballs out and flattened them with hot irons after replacing about 10% of my blood with liquid meth after the first 10 minutes or so. That said, Dokuro did have just enough laughs in there to keep me watching, and a little blood never hurt anybody.That's a lie, everyone has at least 5 gallons of blood in this.Overall and Recommendation: 6Definitely not as good, nor anywhere near as clever as Punie, but if one enjoys the bloodthirsty and dangerous moe girl type magical girl parodies, this one should definitely be on the list. for something made in 2005, it's not a visual feast.

That being said if you do decide to go into this anime with the intent of taking it seriously like many of the other reviewers on this site, then you are going to have a bad time.Now that's out of the way, I would recommend this anime to people who can take a joke, separate fiction from reality and are looking for something fun and brainless to watch.Story is original for its time, artstyle is good,...and characters had their own unique charm. and characters had their own unique charm."", 'As I was scrolling in MAL like I usually do, looking for new things to watch, I found this little OVA series, featuring a boy that screwed up the future, and an angel with a spiked baseball bat.  Upon reading the description and looking at its average overall score, I thought to myself, why not?  And now, I am asking myself, why did I watch this?Story (5/10): Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan is a very odd little series.  It only has 4 episodes, so there is a very big time constraint to be had.  Usually, I would give a pass on the whole...short time constraint thing if they tell at least a decent story, but I cannot under any circumstances give this one any mercy whatsoever.  While the story is about a boy who somehow in the future turns every woman in existence into a loli, being saved by a ludicrous angel from the future while at the same time, getting brutally murdered by her based on the synopsis, I couldn\'t really see that anywhere.  For starters, the actual series itself barely mentions this plot in the first place.  All its purpose is, is to provide something that resembles background information in order to make some ""sense"" in this godforsaken plot.In actuality to the anime\'s real plot itself, I didn\'t really find it noteworthy whatsoever.  It resembles FLCL in the sense that every single episode is a different story in and of itself, while also being completely and utterly pointless in terms of conveying a plot.  The show itself tries very hard to be funny with all of its slapstick humor and bludgeoning; fanservice and innuendoes, but it really falls flat on its face, killing the show.  Particularly, the bludgeoning.  The phrase ""too much of a good thing"" comes to mind.  Because the show constantly uses this gag time after time after time, it felt less funny repeat after repeat, till I was just bored of it all, sighing after every time the main character Sakura (yes, it\'s a guy) loses half of his body due to blunt force trauma, and begins spouting blood like a pressurized hose.  To me, it doesn\'t become funny anymore after repeating the same gag about 50 times.  Now, I understand that this is part of the main show itself, seeing how the show is called the club to death angel.  But honestly, they could\'ve dialed it back just a smidge, in my opinion.  The ending of it all was as generic as could be, seeing as many a romance anime has come to that same predictable conclusion without any real evidence or merit for it to actually happen.Character (5/10): As a consequence to the 4 episode time frame, the characters don\'t really feel special at all.  Looking back, I actually couldn\'t see much personality of the majority of the cast, at all.  The one that probably shows the most in terms of actual personality, is Dokuro herself.  (When she\'s not killing anyone with her club that is.)  She shows her personality easily from the first time she\'s on screen, but she\'s not really that different from start to end.  They don\'t add anything to her or anything of the sort, and she just becomes this monotone character that just feels so ordinary (in anime terms.)  Sakura is just your average ""boring"" character sick of the girl he\'s stuck with, like Kyon from ""Haruhi"" or Tsuda from ""Seitokai Yakuindomo"", from what I can see.  I wouldn\'t go as far as to say he\'s the worst character in the whole series, but he\'s not the best.  The supporting cast is filled with character fodder, filled to the brim with random people that get about as much screentime as a background character.  Personally, this cast didn\'t impress me in the slightest, and I wouldn\'t bat an eye at any of the so-called ""development"" that these people put out.Art and Sound (6/10 and 5/10): For something that was made in 2005, it\'s actually pretty decent, for the most part.  In its normal animation, Bokusatsu hosts a very colorful and moe world that is actually quite childish and pleasing to look at.  It\'s a very simple animation that actually works out with the slapstick comedy that the characters do.  On the other hand though, there\'s the nightmare fuel.  This anime also hosts a great deal of scenes from the opposite end of the spectrum, featuring way too realistic artwork that just looks haunting and scary, shaping the characters\' faces into things that don\'t look possible, and overall, leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  I did not enjoy it one bit.The sound is similar in terms of quality.  While the OP is somewhat cute with Dokuro\'s voice actress doing the singing, it all felt extremely pitchy to me, and I couldn\'t stand to hear it more than once.  It hurt my ears a bit.  The ED is nothing special either.  It\'s just some generic ""depressing"" song that I didn\'t bother remembering since I didn\'t enjoy it.  To me, the music is really all just music fodder.Personal Enjoyment (4/10): Personally, I love romance shows.  I love comedy.  I even like a little bit of ecchi sometimes once in a great while.  And when it\'s mixed together, I usually see a decent and usually enjoyable result.  This...was not one of them.  Along with the strange story, the mediocre characters, the overused gags, nightmarish animations, and generic ending, I felt really bored watching this.  While I will admit I did laugh a couple times, the anime itself was so underwhelming.  It didn\'t feel memorable at all, and it just felt like a bunch of ideas were thrown together in a pot, and mixed together.  Personally, I didn\'t enjoy this at all, and I certainly will not watch the ""second season"" of this.  Let me know what you thought of this series.

I would like to know.', ""Oh, Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan~This show is stupid. I have to be honest. However, that's what makes this anime so funny. It's dumb, but it doesn't take itself seriously, and the viewer is not really supposed to take it too seriously, either. This is one of those crazy, mindless comedy series that make you laugh and that's it. While it is far from flawlessness, it is pretty good.Story: 6There is a story (sort of), but it's very weak and by the end of the series, I really think the writers just dropped the main plot and drifted off into the abyss of no return. Not like...it mattered much, frankly. The anime is for the most part episodic, each episode having its own plot. Honestly, it's better that way. I don't think the anime would be as hilarious as it is if it actually held on to the 'story' introduced in the first episode. Part of the humor stems from the randomness and sheer ridiculousness of the series. This sort of zany humor is great to some, unfunny to others, so it's not like I will say this series is hilarious to everyone. Most people seem to enjoy this series, so hopefully you will too.It's also very cute (at first). Don't let the cuteness make you lower your guard, though. It is a black comedy anime, and by black comedy, and I mean VERY dark comedy. Like, gory. The main character gets killed in horrific ways by the eponymous bludgeoning angel about two hundred times throughout this series, and off-screen, like a thousand more times. However, it's not like Elfen Lied kind of gore. I mean, it's so over-the-top and idiotic, it's funny. The creativity in how the main character dies each episode (he is revived) is disturbing. But funny, too. Makes me feel sort of bad for finding it so humorous, but what can you expect from this show?Art: 9The art/animation is really good, and very cute. Like I said, the cuteness is only superficial. Anyway, the animation is smooth (sometimes choppy, but mostly good), and the character designs and backgrounds are very well made, especially for an OVA. The animation and art in the more comedic scenes is sometimes so exaggeratedly detailed and wacky, it still makes me laugh to this day.Sound: 7The opening and ending themes are nice, and better than lots of other J-Pop anime themes. The opening is bubbly and rather catchy (maybe too catchy), and the lyrics are very suitable for the anime. The ending theme is not as upbeat; actually, it is sort of melancholy, which greatly contrasts with the entire series. The voice cast is great, also. The voice-acting is fitting and well-done, and adds to the comedy. The background music is good, although nothing very memorable.Character: 5There is very little character development until the last episode, and even then, it isn't a lot of development. But the point of the series isn't to develop its characters; it's to be so strange and absurd, that it's funny.Enjoyment: 9Not everybody will love this anime or find it as hysterical as I did. I laughed so hard, my cheeks hurt. However, everybody has their sense of humor. I find this series, for one, rather funny. No, tremendously funny. That is my sense of humor, though. Some might think my sense of humor is atrocious, while others may agree. All I can say is I enjoyed it for what it is, and didn't try to think of this anime as anything more than it tried to be. It's a comedy anime about killer angels.Overall: 7It's a good OVA. Nothing exceptional, except in terms of comedy. I love to watch deep, intense, emotional anime like Kanon 2006, or Elfen Lied, or Clannad, and so on. However, sometimes I want a break. At times I feel stressed and just want to watch something that isn't so complex or thought-provoking. Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan does the trick.

Well I must say I laughed a lot watching this show.  The premise is that the main character will invent immortality, and women will stop aging at 12 years old.  This doesn't sit well with people in the future so they send an angel of death to kill him before he makes his discovery.The angel is cute and cuddly and has one bad temper.  He is killed in just about every way you can imagine.  Let's just say the blood flies in this anime....But relax she resurrects him and they continue on after he lectures her about her violent ways.

What can I say about this travesty?The story (if you can call it that) is complete garbage. There are no redeeming factors here. Nothing of note happens at all in any of the episodes I saw, and the whole thing is pretty incoherent, aside from the story's main setup. This is also supposed to be a comedy, but instead of jokes, it just throws crazy bullshit in the viewer's face, and creates random situations that make no sense. Expecting the viewer to actually laugh at this is kind of insulting to other well-written comedies and the end result is really one of...the most difficult things to sit through.The characters don't help, either...

Basically there’s this angel from the future named Dokuro trying to assassinate some kid named Sakura who will grow up to commit a bunch of crimes. So Dokuro absolutely obliterates the kid with a metal bat into an explosion of blood probably 50 times an episode, while still reviving him with some kind of magical spell thing. And then beating him to death again and again. Also with some more nonsense happening when Dokuro isn’t beating Sakura with a metal...bat. So yeah the story is complete nonsense but it’s funny nonsense.Art - 6The art and animation honestly isn’t that bad. I mean it looks pretty cute when there’s not blood flying all over the place or some other insane stuff happening. It honestly looked completely fine for 2005. The animation wasn’t smooth but it wasn’t that choppy either. There’s really not much I can say about the art and animation. It’s alright for 2005.Sound - 6The sound for the show was also fine. The opening for this show is pretty iconic and definitely a memorable one. The ending isn’t so iconic but it’s alright and I don’t mind it. I didn’t really notice the background music in this show either. The voice acting was alright and the sound effects were too. Honestly none of the sound in this show is that memorable besides that iconic opening.Character - 5The characters in this show were obviously not that good for a show about doing complete nonsense. Dokuro just did a bunch of crazy stupid stuff and then acted all cute like nothing happened. Sakura was just kind of there for Dokuro to completely destroy. All the other characters were just as crazy making this show stupid but extremely funny.Enjoyment - 5I mean this show is really stupid and complete nonsense but I can’t say I didn’t enjoy it. The show was just a load of entertainment and funny nonsense packed into 4 episodes. Which means the show has constant entertainment being thrown at you to make the 4 episodes all worth it. The whole point of this show was just to do the most nonsensical, insane stuff in 4 episodes and it did deliver. This show is definitely memorable and definitely worth a watch if you just want some entertainment and constant laughter.Overall I wouldn’t recommend it to most actual normal people but if you do have a stupid sense of humour like me you’ll have a blast! bat.

All the other characters were just as crazy making this show stupid but extremely funny.Enjoyment - 5I mean this show is really stupid and complete nonsense but I can’t say I didn’t enjoy it. The show was just a load of entertainment and funny nonsense packed into 4 episodes. Which means the show has constant entertainment being thrown at you to make the 4 episodes all worth it. The whole point of this show was just to do the most nonsensical, insane stuff in 4 episodes and it did deliver. This show is definitely memorable and definitely worth a watch if you just want some entertainment and constant laughter.Overall I wouldn’t recommend it to most actual normal people but if you do have a stupid sense of humour like me you’ll have a blast!', ""So there is a boy and he is murdered a lot by an angel. Think of the brand of comedy started by Love Hina, albeit the male character is legitimately damaged by the over-exaggerated violence.Everybody is mean to Sakura and his only recompense is the occasional glance at the female body. The guy is perverted, but the amount of disrespect he gets for it can make you feel uncomfortable. Well, he actually gets disrespected for no reason the majority of the time as it is, so I have to wonder if his perversion is the only thing in life he is capable of enjoying. I...actually can't be mad at him for enjoying it since nobody respects him when he's acting normal.The only person who cares about him is Shizuki, but she inherits the real bad cliché of being envious of Dokuro, making it clear she likes him. But, I really don't know how she can believe Sakura likes her. Due to, you know, how little Dokuro cares for him.Oh, but really, that's the most depth you will get. Sakura tries to be normal, but everyone is gullible to everything Dokuro tells them. Oh, and Dokuro is so short-tempered that everything Sakura does will result in his untimely demise. She also wants him to do a bunch of things to her pleasure, whether or not he enjoys them. See the the things I said earlier for the aftermath of the coercion.Dokuro's ringtone is the only good thing about this anime. Otherwise, the score would be a zero. actually can't be mad at him for enjoying it since nobody respects him when he's acting normal.The only person who cares about him is Shizuki, but she inherits the real bad cliché of being envious of Dokuro, making it clear she likes him.

Dokuro tortures Sakura with her club with sharp spikes and revives him with her magic. This is terrible. How dare you do this to Sakura!!!! Poor Sakura, he couldn\'t defend himself against the attacks of Dokuro especially other angels who also will give him the worse torture.The art made use of all the goofy styles like angels have horns and the blue haired girl looks mature even though she is 9.The opening theme was pretty catchy.Dokuro shows her love by torturing Sakura is not right. It...is very terrible and cruel. If you can tolerate gore and violence then go watch it by all means otherwise stay away.

Do you enjoy wAcKy characters? If you answered yes to any of those, your standards may be low enough to enjoy Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan.In a sense, Dokuro-chan could be seen as the pure embodiment of how normies perceive Japanese animation. The plot is a complete mess of absurd moments that are mentioned and subsequently dropped with no regard for consistency. The few important details that do persistent are a cacophony of random ideas that just leave you bewildered more than anything else. Characters in this show aren\'t complex, clearly-defined individuals so much as gag machines which produce...endless strings of non sequitur punchlines. Tonal consistency is seemingly a thing of the past, with Dokuro-chan switching between dramatic moments and absurd nonsense with zero self-restraint. Of course, this is all not to mention the wildly erratic animation on display. Shots constantly switch surprisingly good and utter shit, with character expressions and anatomy taking on a jumpy, exaggerated look. Everything about Dokuro-chan is a complete and utter mess; knowing that actual people released this as a commercial product will keep me up at night for years to come.Despite all of these hyper-exaggerated characteristics, there\'s still a chance you might find some enjoyment in this series. If you were the kind of high schooler to find yelling ""penis"" in the library to be peak comedy, the random comedic approach will most likely resonate with you on some level. There\'s a certain appeal to watching the writers throw out whatever ideas they came up with while they were black-out drunk. This style of humor is by no means clever, but it does stimulate your brain just enough to keep you watching the train-wreck unfolding before your eyes. Not all media necessarily has to be traditionally good to have value, and garbage piles such as Dokuro-chan should be applauded for being honest about the crummy, low-brow humor they provide. Just don\'t let your parents catch you watching this; they\'ll have your ass out of the house in no time. endless strings of non sequitur punchlines.

This takes me back to at least a month.Story (4/10):If you ask me there isn\'t really any story here, there is but it\'s all just fanservice, killing, fanservice, serious, fanservice, killing, serious, killing. I think that explained it all. This show is really just for a good laugh. If your humour is very low, you take everything seriously and you hate blood and guts flying around then I suggest you step away from this anime.Art (7/10):It was...decent for me but the animation isn\'t all that good, the graphics aren\'t really appealing but it\'s still digestible.Sound (6/10):Almost the same as the description for art. The sound has fair quality it wont make you cringe.Character (6.5/10):I don\'t want this to be long so I\'ll cut to the chase,The boy has a harem and gets killed 100 times every single episode.The main girl is annoying.There\'s just this one girl that you cant help but sympathize to.The main girl\'s little sister looks older than her.A normal student that is also a girl, gets jealous of the other girls but just shrugs it off.And other supporting characters that doesn\'t care about a psychopath transfer student (main girl).With that being said the characters in this series has lots of deres but doesn\'t take it to the extremes. Also, I didn\'t hate any character they\'re forgiveable.Enjoyment (6/10):You know that saying that you enjoy things that are stupid?

Instead of a quaint love story is a violent yandere with a spiked bat who repeatedly murders the MC for no good reason. She ruins his life both literally and metaphorically. This joke is funny if you can stomach gore, enjoy absurdist humor and find some delight in watching the complete opposite of a generic fantasy rom com. This joke is unbearable if you don\'t find the above entertaining - which explains the relatively poor score from the MAL...community.Titular character Dokuro is both the greatest and worst character. The anime is only ever interesting when she\'s involved but for all the wrong reasons, as she has a penchant for causing mass destruction and killing her love interest Sakura after feeling offended or embarrassed. If you find her character cute this can be chalked up to lovable madness.This is one of the few anime best experienced in English, largely thanks to the tandem of Johnny Yong Bosch and Wendee Lee who do a fantastic job of selling the parodic, self aware nature of the comedy. It shouldn\'t surprise anyone that the director of this anime later went on to produce Another and Blood-C - two of the most visually disturbing anime in recent memory. Dokuro-chan goes full force with its gore showing chunks of flesh, flying eyeballs, water fountain blood loss, strangled necks, limbs bending in ways not intended...you name it, you will find it here.Adding to the weird nature of this show is an unbelievably catchy opening theme that will never escape your mind (PiPiruPiruPiruPiPiruPi~). Of course, it is violent with Dokura committing twelve different acts of torture ranging from stabbing to dripping hot candle wax all while grinning in joy.Facial expressions are the strongest aspect of this anime\'s art design. The jokes are sold at times entirely by how goofy a face a character will make, going so far as to even show nose hairs protruding from a face. You\'d be hard pressed to find an anime with more bizarre reaction faces.Dokuro-chan is, above all, a self aware comedy that fully understands it\'s stupidity. One of the greatest qualities a parody can have is the ability to laugh at its own idiocy, and this show does it spades.

Basic plot, basic characters, and a short length. Not necessarily a bad thing.The story revolves around the titular Dokuro-chan, an angel sent from the future to keep watch over the main character, Sakura, to try and prevent him from developing a device that stops women from having aging effects beyond 12, on account of the fact that in the future Sakura's going to become a nonce, and so Dokuro spends her time making sure to annoy Sakura and make him give her attention so he cannot spend any time developing the aforementioned device.The show...has no limitations when it comes to its usage of slapstick comedy. Dokuro is armed with the 'Excalibolg', a magical black bat with spikes that causes anything it hits to explode into a bloody mess, and as a result it looks bloodier than a Tarantino film at any given time. While this humour is rather juvenile, it did catch me off guard a few times, and was a good laugh when it did, albeit humour is ultimately subjective. There are times when the story eventually does branch out involving other characters, but they aren't greatly important, with Sakura and Dokuro always being the main focus. The finale does differ quite a bit from every episode that preceded it, and while it wasn't bad, I believe it should have mirrored the rest of the show and just been something reflective, but I can appreciate that they wished to create a conclusive (or as conclusive as it can get for an 8 episode anime) ending.As far as parodies go, I'd say Dokuro-Chan's one of the better ones, not too bloated with references as is sometimes the case, and on the whole I rather dislike mahou shoujo, yet I was able to enjoy this, so it's pretty good innit. has no limitations when it comes to its usage of slapstick comedy.

The thing is, someone else with a different sense of humor may find it to be hilarious precisely because of the aspects you don\'t like.I found Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan to be pretty hilarious. The humor is juvenile,...nonsensical, incredibly stupid, and somewhat repetitive but that\'s a big part of why I enjoyed it as much as I did. There really isn\'t much story to speak of other than the fact that it involves a spineless MC and the cute girl with supernatural powers (an angel in this case) who has moved in with him. This is a formula that has been done a thousand times before and since in a lot of ecchi-harem trash anime. If you care about this anime having a story, don\'t watch it. It\'s that simple.The characters are as stupid and random as the show itself, but again, that\'s what makes it funny for those of us who like it. Dokuro is a cheerful, occasionally ditzy girl who wields a deadly spiked bat and the MC is basically her bitch. This show never takes itself seriously and doesn\'t try to be witty or clever with its jokes in the slightest. At any moment, Dokuro can bludgeon the MC with her spiked bat and there will be cartoon blood and guts flying everywhere or an angel could lose their halo and get diarrhea. That\'s the kind of stupid, bizarre, and immature humor you can expect from this show.Regarding the art, it feels very cheap and of low quality, but that may actually better suit the show\'s tone than actual high quality art would. It kind of reminds me of how the low quality art in Kill Me Baby, another stupid and random anime I like, actually adds to the stupidity and randomness more than higher quality art would. I don\'t have much to say about the sound track, but I liked the opening theme and I liked Dokuro-chan\'s voice.I\'m a grown-ass adult who still enjoys poop jokes, so this anime is clearly for me. However, I can\'t really recommend it for everyone as it depends on your sense of humor. Definitely DON\'T watch for story, character development, or if you expect the jokes to have some kind of wittiness or cleverness.

It's just HORRIBLE. The story just don't make any sense, at least for me. Noobo characters. Art made in paint, just it. Sound made in China. IT'S JUST A HORRIBLE THING!!!!1!! why did it received a sequel '-' There are many good animes that don't get even finished. Bruh.Overall, it's really bad. If they just deleted this anime and started another one, it would be better.If you want to watch it, go on! You can like this type of anime. It isn't my style. I luv harem and ecchi but... that anime's really bad. "", ""Warning possible SpoilersHaving watched this not too long ago I thought this was a stupid, but funny in some way anime so I decided to re-watch it and now I believe it is an incredibly awful anime, sure some people like this however I am not one of them.Story (2/10)Now the story concentrates on Sakura Kusakabe a normal high schooler and Dokuro Mitsukai an Angel who has been sent from the future to stop Sakura from making a device that can make women stay at the age of 12.Now the big major issue with the story is that it doesn't go anywhere I mean even...when the situation changes during the final episode it's outcome makes all of the changes mean nothing because literally all this show is, is Sakura getting killed or messed up by Dokuro which makes his school mates avoid or even hurt him when he didn't do anything wrong and this is exactly what each episode does it doesn't even try to change the formula of whats going on which is why the story sucks ass.Characters (2/10)If you thought the story was bad then oh boy the characters are just as bad because the chemistry between Sakura and Dokuro is horrible as it is a forced relationship that Sakura didn't want even though Dokuro throws herself onto him whenever the opportunity arises yet she kills and resurrects him when he either accidentally annoys her or sees her nude which the last seems understandable, but the point is there is no reason to support these two characters at all.There is also other characters like Shizuki who is Sakura's schoolmate and the only person who doesn't turn on him when things turn south and there is also Sabato another angel who is tasked to kill Sakura, but these two really don't help out at all especially Sabato who only turns up a few times throughout the show.The only character who actually made some kind of impact was Dokuro's younger sister Zakuro who turns up during the final episode, but her involvement actually made the show a little tolerable especially with her badass yet cute nature.Art (8/10)The only credit I can give this show is the good artstyle now that doesn't mean the characters design was great it was mainly the interesting ways Sakura dies along with the fact that some schoolmates get turned into animals and I thought it was pretty funny that they used picture cutout's of actual animals instead of actually making a design for them.Sound (1/10)All I can say about the op is that it is horrible definitely the worst op I have ever heard since I started watching anime seriously the first time I heard the op I felt like I had lost so many brain cells and couldn't do anything other than watch the show, God why did something as vile as this exist.Extra's:The comedy was really bland because I was looking at my phone during some scenes that's how bad it is to watch sometimes plus the Ecchi didn't help either although it really wasn't that bad since it never really went that far.Enjoyment (2/10)Overall this was a terrible short OVA and it has been a while since I have seen something this bad so if you're ever thinking about watching it then don't because you'll regret it afterwards. when the situation changes

It's good because of how insane the anime was and my dumbass 9 year old brain can contain...the weird amount of faced paced slapstick humor it had, similarly equivalent like most western adult cartoons like Family guy for example.Actual reviews(may contain spoliers):The plot was about a 2nd year high school boy named Sakura that his life was terrorized by an angel whereas he get mashed by her bat and then get resurrected again just to get bludgeoned all over again. Sakura just complained for a bit because in the future he would commit a very horrible crime and that angel did that to him in order to prevent himStory: Never thought as kid there would be an actual plot but because it only lasted in the first season i gave it a mediocre 5Art: the art and the animation was good especially in the opening.

The plot is really stupid, I mean... come on, but hey, It's an ecchi anime, what'd you expect? It's a show that It's not meant to be taken seriously at all, It's just something you watch only to laugh your ribcage out.

HAHA! I've never laughed so hard in ANY anime or manga and I've watched my fair share of them. It's so random but outrageously fun and hilarious, you'll end up wanting to watch more!

Beautiful, uninterrupted satire, from beginning to end.The show has all of the flaws that anime in the mid-2000\'s had : Predictable sekai characters, nonsensical storylines, tiresome ecchi humour and magical girl powers galore. It\'s also an OVA, meaning it\'s very short. But that\'s the point - it\'s a short-lived parody of everything that there is to hate in anime. It manages to take all of those tired and worn out tropes and STILL make something that\'s entertaining and unexpected, because it knows exactly what it is, and as such, isn\'t afraid of turning off hardcore weebs for the sake of making...the rest of us laugh.Story : There is none. Well I mean, there is, but it really doesn\'t matter. Hell, the show itself throws it out the window fast enough.Art : It\'s clear the authors had a lot of fun while animating this and it feels great : There\'s quite a lot of unexpected visual choices that end up working very well, almost as if some of the animators used this show as a sketchbook while they weren\'t working on more serious things. This is especially the case in the second part of the show, where the art direction starts going all over the place.Soundtrack : I personally have a few songs from the soundtrack burned into my memory, especially the main theme, but it\'s certainly no Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo.Characters :  I really like the dynamic between the two main characters. It\'s reminiscent of Urusei Yatsura (Which is actually referenced in the show), but the protagonist in Dokuro-Chan is nowhere near as dumb as Ataru. The choices he makes are surprisingly good-natured and logical, the real trouble comes from Dokuro-chan herself. She always unconsciously sets up deliciously unfair circumstances due to her sheer stupidity that end up causing him a lot of pain, let it be physical, emotional, or even psychological. The other characters take tired anime tropes even further and I\'d have to write an entire paragraph about them to explain why I believe them to be so perfect.Enjoyment : It\'s thoroughly enjoyable, there isn\'t a single moment in Dokuro-chan that\'s meant to be taken seriously. Not everybody will find it as funny as I did, but as far as satire goes, this one puts quite a lot of effort into it\'s hidden overhanging layer of irony. Every single scene makes fun of something specific and manages to turn out great without even telling it\'s audience that it is, in fact, all just a big dumb joke. The humor is served to you in it\'s most raw state, it\'s up to you to make the connections and think ""Oh, God damn it."" and start enjoying that honest laughter that only self-aware cringe can provide.Overall : Dokuro-Chan has always been one of my favorite shows, and I don\'t think that will ever change. I\'m generally not a fan of parody anime but Dokuro-Chan is so casual and sneaky about what it attempts to do that it feels perfect to me. But then again that aspect also makes it a very hit-or-miss show. You either get it and love it, or it doesn\'t connect with you and you hate it.Each episode contains two mini-episodes that last 10 minutes.

Sure, that theme may sound and look appeasing but is it? When you factor in ecchi you like another anime show must consider the remaining context.

It feels like the writers pulled random unfunny scenarios from behind their backs and filling in the blanks with stale jokes and called it a day. A tip for this anime, you can't have toilet humor and ecchi this closely laced together, the former will always cancel out the latter in terms of effectiveness. Also toilet humor is for infants.The premise is silly but that's not an issue for me.The whole thing just feels like they do random stuff sometimes while...Sakura is constantly nagging Dokuro about not beating him to death everyday.I can tell it's just random manga moments being thrown in instead of any sort of flow or continuity connecting these events. I would be fine with this normally, but it just comes off as completely disjointed.All of the characters are either wet blankets or really annoying. Especially Dokuro. In terms of waifus, I'm not quite sure why anyone would find her desirable despite her being the main girl. She's like a really annoying version of Amy Rose.But wait! (Side rant because this has confused me for some time) she can't even be your waifu because she's loli bait!

Wouldn't in the anime's standards being attracted to her make the viewer a total weirdo? What about the ecchi? Who is this even made for?Idk and it doesn't actually matter to me on account this is clearly the writers just making up stuff for the show to work, I'm not sure they even cared about the non-existent demographic.On the plus side, the opening is a banger.

For some it is a terrible comedy with terrible productive values, but for me it is one of the funniest absurd comedies I have ever seen in my life, I can see it 1 million times and die laughing as if it were the first time I saw this anime.I love satires and in this anime mahou shoujo (one of my favorite genres) is satirized in a great way. Pipirupipirupi best line ever.Art and sound:The production values are pretty shitty, the animation has many objectionable aspects and it looks very outdated for its time (reminiscent of animes more from the late 90s / early 2000s).The music is also bad, I do not remember a single song from the ost and the opening is brilliantly bad.Character:The characters work very well, even the secondary ones manage to stand out very well, it is true that most of the characters are archetypal but precisely with the intention of satirizing these archetypes.You will not find very complex characters, much less a development, all the characters are very one-dimensional, but that is precisely why they work so well.Enjoyment (20/10):As I said before, this anime has been for me one of the most entertaining that I have seen in my life and to this day, after having seen it repeatedly, I still enjoy it.I always liked mindless comedies, the more absurd the better for me. For some, watching this anime may be insufferable but for me it is a pleasure.Overall (6/10):Dokuro chan is a very particular and unique anime, you can love it or hate it that will depend a lot on your tastes (many know that I like to be as objective as possible but in this particular case it is impossible for me).I recommend that you go see the first episode and draw your conclusions from there.I warn you that you will see one of the strangest anime out there (there is a lot of gore and echii so remember not to see this with children).With nothing more to say I say goodbye for today, I am really happy to have the time to make reviews again, I hope you are too :) does not take seriously for a moment making this a more absurd comedy than ""flcl"" and ""excel saga"" merged and multiplied by 727.This is why everyone\'s relationship with this anime is love / hate.

Pipirupipirupi best line ever.Art and sound:The production values are pretty shitty, the animation has many objectionable aspects and it looks very outdated for its time (reminiscent of animes more from the late 90s / early 2000s).The music is also bad, I do not remember a single song from the ost and the opening is brilliantly bad.Character:The characters work very well, even the secondary ones manage to stand out very well, it is true that most of the characters are archetypal but precisely with the intention of satirizing these archetypes.You will not find very complex characters, much less a development, all the characters are very one-dimensional, but that is precisely why they work so well.Enjoyment (20/10):As I said before, this anime has been for me one of the most entertaining that I have seen in my life and to this day, after having seen it repeatedly, I still enjoy it.I always liked mindless comedies, the more absurd the better for me.

It only matters in the last chapter. But is comprehensible because the main goal of the series is to be funny.ART (7/10)The art style is a pretty common one but is cute. The color palette is pretty boring at most times. There are a few characters whose designs are worth remembering. The animation is dynamic and funny. Also, sometimes they like to experiment with real photos and different art styles to make some gags.SOUND (7/10)The OST is kind of average but the...OP is catchy, funny, and memorable.CHARACTERS (6/10)The male lead is pretty boring, the female one is the only one who is relevant and funny. There aren't many characters that shine.ENJOYMENT (9/10)Even though some aspects of the series could be better, the comedic aspect is great. It's mainly based on how ridiculous some moments can be and it works.OVERALL  (7/10)Because it's shortness it's kind of worth watching. It makes some great laughs.

But people may argue ""the plot was shit"" yeah that\'s because the Anime was unfinished and never got a proper ending. Anime\'s that are meant to be comedy usually don\'t have as much focus for plot either like the anime Senyuu which has no plot until late season 2, Dokuro Chan still had some plot to it too. The fact that people are judging this as...thought it was a serious anime like a Drama or Romance is just wrong, this isn\'t meant to be romance at all, or anything close to romance. hence why I think Bokatsu Tenshi Dokuro chan doesn\'t deserve all the shit it gets and is actually better than most comedy Animes. thought it was a serious anime like a Drama or Romance is just wrong, this isn\'t meant to be romance at all, or anything close to romance. hence why I think Bokatsu Tenshi Dokuro chan doesn\'t deserve all the shit it gets and is actually better than most comedy Animes.', 'So last night I found Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan on youtube in its entirety so I thought I’d give it a watch. 90 mins later and I wanted to pull my hair out. Here’s whyPlotSo are anime here takes place in a seemingly normal slice of life Japan and our “Hero” Sakura walks in on our main “Heroine” Dokuro-chan and she has a towel round her body as she is getting changed and disgustid by this Dokuro does is turn his head into mince meat then brings him immediately back to life. 😒And that pretty some’s up the show. Well no there’s another angel Sabato who...is sent from the future to assassinate Sakura as he will be responsible for creating a world were all Women stop ageing at the age of 12 thus creating a Pedophile’s World 😔. Can you the shit were working with here. My God and its the same every god dam episode Sakura does something perceived as perverted by Dokuro-chan she kills him brings him back to life and Sabato attempts to kill Sakura. Rinse Repeat. Mind numbing every time.CharactersWell I think it’s safe to say that the characters are not horrid but just annoying in every single troupe you can think of. There either wining, or being over the top but it goes so far its just unbearable. Case in point Dokuro-chan her self she’s loud, crude, obnoxious, thick as a plank of wood and for the most part just so unlikable in any way at all that by the time you get to the final episode and the show tries to go serious for a bit you just don’t care as you just saw Dokuro rip Sakura’s skull in half.Also Sakura himself you would think he’d be more the straight man to Dokuro-chan’s insanity but no he just as unlikable as he just takes Dokuro’s abuse like a bitch and he doesn’t have one back bone in his body. He wines on about being killed for no reason but each time he just accepts it. I know its a comedy anime but that just really urks me. Speaking of “Comedy”HumourI could ignore how Bad the plot is and the annoying characters if there is at least some humour in the show but unsurprisingly the show fails at that too. You can see watching it there going for Excel Saga type of humour but they go so far over the top its just not funny. Most of the humour comes from Sakura being turned into Salami slices by Dokuro which just gets tedious and boring as each episode goes on and the gore is so over the top at times it would look more in place in a horror film not a comedy.AnimationIf I had one good thing to say about the anime it would be the animation is ok. The animation was done by Studio Hal Film Maker who are also know for Princess Tutu and for Dokuro-chan they have done a ok job and I would give it a pass.SoundLets start with the shows opening which is nothing really to write about its just so so like the rest of the music in the show which is just generic music you would hear in any other slice of life comedy anime.Now I watched the show in English and it’s one of the most grating and annoying dubs i have have ever herd and its such a shame because I’m a big fan of Wendee Lee and Johnny Yong Bosch but and I can’t blame them too much as they had to work with what they had but they don’t make it better but I put more of the blame at the show itself than the dub cast.SummarySo to sum up Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan is one of the worst anime I have ever seen which takes a lot for me to consider something to be bad but Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan made it too easy. If you like over the top violence you may get a chuckle out of this and may like a bit more than me but for everyone else stay away from this for your own sanity. is sent from the future to assassinate Sakura as he will be responsible for creating a world were all Women stop ageing at the age of 12 thus creating a Pedophile’s World 😔.

This is supposed to be a parody of your typical high school slice of life/romance anime with a side of magical gals (at least I think?) but because of this the entire production hinges on the comedy. The story is nothing remarkable and minimal plot progression exists over the span of 4 episodes. The occasional quick breaking of character was about the only enjoyment I got out of this, but I found the ""comedy"" to be very poor.Art (5/10)The art and animation are pretty...average and what you\'d expect from a 2005 anime, nothing outstanding or notable, but appropriate for a parody of the genre.Sound (4/10)The sound design was alright, same for the OST.

Unfortunately, that\'s not me.Thanks for reading!', 'Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-Chan (Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-Chan) is a series that I\'m surprised to see it only has 6 episodes in the entire series and it was a very nonsensical but enjoyable series.Story: 7/10The anime revolves around a young, 13 year old boy named Sakura-kun who lives with an angel named Dokuro-Chan. The issue with this is that he is constantly getting killed and resurrected by Dokuro-Chan when he does something she doesn\'t like. The anime just shows various scenes that are loosely related to each other, much like any other slice-of-life anime. There\'s some plot in, like, 2 episodes, but that\'s about it....Art: 6/10The art is fairly decent, although not my favorite. I don\'t have so much of a negative opinion about the artstyle, only that I don\'t like the fact that Dokuro-Chan is a bit too developed for her age (12) and her younger sister looks like in her late teens/early twenties when she\'s 9. I also didn\'t like the use of fanservice with Dokuro-Chan because, of course, her age.Sound: 7/10The OP is one of the most catchiest songs I have heard in anime, having Dokuro-Chan singing about how she\'s an angel and how she\'ll brutally torture you in various ways, but all in the name of love. The VA was alright, in my case I heard it through the English Dub and it was alright.Characters: 7/10The characters are pretty basic, despite some of them being angels. Sakura-kun is a 13 year old who is trying to survive Dokuro-Chan\'s attacks (Her existence in the series is explained in one episode) while trying to earn the affection of his classmate Shizuki. Dokuro-Chan is an angel who is sent to assassinate Sakura-kun but fails to do so since she fell in love with him, and instead tries to spend time with him as much as she can, all while being able to magically change anyone at her will. Sabato is another angel out to kill Saukra-kun, but is usually defeated in some way and tends to live very poor. Zansu is another angel that went along with Dokuro-Chan to save Sakura-kun, but he tends to be very perverse. Zakuro is Dokuro-Chan\'s younger sister who looks older and has a lerger bust than Dokuro-Chan, she tends to be kind and speaks very formal with everyone. Finally, there is Shizuki, Sakura-kun\'s childhood friend and classmate, who tends to see Sakura-kun as a good person, and she tends to display a bit of a crush on him. Besides those characters, all the others aren\'t noteworthy.Enjoyment: 8/10For a 6 episode series, I enjoyed it very much, considering that it was mainly filled with slapstick-humor. That is in the form of nonsensical violence and gore. The characters fairly had a good dynamic with each other that made me chuckle, laugh and smile, and I did enjoy the series considerably well. I did feel bad for Sakura-kun, since he was always at the blunt end of the class\' hatred towards him and Dokuro-Chan\'s abuse to him.Overall: 7/10While this isn\'t the greatest series ever made, it was a fairly good, short series that I liked very much. The only thing unique of this series was the use of angels instead of a ""magical girl"" or ""alien girl"", but it was fairly bland for a series. I\'d only recommend this if you want a short series you can finish in a few hours or you want something silly to watch. Art: 6/10The art is fairly decent, although not my favorite.

The ending had me smiling, a few moments made me sad, and most if not all the episodes made me laugh my ass off. The title itself literally means Club-to-Death Angel. Yeah, whenever the boy does something to piss Dokuro-chan off, she...kills him in bloody, violent ways, and then just brings him back to life again because shes an angel and has that ability.

I can't wait to begin watching Dokuro-chan 2 cause I'm sure it's going to be just as epic as this original series is!"", ""This is going to be a weird show for me to review, because I'm going to contradict my usual self a lot here. The good things about Dokuro-chan is its comedic writting. It's not really good or anything particurally original by any means, but its SO chaotic its entertaining. Every episode goes from one end of the comedy spectrum to the other over the course of 30 mins, along the way stringing such things like sexual tension between Dokuro and Sakura (...its odd lets just say), weird word phrasings that become disastorous, and blood. Lots and lots and lots of blood. Dokuro has a giant...mace that basically bludgeons Sakura anytime he does something wrong (which is very often). Its this controlled chaos of the show that manages it to be entertaining.When I say this is entertaining, that doesn't necessarily mean good. One episode is basically a sugar rush, right afterwards you completely forget about what you just saw or anyting relating to it. Also, even though the comedy is very chaotic and acclectic, a lot of the individual jokes are hit or miss. Most of the funny stuff involves the obscene amounts of blood, but other times, things like Sakura's weird way of phrasing the word paint (watch episode 4 and read the translator's notes) seem a little out of place in all that has happened before.In short, Dokuro-Chan at its core is nothing but quack entertainment. This can be both a good and a bad thing, because even though it is really entertaining when you watch it, on reflection, its almost miniscule. Just as long as you are not expecting a particurally original or well written comedy, you should at least moderately enjoy this. mace that basically bludgeons Sakura anytime he does something wrong (which is very often).

I will admit, I did find a bit funny at first because of how over-the-top it was.However, the more Sakura...gets abused, the less funny I find it, because when you get down to it, it's just a 13 year old kid getting brutally murdered over and over again, which isn't very funny as of itself. I think the main problem is that he never actually does anything to deserve this kind of punishment. He seems like a relatively nice kid, and yet the universe seems to conspire against him for something he hasn't even done yet, and nobody ever seems to feel sorry for him. The effects of this are also only downplayed in retrospect. When he's getting abused, they will often do too good of a job showing his pain. In one episode he even cries and begs for mercy as Dokuro gives him no such thing. Pain is an important part of comedy, but if a character is in too much pain too often, it quickly becomes jarring. The reason it worked the first was because Sakura only ended up being annoyed despite how much pain he had obviously gone through, but it just goes downhill from there. When he actually breaks down and acknowledges how horrible it is to die over and over again, it just stops being funny to me.And if you don't find these deaths funny, then this series frankly doesn't have much else to offer. The characters are mostly very bland. The titular character Dokuro is clearly meant to be very ironic in how she acts cute and naive despite being a killing machine, but the sheer cruelty of her actions ends up making her unlikable. After killing Sakura, she'll either be apologetic, as if she just didn't know better, or actually seem amused, and she constantly switches between these two modes. As for Sakura, aside from being a likable butt monkey, he doesn't have much going for him, except for an obligatory romantic sub-plot. His crush, Shizuki, may be the only legitimately likable character (aside from maybe Sakura), but she's not very interesting.Aside from the over the top kills, the series is visually unimpressive, with some very boring designs (Sakura's design possibly being the blandest of them all.) The characters also get very deformed when they get excited, to the point where they're not even recognizable anymore. I don't have anything against the characters getting deformed, but with how exaggerated it is and how often they do it, I find that it loses its effect. I think One Punch Man is a good example of this being done right. The main character Saitama often gets a lot more detailed when he gets excited, which makes suddenly seem much more intense despite the simplicity of his basic design, but even then he's still recognizable, and the anime knows when to do it.As for the story, there barely is one, and the little context we get for the series actually just makes it even more insulting as we find out Dokuro is staying with Sakura because she was sent to kill him because of something he's going to do in the future, but wants to fix the problem without killing him, yet she's constantly killing him. And no, they don't make a joke about how ironic that is. There's also this strange implication that Sakura is going to grow up to be a pedophile, which seems to be the root of the conflict, and his classmates even calls him a pedophile for hanging out with a little old girl... despite the fact that he himself is roughly the same age at this time. It's just such a strange implication and it's not properly explained, at least not when the idea is introduced.The sound design is alright, though. I... just said all there was to say about it.It's hard for me to even understand who this series was made for. It's way too crude and childish for adults, yet it's also way too graphic for kids. I know Japan tolerates violence in kids shows more, but this is REALLY graphic. There's also the issue of very uncomfortable fanservice. They may have drawn Dokuro with big breasts, but she's still essentially a little girl, and the way they show her off is very off-putting.So... if you're into VERY over-the-top humor and violence, you may enjoy it, but otherwise I don't really see the appeal of this anime. I know I've only seen half of it, and it's not very long, but I can't see myself continuing it. gets abused, the less funny I find it, because when you get down to it, it's just a 13 year old kid getting brutally murdered over and over again, which isn't very funny as of itself.

They may have drawn Dokuro with big breasts, but she's still essentially a little girl, and the way they show her off is very off-putting.So... if you're into VERY over-the-top humor and violence, you may enjoy it, but otherwise I don't really see the appeal of this anime. I know I've only seen half of it, and it's not very long, but I can't see myself continuing it."", ""Well It's hard to explain. This is what you might end up if you put Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, and Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni in a blender. There really is no plot because this is another one of those anime that are nonsense. It's just the adventures of a boy and a club wielding angel that follows him (and occasionally kills him) around. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It's kind of enjoyable if you are into anime with little to no plot. "", 'So this is my third review.Story (1)The story wasn\'t good because an angel that beats up a guy for no good reason is bad.Art (2)The art is horrible. I hated the animation in both seasons, and this just makes this go further.Sound (1)The voice acting and sound are bad. The opening is crap, nothing is good about this anime! I really think the creator was on drugs or something. And that ""sakura-kun"" is horrible....Character (3)The characters are annoying. A boy named Sakura, really? Dokuro is stupid, Sabato is on drugs, *facepalm* sigh, the guy with the shades is creepy but the brown haired girl and zokuro are the only two that I like.Enjoyment (1)This anime is really unwatchable.Overall (1)The whole anime was crap because it was all crack and drugs. And Dokuro smokes? But she is thirteen, I kid you not!That\'s the end of my review! Character (3)The characters are annoying. A boy named Sakura, really?

The stories mostly revolved around the MC getting killed for no reason by a overly violent angel. It was supposed to be a comedy but i didn't find any parts that were funny. the artwork was good voice, music and sounds were good. but the characters were so badly retarded that i couldn't really enjoy this. So in part if you're into violence for no apparent reason in your anime then this should be a winner. As for me slap-stick death scenes get really boring after the first or second one. "", 'If you want to watch this anime, ask yourself the following question: ""do I like shitpost?"" If so, I recommend you watch this anime, if not, skip it.This is an anime with a simple, funny and perverse story. I believe that many saw excerpts of it on YouTube and were curious, due to the violence and the hechi (which in reality is much lighter than it seems). I was one of these people and I\'m happy to have finally watched it. It\'s not something I regret, it\'s a series of handjobs, if we can say so, 4 simple handjobs.An addendum is that as much as...this anime is hated by many, it is almost undeniable that Dokuro chan and his magic club are not iconic in the least. this anime is hated by many, it is almost undeniable that Dokuro chan and his magic club are not iconic in the least.', ""This show is cute but horrifying at the same time. Dokuro tries to prevent our main character from dying at the hands of other angels by killing him herself, then reviving him afterwards. The reason angels are trying to kill him is because in the future he creates something that stops people from aging, which angered the afterlife, seeing as nobody can die.The the anime is bland, but the premise is interesting and I hope they revive it in the future. My personal favorite character is Dokuro because of the ironic humor I get from her whole dynamic with the main character.This next...part might reach into fan-fic territory, but here we go. What if there was an episode where the main character had to be snuck into somewhere, so Dokuro bludgeoned him and stuffed his remains in a jar, so she can get him in.

With its mix of violent slapstick comedy and gratuitous fan service, it certainly isn't for everyone. While some viewers may find its over-the-top nature amusing, others might find it off-putting and excessive. Ultimately, it falls somewhere in the middle, earning a solid but average rating of 6/10.One of the main selling points of Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan is its absurd premise. The story revolves around Sakura Kusakabe, a regular high school boy who is visited by Dokuro Mitsukai,...an angel from the future. Dokuro's mission is to prevent Sakura from developing immortality technology, and to do so, she constantly bludgeons him with her magical spiked bat. The concept of a cute angel mercilessly attacking the protagonist sounds like a recipe for comedic gold, but the execution isn't always consistent.The humor in Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan heavily relies on shock value and exaggerated violence. The series is known for its over-the-top gore, with copious amounts of blood splattering across the screen. It aims to shock and surprise the audience with its grotesque and macabre imagery, often juxtaposed with the characters' innocent appearances. While this can be hilarious in small doses, it becomes repetitive and loses its impact as the series progresses.In terms of characters, Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan doesn't offer much depth. Sakura is the typical clueless and hapless male protagonist, while Dokuro is the hyperactive and violent angel with a crush on Sakura. Their interactions are mostly centered around Dokuro's violent tendencies and Sakura's futile attempts to evade her attacks. The supporting cast is equally one-dimensional, serving as little more than comedic devices or fanservice providers.However, the animation and art style are commendable. The character designs are cute and appealing, capturing the essence of the comedy and fan service elements. The vibrant color palette adds to the overall energy of the series, enhancing its comedic moments. The animation quality itself is decent, although it is nothing extraordinary.Ultimately, Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan is a guilty pleasure for a specific niche audience. If you enjoy crude humor, absurd situations, and don't mind excessive violence mixed with fan service, you might find some enjoyment in this series. However, for those seeking a more substantial plot or well-developed characters, this anime falls short. With its limited appeal and repetitive nature, it's a series that can be entertaining in small doses but is unlikely to leave a lasting impression.Overall, Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan receives a modest rating of 6/10. It's a divisive series that won't be to everyone's taste, but it has its moments of comedic charm if you can embrace its over-the-top nature. an angel from the future.

I also really like the fact that this anime is straight to the point with each episode and not very long of a series with the usual season being 12 episodes this series cuts it by half!

Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-Chan is the absolute form of absurdist comedy, the very concept boiled down to its distilled essence, discarding of any barriers to its multitude of oddities, like plot or pacing. The story is essentially nonexistent, and is more just the execution of an utterly bizarre concept. Furthermore, for lack of how else to categorize the coming descriptions, it is the strongest aspect of the anime as well. The premise is simple, yet anything but- an angel has come back in time from the future to protect the main character from other future angels which would seek to kill...him for his future research into what can only be termed lolification technology. Though, this angel which is supposedly on his side has a habit of murdering him in a variety of ultra-violent ways, only to resurrect him immediately after her various outbursts. The execution is decidedly episodic, though there is some carryover from episode to episode. This gives the anime a frantic, high-energy vibe that one would expect from a short comedy series like this one. But it is the comedy itself that makes the story shine- it is absurd, with comedic timing, physical comedy, and situational conditions which are so utterly unique to this show in particular that they are a transcendent example of the genre done right. Animation and expectations are simultaneously subverted in order to keep the viewer constantly on the edge of their seat, bracing for the next insane development. The use of real photographs, timing and delivery of jokes, over-the-top situations, and a flagrant disregard for suspension of disbelief make for some of the funniest moments in anime, period. Unfortunately, they are moments, and remain moments instead of linking together into a cohesive whole. They are separated from each other by lakes of bog-standard, formulaic slapstick or uninspired ecchi tropes. These things aren't bad when they're executed well, but the show is constantly trying to make you laugh, and in the moments where it fails its really noticeable. Regardless, the math still comes out positive for the story, as the unbounded, experimental nature of the comedy pays off in a big way when it does pay off. The art is quite good, certainly better than your typical mid-2000s anime, with character designs and gag moments of such detail and complexity that they really catch you off-guard, adding to the comedic element. Though, I feel they put so much into the scenes of Sakura getting absolutely eviscerated that other scenes where there's nothing batshit going on feel bland, and almost rushed by comparison. My favorite part of the art by a mile is the use of real photographs for comedic effect, but especially the inclusion of the random White guy in the sequel OVA. The sound is good, with unsettlingly visceral attention paid to details like Sakura's bones shattering to bits, or his brains washing down the drain. The soundtrack backs all of this up, amounting to an acid trip nightmare dreamscape version of your average mid-2000s slice of life ost. The characters are perfect for the world they inhabit- which is to say, they are either victims of, or avatars for, the director's fundamentally insane and brutally comedic will. Overall, Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan is a random and unhinged aburdist comedy anime which has the seeds of greatness scattered throughout, but just misses the mark one too many times to truly earn that title.

He is very known at his school for being a pervert, and many dislike him.Basically They waste your time with Pointless half Hentai Crap for the first 6 episodes. Episode 1, you get the real point of the show and the direction it should be heading into. Then you hit episode 2, and you have a Pervert who has this strange ability to regain his power through getting aroused.On top of that through the rest of 3-6 they keep throwing Hentai-Like events at you, and slowly introducing...characters, something i felt they could have easily done and gotten over with in 2 episodes, and made the show 3x better.If you manage to get through the first 6 episodes of crap. your actually in for a treat, this show turns into gold.

I would have given the first section a 3, and the second section a 9.5So if you can sit through the first half, you should notice the quality increase in the second half.If you\'re watching the show for the Highschool DxD like presence, or just the Hardcore Ecchi, the entire thing provides that greatly, and this is exactly what your here for.FEEDBACK: I would definitely appreciate feedback; it would help me to become a better writer.#AnimeX characters, something i felt they could have easily done and gotten over with in 2 episodes, and made the show 3x better.If you manage to get through the first 6 episodes of crap. your actually in for a treat, this show turns into gold.

So, I Can\'t Play H (also known Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai) is a series about a group of breasts with a perverted protagonist who makes the deal of his short life with a beautiful Shinigami, or in English terms, a grim reaper during a wet and rainy night.~ The DealOr maybe known as the story. Well, the overall tone of the story is predictable and filled with...common cliché, gags, and fan-service. The young boy Ryosuke Kaga (also better well known as Ero-suke, which in my opinion is the better name that suits him considering his nature) plays the main role of the protagonist. He is a perverted at some degrees but at the same time surprisingly funny to watch for his charms and will to protect the girls, or in his words “girls are to be treasured”. He is sort of the middleman compared to other perverted protagonists of the common gag in today\'s anime industries. For one thing, yes..Ero-suke is perverted but at the same time has a heart of gold, especially towards the shinigami he made a deal with.Surprisingly though, there is an actual plot to this series. Can you believe it? An actual plot for an ecchi series! Well, foremost, there are tentacle like beings in the beginning that seems to come after the duo like pouring rice. Later on though, a more direct plot seems to develop and mysteries fill the void.~ Goddess and the ServantOne of the main focus of the series is the interactions, relationship, and bond between main protagonists Ryosuke/Ero-suke and Shinigami Lisara Restall. With her deep scarlet hair and eyes, she is seen as a beautiful goddess of death. It is seems at first glance that she just wants to use Ryosuke for her own purposes. Later on though, we see that she does in fact cares for her dear servant, showing tendencies of care and even jealousy. Oh boy, my tsundere sense is tangling.~ Others of the Daily LifeOf course, there are other characters that drives the series. We have the childhood friend who has boobs that evokes the jealousy of the other female cast. We have the Shinigami rival against Lisara who lately have developed a sense of lust and love towards Ero-suke. We have an idol who is seen as the mascot of the series.Talk about daily life being turned upside down for our poor protagonist.~ When life gives you money, you make fan-serviceBeing an ecchi show, it is no surprise that the theme of tentacles comes into play. In fact, the first  episode and nearly every one so far shows this theme. And of course, clothes being shredded in combat, Ero-suke supplying his powers towards his partner through eroticism, and the inflatable boobs of our teen star idol also gives the show its gags.Strangely though, this series actually makes sense through its usage of fan-service. Can you believe it? It\'s actually part of the story. As clothes gets shredded, it symbolizes a loss of power and weakness. As it comes back together, so does strength and the will to fight again! And of course, curtsey of AT-X, the series offers uncensored (yum) for those who wants to avoid the dark shades, light, and fog of the series that hides our guilty pleasures.The art and music of this anime series is just average although some of the character designs actually seems to be quite appealing, namely Lisara\'s Shinigami outfit. If you don\'t believe me, just look at that beauty. Some of the soundtrack also plays its role to convey the battle moody actions in the other world against the tentacle like beings while other times just seems to be there and not really noticeable.Well, that\'s not entirely true. ""Platinum 17"" by yozuca (the Ending theme song of the series) seems to be quite noticeable. It seems to show a possible future romantic relationship between Ero-suke and Lisara, a “forbidden love” between master and servant. The flower, the bath, the bedroom, it\'s all there. Unfortunately though, he doesn\'t really manage to flower the pot.~ The verdictWell, to enjoy this series, I would say that focusing on the story and characters seems to be the key factor. Yes, there is fan-service. Yes, there are the gags. Yes, there is cliché. What did you expect? If you can\'t deal with it, then hit the drop button now. However, it does seem that the verdict is not carrying its bar so high. With some of the latter factors as well as the dull plot coming around, this series seems is going downhill. It\'s not as hot as it originally was before and that\'s not an understatement. Ultimately, this series is one of those guilty pleasures to watch but for those more into the advanced plot settings with more insightful characters, then look elsewhere. common cliché, gags, and fan-service. The young boy Ryosuke Kaga (also better well known as Ero-suke, which in my opinion is the better name that suits him considering his nature) plays the main role of the protagonist. He is a perverted at some degrees but at the same time surprisingly funny to watch for his charms and will to protect the girls, or in his words “girls are to be treasured”. He is sort of the middleman compared to other perverted protagonists of the common gag in today\'s anime industries. For one thing, yes..Ero-suke is perverted but at the same time has a heart of gold, especially towards the shinigami he made a deal with.Surprisingly though, there is an actual plot to this series. Can you believe it? An actual plot for an ecchi series! Well, foremost, there are tentacle like beings in the beginning that seems to come after the duo like pouring rice. Later on though, a more direct plot seems to develop and mysteries fill the void.~ Goddess and the ServantOne of the main focus of the series is the interactions, relationship, and bond between main protagonists Ryosuke/Ero-suke and Shinigami Lisara Restall. With her deep scarlet hair and eyes, she is seen as a beautiful goddess of death. It is seems at first glance that she just wants to use Ryosuke for her own purposes. Later on though, we see that she does in fact cares for her dear servant, showing tendencies of care and even jealousy. Oh boy, my tsundere sense is tangling.~ Others of the Daily LifeOf course, there are other characters that drives the series. We have the childhood friend who has boobs that evokes the jealousy of the other female cast. We have the Shinigami rival against Lisara who lately have developed a sense of lust and love towards Ero-suke. We have an idol who is seen as the mascot of the series.Talk about daily life being turned upside down for our poor protagonist.~ When life gives you money, you make fan-serviceBeing an ecchi show, it is no surprise that the theme of tentacles comes into play. In fact, the first  episode and nearly every one so far shows this theme. And of course, clothes being shredded in combat, Ero-suke supplying his powers towards his partner through eroticism, and the inflatable boobs of our teen star idol also gives the show its gags.Strangely though, this series actually makes sense through its usage of fan-service. Can you believe it? It\'s actually part of the story. As clothes gets shredded, it symbolizes a loss of power and weakness. As it comes back together, so does strength and the will to fight again! And of course, curtsey of AT-X, the series offers uncensored (yum) for those who wants to avoid the dark shades, light, and fog of the series that hides our guilty pleasures.The art and music of this anime series is just average although some of the character designs actually seems to be quite appealing, namely Lisara\'s Shinigami outfit. If you don\'t believe me, just look at that beauty. Some of the soundtrack also plays its role to convey the battle moody actions in the other world against the tentacle like beings while other times just seems to be there and not really noticeable.Well, that\'s not entirely true. ""Platinum 17"" by yozuca (the Ending theme song of the series) seems to be quite noticeable. It seems to show a possible future romantic relationship between Ero-suke and Lisara, a “forbidden love” between master and servant. The flower, the bath, the bedroom, it\'s all there. Unfortunately though, he doesn\'t really manage to flower the pot.~ The verdictWell, to enjoy this series, I would say that focusing on the story and characters seems to be the key factor. Yes, there is fan-service. Yes, there are the gags. Yes, there is cliché. What did you expect? If you can\'t deal with it, then hit the drop button now. However, it does seem that the verdict is not carrying its bar so high. With some of the latter factors as well as the dull plot coming around, this series seems is going downhill. It\'s not as hot as it originally was before and that\'s not an understatement. Ultimately, this series is one of those guilty pleasures to watch but for those more into the advanced plot settings with more insightful characters, then look elsewhere.', 'Boku-H is a perfect example of what ecchi harem shows are about, and in this review, I am here to explain why our standards of appreciation must be adjusted to account for what actually makes these types of shows enjoyable.By the normal standards of grading entertainment, we usually define quality entertainment as intelligent in some way.  Intelligent design for entertainment usually is produced through a well-thought out story and an interesting cast that has thought provoking development.  Naturally, it is very easy to dismiss Boku-H as being a mediocre show when it does in fact have an uninspired story that feels rushed and...confusing at its worst moments. Nobody is surprised by the usual boy meets fantasy girl who gets boy into sexy action packed adventures.  I will be the first person to admit that the story is nothing special by any means.The other point of appreciation for most entertainment also includes its physical quality, or essentially its sound and art.  Boku-H again would be easily considered unremarkable for the most part in this area. The soundtrack, while not awful, is relatively shallow and repetitive.  The animations are also not the most smooth, and heavily reliant on CG to fill in the gaps. This can be forgiven however given the nature of this particular show is ecchi.  While the rest of the show looks unremarkable, the show does its job of providing appealing scenes featuring its female cast nude in various situations.  If you are looking for an erotic anime, the nude scenes overall do not disappoint.So far, it sounds like I\'m saying that this show is overall a mediocre lump of fanservice.  Well, you would almost be right.  Because the thing I haven\'t yet explained is the REAL reason you should be watching this show.  If not story and art quality, what have I not yet covered? Characters.Yes, characters are the reason you should be watching these types of shows.  Specifically, I highly recommend paying attention to Ryosuke Kaga.  What usually defines ecchi harem shows are the main male character, because if we think for a moment logically, these shows very literally are centered around the adventures of our beloved main character.  What I am basically trying to say is that above all, the single most important thing that makes or breaks an ecchi harem (or a hentai for that matter) is almost always the main male character.  If he is likable and the artwork is passable, almost nothing else matters. A strong main character for these shows is the catalyst for viewers being able to relate to the humor and adventures created in these types of shows.  And I will go so far to say that Ryosuke from Boku-H is easily one of the best main characters that exists for a show of this type.Ryosuke has many qualities that should be used more in these types of shows, but aren\'t for some reason.  He\'s openly perverted, does not come off as creepy when his childhood friend inherently acknowledges him as kind and trustworthy, is never afraid to say exactly what is on his mind, and he has the guts to say ""size doesn\'t matter"" to his relatively flat-chested love interest Lisara. In short, he\'s hilariously manly to an extreme. He is hammy at times, but ultimately comes off very likable due to his honesty and kindness.  And best of all, he is voiced by Shimono Hiro, who once again succeeds at depicting manly hormonal teenage high school boys. Some of the dialogue that Ryosuke dares to say is extremely humorous, both in his shamelessness and the euphemisms he uses (get used to hearing the word ""kingdom"" for a while.  You\'ll know soon enough what it means if you don\'t know already).You might wonder why I haven\'t said anything about the female cast.  It\'s because they don\'t matter.  Yes I could argue that the female cast is objectively flawed, not particularly interesting, and just uninspired.  On the other hand, it could be potentially because this female cast is flawed and so blatantly represents certain stereotypes and tropes that Ryosuke can so easily express his true manliness in the most hilarious way possible. Again, the actual source of entertainment from this genre of show originates almost exclusively from the main character. This is neither a good or bad thing, it just simply needs to be factored appropriately when one picks up these types of shows.In general, when we pursue to immerse ourselves in entertainment, there are standards of quality that we use as a means of finding appreciation.  I personally find it very strange that many people seem to believe that ecchi harems as a whole are somehow not legitimate entertainment when Japan still consistently is able to find a market for it. Naturally, if you choose to approach this show with the expectation of finding attachment to an intelligent storyline, you are obviously going to be disappointed. However, when I compare this show to what other ecchi harems generally offer, I believe that this show definitely stands out as one of the better ones by faithfully providing sexy humor and adventures to laugh at. It is by relating to the main character that we can appreciate the madness that is pretty faces catered to a sexual orientation.  Boku-H does not disappoint here, providing what may be one of the best male protagonists in existence. confusing at its worst moments.

Who basically says hi by stabbing him in the chest with a sword....Now effectively making him her power source whenever she gets into a fight, and the way he replenishes said power is… by getting a boner. I wish I got make this shit up.From this point on the show takes the standard harem show route. There’s a thing that the main girl needs the main guys help to get and they run through the standard enemies for a show like this. Monsters, people similar to the girl, the big bad guy at the end, etc. All the while slowly building up the main characters harem. There’s not really anything new to be found here at all, but the story doesn’t feel boring (Not to me anyway) and this is probably because I feel like the production team just went, “If we’re going to make an ecchi-harem show, might as well go all out.” And it kinda worked out for them in the end. Speaking of the end, it sucks.The Characters (5/10): As I said in the short version the characters aren’t really much more than well-worn archtypes, none of them bring anything new to said archtypes, and as a whole they are there to fill a role and nothing else. You have the tsundere, the girl with big tits, the (semi?) loli, the childhood friend, and the wimpy protagonist to wrap everyone up.Ryousuke Kaga: The honest MC and wielder of “The Kingdom”Lisara Restall: The tsundere and not bad for a redhead.Iria Fukumune: The one with the big tits and is dressed as a cow at one point.Mina Okura: The childhood friend and the childhood friend we all kinda wanted.Quele Sellier: The loli and half-sister to Lisara.There’s nothing else to say about the characters that I didn’t already, I will admit that I think Lisara and Mina are kinda hot though.The Art & Sound (6/10) & (5/10): The art of the show was done by Feel, who also did the animation for Outbreak Company and SNAFU, as well as Corpse Princess. Now that you have a general idea of the art style, the quality in this show is definitely more than I was expecting for a harem show, my expectation being that they put all of their effort into making the tits move and that’s it, and I was right. Mostly. They just managed to find a bit of time to animate the fights as well, which aren’t anything special but again, more than I was expecting.The sound of the show is entirely forgettable. I can’t remember anything of the OST, OP or the ED. The only thing that was standard was the voice acting and that’s the only thing that I didn’t forget.What do you think of this show?Not buying, not a chance in hell.Would you recommend this show?Want to watch an ecchi-harem to kill time? Go ahead.Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one. Now effectively making him her power source whenever she gets into a fight, and the way he replenishes said power is… by getting a boner.

"", 'When I first began this anime I didn\'t expect anything. It seemed like a stupid pervert ecchi story with a bit of fantasy mixed in.As I continued I realized it was exactly what I expected except that it\'s the best of its kind.Story-8Don\'t expect too much. 12 episodes, with a lead that is a pervert. How much development do you expect? It\'s sweet but not a ""make you think"" story like death note or code geass.Art-9Splendid. I love the art. The characters look marvelous.

It\'s a nice anime but it\'s not going to be a ""masterpiece"".', '\'Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai\' is your average ecchi rom-com with a few interesting twists thrown in here and there. That said and whether it\'s intentional or not, this anime has a lot of similarities with other well known series and if you\'re an anime savvy watcher it feels like many plot points here have been done before in a strikingly similar way elsewhere.The story is banal and doesn\'t really require much in-depth description.  The male lead, Ryosuke Kaga, is the stereotypical high school anime pervert and lives out his days oblivious to the powers high above. One day he meets a...redhead death god, Restall Risara, who happens to be on a hunt for the human with the highest amount of spiritual energy, or the ""special specimen"" as it\'s called in this anime. The first episode already looks somewhat similar to Bleach, plot-wise. Those of you that watched it, you surely remember the first episode where Ichigo and Rukia meet - it\'s raining outside and she stabs him with her sword so that he can defeat the hollow. Same thing in this anime, minus the hollow part and it happens inside the house. From that moment on they develop a partner (professionally speaking)  relationship. Again similar to how it was done with Rukia and Ichigo in bleach, where the male lead supports the female companion character as they strive towards a common goal. Of course this might be mere coincidence, stemming from the fact that there are lots of shinigami-based animes out there and through sheer probability, at least two of them will end up being similar.There are secondary characters of course - Fukumune Iria, Okura Mina, Sellier Quele. The first one is just for pure fanservice as is the case with Sellier. They have no real depth, the story doesn\'t expand upon them and they\'re just there so that we can see more breasts on the screen. So is the case with nearly all other female characters and it makes the series more generic. The only plot significant secondary character here would be Mina, who gradually rises in importance, especially in the later episodes of the series. Out of all characters I would say she\'s the responsible and sensible type but one character is not enough to make up for dozens of shallow ones.The story progresses from being carefree with romantic undertones to full-blown romantic drama by the end. Similar to Sora no Otoshimono, again whether it\'s intentional or a coincidence, these are only my personal observations. Risara and Ryosuke set out on an adventure which includes defeating many hollow-like looking monsters; another apparent similarity to Bleach that I personally noticed. The two main characters evolve from being mere strangers to something a lot more than that and we can see their relationship growing with each episode. The makers have done a really good job here and the tension between Risara and Ryosuke and how they come to terms with their feelings is a highlight of this anime. I for one, was excited to see the ending and how their relationship would eventually pan-out.As for Art, it is nicely done. Characters are well drawn. The colors are crisp and the style immediately catches your eye\'s full attention. One thing to note however is that violence and nudity are intertwined in this anime. A lot of fighting scenes will feature the girls being completely naked - much like in Elfen Lied, but with less blood. Whether the makers have purposefully adopted that kind of style from Elfen Lied or it\'s just me - I don\'t know, but it is something worthy to notice and discretion is advised.The voice acting is very convincing and the VAs themselves fit in nicely with this type of anime. The soundtrack as well as the opening and ending songs are catchy.All in all, this is a decent anime. The story isn\'t too bad but there are a few shortcomings, the most notable is the large amount of shallow and completely pointless characters and the fact that the plot lacks uniqueness to stand out from a pile of similar anime series. However at the same time the romance component here has been executed in the best way possible and this is a good anime for all those people who like watching romance-based series. You\'ll also get a few laughs out of this anime, as it is filled with eyebrow-raising situations and one liners.Therefore \'Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai\' gets a rating of 7 from me. It isn\'t bad but it isn\'t very good either. Watch it for fun and definitively for the romance and you will enjoy it. redhead death god, Restall Risara, who happens to be on a hunt for the human with the highest amount of spiritual energy, or the ""special specimen"" as it\'s called in this anime.

Unlike the average high school boy, he won’t shut up about it, and cares little for anything other than breasts, butts, breasts, napes, breasts, panties, breasts, and...  Um...  Underarms.  It makes more sense when he says it.Anyway, on his way home from school, he sees a beautiful red-haired girl standing all alone in the rain outside of his house.  Not content to just stare at her wet, transparent shirt, he offers her his umbrella, and invites her in for a change and a shower.  No sooner...are they indoors and alone then she begins to hold him close...  And just when he’s getting ready to ditch his V-card, she stabs him through the heart with a giant sword.As it turns out, her name is Lisara, and she’s a grim reaper...  You know, those things that were cool until Soul Eater...  And in order to complete her mission on earth, she needed to form a contract with somebody who had inexplicably high amounts of life energy...  Which Ryosuke apparently has in spades...  And she draws her power directly from the one thing that makes her new partner love his life so much.  Unfortunately for her, she finds out that he drives his passion from his perversion, so she can only be at full power when he’s popping a woody...  Which works out perfectly, because without that power, she gets her ass kicked faster than Lina Inverse on her period... Losing her clothes in the process.At first glance, you’d think this was the perfect set-up for an ecchi fanservice series...  Well, yes and no.  We’ll get to the meat of this review in a few paragraphs, but for the moment, I must give credit where credit is due.So I Can’t Play H...  Which I’ll simply be calling H from now on...  Was produced by a company called feel, and while I’d love to say some smart-sounding words about their track record and production history, I’ve never actually heard of this company before.  They’ve done in-between animation on a few shows I’ve seen, but up until now, the only show they’ve directly produced and animated that I’ve actually seen was Corpse Princess...  Which I only remember dropping out of boredom.I can’t say anything about feel, but whatever their eternally lower-cased history may be, this show is drop dead gorgeous.  The occasional CG is breathtaking, whether it’s taking the form of a simple escalator or the teleportation field around a reaper.  This is CG rendering that even Sword Art Online would be gasping at, even if the color scheme does kind of become an eyesore in the final few episodes.  The backgrounds are exquisitely detailed, expertly framed, and they will absolutely dazzle you with their use of lighting and shading.The animation for the characters is much simpler, but not bad by any means...  Their designs are very standard, a little on the bland side, and nowhere near as realistic as the aesthetic would have you believe... but their movement is still quite a bit more fluid than what you’d find in most shows of a similar ilk.  Key frames and speedlines are rare, but they’re used fairly well for what they are.So, when you’re talking about ecchi titles, the bar is consistently a low one...  Titty showcases aren’t typically known for having good writing, original ideas, or any value outside of the perverse.  It’s entirely possible for ecchi shows to be enjoyable outside of the skin content that they offer...  Strike Witches is a prime example of this...  But actual depth and creativity are rare elements indeed.  So why am I bringing this up, while talking about a show that’s basically just Bleach meets Girls Bravo, with an older version of Shana in the lead role?  Because, believe it or not, So I Can’t Play H came dangerously close to impressing me.With the plot being set up the way it is, H had a potentially brilliant subversion right in the palm of it’s hand.  With Ryosuke being a hopeless pervert who values women solely for their bodies, and who’s depth of character only reaches the level of ‘I like different poses,’ and Lisara drawing her energy from that pervert power, the only thing this show had to do to have me eating out of it’s hand was to not have anybody fall in love with him.  If he was simply used as an object, as Lisara proclaimed in episode 1, then it would have been a very clever play on his habit of objectifying women.  I can take the plot at face value...  Trust me, there’s a lot worse ideas out there...  And it makes sense that, under this arrangement she’d eventually get used to being naked around him.  From there, she should have grown to see him as a necessary annoyance...  A being less than a man, who she doesn’t feel remotely threatened by, like a little kid, or a brainless dog.  In fact, the entire harem could have seen him this way, adding a surprising edge of feminism to the heaping helping of boobs that the show throws at us.And as far as the romantic aspect of H goes, this change would have also helped Ryosuke become a much better character...  He could have been emasculated by their treatment of him, faced his immature flaws, and forced himself to develop and grow in order to win more than just Lisara’s time.  I can’t even begin to describe how refreshing a dynamic this would be, and I certainly can’t express how much good will I would have had for this title.  But alas, this isn’t how things went...  Lisara’s promise to use him as a power source was nothing more than the same old cliched Tsundere bullshit that we’ve grown accustomed to.Every girl in the harem falls madly in love with this skeezwad, and he doesn’t start to show monogamous interest in anybody until the third quarter of the series, and it comes from pretty much out of nowhere, proving to the viewer that male perversion can only be overcome if a woman is willing to accept and tolerate it.  Yeah, just love that womanizing douchebag, and he’ll only have eyes for you eventually.  I wasn’t really expecting any better than that, but it would have been nice.Then again, it’s not like that message will ever reach the ears of anybody whom it could damage...  I can’t for the life of me imagine anybody enjoying this show without a bottle of lotion sitting beside them, and any negative message it sends will fly right over the heads of THAT market.Oh, and speaking of all the girls falling in love with him, the funniest thing about H by far is how little it understands human emotion...  Yeah, I know, big surprise, no harem characters are realistic.  But we’re talking about a whole other level here.  It’s not uncommon for harem girls to fall in love with the main character for no reason whatsoever, but this has to be the first anime I’ve ever seen where one of the girls doesn’t start to show an interest in him until another girl suggests it.  Yep...  No exaggeration there.  One of them says “We both like Ryosuke,” and in so many words, the other one says “I do?  Oh yeah, I do!”  And the laziest love interest in the series was born.Do I even have to mention that it gets worse than that?  There’s a reveal halfway through that’s probably one of the most bewildering anime moments I’ve seen in a long time.  Ryosuke skypes his mother for spoiler reasons, and a girl in the room asks her for some information regarding his bloodline.  She says, in so many words, “Oh, by the way, I lied about your father being dead.”  That’s it.  No hesitation, no reluctance, she just drops what should have been a ton of bricks on him out of nowhere and with not nearly enough prodding to suddenly break sixteen years of silence.  And his reaction?  Mild surprise at best.  She gives him a quick explanation, and the subject gets dropped faster than the beat at a Skrillex concert.  And no, that’s not a spoiler worthy of a warning...  I wanted it to be, as I was pretty damn sure the villain would turn out to be his father in a mask, but it never gets brought up again.  It’s even more bafflingly stupid than Ryosuke’s mental dictionary.Which reminds me...  Remember that plot I mentioned earlier?  The one I begrudgingly decided to take at face value?  Yeah, it’s about as consistent as an everlasting gobstopper.  According to the back of the DVD cover, Ryosuke can’t be perverted after Lisara’s used him for power, so he wants to help her so she can leave and his life can return to normal.  Yeah, at no point in the show is that ever true.  First of all, that’s not the reason he’s helping her...  He’s doing it because she says he only has 3 months to live, and he wants her to save him.  Second of all, he never stops being perverted...  Although even when she’s buck naked right in front of him, he has to (I wish I didn’t remember this) memorize all of the dirty words in a dictionary, so he can call any dirty word to his mind when needed.  Because it takes obsessive studying to come up with the word “Bath.”And third of all, his childhood friend makes a contract with Lisara’s childhood friend, and her passion for life comes from her love of Ryosuke...  Spoiler, yes, but you’ll figure that out long before it’s revealed.  And get this...  The exploitation of her life force NEVER causes her to stop being in love with him.  I think that’s a problem, don’t you?  That is, aside from the problem of her being in love with a skeezwad.And oh, I know what you’re thinking...  “It doesn’t matter if it’s stupid, and shamelessly puts flesh on parade despite some gaping plot holes, inhuman behavior, and elements that make absolutely no sense.  Hell, Strike Witches was a booby show, and the logic revolving around the panties makes for an incomprehensible plot hole, and you love Strike Witches!.”  Yeah, you’re right.  Strike Witches was a stupid, idiotic mess with copious amounts of bare boobs.  But you know what it wasn’t?  Pretentious.  Strike Witches was a blast from start to finish because it never tried to be anything deeper than action-packed cheesecake.  But that wasn’t enough for H.See, the story gets serious in the second half...  Well, at least it tries, but all it ends up doing is making even less sense...  And it tries it’s hand at some real drama.  I’ll spare you most of it, including Ryosuke’s uncanny transformation into a perfect gentleman the moment he gets a legitimate chance to pork somebody...  And talk about the villain’s motive, which is going to be a difficult thing to do without giving away any spoilers.To put it in ambiguous terms, the villain’s motivation is driven by a disturbingly real threat to the very existence of life on this planet...  It’s a threat that nobody is talking about yet, as it’s even more controversial than climate change, and the people who try to take a stand against it are demonized for their efforts.  This is quite possibly the first time I’ve seen a fictional story try to tackle this issue, but as I learned before, I wasn’t expecting too much.  Ryosuke and his harem are conflicted over this issue, which seems to be far too great a necessary evil to face...  And I swear to god, the solution this story comes up with is one of the most pretentious fictional solutions I have ever heard for anything.  It’s steeped entirely in ignorance of human nature and whimsical sci-fi fantasy, which makes H feel all the more shallow and stupid for it’s efforts.  It’s like listening to a ten year old say that Israel and Palestine should just hug it out, or seeing Superman solve the world’s problems by sending all the nukes into space.  It’s a cute idea, but for the love of god, please don’t write a freaking story bout it!If I haven’t already made this clear, H is incompetent down to it’s lowest possible level.  The jokes are bad, none of the characters are likeable, the nudity is too constant and over-saturated to remain sexy for longer than the space of a single episode, and the music is made up of cookie-cutter dating sim tunes.  It’s childish and stupid down to it’s very core, and while it’s offensive to women in some very creative ways, the only thing that keeps it from becoming completely morally repulsive is the fact that the harem in question doesn’t include any incestuous or lolicon characters.  Hell, the one harem girl who’s still in junior high is also the only girl in the entire show who never does any unobscured nudity, because yeah, THAT’s going to save it at this point.  The only reason I can see anybody watching this is because of the boobs...  And if that’s enough for you, then congratulations, you’re eternally 14.So I Can’t Play H is available on DVD and Blu-ray from Sentai Filmworks.  It’s fairly expensive on most sites, but at the time this review is being written, you could get it at Rightstuf.com for 17.99 or 23.99, depending on your preferred format.  There’s no dub as of yet, but knowing Sentai, they’re probably just waiting tentatively to see if this title is popular enough to justify spending money on a dub.  It’s a shame they have the rights to it, because a show like this really belongs in the hands of Funimation.  It’s one of the few titles I’d actually LIKE to see Jamie Marchi write the script for.The DVD doesn’t include the final thirteenth OVA episode, and while that omission may be a completionist’s nightmare, I really think it’s better to just pretend that episode doesn’t exist.  Why?  Well, remember all those female characters that you’ve already seen naked in every possible form of undress, and from every possible angle that won’t violate Japan’s decency laws?  Well, the final episode is a swimsuit competition!  Yeah, that’s exactly what this show needed!  No, I don’t want to learn more about the villain, or the whereabouts of Ryosuke’s dad, or the societal results of this show’s idiotic conclusion...  I wanna see my fetishes catered to even harder and more gratuitously than before, in an episode that isn’t even a tenth as well animated as the series that preceded it.So, as worthless as this show is, I can’t really call it the bottom of the barrel.  The animation, quite frankly, is too beautiful for that.  But it’s close.  And keep in mind, the ecchi genre dwells in a barrel that’s every bit as deep as the Mariana trench, and it’s bottom is littered with even more despicable 1/10(or below) titles like Dears, Eiken, Love Love, Popotan, and Master of Martial Hearts.  H is floating just a few feet above those titles, and about a dozen feet below School Days.  That’s not a place any anime wants to be...  Trust me, it’s really cold and dark down there, but it’s where this title belongs, and I can’t wait to post this review and instantly go about the task of forgetting about it.  I give So I Can’t Play H a 2/10. are they indoors and alone then she begins to hold him close...  And just when he’s getting ready to ditch his V-card, she stabs him through the heart with a giant sword.As it turns out, her name is Lisara, and she’s a grim reaper...  You know, those things that were cool until Soul Eater...  And in order to complete her mission on earth, she needed to form a contract with somebody who had inexplicably high amounts of life energy...  Which Ryosuke apparently has in spades...  And she draws her power directly from the one thing that makes her new partner love his life so much.  Unfortunately for her, she finds out that he drives his passion from his perversion, so she can only be at full power when he’s popping a woody...  Which works out perfectly, because without that power, she gets her ass kicked faster than Lina Inverse on her period... Losing her clothes in the process.At first glance, you’d think this was the perfect set-up for an ecchi fanservice series...  Well, yes and no.  We’ll get to the meat of this review in a few paragraphs, but for the moment, I must give credit where credit is due.So I Can’t Play H...  Which I’ll simply be calling H from now on...  Was produced by a company called feel, and while I’d love to say some smart-sounding words about their track record and production history, I’ve never actually heard of this company before.  They’ve done in-between animation on a few shows I’ve seen, but up until now, the only show they’ve directly produced and animated that I’ve actually seen was Corpse Princess...  Which I only remember dropping out of boredom.I can’t say anything about feel, but whatever their eternally lower-cased history may be, this show is drop dead gorgeous.  The occasional CG is breathtaking, whether it’s taking the form of a simple escalator or the teleportation field around a reaper.  This is CG rendering that even Sword Art Online would be gasping at, even if the color scheme does kind of become an eyesore in the final few episodes.  The backgrounds are exquisitely detailed, expertly framed, and they will absolutely dazzle you with their use of lighting and shading.The animation for the characters is much simpler, but not bad by any means...  Their designs are very standard, a little on the bland side, and nowhere near as realistic as the aesthetic would have you believe... but their movement is still quite a bit more fluid than what you’d find in most shows of a similar ilk.  Key frames and speedlines are rare, but they’re used fairly well for what they are.So, when you’re talking about ecchi titles, the bar is consistently a low one...  Titty showcases aren’t typically known for having good writing, original ideas, or any value outside of the perverse.  It’s entirely possible for ecchi shows to be enjoyable outside of the skin content that they offer...  Strike Witches is a prime example of this...  But actual depth and creativity are rare elements indeed.  So why am I bringing this up, while talking about a show that’s basically just Bleach meets Girls Bravo, with an older version of Shana in the lead role?  Because, believe it or not, So I Can’t Play H came dangerously close to impressing me.With the plot being set up the way it is, H had a potentially brilliant subversion right in the palm of it’s hand.  With Ryosuke being a hopeless pervert who values women solely for their bodies, and who’s depth of character only reaches the level of ‘I like different poses,’ and Lisara drawing her energy from that pervert power, the only thing this show had to do to have me eating out of it’s hand was to not have anybody fall in love with him.  If he was simply used as an object, as Lisara proclaimed in episode 1, then it would have been a very clever play on his habit of objectifying women.  I can take the plot at face value...  Trust me, there’s a lot worse ideas out there...  And it makes sense that, under this arrangement she’d eventually get used to being naked around him.

Yeah, just love that womanizing douchebag, and he’ll only have eyes for you eventually.  I wasn’t really expecting any better than that, but it would have been nice.Then again, it’s not like that message will ever reach the ears of anybody whom it could damage...

I give So I Can’t Play H a 2/10.', ""This is my first review so don't be too harsh...XDId give it a 6.5~7 /10 ...i thought it was kinda of generic and bland...though the art and animation is good ,and the insertion of jokes are done well but in a also generic way .But the episode feels like it is lacking the main pole or pillar that supports the bridge,the story.As well as for the way of absorbing viewer.Normally first episodes are ended in a way that incites viewers to watch next episode.But this episode ended with a suspense event ,but one that is not striking enough IMO to have the viewers say ,I...have to watch next episode !I didn't read the manga because ppl were complaining about how the episode of the anime was inferior to the manga.So I watched the episode first.Back to the story the story was IMO lacking,there wasn't or was lacking rather a drive to the actions of the character.Speaking of which had rather overused generic personnalities,in other word they were kinda lacking depth.That's it for the anime.After seeing it i read the manga ...Well not surprisingly i thought is was better.But just comparing the first chapter and the episode.Some key element seems also to be lacking in the anime episode.And I also realised that the chemistry between the main chars is also missing which is kinda a big thin for me.In conclusion ,i though it was ok start for a series but i could of done better.And the lack of depth and drive is also understandable from the quantity of manga present.(If they have shown it like the manga then in a few episode it would catch up the manga)But the way they executed it was done in a rushed way.So in consequense the first episode results in a Ok episode .Though don't drop it yet,the series has a LOT of potential at hand .And the anime adaptation is not all at fault either.Maybe they decided to make and anime adaptation too early.Result:Good episode,ok~ish debut for a series with potential.Here my first review ,hope it helped(btw im def not dropping it ,waiting to see what will happen next) have to watch next episode !I didn't read the manga because ppl were complaining about how the episode of the anime was inferior to the manga.So I watched the episode first.Back to the story the story was IMO lacking,there wasn't or was lacking rather a drive to the actions of the character.Speaking of which had rather overused generic personnalities,in other word they were kinda lacking depth.That's it for the anime.After seeing it i read the manga ...Well not surprisingly i thought is was better.But just comparing the first chapter and the episode.Some key element seems also to be lacking in the anime episode.And I also realised that the chemistry between the main chars is also missing which is kinda a big thin for me.In conclusion ,i though it was ok start for a series but i could of done better.And the lack of depth and drive is also understandable from the quantity of manga present.(If they have shown it like the manga then in a few episode it would catch up the manga)But the way they executed it was done in a rushed way.So in consequense the first episode results in a Ok episode .Though don't drop it yet,the series has a LOT of potential at hand .And the anime adaptation is not all at fault either.Maybe they decided to make and anime adaptation too early.Result:Good episode,ok~ish debut for a series with potential.Here my first review ,hope it helped(btw im def not dropping it ,waiting to see what will happen next)"", ""alright, second review time and it has been some time since my first one, this time i'm going to discuss Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai, a mouth full if you ask me.First off let me say that this show is still airing and I will change my score when this show is completed, so this review is meant to give you an impression.Another thing I would like to point out from the start is that this show is ecchi, so for those people who don't like it, don't even start watching this as there are plenty of ripped clothes which will leave some...girls almost butt naked aside of some strings, so boobs, ass and shyness are there.With that being said, let's start off;Story 7; Now this is straight off where I'm actually already bothered but also where I have to think off what still has to come. This show has great potential and can easily be 1 of the better shows out there at the moment, however the fighting scenes are generally always in the same order: enemy appears, girl gets in trouble because her energy is not high enough yet, boy gives energy, girl whoops enemy's butt.  Don't get me wrong though, the fighting scenes are pretty well done when it comes down to action, but I hope that it will change a bit in the future.Now for the rest of the story, as I said it has great potential and that is because so many things have not been explained yet, as the creators of this show keep giving slight hints that there is coming a major twist to this story, the real action still has to come, I won't explain what still has to come as I myself hate spoilers and I won't spoil things for you guys either.Art 9; Scenery is really well made, characters are not some sort of misformed animals and actually look pretty well. And as I explained earlier, fighting scenes are well made when it comes down to the actual moves of the characters, also it might just be me but I think that the shows is looking better now than it did at the start of the show, might be mistaken here though.Sound 7; nothing really special here, the voice actors do a decent job as so far I have no real hate for a specific character when it comes down to their voices, in fact each and everyone of their voices suit the character pretty well.BGM and opening/ending are mediocore, nothing that will stay with you when this show is over but still decent enough to make you somewhat enjoy it for the moment and the BGM does it's job by adding some tensity or calming atmosphere to the scenes.Character 8; This is another point that I will most likely change when this show is over, I will briefly explain why, the main characters show promise when it comes down to their power and character development in general considering romance etc. However this still has to be done of course and I hope the creators do this otherwise the score for this will drop as fast as a human in the air without a parachute.Now on to a little in-depth viewing;The main protagonist, (Kaga, Ryosuke) is NOT as in most ecchi, action animes a complete weakling who is incredibly pathetic, in fact he is the one who has to save the female protagonist almost the whole time but there is a good reason for that which I won't explain as it would spoil too much.Where this guy gets his power from is absolutely hilarious in my opinion and I think most people would agree with me, he is a very likeable character and for once I enjoy the main protagonist.The female protagonist, (Renstall, Lisara) is basically Ryosuke's master and main reason why this show has the ecchi tag which you will understand straight away after the first episode, believe me when I say that after you've seen the first episode you will know straight away whether you will like this show or not.The minor main characters and side characters are doing a decent job so far to add to the plot and to the comedy aspect.Enjoyment 9; This is a high score, I know, however I will explain why. Even though this show has it's flaws and the fighting scenes have the same order of how it goes, it is still a very enjoyable show and before you know it you will have reach episode 6 which should air this week, I think.As I said many times in this review, this show has potential and I hope that they will have everything taken care of when it ends or at least make it so good that I will look forward to a season 2 if it will come out as this show can become a gem.For me personally so far, episode 1 was really well done, it will get you excited for the next episode but then it slows down a bit it will explain stuff and let's you go with the flow, but the last episode I watched today(nr.5) it will pick up some of the pace again and in between the episodes it will give hints as I stated before of some major stuff that still has to come.So in 2 sentences; Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai is a possible gem but still far from being one. It has flaws and will certainly need some work, but still very, very enjoyable. girls almost butt naked aside of some strings, so boobs, ass and shyness are there.With that being said, let's start off;Story 7; Now this is straight off where I'm actually already bothered but also where I have to think off what still has to come. This show has great potential and can easily be 1 of the better shows out there at the moment, however the fighting scenes are generally always in the same order: enemy appears, girl gets in trouble because her energy is not high enough yet, boy gives energy, girl whoops enemy's butt.  Don't get me wrong though, the fighting scenes are pretty well done when it comes down to action, but I hope that it will change a bit in the future.Now for the rest of the story, as I said it has great potential and that is because so many things have not been explained yet, as the creators of this show keep giving slight hints that there is coming a major twist to this story, the real action still has to come, I won't explain what still has to come as I myself hate spoilers and I won't spoil things for you guys either.Art 9; Scenery is really well made, characters are not some sort of misformed animals and actually look pretty well. And as I explained earlier, fighting scenes are well made when it comes down to the actual moves of the characters, also it might just be me but I think that the shows is looking better now than it did at the start of the show, might be mistaken here though.Sound 7; nothing really special here, the voice actors do a decent job as so far I have no real hate for a specific character when it comes down to their voices, in fact each and everyone of their voices suit the character pretty well.BGM and opening/ending are mediocore, nothing that will stay with you when this show is over but still decent enough to make you somewhat enjoy it for the moment and the BGM does it's job by adding some tensity or calming atmosphere to the scenes.Character 8; This is another point that I will most likely change when this show is over, I will briefly explain why, the main characters show promise when it comes down to their power and character development in general considering romance etc. However this still has to be done of course and I hope the creators do this otherwise the score for this will drop as fast as a human in the air without a parachute.Now on to a little in-depth viewing;The main protagonist, (Kaga, Ryosuke) is NOT as in most ecchi, action animes a complete weakling who is incredibly pathetic, in fact he is the one who has to save the female protagonist almost the whole time but there is a good reason for that which I won't explain as it would spoil too much.Where this guy gets his power from is absolutely hilarious in my opinion and I think most people would agree with me, he is a very likeable character and for once I enjoy the main protagonist.The female protagonist, (Renstall, Lisara) is basically Ryosuke's master and main reason why this show has the ecchi tag which you will understand straight away after the first episode, believe me when I say that after you've seen the first episode you will know straight away whether you will like this show or not.The minor main characters and side characters are doing a decent job so far to add to the plot and to the comedy aspect.Enjoyment 9; This is a high score, I know, however I will explain why. Even though this show has it's flaws and the fighting scenes have the same order of how it goes, it is still a very enjoyable show and before you know it you will have reach episode 6 which should air this week, I think.As I said many times in this review, this show has potential and I hope that they will have everything taken care of when it ends or at least make it so good that I will look forward to a season 2 if it will come out as this show can become a gem.For me personally so far, episode 1 was really well done, it will get you excited for the next episode but then it slows down a bit it will explain stuff and let's you go with the flow, but the last episode I watched today(nr.5) it will pick up some of the pace again and in between the episodes it will give hints as I stated before of some major stuff that still has to come.So in 2 sentences; Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai is a possible gem but still far from being one. It has flaws and will certainly need some work, but still very, very enjoyable."", ""Dakura Boku wa, H ga Dekinai is basically your run of the mill, standard echhi anime. While this anime is by no means terrible it is simply mediocre at best. The story was promising at times but the plot was never sufficiently explored for me to care too much. The animation was pretty good but thats to be expected. The soundtrack is by far the best part of the anime, as the opening and ending are both outstanding. The characters........ This is where Dakura Boku wa, H ga Dekinai falls flat on it's face, of all the characters i only like one, The main character...here is extraordinarily bland and quite frankly a bore to watch, The main heroine is cliche and mostly uninteresting and most of the others are the same. So overall while i enjoyed this anime at times the story and the characters made this unable to be anything but mediocre6/10 if anything listen to the op and ed of this show as they are fantastic here is extraordinarily bland and quite frankly a bore to watch, The main heroine is cliche and mostly uninteresting and most of the others are the same.

Boobs are everywhere is this anime! Right, I'm going straight into what I feel about this anime.Story:Honestly, the plot in this anime is terribly boring. The whole anime is centred around this death goddess searching for the most powerful energy source in this world. Of course, obstacles appeared and they overcame it and that's all.  They actually spend about 9 episodes or so searching for that energy source. Pretty boring to me...as it was sort of draggy. To be really honest, if the characters didn't display their body aspect to such extent, I would've dropped this anime long ago. Also, this anime focus far too much on the body aspect of the characters that made me forget I was actually watching an anime and felt more like I was watching porn. I'm not exaggerating but almost every few minutes, there will be someone's body being featured, naked. Therefore, due to the boring plot and the over-emphasise of the character's body, the story was not really brought into my mind.Character:The characters all have sufficient time in this anime. There wasn't a case of a particular character being left out after being introduced for a few minutes only. Hence, the appearing time for the characters was rather balanced. Additionally, you might want to pay attention to Lisara only as all other females are a pain in the eye.Sound:Nothing to comment on the sound because it has little significance in the anime. I totally forgot the existence of a OST in this anime. However, the opening was catchy and impressive.Art:If we are talking about the art in terms of the body art of the characters, it normal like any other ecchi animes. Nothing really special or unusual about the body art here.Enjoyment:I decided to watch this anime because I had nothing else to watch, hoping this anime could at least entertain me a little. However, the plot was plainly boring and there was an over-emphasise on the character's body which disappointed me a lot. I know this is an ecchi anime, but there has to be a limit to the amount of time spent showing us the bodies of the characters. So basically, this anime was not very enjoyable to me. If the plot was a little more interesting  it might actually turn out to be a very enjoyable anime. Therefore, I would strongly advise you to not spend too much time in this anime because it might turn out to be a waste of time for you because it is really terribly boring.Thank you. as it was sort of draggy.

I haven\'t read both the light novel and the manga.EDIT: Some grammar check and minor addition of content. My opinion regarding the anime still remains the same.After I and my ecchi-addicted friend watched the first episode of ""Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai"" (which we simply watched since I saw it here on MAL that it\'s like High School DxD), we both know that there\'s no sparks out there, trying to hook us - its watchers - to get into the anime. Despite that, we still continued to watch the anime. Although finishing the anime...could be rewarding, I doubt that most people will have enough patience to last that long, with the anime\'s first four episodes not deviating from the usual ecchi anime formula, (with the clothes melting off and ""OOH, BOOBS!!!"") and the laughs simply not enough.The male lead character, Ryousuke, is also your usual male lead character: a lecherous wimp of a teenager (though he gains some sort of powers, the first one - making him regain ero-energy - I find cheesy ). At least I find Lisara, the female lead, a good character, serving as a foil to the pervert Ryousuke.The art and character design is very much similar to High School DxD. Not that I have any complaints about it since it actually looks nice and all.What made the first four episodes ""lacking in sparks"" is that 1) the first episode basically showed all of Lisara\'s powers as a shinigami, and 2) the following episodes follows the usual plot developments of the usual ecchi anime, which has become, simply put, predictable and bland. By that time, some - if not most - of its viewers would\'ve dropped the series, thinking that it shouldn\'t take half of the series\' worth of episodes to get them hooked to the anime (unless all they\'re looking forward to is more boobs, that is).The latter half of the anime features a genre shift from mostly ecchi/harem to more of action (although the fan service still is there), and by this point until the last episodes (which features another genre shift to romance), the story actually starts to have an identity of its own (and also, more sense to comprehend).Unfortunately, this anime\'s problem - overall - is that it plays safe and by doing so, it actually became something that is trite and banal, so if you\'re going to watch this seeing that it\'s like another (albeit inferior version of) High School DxD. If, on the other hand, you haven\'t seen much ecchi in your whole life (or you simply just wants boobs, boobs and more boobs in your anime), then perhaps you might just enjoy this one. could be rewarding, I doubt that most people will have enough patience to last that long, with the anime\'s first four episodes not deviating from the usual ecchi anime formula, (with the clothes melting off and ""OOH, BOOBS!!!"") and the laughs simply not enough.The male lead character, Ryousuke, is also your usual male lead character: a lecherous wimp of a teenager (though he gains some sort of powers, the first one - making him regain ero-energy - I find cheesy ).

All the characters are as believable as they can get in a 12 episode ecchi. Keep in mind that this is a casual anime, it\'s not a work of art but it is at its core, a ball of fun and has actually pretty decent romance.

I heard a lot of praise especially for it\'s second half and as I was dropping anime quite a lot here and there I thought about giving a shot and let\'s just say it didn\'t go well for me...Story: 2/10At best I could describe the anime as ""border to hell"" with a 2. That\'s the most I could ever give it for the story section. Call me wierd, but I am very particular about a plot in an Ecchi anime,...so I went in with DxD-like expectations and got severely disappointed, and sadly there were a whole long list of reasons apart from that which made me hate the show as well.  I\'ll go step-by-step, since the anime itself was divided into two parts, I divided my story section into two parts for easy understanding.The first six episodes are basically plotless and contribute zilch to the plot, it\'s just ecchi and more excuses for more ecchi. Characters being introduced in a cliched manner and wasted exactly HALF the anime in it. You might bring up the excuse and say ""but that was fanservice for the fans, it\'s Ecchi, it has to have it"". Well, sadly this anime itself couldn\'t decide so who am I to judge. It was a harem in second, then pointless Ecchi in the next, and then weak plot. The studio couldn\'t even decide WHAT to follow for the first half and made me think as if the studio just licensed an anime and opened the reference books a few days before the airing date. Thankfully I went past the tortious first half and the end of episode six revealed that the next half (un)fortunately will focus on a proper plot (made you think the studio finally got their hands straight didn\'t they? Wrong.The second half was something that was praised a lot by other reviewers and watchers, not to mention people said the ending was excellent, so I forced myself through the first half and trudged on to the next episodes, what did I get? A bunch of zilch in return. In the most basic sense this anime tried to pull off a Hyoudou Issei DxD-esque rescue-person-in-another-world plotline and let\'s just say much like the rest of the anime, they ruined it. Plain and simple. A cliched villain, ***MINOR SPOILER: whom we don\'t see the face of at all, for no absolute reason...END SPOILER*** a cliched adventure, a cliched set of pointless fanservice yet again (that excuse won\'t work anymore my friend, this half was plot-time, and a whole lot of plot holes. If you compare the amount of plot holes in this anime to a beggar\'s clothes only 2 times out of 10 will the beggar\'s clothes have more holes than this plot, which by the way is the score this anime deserves for a terrible story line. I\'ll end with a weak joke, it was ""a border to hell"". There you go, obligatory hell joke in anime about hell is obligatory.Art: 3/10I think I know why I immediately understood who the studio was because it was a mess as usual from Studio feel. The familiar washed-out artstyle and horrible effects immediately pointed feel. toward me and I wasn\'t surprised that I was right (although I was kind of surprised). Going in detail on those aforementioned reasons, even at 720p it looked washed-out. This is a familiar tactic used by the lazy art directors at feel. and I remember this clearly since SNAFU S2 where they ruined an excellent artstyle (courtesy Brain\'s Base for the excellent first season) and that was seen here as well. As for the effects, the characters had to perform action sequences and throw spells at each other, those required effects at a good level and feel underdelivered. They looked like something a rookie would make, no joke. It looked terrible to be honest and the washed-out artstyle made it even worse. And don\'t get me started on that horribly lazy tactic used in between episodes 9 to 11 as a green background almost everywhere to save time and be more lazy. As for character design, I can say that was the saving grace of this section and if not for the character design, it would\'ve gotten a one, once again no joke. You can clearly see some effort (perhaps the only effort) out into the art into the characters. They looked vibrant, cheery and better than the rest of the art section in general. I personally like the shades of colours used for everyone, especially Quele, Lisara and Iria. Other than that... Well nothing positive so let\'s end here.Sound. 4/10At best I could describe the sound section as decent. Apart from that massively forgettable OP/ED (although I must admit later on the ED was kinda catchy, but kinda) the OST too couldn\'t figure itself out. You won\'t believe me if I tell you that the sound changed EVERY episode. Not a good sign when you\'ve got sub-par story and art scores. The VAs more or less did their job decently which is why I\'ve given a 4 and not a 2. On the other hand like I said the OST was a mess, especially the BGM.Character: 1/10Woah, this is the first time I\'ve ever used 1s 2s and maybe 3s in a review ever. Well, I can say that the characters were promising at first but it\'s what happened to then later which made me give them this outrageous number. They took that potential and threw it down the garbage and shoved it down your throat. If you want an easy example to understand through, this is it. I\'m already severely disappointed in TsunDeres and our Rias Gremory wannabe Lisara Rest-whatever was a painfully bad TsunDere. Apart from being a 99.9% Tsun, that .01% came through in the last Episodes and if you think that\'s enough to make me change my mind, well you\'re sadly mistake.I still can\'t believe what made people think that ending was any good. Personally I\'d be glad if it went the way of the ""bad guys"" since that way I could have been a bit more generous in my scoring but then this HAD to go the typical Shounen route. Anyway, speaking of Shounen, we move to Erosuke, I mean Ryousuke, unlike Hyoudou Issei, this guy was a hilarious attempt at a pervert MC. Forget about his cliched energy, the way he got his power among many other things made me feel like banging my head on a table. As for the denseness, a thing noticed in many romance anime, well I can say this sole reason is the one I\'m giving a 1 and not none. As for the other jokes we move to our onee-sama cliche \'imouto\', Quele. I rooted for her throughout the anime (I moved on from Mina due to reasons I\'ll detail later) but then after that pathetic fanservice scene in the second half I LOATHED her as well. Mina was a character I instantly liked at first, but like this anime, my support for her crumbled faster than the plot did. She was too damn shy to be supported anywhere in the course of the anime. It was painfully obvious at the start who would win in the end. As for our other character who was brutally pushed to the side, Iria. She was your basic ""rival"" archetype and that didn\'t please me at all (even in that way if you take it). There was nothing about her that wasn\'t cliched. \'Nuff said. She wasn\'t even the breast character in the anime (apologies for the pun), which puts her appeal to the maximum of 0.Enjoyment: 3/10Yes, the characters were horrible, yes the artstyle was washed out, yes the story was cliche as hell. But yet there was something that made me watch this anime and not dropping it, perhaps it was the way the after-credits scene was handled after each episode, or because I was dropping too many anime, or more likely both. As for the fanservice part, it was absolutely fulfilled, although I\'d love some reasons as to why it happens, heck, even half an excuse would work (such as Yuuki Rito\'s antigravity control, just kidding). I may sound positive but in the end it was almost worthwhile watching the anime.Overall: 2.6 (Averaged)Breaking the record for my lowest rated review, Dakara boku wa H ka dekinai takes the top cake as my worst reviewed anime ever. If you\'re in it for the plot, you\'ll be disappointed, if you\'re expecting some character development, you\'re an idiot (apologies for being rude), if you\'re in here for the Ecchi, well most of you will be satisfied. I was very surprised that this anime was praised for it\'s last arc and the last episode because frankly I ironically found the first half almost understandable than the second half which was a mess and a failed copy of DxD. On a personal note, it yet again disappointed me as a TsunDere fan since Lisara takes my award for the worst character of the anime. Period. All in all, this is an anime which you\'ll be forgiven if avoided and rewarding if you love ecchi with no plot and just oppai, although I must admit, it might be a fake too. I\'m honestly half surprised at the score the anime ended up with. I expected a little more, maybe 4 but at 2.6 it makes me laugh a little. To be frankly honest with you ***SPOILER: If the end was tragic, perhaps I\'d be a bit more considerate and I thought about this throughout the anime, and sadly it didn\'t happen. It took the pathetic harem route with no meaning to it, it didn\'t even try making up an excuse for the ending...P.S: After such a disgraceful score I don\'t think I have a waifu for the waifu corner. All I can say is that Caesar is the best character of the anime. That\'s it. Goodbye. No waifu corner. This anime doesn\'t deserve one. so I went in with DxD-like expectations and got severely disappointed, and sadly there were a whole long list of reasons apart from that which made me hate the show as well.  I\'ll go step-by-step, since the anime itself was divided into two parts, I divided my story section into two parts for easy understanding.The first six episodes are basically plotless and contribute zilch to the plot, it\'s just ecchi and more excuses for more ecchi. Characters being introduced in a cliched manner and wasted exactly HALF the anime in it. You might bring up the excuse and say ""but that was fanservice for the fans, it\'s Ecchi, it has to have it"". Well, sadly this anime itself couldn\'t decide so who am I to judge. It was a harem in second, then pointless Ecchi in the next, and then weak plot. The studio couldn\'t even decide WHAT to follow for the first half and made me think as if the studio just licensed an anime and opened the reference books a few days before the airing date. Thankfully I went past the tortious first half and the end of episode six revealed that the next half (un)fortunately will focus on a proper plot (made you think the studio finally got their hands straight didn\'t they? Wrong.The second half was something that was praised a lot by other reviewers and watchers, not to mention people said the ending was excellent, so I forced myself through the first half and trudged on to the next episodes, what did I get? A bunch of zilch in return. In the most basic sense this anime tried to pull off a Hyoudou Issei DxD-esque rescue-person-in-another-world plotline and let\'s just say much like the rest of the anime, they ruined it. Plain and simple. A cliched villain, ***MINOR SPOILER: whom we don\'t see the face of at all, for no absolute reason...END SPOILER*** a cliched adventure, a cliched set of pointless fanservice yet again (that excuse won\'t work anymore my friend, this half was plot-time, and a whole lot of plot holes. If you compare the amount of plot holes in this anime to a beggar\'s clothes only 2 times out of 10 will the beggar\'s clothes have more holes than this plot, which by the way is the score this anime deserves for a terrible story line. I\'ll end with a weak joke, it was ""a border to hell"". There you go, obligatory hell joke in anime about hell is obligatory.Art: 3/10I think I know why I immediately understood who the studio was because it was a mess as usual from Studio feel. The familiar washed-out artstyle and horrible effects immediately pointed feel. toward me and I wasn\'t surprised that I was right (although I was kind of surprised). Going in detail on those aforementioned reasons, even at 720p it looked washed-out. This is a familiar tactic used by the lazy art directors at feel. and I remember this clearly since SNAFU S2 where they ruined an excellent artstyle (courtesy Brain\'s Base for the excellent first season) and that was seen here as well. As for the effects, the characters had to perform action sequences and throw spells at each other, those required effects at a good level and feel underdelivered. They looked like something a rookie would make, no joke. It looked terrible to be honest and the washed-out artstyle made it even worse. And don\'t get me started on that horribly lazy tactic used in between episodes 9 to 11 as a green background almost everywhere to save time and be more lazy. As for character design, I can say that was the saving grace of this section and if not for the character design, it would\'ve gotten a one, once again no joke. You can clearly see some effort (perhaps the only effort) out into the art into the characters. They looked vibrant, cheery and better than the rest of the art section in general. I personally like the shades of colours used for everyone, especially Quele, Lisara and Iria. Other than that... Well nothing positive so let\'s end here.Sound. 4/10At best I could describe the sound section as decent. Apart from that massively forgettable OP/ED (although I must admit later on the ED was kinda catchy, but kinda) the OST too couldn\'t figure itself out. You won\'t believe me if I tell you that the sound changed EVERY episode. Not a good sign when you\'ve got sub-par story and art scores. The VAs more or less did their job decently which is why I\'ve given a 4 and not a 2. On the other hand like I said the OST was a mess, especially the BGM.Character: 1/10Woah, this is the first time I\'ve ever used 1s 2s and maybe 3s in a review ever. Well, I can say that the characters were promising at first but it\'s what happened to then later which made me give them this outrageous number. They took that potential and threw it down the garbage and shoved it down your throat. If you want an easy example to understand through, this is it. I\'m already severely disappointed in TsunDeres and our Rias Gremory wannabe Lisara Rest-whatever was a painfully bad TsunDere. Apart from being a 99.9% Tsun, that .01% came through in the last Episodes and if you think that\'s enough to make me change my mind, well you\'re sadly mistake.I still can\'t believe what made people think that ending was any good. Personally I\'d be glad if it went the way of the ""bad guys"" since that way I could have been a bit more generous in my scoring but then this HAD to go the typical Shounen route. Anyway, speaking of Shounen, we move to Erosuke, I mean Ryousuke, unlike Hyoudou Issei, this guy was a hilarious attempt at a pervert MC. Forget about his cliched energy, the way he got his power among many other things made me feel like banging my head on a table. As for the denseness, a thing noticed in many romance anime, well I can say this sole reason is the one I\'m giving a 1 and not none. As for the other jokes we move to our onee-sama cliche \'imouto\', Quele. I rooted for her throughout the anime (I moved on from Mina due to reasons I\'ll detail later) but then after that pathetic fanservice scene in the second half I LOATHED her as well.

It follows this guy whos an extreme pervert and the death god (female of course) that he lives with.This show is one of those where the writers might have gotten a little out of control with their rights. I mean the whole basis is that the death god cant live on earth without replenishing energy so she decides to make a contract where she can suck his energy out. Thing is, for him to energize himself (heres where the fanserve comes into play) he has to be turned on/horny/have a raging boner etc....and to accomplish this he basically runs around copping a feel on anyone he sees and meanwhile there is supposed to be some touching romance story going on in the background... btw this is kinda a harem in a sense. Even better is the fact that the girls' clothing is like a meter for how much energy they have left, for instance if one uses a big attack, or something happens to deplete a large bit of energy, her clothes disapear... granted they start out in spandex so really its not like we couldnt already see everything anyway...Oh and i cant believe i didnt bring this up till now, but the main guy is going to die. That is why he agreed to help the death god because she said if he did she'd save his life when his time inevitably comes in 3 months.To keep shit interesting there are some fight scenes, betrayals, a big showdown, a near-apocalyptic disaster, and a friggin ton of titty flashes. Everything culminates in the final episode (as it does in most anime) and it was that episode (wont talk about it for spoilers) that took my opinion of this show from okay to pretty good. Honestly I had no idea how it was going to end until it was over and thats just how I like it to be. and to accomplish this he basically runs around copping a feel on anyone he sees and meanwhile there is supposed to be some touching romance story going on in the background... btw this is kinda a harem in a sense.

I do not have any idea and I would dread reviewing this as much as forcing myself to watch this 12 episodes of cringe-worthy recycled anime.I have always been dubious of action and ecchi genres being lumped together because in my opinion, I would not be able to focus on the action if there's panties shots or exposed breasts every few seconds on the screen which is much reflected in most of the anime having these two genres together. I believe that there's a fine line between focusing on the action or focusing on the ecchi...portion (no homo).Dakara Boku wa , H ga Dekinai (copy pasted because I'm much more familiar with the english title) is your standard generic anime. Our main character which I can't even remember the name because most or otherwise all of the characters in this series being bland as a 2D cardboard, chanced upon a death god named Lisara whom -- ahh fuck this. Let's just make it simple - guy meets girl , girl starts to hate the guy but requires his help in order to accomplish her goal. That's it.The story basically revolves around Lisara battling against monsters in the same old recycled fashion until probably episode 8? It literally went down like -1) encounters monster , Lisara change to her demon suit or whatever it's called2) she loses and for some reason loses her clothes every time (convenient fanservice almost equivalent that of queen's blade)3) main character comes and provide eropower to Lisara4) Lisara powers up5) ???6) ProfitThere, I summarized the first 8 episodes for you in 6 lines. Oh and did I forget to mention? The main character provides energy to Lisara by the power of ero! How original. No, this is not doused with sarcasm because the only series that I can remember doing this is probably Highschool DxD ( oh how we love Issei and his oppais)The story then finally breaks free from this recycled over and over loop which I would call it the 'Bleach loop' after episode 8. However, by then all my interest in this show have already been depleted by the horrendous past 8 episodes that I literally had to force myself to watch the remaining 4 episodes which starts to get a little more interesting than watching weed grow.The art is most likely the taking point of this show as bright colors and flashly effects were used and the character designs are marvellous. The soundtrack was good but nothing too memorable, voice acting wise was generic as well. Talking about the character designs, brings me to my next point - the characters... (I can't even remember their names except for Lisara because she was probably the only one with actual personality). But the cast consist of our usual ecchi protagonist who is a pervert, a big-boobed character which happens to be his childhood friend and offers nothing but fanservice almost identical to Orihime. A loli whose tits are for some reason censored unlike the rest of the cast and Lisara ( did I miss anyone else? ).As for Lisara's character, at first glance, she's almost as flat as the other characters. No I'm not referring to her tits which is probably the main highlight of the show - tits. But as the series progresses and her interactions with the generic main character reveals that she is much more than a walking flesh of fanservice because she has a reason to stick with the MC until she accomplishes her goal.Overall, I would highly recommend against watching this anime unless you prefer those animes with needless amounts of fanservice and fanservice sprinkled on top and one which may require to turn your brain off while watching. It's not worth grinding through the first eight episodes for a barely decent plot. While some may say that there's humour within the first eight episodes to keep the viewer entertained, I cannot stress enough the amount of recycled plotlines that even the funniest joke of all can become dull. portion (no homo).Dakara Boku wa , H ga Dekinai (copy pasted because I'm much more familiar with the english title) is your standard generic anime.

After watching the first episode me being a huge harem fan expected great things from this show. However with time all my expectations were shot down and flushed down the toilet making me regret ever watching this in the first place.Plot 2/10The plot was so bad it was almost disgusting that the producers could come up with this garbage and try to pass it off as a decent story. What turned me off the most was that...the story was decent until about episode 7 and it felt like something was thrown in the faces off all the fans with poor story telling and replacing the plot with pure fanservice. All the seriousness of the anime was taken out and replaced by flat chests, big boobs and girls stripping every 5 seconds for completely no reason (atleast they had an excuse before) thus leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Not to mention by doing so nothing made sense and I have no idea how I was able to set to this ""Completed"" on my list.Characters 4/10If I was to go through all the characters and make a list of all the traits they have and my feelings toward them, my list would look sort of like...----->Borderline Sex-Offender , Shallow , Annoying , Stuck Up , ""Closet Pervert"" , ""Just Die Already"", ""No One Likes You""And that\'s just me being nice. All the characters are unlikable,, unrealistic, and almost pitiable. The only reason for the 4 is being of the character designs.Art 9/10If there was one thing I could praise ""So, I Can\'t Play H!"" for, it would be its art. Its nice too look at, easy on the eyes and at times stunning. It was very well done. To be honest it didn\'t deserve it.Sound 8/10The Sound was another plus for me. I enjoyed the music throughout the series and enjoyed the OP and Ed with the OP giving me that Accel World feeling.Overall 5/10 (Rounded Up)Thinking back this might be one of the worst things I\'ve ever seen but I can still name a few more animes that I feel are much worse than this. I also might be being too critical of this. It had a great start and a lot of potential. However it feels like all that was pushed aside by all the needless fanservice and random ecchi devices thrown in. I Recommend this to anyone who loves fanservice, anyone wants to laugh at a bad anime, or anyone who has the extreme power to sit through 12 episodes of this nonsense. the story was decent until about episode 7 and it felt like something was thrown in the faces off all the fans with poor story telling and replacing the plot with pure fanservice.

Not for the best though.THE STAFF- Animated by Feel, a studio that makes only shitty ecchi anime.- Directed by Takahashi Takeo, the guy who also did the somewhat nice Spice and Wolf, but is otherwise just another guy deep into passable ecchi titles.- Based on a light novel, which means a light story. And in this case, just another Shana clone.Just from the get-go, you already know it will be...a dumb story full of ecchi that you will be watching for the fan service.SPECIFICSOk guys, it’s based on a light novel, so there is an 80% probability it will have characters and plot almost identical to that of Shakugan no Shana. Not that Shana was the first anime with that formula (that praise goes to 3X3 Eyes) but it is the one that established it back in the good old days when anime were good and initiated a long line of copycats just because it made a million bucks.And indeed this is yet another such clone. It even came out at around the same time Campione, and Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero did and you clearly see it’s the same thing with slight variations. And the problem is that they all don’t have a loli tsundere voiced by Rie Kugimiya, neither amazing production values. Well, the artwork is good if your expectations don’t go beyond lots of milk cows and random things exploding and clothes ripping apart without hurting the female skin beneath. Other than that, there is nothing eye catchy besides lots of low quality visual effects and done to death school sceneries. In a similar way, the soundtrack is not bad if you have no problem with mediocre pop you won’t give a damn about after it’s all over. As I said, nothing stands too much so in order to sell they just throw in EXCESSIVE FAN SERVICE.The plot is quite basic, even for a Shana clone. Some guy has some power, some fiery redhaired slut wants it, sexual tension builds up, and monsters attack. The only thing that stands out is simply the huge sex drive the protagonist has, which is used as a power up for the tsundere. I mean, really, this guy is as horny as it gets, he never misses the chance to say sleazy stuff to pretty girls or jump to grab some skin. This automatically makes him a hundred times better than your typical wimp protagonist of modern anime and half as good as a decent anime character with depth and maturity.Oh well, better than nothing. I like the idea of how he must be turned on every time they are going to fight but never climax while battling so his empowerment won’t drop to zero. Man, that’s one of the worst tortures know to man, lol. Of course like all running jokes it eventually gets old, since he is after boobs every five minutes and never actually has any sex.The only other two characters that stand out are his childhood friend, dash, girl next door, which is shy and has a humongous rack but otherwise feels very secured and comfortable being next to a deviant bastard who doesn’t miss the chance to dehumanize her gender. The second one is, of course, the redhaired slut who is after his libido in order to be a stronger fighter, as she is looking for yet another special person in his school. For that reason alone she puts up with enough sexual harassment to be sentenced to castration by most courts in the world. She too of course likes him. I guess the females in this show deserve to be treated as rape targets if they only dig such types of males.In a similar fashion all the antagonists in the show are after the hornyness of the protagonist as means to beat the tsundere, and they are all conveniently pretty chicks who don’t miss the chance to whore-ify themselves in order to… steal his energy source. And yes, I know this is just guilty pleasure but it sure does not make any of the characters sympathetic or developed in any significant way.Anyways, this is obviously a dumb show you will watch for the porn aspect of it. Every episode is just some poor excuse for some bimbos to have a catfight where their clothes shred all too easy, and the protagonist saving the day by getting horny and molesting them; the end. Oh, and typically everything they trash in a battle gets magically corrected afterwards, so there isn’t even any repercussions for whatever you do in this show. Meaning, the protagonist saves the world daily, has the fun of his life when groping girls, entire buildings get trashed, monsters attack, and nothing changes by the end of the day, besides needing to seriously ejaculate from all this shit. The perfect escapism show where you run away from responsibilities.As usual, it turns a bit darker and more serious towards the end but by then you have lost all interest and respect for the show, so it doesn’t matter in any significant way. Instead of feeling dramatic it looks like a completely ridiculous attempt at making something nice out of something trashy. In all, it is a throw away anime you will watch only if you are really bored and want something very contrived and brainless.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 5/10Analysis: General Artwork 1/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 0/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 0/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 0/1, Sound 0/2, Story 1/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 3/10 a dumb story full of ecchi that you will be watching for the fan service.SPECIFICSOk guys, it’s based on a light novel, so there is an 80% probability it will have characters and plot almost identical to that of Shakugan no Shana.

I like the idea of how he must be turned on every time they are going to fight but never climax while battling so his empowerment won’t drop to zero. Man, that’s one of the worst tortures know to man, lol. Of course like all running jokes it eventually gets old, since he is after boobs every five minutes and never actually has any sex.The only other two characters that stand out are his childhood friend, dash, girl next door, which is shy and has a humongous rack but otherwise feels very secured and comfortable being next to a deviant bastard who doesn’t miss the chance to dehumanize her gender. The second one is, of course, the redhaired slut who is after his libido in order to be a stronger fighter, as she is looking for yet another special person in his school. For that reason alone she puts up with enough sexual harassment to be sentenced to castration by most courts in the world. She too of course likes him. I guess the females in this show deserve to be treated as rape targets if they only dig such types of males.In a similar fashion all the antagonists in the show are after the hornyness of the protagonist as means to beat the tsundere, and they are all conveniently pretty chicks who don’t miss the chance to whore-ify themselves in order to… steal his energy source. And yes, I know this is just guilty pleasure but it sure does not make any of the characters sympathetic or developed in any significant way.Anyways, this is obviously a dumb show you will watch for the porn aspect of it. Every episode is just some poor excuse for some bimbos to have a catfight where their clothes shred all too easy, and the protagonist saving the day by getting horny and molesting them; the end. Oh, and typically everything they trash in a battle gets magically corrected afterwards, so there isn’t even any repercussions for whatever you do in this show. Meaning, the protagonist saves the world daily, has the fun of his life when groping girls, entire buildings get trashed, monsters attack, and nothing changes by the end of the day, besides needing to seriously ejaculate from all this shit. The perfect escapism show where you run away from responsibilities.As usual, it turns a bit darker and more serious towards the end but by then you have lost all interest and respect for the show, so it doesn’t matter in any significant way. Instead of feeling dramatic it looks like a completely ridiculous attempt at making something nice out of something trashy. In all, it is a throw away anime you will watch only if you are really bored and want something very contrived and brainless.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 5/10Analysis: General Artwork 1/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 0/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 0/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 0/1, Sound 0/2, Story 1/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 3/10', ""Alright listen up.I'm going to start this review by introducing myself.

Dakara Boku wa H ga Dekinai is an excellent well made enjoyable harem anime. The characters are my favorite part of this anime and it is one of the few harems that actually have a good ending. Usually harem animes end with a cliffhanger and no sequel which is really annoying in my opinion and that is why I liked this anime so...much. It had a really good ending and some enjoyable moments. The art style is good, The sound is outstanding. It is worth your 5 hours. trust me! In no way is it a masterpiece but it is a solid example of doing it right in its genre.Alright this is an example of the quick reviews Ill be doing in the future.Peace. much.

It started off great and reminded me of High School DxD which is by far my favourite anime ever. The first few episodes from about 6-8 where great but then it started to slip.... I enjoyed the humour but by this time it was almost always completely serious.I finally got to the end and cried my eyes out. How could they do that it was so devastating. I took everything down to a six except for the Art and the Sound but then...realised that there was 1 OVA episode. So I watched that and was very happy with it  so I raised it up to a 8. Keep in mind that if i had not seen that OVA episode than I would have not been satisfied at all even if it was in the actual show than I would not have changed the score of it. OVA episodes make me feel great and I love them.Thanks for making an outstandingly great Anime, I really enjoyed watching it and I am sure anyone else who watched it would too. realised that there was 1 OVA episode.

It was great if not for some of the cliche stuff that\'s in most harem/ecchi animeBut the synopsis on the show is totally wrong.The only thing that\'s right is that she takes is ""special energy""but even then she does it when he gives it to her...except when he\'s being too perverted then she stoles it to make him pass out. ', 'First off i want to make clear that the synopsis of this anime couldn\'t be more wrong than the way it is written on this site. Having said this, I\'ll write a proper one as it\'s technically the plot.Story 8 / 10Ryosuke Kaga is a 2nd year student at Momozomo Academy. He\'s a extreme fan of erotica, and praises women for their bodies and believes them to be treasures. He\'s kind to every girl and shows concern, However he has the habit of speaking his mind out loud and his reputation as a pervert grows everyday, As he not only compliments girls good looks, but...also emphasizes on how they\'re erotic and creeps out every girl in sight.One day on his way back home he sees a petite red haired beauty standing right outside his house on the middle of the rain, He however can\'t allow this so he\'s corteus to her and invites her in his home. This girl however is a pro at what she does, As it just happens, She is a ""Shinigami"" or a Death Goddess, At least that\'s what she call her self, As Ryosuke was prepared to make his move, She stabs him with half of a blade that allows her to make contracts and temporal contracts with humans to sustain her existence on the human world as for any visitor from ""Grimwald"" her world.Ryosuke can dissolve the contract at any time, and at first he\'s reluctant to believe what she is, That\'s before they\'re attacked by organism that belong to her world, She begins to fight the organism and takes some of  his energy and quickly defeats it.Lisara Restall is the Grim Reaper name, Her world is suffering an energy shortage and her mission is to find ""The One"" a human capable of producing unfathomable amount of energy that would benefit her world greatly and mission.Ryosuke as i said can back out, But then she releases shocking news,She Possesses the ability to knows how long people have left to live just by looking, Ryosuke has only 3 months left to live, Now if he helps her, She can use ""The Ones"" energy to renew his life, Or he could perv out and wait for his for his number to be called. Peoples energy usually comes from a driving force, His is erotism, Now every time she uses his energy he will be incapable of getting excited ""Downstairs"" for a time. Things never stay business between a hot reaper and a perv human partner, Things tend to tangle and along the way many things happen.Art 9 / 10The art is above average and smooth. Very enjoyable.Sound 8 / 10The voice actors are very good and the sound tracks are very much on point.Characters 8 / 10Very developed and enjoyable.Enjoyment 8 / 10I enjoyed this anime very much, I\'d recommend it to anyone out there that enjoys the Ecchi Genre with some romance.Overall 9 / 10The anime itself it\'s great, A lot of ideas. It portrays a relationship that start as business and end up in romance. This anime is very serious on story line, It makes good use of Fan Service and the expected ""Ecchi"", This saddly cripples the story as for some of the material used in this anime, Was needed if it were to be a extended anime, The only mistake here is that they tried to fit way to much in such short space.I\'m certain that in a 24Ep anime this would have been quite the anime, But on my view this cramping dropped it to an (9). Which is the overall i\'m giving the anime. Why an (9), Well you gotta be made of STONE to no like this anime, It has a little bit of everything, So much that what you find lacking, It another quality fills the gap and continuously keep going, With proper Comedy, Drama, Ecchiness, Harem, Romance that rotate back and forth and fill up the gaps. also emphasizes on how they\'re erotic and creeps out every girl in sight.One day on his way back home he sees a petite red haired beauty standing right outside his house on the middle of the rain, He however can\'t allow this so he\'s corteus to her and invites her in his home.

I like the general concepts used in the show despite how plane and uninspired as they are.It uses concepts like protection fields and energy sources much like Shakugan no Shana but with little to no character depth and lots of nudity. The show lacks on drama and any really urgent dangers involved since over half the season is just them beating generic bad guys and stumbling around naked.The art is not above or below standard its actually fair when it comes to the anime standards. The characters are drawn attractively and given provocative clothes with...some strange additions that make me wonder why. Namely the horn on Iria concerns me,it looks bizarre. In the very first episode there was a few really well done scenes that really added depth to the atmosphere but as the show progressed it got really generic. It spends all to much time at the school yard, a very overused setting with a very bland appearance.The music is actually to my liking in this show, its catchy and it accompany s each scene really well for what its trying to convey. The characters voices are all well chosen and really convey there personalities but the main character ryosuke is just over the top annoying. His character in general is but the voice that goes with it despite being exactly what id expect from that sort of person just grates on my nerves.The characters, all the females are well done. They have all the aspects you need for a harem styled fan service show like this. They fill out all the arch types and nothings overly original because of it sadly. The main character Ryosuke is what i consider the greatest failing of the series, hes just so excited and annoying to hear speak. Everything seems so positive or so negative with him and its just a very turbulent character that just destroys the rhythm and scheme of the show. The worst part is there trying to develop him into the standard hero but maintain the fact hes a pervert. They are trying to develop him into the standard unexpected hero and there gonna make sure to remind us how humble he is by reaffirming how perverted he is in the end of it all. The character just feels so predictable and they make him annoying to top it off.Enjoyment of this show is mild. Its a fan service show masquerading as a action adventure. The women get nude every episode by goop monsters and Ryosuke upon seeing them gets his libido going and he saves the day with a restoration of energy. Rinse wash repeat and you have this entire series. It is what it is and i can only say the show is fine, not great,not terrible but just ordinary.

This anime isn't really special but I liked it anyway. "", ""Part 1 EnglishPart 2 Bahasa Indonesia--------------------------------------Alright, let's take a gander at Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai, shall we? First off, let's talk about the story. It's your typical harem anime with a sprinkle of supernatural elements, and while it's not breaking any new ground, it's still a fun romp if you're into that sort of thing. I mean, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned love triangle, right?Moving on to the art style, it's not exactly groundbreaking either, but it gets the job done. The character designs are decent, and the animation is smooth enough. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about...either.Now, let's talk about the three main characters. You've got your standard dense male protagonist who can't seem to pick up on any of the girls' advances, your classic tsundere who's all bark and no bite, and your mysterious girl who's hiding a dark secret. It's like they pulled these character archetypes out of a hat, but hey, they work.As for the voice acting, it's... adequate. The actors do a decent enough job bringing the characters to life, but there's nothing particularly outstanding about it.The music, on the other hand, is pretty forgettable. I couldn't tell you a single track that stood out to me, but then again, I wasn't really paying that much attention to it either.Overall, I'd give a solid 5.4 out of 10. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. If you're a fan of harem anime and don't mind a little supernatural twist, then give it a shot. But if you're looking for something truly exceptional, you might want to look elsewhere.That's it from me, folks. Until next time, keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the anime remote.--------------------------------------Baiklah, mari kita lihat Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai, ya? Pertama-tama, mari kita bicara tentang ceritanya. Ini adalah anime harem biasa dengan sedikit unsur supernatural, dan meskipun tidak memecahkan hal-hal baru, ini masih merupakan petualangan yang menyenangkan jika Anda suka dengan jenis anime seperti itu. Saya rasa, siapa yang tidak suka dengan segitiga cinta klasik, kan?Beralih ke gaya seninya, tidak ada yang benar-benar mengesankan, tetapi gaya seninya cukup baik. Desain karakternya bagus, dan animasinya cukup lancar. Tidak ada yang istimewa, tapi tidak ada juga yang bisa dikeluhkan.Sekarang, mari kita bicara tentang tiga karakter utamanya. Anda memiliki protagonis pria yang bodoh standar yang sepertinya tidak bisa memahami tanda-tanda cinta dari para gadis, tsundere klasik yang semua bicara dan tanpa gigitan, dan gadis misterius yang menyembunyikan rahasia gelap. Rasanya seperti mereka mengambil arketipe karakter ini dari topi, tapi ya, mereka berhasil.Untuk pengisi suaranya, cukup memadai. Aktor-aktornya cukup baik membawa karakter-karakter menjadi hidup, tetapi tidak ada yang terlalu luar biasa tentangnya.Namun, musiknya agak mudah dilupakan. Saya tidak bisa memberi tahu satu lagu pun yang menonjol bagi saya, tapi sebenarnya saya juga tidak terlalu memperhatikannya.Secara keseluruhan, saya akan memberikan nilai 5,4 dari 10. Ini tidak mengerikan, tetapi tidak luar biasa juga. Jika Anda penggemar anime harem dan tidak keberatan dengan sedikit twist supernatural, maka cobalah. Tetapi jika Anda mencari sesuatu yang benar-benar luar biasa, Anda mungkin ingin mencari di tempat lain.Itu saja dari saya.

The story revolves around a Shinegami coming to Earth to meet him in search of The One, and several ecchi shenanigans pursue this encounter.As to why I recommend this show, is the same as why I enjoyed watching ""Renai Flops"": they are both fun shows with likeable, cute, fun to watch, and funny main characters. You end up wandering what...is to happen to Ryosuke and htat\'s a great feat to achieve in an anime. is to happen to Ryosuke and htat\'s a great feat to achieve in an anime.', 'This review is written after watching Episode 8. It may be subject to change as more episodes come out.While I enjoy the overall plot, I feel that it\'s incredibly predictable. Everything in the entirety is, like I said, incredibly predictable. Initially, the story was kind of ""Meh."" but, in the recent episodes, it has started to get better. I feel like it actually has a story since about episode 4.Before I talk about the art, I\'d just like to point out; this is an Ecchi anime, *at one point, borderline hentai. Anyways, being an ecchi anime, expect a lot of breasts and tons of panty...shots. Now, I am a fan of fanservice (Go figure, right?) so, I will not judge the show on that.But enough about that, let\'s move on to the art.The overall art is nothing spectacular, but not bad. I have never judged an anime based on art (With the exception of Lucky Star) but there are some very nice moments. In Grimworld, the art style changes significantly and actually looks pretty good.Because I don\'t judge animes on art, this section is short and sweet.Skipping over trivial things like Sound, the characters are copy, paste from loads of other harems.Without saying names, I am going to list the ""Character Types"" and you can assume who goes with what. While you\'re at it, think of these same Character Types for other animes...The Tsundere, The Childhood Friend, The Shy One, The Eccentric One.All in all, the show is pretty light-hearted, and does not take itself too seriously.

I mean, the plot looks like a kid\'s show with the pervet scenes. All episodes are the same:Wild monster, they start off losing, then the protagonist uses his ""Hentai Power"" and kill the monster.

The characters are too much mainstream:A tsundere girlA pervert guy as portagonistA childhood friendAnd so on.The sound is fairly good, neither good or bad. ', ""Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! Today's title is a bit interesting in that it's pretty firmly in the ecchi genre and does little to break away from the mundane checklist most harem ecchi shows follow. Yet there is a touch of uniqueness in the second half that gives it a slight edge over the tons of DxD copycats out there. Let's break it down before death claims us all.Story: 6In the first half of the series we have just complete and utter cliches. Hot redhead who is supernatural/related to demons? Check. Childhood best friend that's madly in love with the MC? Yep. Enemies...defeated and absorbed into the harem? Of course. Lots of panty flashes and topless nudity? Spot on. Finally we have a MC that is quite literally powered by being a pervert, with special interests seemingly on girls' breast sizes.Because reasons, a shinigami (death god, erm goddess) finds herself on earth and powerless against her foes. She comes across the horndog MC, and forms a temporary bond with him to survive. Of course his lust is overpowering, surprising the girl. As the show goes on, we see several instances where the MC powers up the girl by having dirty thoughts, giving her the needed edge to defeat either the other supernatural girls, or these weird tentacle monsters that seem to be after her. His hornyness is so pronounced that he can inject her with great power, and whereas it would take most humans several days to regain their strength, it only takes him a matter of minutes as he fantasizes the girls doing sexy things. He's able to charge even faster if he manage to grope any girl's tits, which he actually does pull off a few times.So far, so DxD-ish right? However, once we get past the 'girl fight of the week' and the harem is well established, the show switches gears on us and becomes about saving the MC (who everyone has fallen for of course) from his imminent death. Instead of the usual 'save the damsel' line, we get the girls moving to try to save the guy instead. The plot after this shift, say around episode 7 or so, changes the entire mood of the series. While it still remains highly trope-ish, this new wrinkle adds enough depth to it to make finishing the series bearable. Come for the boobs, and stay for the surprisingly interesting plot that finally develops over the second half of the series.Of course the story is far from perfect, we still have a girl who is close to the primary female in the devil realm, only for her to betray her not long after hitting the human world. Instead of getting a severe ass beating, the primary girl dismisses the event, and the two faced girl suddenly becomes a harem member. The treason girl forms a contract for her own energy with the MC's childhood friend, who of course cannot bring herself to openly admit her intense feelings for the MC. She's just happy to be around, even when the MC is obviously falling for the primary girl.And of course the monsters/enemies being sent to destroy the primary girl or the harem are of course tentacle monsters. We get some very typical hentai-like shots of the tentacle monsters holding the various girls before they regain their power and defeat the beasts. So yeah, we're looking at a great deal of fanservice for absolute sure. And even through the fanservice, there is a story, though flimsy at best at times, running throughout. It's not Shakespeare but it manages to stand on its own in a rather overcrowded genre.Art: 7The art looks good of course. It's not super high end, but it's good enough for the show's purpose. It's hard to have a show based on bare tits and panty shots if the art look horrible. The coloring is interesting, and the battle costumes the supernatural girls wear are pretty cool, even if they are quite skimpy, and prone to being ripped to shreds at the drop of a hat. While some of the characters suffer from blimp sized tit syndrome, oddly enough the primary girl does not. And the girls who are stacked don't always have their breasts jiggling around like they were made of Jello. Overall it's the kind of quality one would expect from the title's genre.Sound: 6The opening and closing themes are fun but forgettable, though the background track does use sound effects and music to heighten the tension or feelings regarding various scenes. The voice actors are all pretty spot on, but my biggest knock was all the yelling. The MC is constantly yelling about being horny or about girls' bodies and all that. The primary girl is constantly shouting about him being such a perverted weirdo. It did get grating after a while.Character: 5As I said, the characters are for the most part cliche. The primary girl being a powerful shimigami with red hair smacks of Rias the demon heiress of DxD. She of course falls in love with the MC but tries her best to hide it, and often denies her feelings to others and even herself in the aforementioned shouting. She's not like Rias in the department of constantly coming on to the MC however. Also, for her to be a member of the ruling family of the underworld/hell/whatever, she does seem to be a good deal underpowered. She's often near defeat and only pulls out victory because the MC gropes her breasts or thinks dirty thoughts. On her own, you would expect her to be more dangerous, but she's not much of a match for any of the other girls/harem members in a one on one, no power refilling match. It is kind of cute that she does get so embarrassed about her feelings and all, instead of throwing her lust at the MC from beginning to end, as is common in the genre.The traitor girl is kind of odd in that she was able to secure a contract for power with the MC's best friend when she clearly attacked both him and the primary girl. She didn't seem to have any concerns over sparing him or keeping him safe, so why would the girl with the secret crush help out someone who was previously so very hostile to her love interest? Nor is it really explained why she made the about-face in becoming friends with the primary girl after being defeated. She was said to have been the primary girl's best friend in the Underworld, which makes sense, because she was secretly looking for a way to topple the primary girl's family from leadership so her own could take the stage. After all that, one ass kicking brings her to abandon those ambitions and throw her lot in with the harem? Not making very much sense there.The childhood friend is also a little on the underwritten side. She's always been in love with the MC, but never told him so. She's also our queen of super tits, as the quiet ones tend to be. She knows of his perverted ways and is accepting of them, to the point where they openly talk about her breast size and what cup size she is wearing. She's also the unassuming one in glasses who just wants to make the guy she loves happy. She's a likable character, just seems odd that she wouldn't have made her move before the show began, or expressed herself in some way. If a guy looks at a girl and tells her he's been raptly watching her breasts grow for years, that's kind of an opening for developing a relationship. Either that or getting the piss knocked out of ya.The other busty supernatural girl gets her power somehow from a life insurance company? It's....odd. She has a stable power level and is pretty ferocious, but again, as always, folds after she witnesses the awesome power delivered by the MC's lustful ways.All in all, we have some pretty cookie cutter character types, but there's enough hints thrown in to give them more personality than 'girl with big boobs' or 'girl with glasses' or what have you.Enjoyment: 6Even with all the knocks, it was an enjoyable story, I do admit being a fan of the genre (among many other genres) and liked how the story went down. It might not be DxD quality, but it sure as hell isn't as grating as say, Valkyrie Drive Mermaid. This was obviously created for younger males and it serves it's purpose well enough. I'm not a younger man anymore, but I can still appreciate good fanservice, and as I've mentioned before, I do dig the supernatural, especially dealing with religious iconography such as angels and demons and all. I know some people's scoring system (and at times even my own) often make a six out to be abysmal. No, six is still above average, if only by a little bit. I don't regret watching the show, and I did get a laugh or two from it, but it just is what it is, kind of middle of the road.Best Girl: Okura Mina. Yes, I said the childhood friend is kinda thin character wise, but she's just so innocent and cute I couldn't help but really like her. And being stacked like a brick shit house never hurts either.I say give it a spin, especially if you like fanservice/ecchi content. Just know that it actually does pick up a bit of a plot before it's over, you just have to wait for it. It's not a hard thing to wait for either, as the 'monster girl of the week' is mildly entertaining as well, and leads to some really funny moments. But don't come expecting anything more than the standard points nearly all ecchi/harems follow. It treads well worn ground, but does so with just enough spring in its steps to justify another trip down that old road. I say it's worth a try at the very least. defeated and absorbed into the harem? Of course. Lots of panty flashes and topless nudity? Spot on. Finally we have a MC that is quite literally powered by being a pervert, with special interests seemingly on girls' breast sizes.Because reasons, a shinigami (death god, erm goddess) finds herself on earth and powerless against her foes. She comes across the horndog MC, and forms a temporary bond with him to survive. Of course his lust is overpowering, surprising the girl. As the show goes on, we see several instances where the MC powers up the girl by having dirty thoughts, giving her the needed edge to defeat either the other supernatural girls, or these weird tentacle monsters that seem to be after her. His hornyness is so pronounced that he can inject her with great power, and whereas it would take most humans several days to regain their strength, it only takes him a matter of minutes as he fantasizes the girls doing sexy things. He's able to charge even faster if he manage to grope any girl's tits, which he actually does pull off a few times.So far, so DxD-ish right? However, once we get past the 'girl fight of the week' and the harem is well established, the show switches gears on us and becomes about saving the MC (who everyone has fallen for of course) from his imminent death. Instead of the usual 'save the damsel' line, we get the girls moving to try to save the guy instead. The plot after this shift, say around episode 7 or so, changes the entire mood of the series.

At it\'s worst, it is iffy animation, cliched characters, mammoth sized plot holes, and is coated in a yellowish tinted world. All in all, I enjoyed this anime immensely, probably as much as any ecchi based show.The story.Well, as I said there are massive plot holes. And the story was kind of like a bunch of hero anime plots thrown in a blender to make a somewhat promising, but eventually...failing plot. It really just blew it\'s load too early, seemed to skip some parts that seemed important early on, and kind of fizzled out at the end. I hear this was based on the visual novels not the manga, so I may give those a read and see how the manga is. But, more importantly, as it is an ecchi comedy anime, I think we have to give the story less weight in general because there\'s just no sense in expecting a grand plot to go with all that fanservice. I give the story a 4.The art.The art was very good. I really liked that the main girl was not another girl with stupidly large boobs. They weren\'t tiny really, but a decent size. Only, I guess in ecchi show standards they are supposed to be considered very small. The other main characters are done well. The bad guy is a pretty lame effort, but I think that has more to do with him being a guy and also not actually having that much real screen time. Anyway, overall the art is good. The focus is on fanservice and battle scenes, and they do very well with both. In other scenes, especially after the first few episodes, it seems like some of the battle animations are reused a bit and the animation for regular scenes that are neither battles or heavy on fanservice are often poorly done. For these reasons I give the art a solid 7.Sound.The sound was great. From the OP, ED, effects, general songs used here and there, and the voice actors. Everything was really good. I can\'t find much fault in it so I give it a full 10.Characters.Meh, I\'m iffy on this category. The characters were mostly cliched harem types. The guy wasn\'t a total loser, even if he is incredibly perverted. He is the usual kind guy that shows his power when his girls are in trouble. He also makes a choice based on honesty and love in the end, which is kind of refreshing in the end, even if the last few episodes felt a bit out of place. The girls, well, if you\'ve seen harem/ecchi animes before, you probably know the types by heart already. They are all here, and offer little to no variation to the norm. The thing that I like here is that the main girl is neither loli or super annoying. She is the kind of girl I usually pull for in animes, though more often than not, that isn\'t the type that is chosen in the end. I\'ll give the characters a 6 because I like the main girl so much.Enjoyment.This is the standout factor for me. Ecchi comedies are supposed to be about enjoyment more than anything else, so instead of giving a heavy handed grade because the story didn\'t bring you to your knees, I feel like people should grade this type of show primarily on how much they enjoyed it. And I really enjoyed this one. It had me laughing right from the beginning. The comedy is great, and it keeps a fun edge on things even through the dramatic parts. Of course, I wouldn\'t have watched if I didn\'t like ecchi and this show doesn\'t disappoint on that front either. The fact that the main girl has good proportions that I prefer to the super skinny, super big boobed girls normally seen in these kinds of shows is icing on the cake. I have to admit that I was disappointed it took a few episodes for the show to just fizzle out, not to mention threw out most of the plot points completely in favor of a happy-go-lucky ending. Glad for the happy ending, but it just could have been better. Because I truly enjoyed the show despite it\'s flaws in the storyline, I still give a 10 for enjoyment.Overall, I really enjoyed the show, and as I said, I feel like this type of show needs to focus on enjoyment rather than being caught up in a thought provoking storyline. Of course, I\'m still waiting for a show with this level of ecchiness and a great story, but I\'m not holding my breath. I have to give an 8, because the issues with the story and the disappointing ending can\'t be translated into a better score. I\'m really glad to see a heroine that I truly enjoy in all respects, love the comedy, sound, and of course the fanservice. And, as Eroske said, ""Ero is justice."" failing plot.

Well it is So I can\'t play H.First of all, when you think Zenitsu (demon slayer) is perverted, well then you haven\'t met Ryousuke.Or have you? Anyway the voice actor is the same! And you can just feel it.With this anime i had multiple ""eeeeh aight"" moments. It is weird, has good fan service, tsundere, boobzilla childhood friend and a pervert. At the beginning of the show and the end it felt a lot like High School DxD with the redheads getting undressed and the...mc being perverted. The plot feels more mature than High School DxD, but because it has just 12 episodes it isn\'t very complicated. As for that they leave a lot of potential out. It\'s not bad, but it could have been better.The music taste for the episodes in the grim world is weird and sometimes annoying. The rest is good and the voice acting is done well to (I still hear Zenitsu tho).In most episodes you get your healthy portion of ecchi and a lot of weird fetishes, you get SM, bondage, exhibitionism, big boobs, bdsm and some poses. The anime could just been a long hentai. But as a Kill la Kill like experience, fan service/ ecchiness is plot. It is explained sometime and will come back in the last episode.The animation style is good and let\'s the girls shine, but that\'s about it. There is a weird filter over the screen which indicates something in the world is off but that didn\'t work out for me. The background is fairly simple and the monsters are just zombies fighting. I think the show would have better effects if it had more budget.This lighthearted short ecchi anime was interesting to watch.

I can only give it a fair 6/10. The first episodes where something else, outstanding but after a while it went downhill fast and the last episodes were very very bad. The lie mostly in other categories that affect the story but it really seems like a ripoff Highschool DXD, which just letting the anime community know trying to copy a successful anime title will only do harm. Taking the good things from it would aid your cause but I think that the bad things were taken mostly.

Pervert to the bone and in the end tries to be the hero without (excuse my language) the balls to be one. Treats all women equally, equally shit  that is. Bottom of the barrel pathetic rating well deserved 1/10.Quele, a sister which starts a little bad but progresses well in the story.

So me. Or...how I should be.

It\'s not the average person\'s masterpiece, but it is mine, and may be yours.This anime just breaks many (in my opinion dumb) anime paradigms, by *not* having an annoying, effeminate main character that avoids the women he\'s interested into, or never decides who he wants and ends up ""not biting any piece of the pie""; Ryosuke is simple and honest with everyone, and always keeps his goals ""pure"".

It has none of the annoying nonsense of luring the viewer into thinking something extraordinary he wants is going to happen over and over, and never happening.

With it's best feature being the main Female lead( Lisara) She has a character model i really like and i am a fan of her personality. She is one of the only reasons i found most of the show enjoyable.The first 5 or so episodes aren't bad. They are funny and have their own entertainment value to them. But from 6-11 the episodes are just so boring with nothing worth remembering.There's some dumb crap with two worlds merging and tons of people dying. Show tries to be all emotional with it...but just comes across as boring.For the first half the MC is alright but then he just becomes an idiot that get's other people injured cause of his mistakes. He also get's tons of people killed and i'm still not sure how it's his fault but what ever.I do like the relationship between the MC and the Female MC. I also enjoy the ending too this surprisingly.Overall an alright show that kind of turned into something else halfway through. but just comes across as boring.For the first half the MC is alright but then he just becomes an idiot that get's other people injured cause of his mistakes.

Overall,This was a stupid love awesome packed perverted anime that I mostly enjoyed!Thanks for reading my review!', ""As I sat through this anime I came to the conclusion that a series being enjoyable is not the same as it being good. For what this anime lacks in the departments of direction, storytelling, character development and sound design it certainly makes up in comedy and the likeability of the main female lead, Lisara.However, It is to my belief that this anime has too many problems for it ever to be possible to consider it a masterpiece.Story: Poor (3)I initially thought that the story was going to be good. Sadly, I encountered many problems that weren't apparent until after a couple of episodes: Certain...events and plot points are either contrived or poorly explained to the point that the audience (me) had no idea what was even going on. I can't really unveil any of the details, for that would require me to spoil a lot of the content.Art: Decent (4)See, I liked the overall art. The character designs weren't really unique or original, but they seemed to properly make the characters stand out in their respective enviorments and you could instantly tell them apart from each other. However, most of the time there was this green hue covering everything, making the anime seem as if it was covered in vomit. I don't know why this was included (because it wasn't explained), but it pissed me off a great deal.Sound: Pathetic (1).The ost was mediocre but not bad, and the opening was irritating and all over the place. The sound design was awful. I won't say much due to spoilers, other than that it was inconsistent.Characters: Mediocre (5)Not too bad I guess, except for the fact that most of the females would fall in love with the main character for no reason at all.Enjoyment: Fair (6)To conclude, there were a lot of problems here and there. There are good things to be mentioned about this anime, such as the comic relief and Lisara, whom I seriously thought to be the saving grace of this anime.Overall score: 5. Not awful, but nothing special in general. It is worth mentioning that the anime would've been better if it wasn't an ecchi harem. events and plot points are either contrived or poorly explained to the point that the audience (me) had no idea what was even going on.

That\'s pretty much the premise for this show. It\'s always interesting to see how far Japan is willing to push the boundary between ecchi and hentai, and this series does just that. So why is this series so poorly ranked? I shall borrow a few lines directly from the series:Antagonist: How is this happening?Protagonist: Didn\'t you know? A girl\'s scent is just as soft and gentle as boobs!!!Antagonist: NaniiiiiIIII??!?!It\'s this type of senseless dialogue and strange plot that alienates all who can still keep a level head after seeing...what is pretty much an endless stream of topless or otherwise unclothed girls. Though if that\'s all you\'re really looking for, feel free to dig in.Animation:Dakara is standard fare animation quality wise. Colors are nice and vibrant but there are scenes where they could have used some more background detail, and also some scenes that would have done better with less CGI. So basically Shinigami are (seemingly) mostly cute girl-like creatures that dress similar to the familiars in C (with weird head gear). These Shinigami transform their uniform in preparation for battles- but they\'re probably better of in street clothes as the clothes pretty much evaporate when they\'re low on power. Due to this, expect almost constant nudity throughout the entire series. Styling-wise, everyone is easily distinguishable though the constant addition of new characters is a bother.There\'s quite a bit of action with your standard magic elemental attacks though most of the time damage seems to be minimal (other than to the clothes of course). During battles, the Shinigami puts up what\'s equivalent to a fuzetsu from Shana and uses ""life"" energy to repair all damage done during the battle. As for ecchi, all the power for these attacks and abilities is sourced from humans, who apparently can increase their ""energy"" reserves based on what makes them interested. In the case of our protagonist, it\'s anything ecchi. Thus surprisingly, ecchi is actually baked in as a primary feature, rather than as just fan service, so expect it in large quantities here.Sound:The series opens with an energetic jpop song and ends with a catchy, somewhat playful ED. These fit the mood fine though aren\'t really collection-worthy. BGM is average overall withone track that you\'ll soon recognized as it\'s overused.VA performance overall was, as well, fairly standard. I can\'t really blame the VAs though as, as seen from the lines above, some of the dialogue is a bit dry/strange.Story:An ordinary dude (with an obligatory childhood friend next door) finds a mysterious, red-headed beauty standing in the rain outside his house. When he lets her in she tells him he has less than three months to live. However, if he agrees to form a Kurokami-like contract with her, a shinigami, she promises to save him. Her goal is to find a certain person who has a huge amount of energy (apparently famous people have more energy) at his school. How will she locate them? She has a Dragon-ball power-scanner-like device that measures people\'s energy.The story follows the pair as they seek out individuals as school and are attacked by other shinigami. The first half of the show is extremely predictable as it follows the same pattern of being attacked by an antagonist, who then somehow becomes an ally and an additional ""rival"" for the protagonist\'s harem. The story builds to a seeming climax around halfway through the show, and then the pacing goes awry. The show stops being an action-harem and transforms into an emo show not too different from the majority of Da Capo 2 SS. The story then, unconvincingly, tries to tie everything up with a last-minute climax that feels more like an afterthought. Finally, the show ends with the obligatory open-ended harem conclusion.The presentation of this story felt jarring at times. A lot of major events happened just because of conveniences. For instance, if the main character had moved 5 or so degrees left or right at the first climax, the result would have been very different. Another example is the power scouters. Just like in DBZ, humans can vary their power level depending on how they feel, so it feels really odd that the Shinigami have never noticed this fact. Overall, it really feels as if the director felt he could get away with short cuts, assuming the viewer was only focusing on the nude girls bouncing around the screen.Character:The picture doesn\'t get much better here as well. Most of the characters feel very generic, yet certain character behaviors and interactions feel contrived and unnatural. For example, our protagonist is a really cheerful and openly perverted dude. As in Kurokami, he learns in the series that his contract enables him to use certain powers as well. Empowered by this new ability, he becomes a brash warrior who thinks he can protect his shinigami, despite never having any real battle training. Fast forward a single episode and he becomes a shriveled wimp unable to leave his bed. These transitions are not adequately developed, leaving to a very artificial aftertaste for many of the characters.Due to the above issue, you never really feel that the characters are plausible, and thus don\'t try hard to relate. This dooms any efforts at bringing out the development of the characters, which is pretty minimal in the first place. Add the fact that secondary characters are introduced and, just as quickly, disappear and you have a recipe for a pretty poor performance.Value:Despite having an interesting twist to some established anime patterns, Dakara ends up failing in its execution; falling in the same bucket as other generic harems that go nowhere such as Champione and Hagure. The only characteristic that really sets this one apart is blatant nudity, and unless this is your thing, I\'d recommend skipping this one. what is pretty much an endless stream of topless or otherwise unclothed girls.

The real unnatural lewdness is with the main protagonist and his absurd fascination with the female body.Yet, even so, you can argue that a true knight will also care deeply about treasuring a woman, though, I don\'t think eroticism will be a key point. But it\'s funny that this guy doesn\'t cut corners and just says it forthright.Aside from the weak story that might as well not make sense at all, this anime at least had a good consistency from beginning to end. The story / lore is more like a place holder. It might as well be any ordinary story ever made. But it does its job. So good work.The REAL strengths in this anime is the romance and character interactions. That\'s where the 9 score is coming from. Like I said, Darling in the Franx had the same issue of having a weak story but a good base of characters and their motives. This anime is the same, and where other more ""serious"" productions miss their mark, this anime does a really good job at both comedy and serious scenes. The emotions of any ordinary higher production anime are all there, if you can get past the whole ""erotic"" edge.These characters are really great and memorable, except for the childhood friend. I found her the least interesting after the first 3 episodes when she was eventually out classed by all the other heroines.

I\'m back in the Ecchi genre of anime..Now I\'m going to give you a question before I start the review.. ""Are you a conservative type of person?"" I not, good for you.. Why? Because this is an ecchi anime.. Not only ecchi and harem but an uncensored one.. I noticed that the animation on ecchi animes today became uncensored. You know, they show the things that will make it look like an H anime but of course it\'s not H anime.. This series is a good example..I will give a short preview to give a short background of the series.. You see, there\'s...this boy (Ryossuke) who dedicated himself to serve the world for the sake of eroticism.. Well, to make it short, he is very erotic.. Then, one day he encountered a strange woman in front of their house.. That woman is Lisara and guess what.. she\'s a grim reaper..Ok here are my thoughts as I finished watching this anime..Story (8)It is a so so for me.. Sometimes I feel interested in the flow of things, sometimes not.. But, I\'m sure you are going to appreciate the story of this series as it reaches the ending parts.. Well, for me, as the story goes by it became different.. There is this ""betrayed expectation"" element that I feel I saw at the ending.. I recommend that when you are going bored, don\'t give up.. Honestly, I felt bored.. but still, I enjoyed..But, let me give you the one main reason why I watched this series.. Of course, it\'s the damn fan service.. This will not be considered ecchi if they are no fan service.. Well, in terms fan service, you will learn how to appreciate flat ones.. (If you know what I mean..) Hahaha!Art (8)It is another so so for me.. Sometimes the art is beautiful.. The girls look beautiful especially the close up views and the sexy views.. But, I noticed parts  wherein the animation is off.. Well, it does not affect the majority of the series..One more thing.. There is this feeling within me that there must be more... More eroticism.. More urghhh.. I can\'t say it.. heheheSound (6)I don\'t hate the theme songs but they don\'t spark any interest in me.. I just skipped them...Character (8)Well, its typical for an ecchi anime series that the male protagonist is either a maniac one or a very dense one.. In this case, we have a maniac one.. He is Ryossuke.. I enjoyed the element wherein he publicly claims that he is living an Ero life.. It\'s funny.. It\'s like a new lifestyle.. Though, you can\'t just do that in reality.. Ryo-san, You\'re freaking insane.. heheheIn terms of the girls, I think its first time for me to see a lead female character in a ecchi series who isn\'t a busty one.. I\'m referring of course to Lisara.. It\'s new.. At the beginning I don\'t see the hotness but on the later parts I start to see it.. The sexiness is there and like what I said.. you will appreciate the flat ones..On the other girls.. I think I don\'t have anything to say..Enjoyment (9)Of course, I enjoyed watching this anime.. Like what I said before, the fan service is good.. In my case I watched the uncensored version, so I definitely have fun.. Now that I mention it, is there a uncensored version?Ryossuke\'s line of thinking, the Erotic Life, is really the life of this series.. That\'s all..OverallAs I watched the series I noticed that Lisara looked like the protagonist in Highschool DxD.. You know, same red hair and some parts of the overall appearance.. I thought to myself that maybe Lisara was made flat chested so that you can\'t compare the series to Highschool DxD.. But still, this series has an identity of its own.. It has its own brand.. We must not completely compare the two...Um... I absolutely suggest that you watch the uncensored version..

Neither plot nor characters can be called unique or interesting. However there are some merits here as well1. Opening and Anime OST, there are some decent tracks, worth of looking into them.2. Unexpected plot twist in the end of series. If its performed more smoothly this still can be decent anime after all. However, performance of this idea ruined even this possibility.To summarize you can easily skip this standard harem echi show, but if you don't look into Anime OST and plot twist in the end of series. "", ""honestly it was predictable that's not to say predictable isn't enjoyable. the voice acting was great and it had allot of fan service. and as with fan service you need good art and it was good no obvious exaggerations. however the story seems to lack originality in an over all since of it the specific details are somewhat the same but it is understandable since the series had so much fan service and that if there was to much detail they would need to clarify questions. overall it very enjoyable light heart'ed fun.

The animation was (ohhhh my god) it was so GOOD like unbelievable. The music was fantastic but the ambient sounds would ring for way too long during dialog scenes and it killed the mood. Then the story, it was all over the place. Like the only good scenes were with the mc and heroine besides that. My god what a freaking waste kinda seemed like it had some kind of idea what it was doing at the beginning but by the end you are just...waiting for it to be over. I liked the end, but its like… we all knew which girl he was going to choose just look at the thumbnail also the ed video has them kissing in it. Idk man I was holding on to this for a while cause I was hoping it was going to be good but mheeeeee. It gets an extra point for the animation and music but 5/10 waiting for it to be over.

After meeting a beautiful Shinigami named Lisara Restall, Ryousuke is forced into a contract with her and must help her collect ""Soul Fragments"" in exchange for his life force.While the premise of the show may seem unique, the execution leaves something to be desired. The characters are one-dimensional and lack depth, with Ryousuke\'s constant perverted comments becoming repetitive and tiring...after a while. The animation quality is mediocre, with many scenes feeling stagnant and unimpressive.Despite its shortcomings, the show does have some redeeming qualities. The humor is occasionally entertaining, with some moments that are genuinely funny. The fight scenes are also well-choreographed, with dynamic movements and a good use of camera angles.Overall, Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai is an anime that is likely to appeal to those who enjoy the ecchi genre and don\'t mind a lackluster plot and flat characters. While it has some enjoyable moments, the show ultimately falls short in comparison to other anime in the same genre. Although it\'s not my personal preference, I can see how it could be entertaining for those who enjoy ecchi humor and action. after a while.

In the second part the Supernatural takes place leaving the ecchi elements in the background, and here is where this title really shines. It turns a bit dark, the story takes some layers of depth and the characters turn a bit more complex. All of it in a light way. Lisara is by far the most complex character of this story, and drives the tone of the storytelling, her interactions with Ryosuke have different shades and they together never get boring. The anime has 12...episodes + an ova, and even though it doesnt provide a definite end to the story, it has an ending good enough to keep you satisfied.

This is one of a handful of ecchis that has a story strong enough that could work without all the nudity, similar to High School DXD.', 'To put it nicely, there is obvious inspiration taken from High School DxD, which, unsurprisingly, came out just a season prior to this. Specific elements come to mind such as the protagonist, the intrigue of the conflict and the red hair girl nearly deserve to be called plagiarized. Together with the reoccurring cliche elements of the ecchi & harem genres (such as random ""attractive"" female types appearing and starting to like the MC), I\'m not sure what this show has that it can call its own. And to follow that further, I\'m not sure what innovative, quality ideas it truly brings to the anime scene....It is a bit unfair to analyze this in such a way, because, just like with other shows in this genre, it entertains through specific tools (not that that makes the writing any better) and, after all, entertainment is the main purpose. Nevertheless, this anime in particular does try a little to be something more meaningful, and so it gave off a slightly different vibe to the anime it clearly took inspiration from, which are both reasons to be a little harsh and critique what it brings. It really feels just like a High School DxD with less spice, less/worse comedy, less ecchi, slightly worse characters with comparable development, less/worse worldbuilding, less intriguing plot. Unlike DxD though, it only has one season which might make it a little difficult to fit in romance, comedy, ecchi, characterization, the fantastical Grimwald worldbuilding, AND some significant plot in 12 episodes. It did feel quite crammed, as if they had the ambition to include all these but in the end it is obvious it was a no-go from the start to try to speedrun it all inside one season.More in depth - Ryousuke is like a Issei with a more annoying/dead tired voice lacking energy, less funny jokes/mentality, and a bit of a contradicting personality that dies off as he progresses. For both these guys obviously I understood their moments of shyness and let\'s say acting in a contradicting way to what they say, but in Ryousuke\'s case his whole mentality seems to shift. It feels as though his perversion only scarcely comes back whenever the author remembers of it or when it\'s an empowering/comedic moment and we need some dialogue from him. And even though he is literally powered by his perversion, to me it did not seem as though he ever acted in that direction enough to convince me of it or of its relevancy in deciding his actions. It\'s like... the show is telling us he\'s a pervert, because he\'s preaching about females, because he has pornographic material at home, because he\'s studying/thinking about that stuff... but somehow, it still does not seem to fit his character. It is probably both an effect of the voice acting and the author\'s choices in terms of what he makes him do and say (and generally the other content shown in the anime that takes up ample time). The only entertaining/unique thing he has to his personality, really, is his perversion and speeches about females (although the part where he studied in order to be able to stimulate his ""ecchi powers"" to the maximum was quite funny), but aside from that he was a little bland or even quiet like a cool guy MC.The other characters apart from Mina seem especially shallow and I didn\'t even expect the development that they start to like the MC, which makes the cliche writing be of even worse quality. Sure, I can take one character, the main love interest, be like that, since she, at least, spent the most time with him and got protected all the time, whatever. But the other one just deciding one day that ecchi is coming was a surprise even for a harem show. Their personalities were different enough whilst not being too annoying/overbearing or unrealistic - aside from the romantic developments - so that aspect of the characterization didn\'t stop me from watching, at least. Obviously Lisara\'s personality is in itself a cliche, - and a bit of an annoying tsundere (?) one at that -, the development of her feelings & treatment towards the MC are a cliche, the end of that romantic plot is expected (no minus points there since it\'s always satisfying), and the fact she\'d fall for him was clearly scripted. It seemed a little more inconceivable that such personalities would fall for each other than in other shows.As far as the story is concerned, and I probably should\'ve covered this earlier considering the focus that the action scenes do get in this show, it\'s not great. Soo much fighting in a shallow world where there\'s barely anything intriguing about Grimwald. The fights are either with weird monsters with no backstory nor interesting traits (or any personality all since they don\'t talk), or new magical girls we don\'t know shit about beforehand and that are not intriguing at all either through anything else such as personality. Some of the attacks are cool, but overall, it is so uninteresting seeing these cliche, unintroduced & short-lived characters (10-12 episodes) with an also cliche, specific and simple purpose (fighting for some simple reason such as power/rivalries in Grimwald, appealing to viewers through their looks). It is all so simple and rushingly shown to us that literally nothing interested me and I skipped through all of the fighting in Grimwald. It was a pretty big change in vibe and theme compared to the beginning and/or my expectations from the categories coming into the show regardless, but having it be this tired action made it even worse. The main villain is also never properly introduced until he actually takes action and my lack of interest reached its peak at that point, although by the end, with his speech before death, he grew on me a little since his plan/intentions made sense and were meaningful. We should\'ve gotten that way in advance, and again, perhaps a show like this with only 12 episodes suffers a little since more interest would be gained over time instead of fighting the main guy over like 2 episodes after learning about him. Still, other shows have executed this better.Thus, the middle-end of the show was the worst. Just uninteresting tired action with no major turns in anything else, although we do get a little bit of romance/ecchi pretty often.Up to that point, it worked, sort of. I mean, it was enough to make me keep watching so that\'s that. Still I didn\'t like when the random monsters came to fight (which, now that I think about it, was also pretty much the way characters were introduced all the time for some reason - certainly not uninspired writing!). The progress in the romantic plot and generally the time spent at the start getting to know the red hair girl, the funny relationship with Ryousuke, and certainly the search for The One, which was great rom-com with some purpose, made the first 4-5 episodes or so pretty enjoyable.Then came the climax of the conflict that was where, as mentioned, my disinterest peaked, but luckily there was some more meaningful material at the end. The drama was a little weirdly created, because, as Ryousuke says, he feels/looks perfectly fine and so the fact he has to die in two weeks felt a little artificial (my intuition tells me it\'s because of the sword implanted in him, but still). But the way this evolved at the end, with Lisara\'s struggle to get the MC to confess to the nerd in order to keep him alive with her power, which he couldn\'t, because he liked Lisara instead, who in turn hid her feelings in pain trying to keep him alive, was a really cool intrigue. I thought I was too young to get to that middle age woman stage where romance is my thing, but here we are. That period, with the depressed MC and his feelings, Mina\'s feelings (although the date was boring), Lisara\'s feelings, was pretty meaningful and of course interesting in that we knew he wouldn\'t confess.Of course we also knew he would get saved eventually, and the way it happened was nothing surprising, if anything it was a cliche with Lisara putting herself in danger in the ""soul realm"". The confession/romance that followed was as satisfying as ever in a story like this, not that the buildup up to that with Ryousuke\'s own confession was much less engaging.This show pretty much took a couple unoriginal elements, executed them acceptably whilst adding few original elements aka its own spice into it (which most of the time was not that good). Which, in my eyes at least, proves the efficiency of that basis that it stole from other shows, or the implications of the category itself, because even after filling half the show with weak fights they can say they\'ve got a non-negative rating from me (not that that\'s very difficult). The half of it that was half-decent, was sufficiently enjoyable, and the other half could be easily skipped through by viewers with access to the right arrow key on most streaming platforms.

Dragon Ball Z Movie 04: Super Saiyajin da Son Gokuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/897/Dragon_Ball_Z_Movie_04__Super_Saiyajin_da_Son_Gokuu,"['Overview:Certain questions have always plagued mankind. Can absolute morals exist in the absence of a God or some form of karmic retribution, or does morality become relative and all is permitted because nothing is innately wrong? If highly religious countries always have lower suicide rates than atheist countries due to the fear of eternal damnation, should religion be promoted to stabilize society even if we know many of the stories aren\'t true? Finally, what IS the worst fucking DBZ movie?!""plot"" 2/10The story of Lord Slug is that there is a super powerful Namekian that comes to Earth in order to gather the dragon balls and...wish for eternal youth. Keep in mind that he has an interstellar ship and MUST be aware of the Namekian dragon balls, that grant 3 wishes instead of 1 and are less well defended, because the toughest Namek is Nail with a power level of only around 40K. Lord Slug decides to defy ALL logic and come to Earth, so that this movie can totally rip off the King Piccolo story arc from Dragon Ball. Goku and friends must sense this powerful being coming, but decide to do nothing and just allow his minions to gather the dragonballs and grant a wish. If he had wished for immortality, the gang would be screwed because Lord Slug isn\'t going to open the ""Dead Zone"" and off himself. Fortunately, Lord Slug is so stupid that he merely wishes for youth without adding that extra bit about not being able to die. How is he defeated? The first step in his downfall involves Gohan whistling. In this movie, Namekians are really weakened by whistling for...some reason. Keep in mind that this has ZERO precedence in the series, and apart from this movie is never used again! Goku then changes into a form that isn\'t a Super Saiyan, because Toriyama hadn\'t created the  Super Saiyan design yet. Instead he becomes a glowing red form that fans now simply call ""Champion of Christmas"" after the TFS joke. Goku then finally defeats him with....wait for it....the spirit bomb! Seriously, Fuck this movie!Art and Sound: 6/10The fight scenes aren\'t nearly as good as some of the other DBZ movies, but they aren\'t absolutely terrible. The animation is generally decent for 1991 DBZ standards and the soundtrack (I\'m talking about the Japanese one) is mostly just the same soundtrack from the series without any notable great track additions, unlike say the 7th or 8th movies. Basically the art and sound is fine, but it didn\'t feel like they were really going all out either. It felt like a quickly made, lazy cash grab because that is exactly what it was.Overall: 3/10Does it have some of that trademark DBZ yelling and action? Yes it does. Does it have a few moments that were amusing? I would argue that it does. Is it a good movie? HELL NO! This movie is always a strong contender for the worst DBZ movie along with #6 (Mecha-Cooler) and #11 (Bio-Broly). All 3 are honestly horrible fucking movies that only rabid DBZ fans (like me) could even remotely enjoy, and even that is a stretch. My opinion on which of the 3 is the worst fluctuates, but most of the time I would respond that Lord Slug is in fact the worst of the whole bunch. This is obviously not counting the time traveling Bardock special, because that was a TV special and NOT a movie. Bottom line: don\'t watch this movie unless you are a HUGE DBZ fan and simply have to complete all the movies, just to say that you did! wish for eternal youth.

I\'m here to let you know that this movie is good! Obviously it has it\'s issues, but this is the first Dragon Ball Z movie to be enjoyable to watch. The first three movies simmer around mediocrity. It\'s not canon so feel no obligation to watch it. However, if you want some more fun Dragon Ball Z action, this is a worthwhile experience.Let\'s just address this up front. Is Lord Slug a Piccolo rip off? YES! He is a Namekian. He commands an army (like Piccolo did when he originally took on Earth). He hunts the Dragon Balls to get...eternal youth. Slug\'s moveset is even the exact same. He even uses the ""turn into a giant"" move Piccolo used. Everything about him is a complete, utter, and unhidden rip off. But you know what, I\'m not mad about it. It works. The story was good for Piccolo and it\'s good here. It\'s not original, but it\'s not boring to watch by any means. For a rip off, it does a serviceable job of making it entertaining.To address another thing. Lord Slug did not go back to Namek to get the Dragon Balls because they used the Dragon Balls to exile him. I know this is minor, but reading other reviews bugged me. This is why. Moving on.The animation and sound is on par with the anime at the time. The fight scenes are animated well. I love when fights actually have a bit of back and worth and are not entirely one sided. Not to mention Piccolo and Gohan get a bit of time to show off their moves. They are not the best fight scenes, but they stand above a lot of the one sided borefests that monopolize Dragon Ball Z. Sound features your regular Dragon Ball Z tunes. Nothing out of place. Voice acting is solid too for the dub.Forget the haters. Yes the movie is unoriginal. It\'s not canon though.

I was getting worried at one point that I would have to start rating them like 8 or 9 eventually. :PThis is the first Dragon Ball Z movie that I watched in Japanese... and it turns out this is one of the few anime where the sub does not seem like much of an improvement upon the dub, if at all (assuming the dub in this one is of similar quality to those in other Dragon Ball Z movies). I mean, did they find a bunch...of kids to voice this thing?! Because that's what it sounds like, especially Goku's voice.I think they actually attempted to produce something that's slightly more clever than most Dragon Ball Z movies. Unfortunately, the result isn't pretty. A couple of things happened during the battles that didn't entirely make sense.

This review will contain spoilers, so you\'ve been warned! The movie gets straight to the point after a light-hearted scene between Gohan and Piccolo. The sudden news of an extinction-level asteroid is about to collide with the Earth. Shortly after, we see Goku and Krillin in a fantastic scene showing them perform a double Kamehameha wave at the asteroid. That scene alone was just amazing, so I won\'t spoil what happens next! Later on, the movie reveals the antagonist called ""Lord Slug"" who turns out to be an Ancient Namekian who, along with the...rest of their kind, were eternally banished long ago by the Namekian Dragon Balls from their home planet Namek for abusing their newfound powers. This movie also shows Goku almost turn into a Super Saiyan, so that\'s awesome as well. This movie is great. From the story, sound, and also the dynamic between Gohan and Piccolo...this movie does everything right for just being one hour long! It\'s one of my favorite DBZ movies alongside ""Cooler\'s Revenge"" and ""Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan"", so definitely check it out! rest of their kind, were eternally banished long ago by the Namekian Dragon Balls from their home planet Namek for abusing their newfound powers.

It\'s one of my favorite DBZ movies alongside ""Cooler\'s Revenge"" and ""Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan"", so definitely check it out!', ""Lord Slug is the fourth film of the Dragon Ball Z film series - and it comes with a plot and villain that are just as generic as the last film - thankfully with the caveat that it's at least a more interesting and exciting film then Tree of Might, but that's not saying much when the result is still quite a bit more forgettable and middling then I'd like to see in a Dragon Ball film, or any film for that matter.One thing that sets Lord Slug apart is it's set-up that could only really work in a film setting - a doomsday setting...that pushes the Earth (again) to the very brink through the use of a 'terrafreeze' device after a huge planet-sized object barely misses the planet. The scenes leading up to these plot devices are pretty dramatic, showing the world on the edge of destruction - I just fee that as the world begins to freeze over, we could've just gotten a few minutes of the world reacting to the slow cold creeping around the globe. The art direction for the frozen world looks pretty great, and it looks very different to a lot of other DBZ films, at least in about half the scenes.Lord Slug himself, however, is a bit of a disappointment. His original premise of being an old, ancient being made me pretty excited to see how he was going to be a major adversary to Goku and crew, but almost instantly is this idea dropped and we get a normal, run of the mill villain who comes off as a budget King Piccolo from the original Dragon Ball. At the very least, we get some cool abilities on display from Lord Slug, but even these feel just like cheap imitations of Piccolo and other Namekians we've seen through the series.Sadly, you know something is wrong with the film when the side-fights are more interesting then the one against the titular opponent himself. Almost nothing stands out for the actual brawl against Lord Slug; it never falls into boring territory, but outside of his initial, calculated beat-down of Goku and Goku's sudden pre-Super Saiyan power-up, there isn't really much memorable about it until the final stages. On a completely different note, however, this movie is actually pretty funny - Lord Slug has a lot of stupid, yet great one-liners, and Krillan's reaction to the world ending is nothing short of hysterical.For the love of god, though, why doesn't Krillan get ANY love in these films? When he's not being a babysitter, it seems he's almost instantly removed from the fight. Otherwise, one of my favourite parts of this film is the other Z-Fighters trying to deal with Lord Slug's efforts when Goku is MIA. Gohan going full Musou-style on Lord Slug's goons is pretty spectacular to watch, and there is nothing in this film more satisfying then Piccolo's initial fight against one of Lord Slug's commanders. The build-up to and the side-fights themselves are probably the highest points of the film - it's a shame, because with a similar tone and a little less villan's going down in one shot, this could've ranked with the best.Lord Slug is a perfectly average and forgettable entry in the Dragon Ball Z film series. Like many of them, it has it's moments, but it feels nothing short of a massive amount of missed potential. I wouldn't go so far to say it's a bad film, but it's very much the kind that you'll watch it once and never think about it again, which is some ways, is a much worse thing to say about a film then calling it bad in the end, anyway. that pushes the Earth (again) to the very brink through the use of a 'terrafreeze' device after a huge planet-sized object barely misses the planet.

Okay... sure, whatever. I mean... Frieza\'s yet not existant in a timeline, so we cant yet rehash him time and time again to - not permanent - death, no can we?!Namekian, who\'s not named King Piccolo... or Kami... or NAAAAAAAIIILLL... lands on Earth, and freezes everything over - something, that Frieza would do, if judged by the name... He wants dragon thingies so he can be young again. Sounds familiar? Carrot and the gang are having non of it, since Piccolo is supposed...to be the handsomest Jolly Gree Giant on Earth, and so they start throwing their lives, limbs and kids at them, till the Piccolo 2.0 starts to erect... ehm, grow, and break shit - pretty basic stuff... nothing to get excited over. Some expositon in under a one minute happens, some flexing and flailing, Piccolo rips his ears off... what?! Once again, the bad guys are ""surprisingly"" inadept to kill the Carrot cake, and Piccolo gets finally some touch n\' feel on his fellow namekian... slugdemon... pokemon-reject... thing? Asses are being pulled... humans are once again just a mear punchingbags... do Piccohan-fans finally wet their pants all at once?! Rated dirty R for antenna-pulling. Better not see it - namekians can\'t apparently even cum... just like their fans can\'t.This movie is only 50-minutes long turd of a wasted money, and some Piccohan-fanfiction - I had to google that term! - and it took me over 3 hours to finish - I\'m not even kidding! Still, I feel like I have to be honest, so I\'m gonna say it... namekians are kinda cool! Bearing that in mind, I was kinda excited, when I noticed, that the villain of the ""story"", is yet another alien - namekian, if you didn\'t already guessed - and I was of course hoping, that just once... just freaking once, Piccolo of all people... aliens, would be the Hero of the Day, and save the Earth - more or less - since his latest attempt to save the world, was to allow it\'s inhabitants to be turned into candy, by some pink blop! Or... future attempt, was it? Oh, what the heck, some redemption would do some good for this guy anyway! But honestly, I could already see it now actually happening! Two namekians, green against bigger green, fighting for something, and so on! That would\'ve been cool, and it would\'ve brought something new to the table, as well as possibly expanding Piccolos already almost-non-existant character! But no! Of course, this movie had to be yet another Fanporn- movie, dedicated to Goku-wanks, and oh my, does it stink!What I first noticed, while watching this... movie, is that a thinner-than-wallpaper- type of stories seems to really be the biggest trademark of DBZ - like the fans would mind about the story, right?! I actually counted down the actual ""story-mode"" of this movie, that I did, and it turned out to be only about 15 minutes, with rest of the movie being... you guessed it! Fighting, gawking at terror, more fighting, and oh, so very, very awful dialog! I mean... really bad dialog! Cringeworthy! So bad, that not even a porn-movie, would be proud about it... and this movie, is a Fanporn-movie! And it still is such a short movie! Hey! Idea! What if... instead of wasting my time, into all of this boasting, fighting and all this ""Ah! He\'s so strong! I can\'t beat him! We\'re doomed!"" bullshit, why not... now stay with me... actually give us some actual backstory, for our main villain?! You know... the villain, that seems to be even more hated, that Broly?! The whole quarter of the ""story"", that ever took place in this movie, was pretty much just about our villain, but the problem was... he didn\'t do anything! The way I saw it, he, Lord Slug that is, just came - not that way! - crashed into the scene, sat there like a tool, keeped acting like a tool, is later the actual tool, and then, right at the atmost last moment, we\'re given this under-minute- long backstory about him, and why he\'s doing all... that what he\'s doing! That\'s not a story! That\'s just some... really pathetically weak writing... at most and/or it\'s best! Weak, and stupid... much like this franchise, as a whole! Even his big plans were treated most of the time, like some throw-away- jokes, not to be taken seriously, and to be honest... that\'s how I felt! Nothing was serious, nothing had any meaning, and yet another wish, from a Deux ex Machina, was wasted, into pure idiotism! Someone... take those wreaking balls out of their hands - no pun intented! - and let\'s see, if the actual story would ever take in place!Another problem, was... the villain, himself. Not that bad of a villain, honestly.... more like a Piccolo, on steroids. He\'s supposed to be this ""ultimate ruler of the universe"" - not Frieza, apparently - but really... he has absolutely nothing, on his name! We don\'t know him, his character, or his story! His just evil, for the sake of it, and nothing else! And what\'s up with that stupid weakness of his - whistling?! And Piccolo, too?! Really?! You can take these space-monkeys, screaming at you, and to each other, for like 15-minutes straight in constipation, and blowing shit up left and right, but you can\'t take couple of minutes, of some teeny whistling?! Wow! That\'s just... wow! And speaking of space-monkeys... why did we needed Goku, to be a hero to begin with in this film?! No, I know the answer! To give fans more reasons, to wank... but that\'s not the point! The point is, that this was clearly a bloodfeud, between namekians from opposite spectrums, with one of them being... not so big of a doucheback, than the second! No third hands needed here! Let them clean up their own shit... and rather somewhere else, than this God-forsaken Hellhole-Earth, please!This movie felt like some stupid filler-episode, that was just mayde even too stupid, to put in actual tv-series, and that\'s saying alot! It had absolutely no story, very little plot - if any - and throw-away- villain, with no actual story of his own, character, or motives. Everything was too easy either to accomplish, or fix back to normal, so that very little consequense was left behind... if any - casualties of humanlives, and enviromental catastrophies are something, that this wolrd learnd to live with, and accept ages ago! I truly hate it, when our ""heroes"" treat the threaths of their homeworld, like some sort of everyday-happenings, like a stroll down the lane in a park at sunday-afternoons, and they even dare to laugh at it in the end! Some heroes! What about all those people, that I\'m sure were killed, in the process?! Did they ever came back to live, or is it more important for Oolong, to wish another pair of pants?! And what about all that enviromental damage? Whatca gonna do with that?! Nothin\'? Kay!This is one of the purest Fanporn-movies, that I\'ve seen, in a while. No story needed, \'cause who wants one of those - not the fans, right?! Plot is very light, like a cloud, made out of... thoughts, not water, and the villain\'s so stupid, and boring, that you don\'t remember him, right after this movie ends... if at all. What you get, is just some fighting, and... yeah, nothing else. Or, if you\'re a yaoi-fan, you can get something out of Piccohan - seriously, is that a real thing?! - but other than that... I wouldn\'t recommend this movie to anybody! Not even those, who are stupid enough, to watch these bad anime movies, and then write how bad they are! Like I said, this movie is a filler... or a demo-version of a storymode, for a Street Fighter. Don\'t expect to get anything good out of this, even if you actually like DBZ.For once, the fans were right about something - this is one of the worst movies, this franchise has to offer... which is really, really bad!Story: 1Art: 3Sound: 2Characters: 1Enjoyment: 1Overall: 1 to be the handsomest Jolly Gree Giant on Earth, and so they start throwing their lives, limbs and kids at them, till the Piccolo 2.0 starts to erect... ehm, grow, and break shit - pretty basic stuff... nothing to get excited over.

This plan...also has side effects on the planets inhabitants as many characters succumb to the cold created by that change. In other words, the movie does a great job displaying the destruction caused by Slug arriving.This movie has some of the most brutal action scenes in the franchise even some done by the good guys. For example Goku would counter an energy blast of an opponent sending it back inside his mouth. Or Goku breaking the ankle of an opponent.The setting is also very well used to show tragedy. They move their fight into a theme park which is normally associated with happiness but because of the invasion its dark and lifeless.The fight against Lord Slug is also entertaining since he uses known Namekian abilities in a very good style especially when he turns into a giant. There is also a very creative way how Goku and Piccolo fight it instead of the boring charging into random body parts to attack like in most Dragon Ball fights. Piccolo being also a Namekian does a good job in knowing how to handle him using what normally is a strength of a Namekian and turning it against it.Lastly the false Super Saiyan form which is considered by many the most underwhelming or bad. And it did come out of nowhere and considering we got so many forms, it feels like another pointless transformation. In terms of release it did come out before regular Super Saiyan and is a form that you can only stay in while enraged. But honestly it feels no different than a golden colored Kaioken, but then again it turned Goku more aggressive which isn't anything knew after seeing the real Super Saiyan. However, it does look far more powerful than many forms you will see in Dragon Ball Super.The characters in the movie are well used. While in many other movies characters feel like filler sometimes because they don't accomplish anything. In this movie, even if they don't nor affect the movie, they feel relevant simply because they are affected by the invasion.Gohan and Piccolo were crucial to beat Slug and Goku obviously does the heavy lifting.Lord Slug doesn't feel like he is deserving his power and even him being a Super Namekian feels like a rip off of Super Saiyan without the deep lore behind it. But it did foreshadow the Super Namekian in the manga I guess. So isn't very memorable, but not a bad one. As I mentioned Slug has motivations besides regaining his youth, that being turning earth into an utopia for him and his men. And it feels he wants to succeed in it and manages to do so.There were obviously some issues. Like how Goku used defeated the bad guy with the same technique as in the prior movies. Piccolo continuing the tradition from prior movies to come safe Gohan. Not outrageous since this is the third time, but it will happen more often.Overall this movie is better than I remembered. The name is kinda a false advertisement since it doesn't have THE Super Saiyan, but a Toei interpretation what a Super Saiyan is.If you are a Piccolo fan, I think his movie does really feel as brutal as you know him in the past. Not a nanny of the son family.Action is good with fluid animation and the Japanese music is great setting the atmosphere well.Not one of the best movies and it doesn't stand out, but an enjoyable experience regardless. also has side effects on the planets inhabitants as many characters succumb to the cold created by that change.

Let\'s make it a thing in dragon ball, no.The moment, when King Kai said Frieza\'s name to Goku, I\'ve decided to dissolve this movie into pieces. I could care less it came out before Super Saiyan even appears in anime, Lord Slug takes place AFTER the Frieza saga, and King Kai comparing Slug and Frieza strength to Goku, and Goku\'s weird Super Saiyan just confirmed it for me.Now, some say it\'s a pre-Frieza movie, but the fact that Super Saiyan appears and Slug is stronger than FRIEZA, there\'s no way Goku can hold against Slug in his...pre Namek power even with Super Saiyan. That\'s my argument. If you disagree, that\'s okay too. This is my only opinion on how I see LS.Lord Slug is a non-canon movie, meaning anime original, and Lord Slug doesn\'t appear in DBZ Manga. It was a kind of commercial on Super Saiyan, but that won\'t play any role in my review.Without further ado, let\'s get to the business.

His first impressions from the movie are killing his crew for no reason to make him look like a d*ck. It doesn\'t invest a single bit into his persona doing lazy pure evil villain cliche.5, How could Goku do Genki Dama, when earlier Kai told him there\'s not enough energy for Dama? Plot.6, If Kai says LS is stronger than Frieza, does he mean his 530 000 form or full power Frieza? If he means 530 000, there\'s no way Slug would survive a single second against Super Sayian.My Main Course negatives from LS if you consider LS as post-Frieza:1, Why there isn\'t Vegeta? No, seriously, where the hell is he here when Goku\'s on Earth.2, Why Goku gets himself beaten by Slug without using Kaio-ken or his Super Saiyan, just to turn into a weird Super Saiyan3, Why the hell is Gohan always useless in DBZ movies? Whenever there\'s a DBZ movie, I swear he\'s there, just to be some sort of a reason, why Z warriors are beaten down. It was with Goku in Cooler\'s Revenge (I watched it before LS), and it is with Piccolo in this movie as well.4, Why Demon Clan again? I swear that Garlic jr. and Slug are a disgrace to Piccolo Daimao from DB 1986. Daimao was a good villain, but every attempt to replicate Demon Clan came out weak.5, Where\'s Tien and Chiaotzu and Yamcha? (if it was pre-Frieza) They can\'t be dead because Piccolo is alive.Summary: Even if I would take this movie as pre-Frieza, it still makes no sense to me, same as post-Frieza. LS has some bright moments, but there are lots of wtf moment that just can\'t get past me.Dragon Ball Z Movie 04: Lord Slug earns 3/10 no matter if I rate it as a post or pre Frieza. This movie didn\'t work for me, it has good scenes, but I just don\'t like it, and it is my 1st 3/10 rating given to the anime. pre Namek power even with Super Saiyan. That\'s my argument. If you disagree, that\'s okay too. This is my only opinion on how I see LS.Lord Slug is a non-canon movie, meaning anime original, and Lord Slug doesn\'t appear in DBZ Manga. It was a kind of commercial on Super Saiyan, but that won\'t play any role in my review.Without further ado, let\'s get to the business.

There\'s a lot more humor this time around, and the fights are better thanks to some really creative villains. The movie is still really stupid, but it\'s at least mild entertainment.The minor characters get to shine here a lot more than by this point in the show-- Chi-Chi gets to fight again, yay! Oolong has more screentime than most of the TV series combined, yay! Piccolo has a cool fight all to himself where he doesn\'t get blown up by the end of it.What\'s really...dumb here? Goku goes ""Super Sayian"" but I guess they hadn\'t reached that point in the anime when this came out, so all he does is get a big energy field and have his pupils disappear.

Extreme Hearts,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50999/Extreme_Hearts,"['You\'ve seen sports anime about teens who were new to the game, and you\'ve seen idol anime about struggling idols. But have you ever seen an anime about an entire tournament of people who are bad at BOTH?Because that\'s the concept of Extreme Hearts, both the anime and in-universe tournament. Our MC is a failed idol who joins a league of potential idol athletes where the common goal is to use the tournament\'s notoriety to go pro. Their world has pro athletes and pro idols without combining the two and adding weird unexplained technology, it seems like all players here NEED this tournament of losers...to become successful. While this COULD be an interesting commentary on the entertainment industry and how fame and success is much more thanks to luck and marketing and riding a wave than raw ability, this is the seasonal garbage anime so none of that is here. Extreme Hearts is a fast paced tournament where its contenders must become pro in every sport and in music, which...isn\'t normally how attaining pro status and skill in anything works? Luckily the show absolutely refuses to show as much of the games and concerts as possible so we don\'t even see most of it to need to argue that they\'re good or justify why, and we also don\'t spend much time showing meaningful training to need to visualize the concept of improvement or strategy. And when we do...oh boy does it look bad. What isn\'t just a slideshow of still shots or narrated about without showing is incredibly poor. Most of the girls\' games are won by a new team member entering mid game, surprising even the team. Which, sure let\'s say the first one already had the new players on the roster. The rest...didn\'t. How did they come in? And even then it\'s still usually clip show or a quick cut to the ending as if the anime is afraid to show it. What little is animated is very poor quality and unexciting though so I can\'t say I wanted more. In the final game of the tournament, we actually do show a large portion of the game and I found myself very confused and very bored wondering why we were focusing on it. Clearly nobody on staff was particularly interested in writing staging or combat.So what is the point of Extreme Hearts? As mentioned it sure isn\'t the sports. Even the practice is montage and offscreen. So is it the idol part? That\'s a money maker. But the music is given even less time, with concerts glossed over or even skipped and mentioned in passing. Like with the sports, we also never show much practice despite most of the cast is new to music. If this is supposed to be an idol anime, Extreme Hearts does a miserable job at selling its idol waifus. Even their designs are the blandest most uninteresting girls I\'ve seen in ages. Who would want a figure of any of these girls? Even within their own show, the main team Rise is very noticeably more homogenous, boring, and uninteresting than every other team they face. I understand simplicity for the budget\'s sake, but maybe you\'d have more funds if you could expect anyone to want to buy merch of this show.Ruling out sports and idols....the two things the show markets itself on...maybe the characters are interesting? But I\'m sorry to say they\'re the most bland and forgettable roles possible. Even the word ""archetypal"" doesn\'t fit because that implies some level of interest to grab onto. Our MC is boring the point the final episode even has a discussion about how she\'s never been seen crying, or overtaken by laughter, or angry, or any strong emotion. Whenever shows have to justify how cool their character is by them being a blank slate, I have to ask...are you trying to convince yourself that\'s cool? Because I find it boring as can be. Meanwhile every girl that hesitates to join the team is because they\'re TOO GOOD at sports and hurt someone physically or emotionally and were shunned because of it. So they avoid the team until they learn ITS OKAY TO BE TOO GOOD. Other characters claim its an offscreen responsibility holding them back, or they have no hesitation at all. That\'s really...everything there is to these girls, and it doesn\'t even matter because after their intro episodes they fade into the background and have very few lines, let alone development.So what does Extreme Hearts do with its run time if it doesn\'t focus on sport, idols, or characters? Honestly I\'m not sure. I watched every single episode and every week it just felt like we were either stalling to avoid more exciting things, or we were rushing through events as fast as possible. I understand this show was clearly low budget in an era where we\'ve been having many delays and issues. But this goes beyond adjusting to handle problems because fundamentally from the first moment nothing was working. The designs were bad, the writing was uninteresting, and the pacing was terrible. The show also fails to explore every concept it creates, from what it\'s Extreme Heart tech really does or how it works, or how much AI melds into society and how that functions, to even how these new hybrid sports idols function in showbiz that also includes actual athletes and entertainers. Whether it\'s a character beat, the end to a conflict, or a whole theme of the show, Extreme Hearts seems not only hesitant but downright unwilling to work with its own premise.I have to admit, both idol and sports anime are not my particular favorite genre. While some are unarguably fantastic, I feel like these genres can let in even more forgettable trash than some others. However usually there is something about a pitch to latch onto, or to be disappointed about if it doesn\'t succeed. But Extreme Hearts is such a...nothing from beginning to end. I was bored out of my mind and resented the time I spent, but at the same time I never cared to begin with to feel let down. It really felt like nobody on staff wanted to be there, and so I didn\'t either. For a show about the rejects of the entertainment industry, they sure made a poorly entertaining show itself. to become successful.

It's not a sports anime. Nor is it an idol anime. And even with Sci-Fi elements, it's not a typical Sci-Fi series. And it's certainly not somewhere in between those three. This series is best described as a journey about challenging oneself and staying true to your own goals. It's about relating to others, forging new friendships, and it does so with brimming positivity, and a diverse cast of well-thought-out characters.The story begins with Hiyori, an already debuted singer/songwriter with an extremely small following, and her kouhai, Saki. When Hiyori's contract is terminated,...she sets her sights on Extreme Hearts, a knockout-style sports-festival for entertainers. The competition itself cycles through different sports, from baseball to basketball, and from soccer to rugby. Hiyori sets out to overcome these challenges, and with the help of her kouhai's friend, Sumika, prepares as best she can to face it. But she's alone, and the aforementioned sports are all team-based sports. Without the help of her friends, she won't get very far.This series is never about the sports; the sport is the challenge. And it's not about having the most unique storyline. Nor the most realistic. In fact, it's filled with tropes. And the Sci-Fi elements are barely explained. If that grinds your gears, then you'll end up hating this series. But if you're okay with that and you're not heavily leaning into sports or idols, then you'll find a series that overflows with warm feelings and extreme positivity. It's refreshing and wholesome. This applies even between direct competitors in the sports festival. The various groups come together, help each other practice, and lift each other to new heights. It's wonderful and a gentle take on what life is all about.I can easily draw comparisons between this series and Iwa Kakeru or Dog Days. If you liked those, you'll like this. she sets her sights on Extreme Hearts, a knockout-style sports-festival for entertainers.

How are those two things connected?”The answer is; They’re not. Don’t think about it.""Extreme Hearts""...is equivalent to that episode of ""The Simpsons"" in which Homer tried to make a barbecue, but dropped all the contents to make said barbecue in cement and shouts “La Grill?” before smashing the contents to pieces, jamming an umbrella into the mess and accidentally selling off the disaster to a contemporary art collector. It’s a moé idol show combined with a sports anime which also has futuristic, sci-fi elements crammed in for good measure and no, in its current state none of those elements fit together in any way, shape or form.However, it is weirdly charming. I did watch 8 episodes before asking myself the big question “What am I doing with my life?”, so it’s not like most other sports/idol anime where you can just drop them after 4 episodes from sheer boredom or mediocrity. The show doesn’t make any sense, but I like the characters(?), and when the animators can be bothered to animate it the action can be quite good. The tech the girls wear to enhance their abilities isn’t explained, the rules for each game don’t seem to matter at the moment, and theirs an entire industry dedicated to creating easily affordable moé sports androids to either compete in the sports or be the manager of a said sports team which isn’t explained, but after a while, you sort of say “fuck it” and run with it.As stupid as everything I just said sounds, I do think in the hands of a better writer and animation team there is a possibility that “Extreme Hearts” would be anime worth watching. It is strangely entertaining for a while, and although the characters are a bit bland and predictable there is at least a skeleton of a good show hidden somewhere within. In its current form “Extreme Hearts” is not good (in fact it’s kinda bad), but it does get something that most sports anime don’t and that’s to make sports feel awesome so I’m going to give it a ‘good try’ sticker along with my rating.3/10 Wasted Potential. is equivalent to that episode of ""The Simpsons"" in which Homer tried to make a barbecue, but dropped all the contents to make said barbecue in cement and shouts “La Grill?” before smashing the contents to pieces, jamming an umbrella into the mess and accidentally selling off the disaster to a contemporary art collector.

People just don\'t learn, that\'s the hard-and-fast rule and unfathomable truth.As I would like to call it, the now famous Uma Musume formula of involving sports and idoling, CGDCT style, it certainly has seen a major success incorporating such a genre that back then, didn\'t have a lot of competition. And CyGames definitely took advantage of that formula by being the first anime adaptation of their popular mobage game to do so, such that it was the precedent going forward. And many similar other...tried to replicate this exact styling from the likes of ""PuraOre! Pride of Orange"" and now this show, but it\'s very clear that the concept didn\'t work out as it should, being a novel concept on paper but forgetting about everything else that came with it. And this is exactly what Masaki Tsuzuki, the creator of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha and Dog Days did, that try as hard as he might to hope to make a splash, but like the useless Pokémon Magikarp that takes long enough to evolve into a Gyarados, this show couldn\'t evolve from having a now generic formula, with basically nothing unique to show.I do love underdog stories, and Extreme Hearts\' story plot shows a newbie group\'s rise to fame: Team RISE, consisting of team leader Hiyori Hayama, members Saki Kodaka, Sumika Maehara, Yukino Tachibana and Lise Kohinata, does feel just that. The always enthusiastic team leader, Hiyori has actually made a name for herself as a guitarist, but even with a solo debut, that\'s still not enough to break even. That\'s where her one and only fan Saki Kodaka comes in to persuade her not to give up music, for this competition/tournament for idol groups that\'s known as Extreme Hearts provides her another avenue to use her talents in a better way. Subsequently, with the rise of the team, comes more girls that bred from the necessity of evolving the team to greater heights: Sumika Maehara with her knowledge on Hyper Sports, Yukino Tachibana in baseball and last but not least, Lise Kohinata...in just making the team complete in numbers, that\'s all. That to me, screams inconsistency, though props must be given for having members that are of necessity other than just a want ""because I\'m a fan"".The other girls of rival groups, yeah...it\'s just how PuraOre! did the same thing to satiate the tastes to generic boringness, though there are some that I like. Case in point: the 2-member team Snow Wolf compromising of Michelle Jaeger and Ashley Vancroft, both dedicated to their craft of robot manufacturing and making the world a better place. It\'s just absurd how an even smaller side group like this ironically is my favourite team, though they ultimately become assistants to Team RISE, which isn\'t all that bad.Honestly, director Junji Nishimura has recently been in a rolleroaster of shows that director-level or not, hasn\'t really been working things out for him. Being the director and one that has the most input on Mamoru Oshii\'s Vlad Love, it\'s a very unique take on the madman\'s creative side that however, just feels like it\'s a ""style over substance"" show. And most certainly as studio Seven Arcs\'s in-house director, shows like Bermuda Triangle: Colorful Pastrale really only cater to the kids style, and I\'m left wondering if like Extreme Hearts, he\'s gonna screw up the upcoming anime adaptation of Mato Seihei no Slave (which the original source material is actually quite good). But I can only judge what he has now, and it\'s starting to feel like Junji Nishimura is feeling his ripe old age whom he is at the limit of making good decisions and leaving everything else to his production staff team. And truthfully, it is sad and a shame.The OST...forget it, it\'s the same generic idol-ness that doesn\'t really stand out in its uniqueness, or might as well that I say that character-centric songs are somehow getting worse, at least it is to me.I\'ve already said this once in my PuraOre! review, but like a certain Touko Machida, Masaki Tsuzuki\'s writing prowess is leagues behind the times, and although the enjoyment may have sufficed with both Nanoha and Dog Days back in the day, Extreme Hearts is a comeback that honestly, it\'s better off without in its entirety.

This show ABSOLUTELY did that, and so much more. It has everything an idol anime needs, great characters you want to support and see develop, actual character development, rivals and competition and great drama, all to the backdrop of hyper sports with awesome OST work. If you're a fan of idol anime this is a must watch, and a true hidden gem in my opinion. I couldn't stop smiling and being invested in every story being told. The show paces itself brilliantly, never introduces too much too fast, and,...oh yeah - the idol performances are great too! oh yeah - the idol performances are great too!"", ""It's a great anime if you like sport anime and idol anime,character that been use in this anime was very cute,to attract viewer,but i don't think it's a problem.This anime has something that most people want to see which they play a lot of game and not just focus on one game only which was pretty interesting,unlike other sports anime which just show one sport only such as baseball,but this one are different and a masterpiece,only blind say it bad.It's also including a lot of beautiful song,which was also a great thing as it was very great and even better than some anime idol(believe me,i...already watch a lot)maybe it's not goosebumps but still fantastic.It show about teamwork and hard work to achieve the goal that been made,it's also show to us the important of friendship in any situation especially during playing a game,in overall i can say it was a very great anime.if you like a romance or killing anime or even guy as mc then get loss from here,SOL anime for a relax people Don't leave anything

are fan of nishimura junjiOverall from 1-8 as the time i write review i think extreme heart is not focus on anything other than character interaction and depths so if you are person who like yuri and drama nagi style this anime okayIdol aspect is hollow production and animation utilize okay drama also pull me intoThere is a lot of character design and moment slice of life i enjoys but not...focus on anything other than that  as technical sports aspect is plain and boringScore of the episode from high to lowOutstandingGreatGoodokaySosoBadTerribleunwatchableEpisode 1I hope but probably not happen will this anime not to be like birdie wing to only show the character fight without showing the real match of characterFairly enjoyable because fast pacesBasically goal of the HIYORI OR EXTREME HEARTS IS to make fans of hiyori by participate in sports which is kinda weirdBut the thing i am interested in is the character of saki who want to help hiyori in sportsIdeas is of using the future tech nology to compete in sports i dont really understand why not using smae gear or is it safer?Episode 2I started to understand the ideas of extreme hearts about having 2 of the profession paly part in playing extreme sportsUsing music song to cheer entertain while also needs to play extreme heartsAnime not focus on the match or on music exactly but on the story of emotional changing and growing of Hiyori and her 2 friendsWhile the story trying to make stoyr about team sports but wanted to focus one 3 character instead filling up the roles of 3 with ai which kinda genius or could you call it lazySo interesting journey with 3 friends good musicsI dont really have problem with the fast pacing i think i quite grasp the storyGoodEpisode 3Surprisingly i really liked this animeCompared to sports in the same genre this anime shows to be really easy to understandAnd i understand more concept of the anime as the boots which is used in the future from world building of this anime was used to erase the unfairness of builds of each person since birthBut like the world we born in to the difference environment and brain so it will still i think no 100 % fair but still erase that gap to unfairness of builts of each person bodiesThe uses and abily of each character easy to understand in basketball scene hiyori is fast saki is agile and another character is accurateThe fighting scene of shooting 3 score hiyoroii getting in front to get basketball or saki dunkingIt actually make sense and easy to uynderstand rather than other anime where it really is linear and not showing any of the match at near the endBut in extreme heart there is also other part of the story that make it not that linear like the saki and sumika is good at sport while hiyori is bad at it so they teaches and help hiyori while hiyori good at sing ing and so she need to teach those two  to singBecause  of these difference in preference they need to learn each of singing and sportsThis is really interesting ideas as the anime who also doing sports also singing as the two compliment oneGoodThe episode 3 did really good so i will continue to watch it until endEpisode 4The team also cooperate to get into getting better in practicingI think variance in sport is the key main core of what make this anime being uniqueThe girls of Rise need to participate in many-many sports also sing a song to win so it has to use the boots to powered up not to be tiredThats why they are so need to practice vary and a lot of sport and then have only one sport to be in final matchSo practicing help Rise to still cath up and gauge level of the teamit really is having a smooth and related connected ideas with it progressionGoodEpisode 5’Yuki past story doesnt pull that she is poor and fucked life that much rather show it in the way that she just have the difference goal and doesnt pull that too much out of scaleAnimation is okay in the scene of baseballGood - greatEpisode 6This anime remind me of robotic;note which has very different in everything apparentlyI think style art and style of storytelling much like robotic;note  that the group of friend still growsthat ‘s kinda weirdBut put it aside i was very excited in this episode about the fact that i like yukino past of her that she is the person that also like the sword path not like she is forced or responsibility onlyIt’s about the you need to choose one of the thng friend or sword that related to her familyYuki family wanted her to live her life freely and grandpa suggested her to help her friend to go roundabouts way that the way of giving up the friend or sword is not everything but if you need to choose one choose your friend live your life dont abandon your friendAnd later you could get back practicing but these time of adolescent use it the fullestAt least that what i think grad pa try to tell herBut the baseball match quite confused but i think first they foul to score at last yuki go and complete blast them with sumikaSo quite understandable with a lot of sports i think this anime doesn't focus on particular oneGoodEpisode 7This anime still good at how the fight rather the sport scene in this case soccer were drawing before the match of saki drawn in smooth easy to understand way that they have teamwork to kick into goalDue to the fact that this anime have a lot of the sports it is hard to make it has a lot of up and down or tactics out due to individual lack of knowledge though it just and excuses from me for the storyLack of up and down or tactical fight between sports has became problematic for some viewers because some viewer watch this anime not for the sake of slice of life but these kind of people probably drop them in episode 1For me although the story doesn’t have much conflict or twist i enjoyed the character development of liseBut the fight scene of saki is more like the more emotional you get the more kick powerWhich begs the question if this anime were to only have the character conflict and growth of the character why hired nishimura junji to directedWhy kill him? As a long time fan of nishimura junji i think this anime is not disappointed as he direct the character in a way that i have liked for long timeBut the fact that nishimura junji cant directed these future technical sport fight except baseball make other area looks really staleAt this point better that you just do something like have fun chill do other things in the future era doesn't have to be sport or idol i start to understand people who hate this anime because it doesnt focus on anythingAt least glasslip focus only spread relationship of the character and supernatural visual yukihira relationship family those human pure emotionBut this anime animation didnt did a good job nothing is even touched the average in this animeKinda accept that episode 1 were rush and just show super power kick but after the episode 1 pacing is easy follow sports scene except baseball for me easy to understandTo be honest i quite understand the baseball scene too due to the fact that baseball maniac nishimura junji directed this animeDespite the fact it i just say that i will still watched this anime due to i am too into the character to get out now nishimura junji doesnt do anything wrong but seven arcs did nishimura junji just try to maintain the career of his love you nishimuraI gave a lot of the score for the sake of story of LiseGoodEpisode 8I will not called extreme hearts jack of all trade because it is good for nothing but tried to do everythingAnd that’s what is commendable, dancing costume design fonts of each team character designTo drawn all of the character doing bunch of different character and a lot of plot slice of life momentsAnother thing ideas of snow wolf as being one person has strength and two has perception tactics and intelligent type using robots to leads the teamAnd using the robots is interesting as no need to use real playerI dont understand what is up and down and conflict of idols and song aspect of extreme heartsWhile sports i still understand ability of each of the character but that’s still is flatFor the idol aspect it sure is hollow. Just show each team in fact only rise team and that’s all why having this idea and just left theirHaving a lot of ideas and not using or focusing on any of them is a waste shouldn’t put it into the anime in the first place just let the anime being the anime about character following their dream and playing casual sport like running in glasslip and focusing on dialogue and character depth insteadYou know seven art producer everyone knows that nishimura junji not suited for directing anime about technical physical confilict rather conflict about character and beauty of the natural and supernaturalA lot of animation is okay and slice of life moment is entertaining and enjoyable and beautiful to watch as heavy yuri anime fansMusic is top tier as being kinda pure and otome stuffokay focus on anything other than that  as technical sports aspect is plain and boringScore of the episode from high to lowOutstandingGreatGoodokaySosoBadTerribleunwatchableEpisode 1I hope but probably not happen will this anime not to be like birdie wing to only show the character fight without showing the real match of characterFairly enjoyable because fast pacesBasically goal of the HIYORI OR EXTREME HEARTS IS to make fans of hiyori by participate in sports which is kinda weirdBut the thing i am interested in is the character of saki who want to help hiyori in sportsIdeas is of using the future tech nology to compete in sports i dont really understand why not using smae gear or is it safer?Episode 2I started to understand the ideas of extreme hearts about having 2 of the profession paly part in playing extreme sportsUsing music song to cheer entertain while also needs to play extreme heartsAnime not focus on the match or on music exactly but on the story of emotional changing and growing of Hiyori and her 2 friendsWhile the story trying to make stoyr about team sports but wanted to focus one 3 character instead filling up the roles of 3 with ai which kinda genius or could you call it lazySo interesting journey with 3 friends good musicsI dont really have problem with the fast pacing i think i quite grasp the storyGoodEpisode 3Surprisingly i really liked this animeCompared to sports in the same genre this anime shows to be really easy to understandAnd i understand more concept of the anime as the boots which is used in the future from world building of this anime was used to erase the unfairness of builds of each person since birthBut like the world we born in to the difference environment and brain so it will still i think no 100 % fair but still erase that gap to unfairness of builts of each person bodiesThe uses and abily of each character easy to understand in basketball scene hiyori is fast saki is agile and another character is accurateThe fighting scene of shooting 3 score hiyoroii getting in front to get basketball or saki dunkingIt actually make sense and easy to uynderstand rather than other anime where it really is linear and not showing any of the match at near the endBut in extreme heart there is also other part of the story that make it not that linear like the saki and sumika is good at sport while hiyori is bad at it so they teaches and help hiyori while hiyori good at sing ing and so she need to teach those two  to singBecause  of these difference in preference they need to learn each of singing and sportsThis is really interesting ideas as the anime who also doing sports also singing as the two compliment oneGoodThe episode 3 did really good so i will continue to watch it until endEpisode 4The team also cooperate to get into getting better in practicingI think variance in sport is the key main core of what make this anime being uniqueThe girls of Rise need to participate in many-many sports also sing a song to win so it has to use the boots to powered up not to be tiredThats why they are so need to practice vary and a lot of sport and then have only one sport to be in final matchSo practicing help Rise to still cath up and gauge level of the teamit really is having a smooth and related connected ideas with it progressionGoodEpisode 5’Yuki past story doesnt pull that she is poor and fucked life that much rather show it in the way that she just have the difference goal and doesnt pull that too much out of scaleAnimation is okay in the scene of baseballGood -
