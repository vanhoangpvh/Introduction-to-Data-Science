Choujikuu Seiki Orguss,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2089/Choujikuu_Seiki_Orguss,"[""Super Dimension Century Orguss is the second of the Super Dimension Trilogy, the first being Super Dimension Fortress Macross and the third being Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross. These are all unrelated series made by the same people they just carry the same title of Super Dimension. In the US release of Robotech, they used both Macross and Southern Cross, however instead of Orguss they used Genesis Climber Mospeada instead. This lead to Orguss becoming obscure as it was never made popular. Well it's not like I would of felt any better if Harmony Gold got it's hands on this and made a censored version....However because of that it's terrible abomination of a sequel (Orguss 02) is the only way anyone knows of this.\u200b\u200bBeing made right after Macross you can see how similar it is and how much they improved. The cels are a lot more detailed, the plot is just as complex. It wasn't until last year that I discovered this anime and I enjoyed it as much as I did the original Macross many years ago. It has everything you need, action, suspense, aliens and robots just like Macross. Even though it's been over a year, this is still the last great anime I've watched. 10/10 Perfection.

It\'s not the best anime in the world (maybe people are comparing it to Macross because it\'s Studio Nue and most of the same staff worked on it?) but it\'s definitely an enjoyable little show that\'s worth watching at least once.Without giving too much away, the basic plot of the show centers around two pilots, Kei Katsuragi and Orson Verne, whose mission is to set off a ""trans-dimensional bomb""....It\'s the ""near"" future and the two factions that govern the world are fighting over the control of an orbital elevator. When it comes to this conflict, we don\'t get much more detail than that, but we don\'t need it, because as soon as the bomb goes off, Kei is transported to another earth, one where dimensions phase in and out and the earth\'s atmosphere is affected by some sort of extreme greenhouse effect.Kei is immediately discovered by a group of people who call themselves Emarns, a business-minded people who typically travel from place to place selling goods in sort of a floating spaceship-esque caravan, the Groma. Kei soon learns that he is one of two ""differential points"" (I kind of wonder if this could\'ve been translated another way) -- this basically just means is that Kei is key to the restoration of the earth, which is becoming increasingly unstable. There is an antagonistic faction on the planet called Chiram who want Kei for their own purposes, and to complicate things, our heroes also have to contend with an entire civilization of genocidal robots hell bent on destroying all humans.From there, politics get a bit more complicated, as to be expected from an anime directed by Noburo Ishiguro; it\'s not as sophisticated as some of the other anime he has directed such as Legend of the Galactic Heroes or even Macross, but it\'s still complex enough that the story plays more like a pulpy late 60s sci-fi novel than your typical 80s mecha anime. Unfortunately, due to the pacing of the show (there is some filler and the last handful of episodes seem rather rushed, and the ending is completely abrupt) the story suffers a bit. The story really begins to pick up around episode 15, after Orson is reintroduced into the show (my favorite character by far and probably the best example of a ""main hero b"" I\'ve seen in a mecha anime). I also feel like the conflict with the Muu robots could\'ve been introduced a lot sooner than it was. With some better pacing this show could\'ve been a lot better, but it\'s not hard to see what they were shooting for and the show is still enjoyable to watch. There are several WTF moments (Palm tree monsters! Gigantic grapes!) but those just add to the charm of the series and are imaginative, I mean, in a world where different dimensions phase in and out, why not have fun with it?The characters in this show are fun. Most of them are deeply flawed, but to get into detail about their flaws would spoil a lot of the show. The protagonist, Kei, is a ""player"" type of guy but has more charm than your typical Ataru Moroboshi-ish horny male anime lead. I started off really disliking him as his constant attempts to get with Mimsy were really annoying me, but over time you get to see a softer side of the character, a guy who is attracted to women but simultaneously genuinely cares for and respects not only women but everyone around him. In fact, this proves to be a major problem for him later in the series.Basically, Orguss is a really fun show with some great art (great example of early 80s Haruhiko Mikimoto character designs, which I absolutely love) and sporadic bits of decent animation, with an intriguing and original story, and really good music. (My absolute favorite OP and some of the BGM is actually quite good -- listen for the Morricone-ripoff theme!) Watch and judge for yourself, don\'t listen to the haters.

I was excited to start watching another anime from the person who directed Legend of the Galactic Heroes and SDF Macross, it evens looks like SDF Macross. What could possibly go wrong with this anime? Just about everything, I\'m afraid.For reasons unknown to me, the budget for this anime is noticeably lacking. For those who have seen Macross and the infamously bad Max vs. Miriya knife duel, that\'s about how Orguss is ALL THE TIME. Reused frames and clunky character movements run rampant and no amount of directorial magic can draw attention away from it. Your eyes will be subject to...bleeding if you watch this anime.What is Orguss all about then... The setting is an Earth that consists of many different versions of Earth due to a new dimensional bomb set off by the main character, Kei. Kei is transported to the future and must make the Earth right again while protecting himself from the various versions of humanity that want to use him for their own goals. Sounds good, right? Oh no, horrible memories are flooding back! One of these new ""human"" species look exactly the same as regular humans, except they have weird hair tentacles. This bothers Kei for about 2 seconds before he starts fawning over the sexy hair-tentacle women. The presence of the tentacles is merely so that they don\'t look exactly like humans, I can make this bold statement because their purpose is never mentioned throughout the rest of the show, nor do they seem to be of any use except as a reminder for them to be very careful around scissors. To add insult to injury, this beacon of evolution, the people who have easily ripped off hair-tentacles, can\'t have children after the age of 18. No, you did not read that wrong, every girl belonging to this species gets knocked up when they\'re underage. Oh, Japan...I also have to add, in one of the early episodes Kei notes how these people don\'t really mourn death the same way humans do. This is not adhered to or brought up again for the rest of show. It was too hard to write in an entire one cultural difference apparently.""Surely then,"" you ask, ""the characters make up for it?"" HAHAHAHA, did you think this would be anything like SDF Macross where there is an underlying character drama underneath the all mechs and lasers? Unfortunately, wrong. There is a vague attempt to make some melodrama by having the main character be a man-slut homewrecker, but we\'re saved from that horrible plot point by the convenient killing off of his competition. It\'s no spoiler, the guy has maybe four lines and nobody even likes him. Life lesson: infidelity is no problemo if the dude you\'re screwing over is a total jerk.I can\'t say much about the overall direction of Orguss, there isn\'t much of one to begin with. Just know, basically everything ends up having no consequence and everyone but maybe three characters could not have existed and it would have all ended the same anyway.Thanks for nothing, Orguss. bleeding if you watch this anime.What is Orguss all about then...

You had such a neat, unique concept for a story, and then somehow made it into generic schlock. If Aura Battler Dunbine is considered to be one of the first isekai anime, then Orguss was also truly ahead of its time incorporating all the tropes people hate in modern isekai, and might just possibly be the progenitor of bad isekai anime.--STORY—As stated above, Orguss’s story starts off interesting. It starts off with this dimension bomb thingy going off, and it teleports our mc into a new world that’s a Frankenstein of multiple different worlds from various...alternate dimensions. It very quickly becomes a typical mecha war drama that barely does anything interesting with its gimmick. Speaking of the generic isekai tropes tho we have:-\tPervy playboy mc that sexually assaults the main female character at least a few times throughout the series.-\tPretty much every female character being centered around a male love interest with half being the playboy mc, and hardly getting any character growth.-\tA little girl slave robot with a cleavage window the mc buys.-\tA species that are “totally not humans”, and whose defining features are…hair tentacles.-\tSaid species also needing to have girls marry and have sex before 18, cuz they become sterile at the age of 18Wonderful freaking world and story we got here huh? First half of the series is a very slow and boring slog, as our main cast constantly tries to get away with from generic military dudes with stickers on their foreheads. Second half is barely interesting but still mostly boring with some concepts that could be pretty interesting such as the mc maybe having to choose between 1 of the 2 worlds they’ve come to have close affiliations with. Alas these concepts don’t go anywhere really, and ultimately the ending is a bunch of nonsense and you can clearly tell the team behind this show had run out of budget and craps to give about the show.--CHARACTERS—I struggle to think of any characters in this series I actually like. Kei is the closest character to having actual good character development, if you can even call it “good”. He takes half the series to become remotely likeable, and even after that there were various moments where I just rolled my eyes at his actions. He starts off as a filthy home wrecker, and ends being a somewhat ok guy but still very much stays the annoying frat boy he started off as.It’s not like the side cast is any better, they’re outright worse if anything. Mimsy comes off as a spineless girl who can’t stay loyal to her man, and then the rest of the series she does basically nothing but be Kei’s GF or a damsel in distress. Shaya comes off as a wishy washy, incompetent “leader”, who often gets our cast into a trouble and never has her naïve ideals really challenged. Mome is just there to be cute or for perverted lolicon fanservice, Olson can’t go 5 seconds without saying “but muh singularity”, Athena is “daddy issues the character”, I could go on. Any development for these characters is either nonexistent or bare minimum of what you should do in an anime. It’s not even worth mentioning the antagonists, they serve as nothing but an opposing force and our just your generic evil government or rebel robots.--MUSIC/VOICE ACTING—Perhaps the best thing about Orguss is its OP. It’s an absolute banger, and the ED is alright too. The rest of the soundtrack is…average. None of the themes in the soundtrack particularly stood out. I watched sub, and voice acting is good as always.--ART/ANIMATION—From old shonen to several mecha series, I’ve seen a lot of shows that often reuse stock footage or animation. I’m ok with that, it’s expected of both genres, in fact I probably mind it less than most people. That being said, HOLY CRAP the SHEER AMOUNT of reused animation is staggering in Orguss. I’ve genuinely never seen a series so cheaply and shamelessly reuse animation. There are times when certain reused animation doesn’t even make sense in the context of the scene. There’s this one often reused animation of the main mech pushing itself off of a rock, and then they reuse it later but it pushes off of NOTHING. Literally nothing is there, and it’s not the only example. It’s not like this is just an old anime thing, since I’ve seen series like Xabungle, Gundam 0079 and Zeta, Ideon, etc. that are all from the same year or earlier and all have better animation and less reused stock footage.As for the character designs, they’re ok. There are a few characters that look the same but with different hair color which is annoying, but nothing too bad. Jabby has a cool design, but is really the only remotely alien looking thing in this series. The Orguss, and mechs for Olson and Athena are look kinda cool but aren’t my cup of tea. The grunt units are meh and it feels like there’s barely any differentiation between them, and the same can be said for the ships. Boths characters and mechs are actually drawn on model mostly, but there are def some shots with questionable quality.--ENJOYMENT/CONCLUSION—To be quite frank, I did not enjoy Orguss. After about 10 eps or so, for the first time ever I watched an anime on 1.5x speed and powered through the rest of it by sheer will power. It’s at best below average and still a huge waste of time to watch. I can only rec you watch Orguss on 3 conditions being:-\tYou want to see most or every series in Super Robot War Z (the only reason I watched this personally)-\tYou’re some kind of anime completionist or masochist, but let’s be honest they’re both the same thing.-\tYou just want to laugh at a bad isekai anime, and take the piss out of it.Ultimately though, you’re best off checking out just the OP and never touching it again. alternate dimensions.

I mean, Orguss LOOKS good, but the characters and plot are all over the place. The main character is pretty much a womanizing, rape-y douche-solider that got warped into a parallel world, where’s there’s subsequently… a harem of hair-tentacle girls and a robot loli. Great.• So, our lovely protagonist, Kei Katsuragi, holds one of the girls, Mimsy, at knife point and tries to force her into kissing him. And because main character privilege, also known as protagonist syndrome, in real life, Mimsy eventually falls in love with him and he NTRs’ her...fiancée. To make things worse, all of the women in this dimension have to have sex when they’re teenagers, because they’re infertile in adulthood apparently. What the fuck, Japan?• The what-the-fuckery gets more intense when you find out that the ship captain’s twin sister Maniisha is being so antagonistic to the crew because her husband originally wanted to sleep with her sister? How are you supposed to like any of these characters when even fucking Jabby, pretty much the Jar Jar Binks of the show, is shown cheating on his girlfriend in a flashback? Why didn’t Noboru Ishiguro just make a NTR hentai?• And the lolita robot-slave, I’m not fucking with you, gets jealous over Mimsey and expresses a romantic interest in the protagonist, which is partially reciprocated, because the main character is a piece of shit! Keep in mind: Noburo Ishiguro is the director behind Legend of the Galactic Heroes, the original Macross, Megazone 23, and the original Space Battleship Yamato, so Orguss’s visual direction is on point. That’s what makes it so bad…• There are some weird visual conniptions, in character movements and general robotic animation, but overall I thought the designs and directing were appealing to look at. I thought the idea of what would happen if a singularity were to exist within a parallel dimension was supremely dope, and wished that all of the internal character drama didn’t distract from the conceptual coolness.• I didn’t think that Orguss 02 was that much worse than the original, though obviously inferior in direction. There’s another rape-y, douchebag character, that’s not in the main cast, and actually gets bad karma in the end, instead of being celebrated as a hero home-wrecker. The main villain from 02 was silly, he’s exactly like Shakespeare’s Hamlet (not exaggerating), except if Hamlet wanted to destroy all of humanity to cover the Earth with beautiful flowers.• But, overall it isn’t that inferior to Ishiguro’s vision. The director who did the second series, Fumihiko Takayama, also was behind Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in Pocket, which I enjoyed. Both Orguss stories kind of made me feel trailer trash for watching them, with little-to-no sophistication with the writing.• The original Orguss is like a much, much worse version of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, as far as women being cast as meat bags that are just there to sleep with and don’t really do anything that useful, but the original Gundam actually has them written as human beings, not just conquests.• With the little eyebrow turns you gets from the dated subject matter in Gundam, you also get a superbly executed and iconic story, characters, and world. Whereas Orguss just seems like a cheap, bargain bin pulp magazine from the 80s. I did like how the story wrapped up at the end; Ishiguro is really great knotting together all of the strings of the story with a glorious conclusion in the endーnote to viewers: the prime example of this is Legend of the Galactic Heroes.• If you’re wondering why Legend of the Galactic Heroes is is considered the greatest sci-fi work in anime history; you have to watch it to the end to know what I’m talking about. Every question or head scratch you might have about the show is answered. I give the original series of Super Dimensional Orguss a 4/10 and Orguss 02 a 3/10. fiancée.

I give the original series of Super Dimensional Orguss a 4/10 and Orguss 02 a 3/10.', ""There's a strong feeling of early Gundam to the structure of this show. Most of it involves a group of misfits travelling through enemy territory in their ship, getting embroiled in local conflicts for an episode or two, and fending off attacks with their mechs. Where Gundam added variety with a new mech design almost every episode, Orguss instead shows us new species and cultures that have been mashed together in a cross-dimensional apocalypse.The broad strokes of the plot in Orguss are great, presenting some tough moral dilemmas for the characters to overcome. The scene-by-scene execution of those ideas often fall short, however, mostly due...to clunky dialogue and a habit of telegraphing upcoming twists. The characters are likewise an entertaining bunch, from the playboy pilot to the grumpy old combat robot, but many aren't given enough screen time to develop. It remains a good watch throughout its 35-episode run though, and only really falls down in the final minute with a confusing and frustrating ending. to clunky dialogue and a habit of telegraphing upcoming twists.

I remember owning a few of the Animeigo dubbed tapes of Orguss later on in the days of VHS, but never saw the series proper until recently thanks to the efforts of fan-subbers. Suffice to say after seeing the whole narrative beginning to end, it had some potential and a few interesting characters, but feels like it largely spins it's wheels in regards to...exploring characters deeply or going more into the worldbuilding & 'alien' cultures the way Macross did so effectively. It was too bad because I found the Emaan culture of Gypsy Traders to be really fascinating, but after some early exploration of the idea, the series settles into a constant grind of battles that rarely offers time to explore this interesting facet of their society (or the Terram or Mu cultures for that matter) more in depth, with the Singularity concerns dominating most of the narrative outside Kei's romantic developments with Mimsy. The patch-quilt dimensional mosaic structure of the world offered some interesting story potentials, but feels like it is underutilized as an effective narrative tool which was really a shame. The ending also left me unsatisfied with an abrupt ending once they reach the Space Elevator, kind of like how Star Trek Voyager abruptly ended when they reached Earth, as both shows failed to offer much of an epilogue to their narratives and end very suddenly when you expected to hear a bit about what happened in the aftermath of the resolution of both series. exploring characters deeply or going more into the worldbuilding & 'alien' cultures the way Macross did so effectively.

Both were made by similar staff and were in production at the same time at some point. The story is it's own, and follows the story of Kei. He was blasted in an accident into a parallel world along with his friend Olsen. Once there, it's a struggle to try and get back home while at the same time falling in love with the new world he finds himself in. Compared to Macross, Orguss is inferior but still an interesting series going into...early mecha.The series shares many of the same flaws as Macross. The production falls apart constantly. There is lot of reused animation, slide show like execution, and skips in animation. At least the characters don't look like clay sometimes such as in Macross. The ending felt rushed, odd, and underwhelming. I really enjoyed most of the beginning of the series. On the other hand, those few last episodes began to decline in quality and weren't as enjoyable. Music wise, hardly any of the songs were memorable. At the very least the opening and ending sequences are iconic. As a romance, there are several characters that get involved here. Whereas the previous series was based on a love triangle, there are several love triangles and love quadrilaterals going on in Orguss. You can expect lots of heavy drama in regards to this.Kei himself is an amusing and funny character. He always has something smart to say back even during dangerous situations. The man is always surrounded by women and is very flirtatious. At the same time, once he has really fallen in love he can fully commit, though he can make inappropriate comments at times that can make his girlfriends jealous. He makes a lot of mistakes but ultimately is a good man. Throughout the series, he tries to adjust to the way life works in this new Earth, and travels around after meeting the crew of the ship called The Factory. It's revealed that he and Olsen are the singularities. They would come to understand that they have become the keys towards restoring the Earth. Kei can also be very reckless to the point his life can be carelessly put in heavy danger.Olsen is his friend who thinks much more rationally. He doesn't succumb as easily to his feelings unlike Kei. He is often calm, cool, and collected. He often wears shades for his iconic look and tries to be Kei's voice of reason.Mimsy is, you could say, the Minmay of Orguss in a few ways, except Mimsy's character is too involved in emotion than actually growing and developing as a character. She is just something to protect and not much else. Her character design can look very beautiful at times when she isn't drawn in odd ways. She is part of a race that look like humans, except that they have two tentacles that made Kei panic once he noticed them. They are sort of like the Zentradi from Macross in that they live life oddly in Kei's view, while at the same time they are not too familiar with the culture of Kei's human race. She is Slay's girlfriend who finds Kei as a bother as he has a target on his back and is constantly bringing trouble back home to the crew.Mome is another focus of the series as a cybernetic girl with many useful skills. She is head over heels over Kei despite that he has no interest whatsoever. Her story is touching but feels like a tragedy overall.There are sadly many characters who don't do too much by the end and don't really feel worth mentioning. Still, there are a few more who are memorable such as the adorable duo pilots Lieea and Maaie, Shaya who gets involved in her own love triangle, Athena the conflicted soldier, the loveable Jabby, and the loyally protective captain robot.Despite the animation quality at times, Orguss still can look beautiful. It comes from a time where hand drawn animation beautifully put attention to detail in its own respectable way compared to modern anime. I can appreciate that it does very well in animating the entire characters bodies and in showing body language. You look at modern anime today that is so painfully bland and many times executed as still frames with flapping mouths that really make you appreciate the animation of Orguss.Orguss overall was a very enjoyable series despite it's many flaws. I would have called it a masterpiece if it wasn't for that small mediocre chunk of episodes towards the end. early mecha.The series shares many of the same flaws as Macross.

After playing through the game and the Orguss parts while stumbling through the dialouge (私の日本語がすごいない) I was impressed at the character art and mecha design. This led me to a website named gearsonline (easily searchable enough) which had enticing descriptions of the show, its cast, and some of the art. I also had found the intro song (Sky-hurricane by Casey Rankin, Life in the Sky, 1983) which had me in LOVE. It's incredibly triumphant, with...a large range of emotion and expressions, the flanger guitar effect combined with poppy piano has me in tears. (Additionally, the best part of the song is the first half!) The accompanying animation is also splendid, colorful, and evocative. Really, if this entire anime was just this opening, it would be a 10/10! Gypsy is also a rather fun outro song, though not as imaginative.I am actually rather split on the overall tone and nature of Orguss. During this short review, I will try not to make comparisons - if I were to do that, I unfortunately just couldn't put it up to the high pedestal of modern classics such as Space Patrol Luluco (Trigger, 2016) - and judge it on its own merits.THE GOOD:Orguss has a very colorful palette, as shown in the intro. It pops very often with pleasing aesthetic design and direction. The budget feels rather low, but this doesn't really bother me so much. It's kind of funny rather, seeing cells of mecha just sorta slide into frame. A few more frames of animation sometimes would have a smoother presentation, and more kinetic energy, but I'm not a huge buff in this area and I generally enjoyed it. Animations do get reused, and this often feels a little lazy, but they're usually good to begin with. (Seeing the MC's stupid smiling face as he spins a stolen mecha in the air does warm my heart, even if half of it is stills that slowly pan or zoom in.) I also generally like the sound design, especially in the outerspace sections.The setting of the show allows for a huge melting pot of cultures, literally popping in and out of space and time around each other. This is, on its face, pretty exciting! Unfortunately, they don't really do a whole lot with the idea, but it leaves room to sort of imagine conflicts that could arise. You might get the theme at this point which the show has good ideas, BUT is lacking in execution. Orguss plays with these ideas in a sort of monster-of-the-week kind of way, which feels a bit lacking but still serves a purpose. Did I accidentally watch an 80s sitcom with a dumbass protagonist who bumbles his way into bad situations? Possibly.Characters do develop over time, especially the main character (thank FUCKING god). There isn't a lot of attention to the background characters in this area, but I feel that makes sense in context. The central drama is about the MC's internal conflicts - does he fight for himself? his ego? for his friends? does he experience love? or is he just selfishly using everyone for his own gains while protecting his fragile masculinity in whatever way he thinks he can? He is certainly in a scary and dreadful situation, losing everything he has except (for a moment) his aircraft, and his piloting ability. The only thing really left of Kei Katsuragi is to be a soldier, but the WHY of it is taken for granted - at least until he must confront it.THE BAD:As alluded to, the MC is a bit of a chauvinstic prick. It goes beyond just being a sexist asshole, he holds a woman at knifepoint and forces a kiss on her! She calls his bluff, that he would not actually hurt her with the knife, and he uses the kiss as a last ditch resort to establish some amount of control. Do I feel like there is an avenue for understanding this character, his plight, and the journey that he has to undertake to reach a point where he can respect others - and himself? Yeah. I think that's the only real reason I kept watching. He is really difficult to watch in the first few episodes, where that is a constant nuisance, and I wouldn't fault you for ditching the show based on that alone. A lot of these types of media live and die by the attractiveness of their main cast, physically and personality wise, and the MC is very hard to stomach - though he is a bit cute as an 80s anime boy.Leaving that aside, as difficult as it may be, the other characters just act kind of... weird. Mimsy Raas acts like a very stereotypical heroine in the beginning, with superficial dialogue and voice acting (in Japanese at least) that makes me think she is trying to be that way. Shaia Tobu is also strange, she constantly makes bad decisions, and will complain when others take control as if it were a game to play. The Emarns are described as believing in souls and not taking mortality as hard as you might expect, but this is not at all consistent when someone who is important to them dies, and is in very fact important whenever the plot demands it. I can't decide if this is bad storytelling or they just wanted to have an excuse for a lighter mood, to allow for more slapstick humor. A feature of the times. In either case, I'm not really a fan.As a contrivance of the plot, the MC has to be a good pilot and the enemy (Chiram soldiers) have to be bad pilots, unless the episode demands that one of them is good (random dude who evades every shot) for some amount of dramatic tension. Kei is just so fricking powerful in every scene until he loses due to absolute incompetence. There is kind of a weird connotation again, that the enemy is both so incredibly powerful and numerous yet also so stupidly weak. Why all the friendly fire?? Why do they seriously crash into each other when scared??? Did you guys not learn how to fly???? My suspension of disbelief only goes so far!As mentioned by another reviewer, it is weird emphasizing the Emarns' reproductive cycle, the 2:1 ratio of women to men, and the awkward loli-robot. All of these things are a bit creepy. I can however, apply an angle of culture shock to it, if only to allow myself to continue enjoying the show. Do these aspects of civilization seem a bit horny and nonsensical? Maybe, but that's a matter of perspective. If this type of thing WERE the case in a separate reality, I would probably just accept it at face-value, and move on. The show does not really linger on these topics as they're introduced - which also feels a bit off. The pacing of the show just kind of introduces concepts and then... continues. For the first 14 episodes, it's hard to say exactly what happens. The gang goes home. Setups will be created for the cast to feel righteous in some cold-hearted mecha murder action, and then they do it, rarely with consequence. Also, realizing that the dinosaur Jahvy was basically just Jar-Jar Binks made it hard to take any scene with him seriously.OVERALL:Super Dimension Century Orguss is a good show to watch in the background of something else! I don't think it lives up to the intro, but there's a lot of show to engage with nonetheless. The best thing I can really say is that it lasted 35 episodes, and all of them CAN be an enjoyable use of time. I cannot really tell anyone who isn't already interested to watch it, and it seems in describing it to my friends they have decided to never do so, but if the premise interests you - take a chance! a large range of emotion and expressions, the flanger guitar effect combined with poppy piano has me in tears.

Comic Party Revolution,https://myanimelist.net/anime/706/Comic_Party_Revolution,"['Now I will admit that change can sometimes be a good thing as it can bring new perspectives, a new feel, and a new avenues for the plot to explore. The only problem is that all too often in anime, change simply means demeaning the existing work and it\'s fanbase by producing, well, crap.It\'s unfortunate then, that a pioneering show like Comic Party should suffer the ignominy of having a sequel like Revolution, and while the two shows share many qualities, they are sometimes used in very different ways.The story initially follows directly on from the original Comic Party, with Kazuki and Mizuki now...attending college. Kazuki has continued to work on doujin creation in his spare time, while Mizuki\'s attitude towards otaku has softened slightly, although she does still hate the majority of them. The rest of the gang from Comic Party are all present and correct as well, and the show also introduces a few characters who, if you\'ve played the game, were noticeably absent in the first series.The biggest problem with CP Revolution is the lack of any coherent or cohesive plot. Now I will be the first to admit that some shows work really well on nothing more than a ""what if....?"" premise, however this isn\'t one of those occasions. CP Revolution suffers from a fundamental lack of plot and, while there is a lot of comedy in the show, much of it, especially during the first few episodes, is generic and overblown. The problem with the show is that it suddenly strikes off in what seems to be a vaguely new direction from time to time, something which really upsets the overall flow of the story. The reason for this is simple. CP Revolution was originally intended to be a two-part OVA, but was bumped up to four episodes after the release of episode one.Many will have noticed that there are actually two versions of CP Revolution, an OVA and a TV series, and potential viewers of either need to know one important fact - the OVA is basically the first four episodes of the TV series (with some minor editing). The OVA, directed by Sakata Junichi, was extended to a 13 episode TV series in 2005, and the four episodes were edited and shortened to ensure they fit in the show\'s time slot. The following episodes however (5-13), were not direct by Sakata, but by Tougo Mitsuhiro, and the difference in style really shows midway through the series.The production schedule is actually the main reason why the directors have tried to compensate for the show\'s failings, however in respect of the comedy they have tried a bit too hard. The show\'s focus is also different from the original series. Where Comic Party focused on Kazuki and the creation of doujins in amongst all the antics, CP Revolution focuses more on the female characters.As far as the design, animation and backgrounds go, CP Revolution is every bit as colourful and well animated as Comic Party. The character designs largely follow the first series and the game, however there is a certain genericism that permeates the show, reflecting the fact that CP Revolution is also a harem rom-com. The change in production companies hasn\'t really brought anything new to the show, and in truth, the fact that CP Revolution was made by a different comany, with a different director (on both occasions), is actually a hindrance rather than a help.In terms of production, the biggest letdown was in the music and voice acting. The score was particularly bland for a show that is essentially trying to be a madcap comedy, and gives much of the humour a rather ""forced"" feeling. The voice acting in the Japanese dub is pretty decent, which is understandable since the cast is much the same as that for the original series. The problem is with the English dub, as the cast, for some reason, really try to ham up their roles, especially when it comes to accents.The English dub is the main reason why I\'ve scored the sound as average. If you\'re planning to watch this show, stick to the Japanese dub and subtitles.Character-wise, the show runs on the assumption that the viewer has already seen the first series. CP Revolution isn\'t bad as far as development goes, with certain characters having an entire episode devoted to them. Unfortunately, this type of development is artificial and haphazard, especially in comparison to the first series. The reason for this is, once again, the messed up production schedule. The characterisations were pretty decent for the most part, especially with the characters that continued on from the first series. That said, because the show tries to be a harem rom-com it very much needs the characters to be developed, and developed well. The characters in CP Revolution only grow sporadically, and it\'s truly sad to see the huge missed opportunity here as the characters in CP Revolution are older than in Comic Party, and college students to boot.This show could very easily have become a real rival to Genshiken instead of the lacklustre attempt at otaku based humour that it is.That\'s not to say that the show is so bad that it\'s unwatchable. In comparison to the first series, CP Revolution is hands down the loser in pretty much every department, but that doesn\'t automatically make it bad. The humour, while being over the top, is sometimes pretty funny. The characters are okay for the most part, with the biggest plus being that none of them are overly annoying. Although the story is on the ""here and there"" side, it isn\'t so bad that it won\'t keep fans of otakudom watching, and the show has just as many references as the original Comic Party did, so playing the spotting game is always an option.I\'ll be completely honest though - this show could have been so much more. All the chopping and changing in the production schedule meant that there was simply no time for other options to be examined, so everything was simply thrown together and everyone hoped for the best. Strangely enough this has worked - and it hasn\'t. The viewer is able to see just how much potential the show had as either a rom-com, a slice of life comedy, or a zany, surrealist comedy (like Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu). If the director and studio had chosen any one of those paths, then CP Revolution would have been a much better show than it is, especially as the seeds of all three types of comedy are there within the series.It seems as though the old adage ""if it isn\'t broken, don\'t fix it"" only exists for certain anime, and sadly, Comic Party Revolution isn\'t one of them. attending college. Kazuki has continued to work on doujin creation in his spare time, while Mizuki\'s attitude towards otaku has softened slightly, although she does still hate the majority of them.

The characters in CP Revolution only grow sporadically, and it\'s truly sad to see the huge missed opportunity here as the characters in CP Revolution are older than in Comic Party, and college students to boot.This show could very easily have become a real rival to Genshiken instead of the lacklustre attempt at otaku based humour that it is.That\'s not to say that the show is so bad that it\'s unwatchable. In comparison to the first series, CP Revolution is hands down the loser in pretty much every department, but that doesn\'t automatically make it bad. The humour, while being over the top, is sometimes pretty funny. The characters are okay for the most part, with the biggest plus being that none of them are overly annoying. Although the story is on the ""here and there"" side, it isn\'t so bad that it won\'t keep fans of otakudom watching, and the show has just as many references as the original Comic Party did, so playing the spotting game is always an option.I\'ll be completely honest though - this show could have been so much more. All the chopping and changing in the production schedule meant that there was simply no time for other options to be examined, so everything was simply thrown together and everyone hoped for the best. Strangely enough this has worked - and it hasn\'t. The viewer is able to see just how much potential the show had as either a rom-com, a slice of life comedy, or a zany, surrealist comedy (like Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu). If the director and studio had chosen any one of those paths, then CP Revolution would have been a much better show than it is, especially as the seeds of all three types of comedy are there within the series.It seems as though the old adage ""if it isn\'t broken, don\'t fix it"" only exists for certain anime, and sadly, Comic Party Revolution isn\'t one of them.', '""Comic Party Revolution"" is the second season in the Comic Party anime. If you’re a fan of the first season, then you will enjoy this one as well. The whole premise of the anime shows life in the Otaku world, which revolves around one thing...Doujin!Story: 7/10The story in the second season is much more random based when compared to the first. One of the most stand out features that viewers of the first season will notice, is the age of all the characters. When we last left the gang, they were around the age of high school kids, now they seem to be of College...age. Kazuki is still creating mangas as he usually does of course, and if you have seen other series revolving around ""Doujin, "" then this will feel very familiar to you. The story doesn’t really follow too much of a strong premise. The whole general idea is suppose to revolve around Kazuki and his Doujins. However this one steers more clear of that general idea, and pretty much only shows the gang running into random predicaments and gags (at least for a big chunk of the series anyway). Even so I still found quite a bit of enjoyment from the humor in this, such as when the gang gets lost in the woods, and can only get directions from a group of army members that want to challenge them to a stealth contest. Despite the series not going too over the top with it’s gags, you can also see that it doesn’t take itself very seriously either. One of the cast members even has the ability to literally transform into her favorite anime character. One thing that made the series quite enjoyable, is all the neat cosplay you get to see from time to time, many of which are quite recognizable from other series. Of course due to copyright law I guess, they never actually said the series name, and only made up a title that sounded like it. (ie: ""Cardmaster Peach"" is really ""Cardcaptor Sakura and Wedding Peach"") They also use a lot of Otaku dialog, and enjoy many jokes revolving around the whole ""moe"" factor. My biggest complaint with the story though, was the actual ending! It made absolutely no sense whatsoever, and felt quite uninspired. Still, it isn’t a series that is really trying to involve the viewer with its overall plot, and focuses more on randomness and character humor. All in all, it has good concepts. It may not suck you in with any of its actual storyline, but it will indeed put a smile on your face afterward. Plus I think that viewers who have seen more realistic ""Doujin"" titles, and thus may have found some of them to be a tad too realistic and boring, might find this one more enjoyable to digest.Art: 8/10I really dug the art style to this. The animators did a great job at making the characters look older, yet at the same time very familiar. The whole series is quite bright, with a nice selection of rich colors and art. Most of the characters outfits have been tweaked from their standard default ones of before, and all have great style and appeal to them. Backgrounds were okay, but sometimes looked quite faded and dull. They just couldn’t compare to the actual character art.Sound: 7/10The opening and closing tracks are quite catchy and memorable, so chances are you will still have them in your head long after the series is done. I actually watched this anime in both English and Japanese, and have to say that each one is just as good as the other. As with the art style though, the background music is pretty bland, they do strike the right keys for most situations, it’s just a shame that there isn’t really anything that jumps out at you.Characters: 8/10The heart of ""Comic Party Revolution, "" is not found in any kind of deep emotional story, but with its characters! Each one has his or her own likes and dislikes. You get a nice variety of personalities with this. From the down to earth Aya, to the brash and outspoken Taishi (who enjoys calling everyone his ""brother and sister"" in the Otaku world). They don’t have a whole great deal of depth to them, granted that there are just too many characters in this series to do so. Still, viewers will get to know them well enough to where they can understand what most are all about.Overall: 7/10""Comic Party Revolution"" may not blow you away with its content, but it is still quite an enjoyable little series. If you\'re a fan of such series as ""Doujin Work,"" or are looking for an anime that deals heavily in this life style, then you may find this one to be a bit too far fetched from the whole Doujin source. Still, if you\'re just looking for a short and humorous anime, then ""Comic Party Revolution"" is a fun read...err...watch. age.

Recently, I remembered this franchise and now began to play the original game, at the same time I decided to re-watch both seasons. With the first season, neither then nor now questions arose, but the second season I did not like back then. Like most other viewers, it seemed weak and incomprehensible to me. But after I cleared the game for several characters, I completely changed my opinion about him.Story:- The episodes are not related to each other and they’re complete mini-stories....Unlike similar series and especially the first season, the characters here are not represented in any way and just appear. Therefore, for viewers who have not cleared the game, it will be difficult to keep track of what is happening and understand some of the jokes based on the events in the game.- Most of the episodes are interesting and only a small part turned out to be different. But frankly boring stories were not noticed.- There is not so much ecchi. For me, numbers of scenes are same as in the game. The moment with the transformation of Mizuki, of course, gets out of this.- In the last series it was stated “to be continued ...?”, But so far, as you can see, there’s no new season or something. It should be noted that each edition / re-edition of the game were coming out together with the release of the seasons of the series and OVA. If another re-edition happens, then maybe new season will come out.Art:- Characters’ design has changed in relation to the first season, but it has become closer to the original design of the game, which I certainly pleases.- I would rate the overall quality as good (7 out of 10). Opening and ending are drawn independently of the main series and their drawing quality is noticeably better. The graphics in the main series is changing. The first 4 episodes that were OVA are well drawn and there are no complaints about them. In the rest - part of the scenes were drawn extremely awful, but there are not many of them to spoil the overall impression.Sound:- I watched with Japanese voice acting and therefore I will say about it. With the exception of Mizuki and girls-cosplayers, the rest of voice actors remained the same as in the first season and game. To the main character there are no questions for actors - I liked them! But I did not remember voices of the episodic characters.- The musical compositions are not particularly memorable, except for those that were in the game. This season they took a few songs from there.- I like opening theme more than ending. By themselves, they are not bad, but they cannot be called outstanding.Characters:- Since one of the genres of the game was a love simulator, each of the characters has its own unique character, style of speech, etc. But characters’ histories are not described here, as I wrote above.- There were several ""over-acting"" moments of Taishi, as it seemed to me, even by his standards. In general, the other characters behave as prescribed in the game and with some changes from the first season. So they are good.- The most memorable character from the first viewing and still remains is Kuhonbutsu Taishi.Overall impression:- I consider that the main problem of the second season is focusing only on game fans or just on players who have gone through it at least once or twice. Since this season is not a continuation of the first and is associated only with the game. It is not clear why they decided to do so. There are no intro episodes where at least they could represent all the local characters. Of course the number of episodes would change, but the season would have liked by a greater number of viewers. I think that there was no such problem in Japan, since there only certain people looked at it there. Only the series and manga were released outside of Japan, and the game, which links everything, remained available only in Japanese.- Therefore, the season should definitely please those viewers who are familiar with the game. For the rest, it will seem less interesting than the first season so they can skip it.- For me, the second season, after re-watching, even slightly surpassed the first one, thanks to the many references to moments from the game. Unlike similar series and especially the first season, the characters here are not represented in any way and just appear.

I guess I have to say, it’s not as bad as some sequels but this one is one of them. From the artwork to the voices, it just takes the cake. The story line is more like a stand alone show now, making each episode be Kazuki with a pretty girl. It turned into a date style show.This had a lot less parody then the one before and less that had to do with the comic convention and manga creation. It turned more into a slice of life and sweetheart romance. In the...end, I don’t really like the new change. It’s called Comic Party for a reason, not day in the life of Kazuki.What the hell just happened? The animation looks pretty fucked up. Now, they did give them a better looking face, but now their heads are way too small and their necks way to long. The bodies are a bit un proportioned making them feel wrong no matter what way you look at it. A lot of the images show a lot of fan service in it, and I can’t believe how short some of the shirts are.The voices in the English dub are so fucked up! Now, one or two feel better then the older version but they just had to mess up Taishi’s voice and that’s not cool! The characters sound much older and not well done ether. The new character, Subaru, isn’t that good ether. What’s with the ‘fugu’ part? Does she actually say that in the manga or is she even in the manga? Yu sounds like she became a Brooklyn accent and Eimi Ohba’s voice have just become an octave way to high. Now, I do like Kazuki’s newer voice and he doesn’t sound so much like a whiny brat. At least they use the words Manga and dojinshi.The music is nice in the beginning and it feels a bit closer to a game music then the other ones. end, I don’t really like the new change.

However, towards the end, I felt this second season was okay.Character development did happen, but it didn't go as deep as I would like it to have gone. Lots of the episodes dedicated themselves to having the viewer learn about each character a little bit more (except for Subaru).I apparently missed something because the character Subaru just suddenly appeared in...the group that I've grown to love. I felt as if she was an outsider the entire time.The art style is a little different, but not so different that I couldn't enjoy the show. Instead of living in a house, Kazuki lives  in an apartment. All of the characters felt much taller, which made me think that at least a couple years have past since the ending of the first season (although that isn't supposed to be the case). Mizuki's and Yuu's hair is a lot longer.The English dub in this season was... okay. Yuu's voice actress was obviously from New York or New Jersey because her voice stood out like sore thumb. She has no place in Japanese anime's.Mizuki's voice actress is great, she reminds me a lot of School Rumble.The music wasn't very noticeable. A couple times I noticed a great melody but nothing in particular struck me as fantastic or something that I had to have.Although I did enjoy the show, I have to say this show strikingly scores 7 all over the place. It does not do exceptionally well in any category or in any way period. There was no underlying story to speak of, the art was a bit different, the characters did not get as much depth as needed, but in the end I did enjoy what I watched because of the comedy.The last episode is specifically why I ended up liking this season. It strayed from its normal E rated material. The last episode had two ways it could have finished. One way could've finished romantically, the other could've finished with no real relationship advancement what-so-ever. Unfortunately the chose they latter. In the end, I wanted a bit of romance to be sparked and nothing advanced in any of the characters relationships.The relationships in the end were exactly the same as they were in the beginning of the season.Eimi Ooba for some reason becomes part of the group. Her reasons for doing so is never clear. Aya's reason is never touched on either, but her reasons are more obvious. Subaru is a surprise character, she suddenly appears out of nowhere and seems to know everyone really well. Her character did not get any depth and remained an outsider in my eyes.I was looking forward to season two because I wanted some resolutions, but all I got was a bunch more questions and sometimes became confused as to why certain things happened.This show kind of ruined Comic Party for me. Part of me regrets watching this season, but another part of me is glad that I watched the last episode.Now, on to the OVA, and hopefully it was resolve some of my questions.

Cheat Kusushi no Slow Life: Isekai ni Tsukurou Drugstore,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40960/Cheat_Kusushi_no_Slow_Life__Isekai_ni_Tsukurou_Drugstore,"[""Let me start this review off by saying that if you're looking for a brain-heavy show packed with tons of action and adventure, then i advise you to look somewhere else, as Isekai Drugstore doesn't exactly have any of that. But, what Isekai Drugstore does have is a genuinely cute, wholesome, and enjoyable story, with funny characters, and a ton of humorous moments that'll leave you loving this show. Well, at least i hope it does, because it definitely did that for me.Cheat Pharmacist is an extremely generic, unoriginal show, through and through, and there's absolutely no doubt about that. But what this show does...best is that it stays true to itself the whole way. It doesn't try to be anything its not, because this show is already so unbelievably dumb that it doesn't need to do anything outside of its obvious plot and production limits. But hey, it's a good kind of dumb. And if there's one thing i can't lie about, it's that i enjoyed this show for its 12 episode runtime. When it comes to viewing shows like this, i tend to be extremely critical. If anything, i'm very strict when it comes to fantasy isekai animes, because just like anyone else, i find that genre of anime so insufferable and uninspired that i simply cannot invest my time into those types of shows. But, there's something odd about this one. For example, I feel like one reason i enjoy this anime so much is because it reminds me of I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level, which finished airing June 26th of this year, and even if they aren't exactly all that alike, they both share that common quirkiness and enjoyability.The consistency in the art style and production that this show maintains is honestly pretty impressive. I said this in my last version of this review, but this show has a vibrant color palette with cute character designs that look like eye candy. One common element that all these Isekai animes share is that they all usually have a pretty subpar animation studio backing them, with somewhat subpar production quality. But, Cheat Pharmacist doesn't really have any of that. However, what Cheat Pharmacist brings is a message. What is this message, you ask? Well, it's a message to dumb people. If you're an idiot, you should know that Cheat Pharmacist is here for you, and is willing to welcome you with open arms and embrace you with their colorful and vibrant warmth.The sound is pretty normal, honestly. The background music is basically just anything you could possibly ever hear in a fantasy anime, but there's not necessarily anything wrong with the soundtrack, it's simply just okay. However, i should say that i really love the ending theme for this show. It's incredibly catchy, and i had to add it to my playlist when i heard it. So, in terms of everything that this show provides, the soundtrack is definitely the weakest link, but the ending theme makes up for it, and it doesn't affect the show negatively.   The VA's do a good job with these characters, and overall, there's nothing exactly wrong with the sound elements of this show, but there's not exactly anything unique.However, the enjoyment i got out of this show left me wanting a new episode every week, and i find it odd that i would like a show like this so much, but it was pretty entertaining the whole way. If there was a Season 2, i would definitely give this show another chance without any doubts. If you're looking for a show far more serious than this, then i can't exactly blame you, but if you want to turn off your brain for a couple of hours, and watch colorful, idiotic anime characters yell and do random crap, give this thing a try. You might even end up enjoying it as much as me.End of review. best is that it stays true to itself the whole way. It doesn't try to be anything its not, because this show is already so unbelievably dumb that it doesn't need to do anything outside of its obvious plot and production limits. But hey, it's a good kind of dumb. And if there's one thing i can't lie about, it's that i enjoyed this show for its 12 episode runtime. When it comes to viewing shows like this, i tend to be extremely critical. If anything, i'm very strict when it comes to fantasy isekai animes, because just like anyone else, i find that genre of anime so insufferable and uninspired that i simply cannot invest my time into those types of shows. But, there's something odd about this one. For example, I feel like one reason i enjoy this anime so much is because it reminds me of I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level, which finished airing June 26th of this year, and even if they aren't exactly all that alike, they both share that common quirkiness and enjoyability.The consistency in the art style and production that this show maintains is honestly pretty impressive. I said this in my last version of this review, but this show has a vibrant color palette with cute character designs that look like eye candy. One common element that all these Isekai animes share is that they all usually have a pretty subpar animation studio backing them, with somewhat subpar production quality. But, Cheat Pharmacist doesn't really have any of that. However, what Cheat Pharmacist brings is a message. What is this message, you ask? Well, it's a message to dumb people. If you're an idiot, you should know that Cheat Pharmacist is here for you, and is willing to welcome you with open arms and embrace you with their colorful and vibrant warmth.The sound is pretty normal, honestly. The background music is basically just anything you could possibly ever hear in a fantasy anime, but there's not necessarily anything wrong with the soundtrack, it's simply just okay. However, i should say that i really love the ending theme for this show. It's incredibly catchy, and i had to add it to my playlist when i heard it. So, in terms of everything that this show provides, the soundtrack is definitely the weakest link, but the ending theme makes up for it, and it doesn't affect the show negatively.   The VA's do a good job with these characters, and overall, there's nothing exactly wrong with the sound elements of this show, but there's not exactly anything unique.However, the enjoyment i got out of this show left me wanting a new episode every week, and i find it odd that i would like a show like this so much, but it was pretty entertaining the whole way. If there was a Season 2, i would definitely give this show another chance without any doubts. If you're looking for a show far more serious than this, then i can't exactly blame you, but if you want to turn off your brain for a couple of hours, and watch colorful, idiotic anime characters yell and do random crap, give this thing a try. You might even end up enjoying it as much as me.End of review."", ""I dunno what it is about this show, but it just feels....There? Like it feels like a typical, normal cute show. But once the season is over, you'll put it out your minds, and forget about it. It's not all that bad, some of the characters are cute, and the idea of an Isekai type instead just running a store, rather than going on some grand adventure, is way more appealing then one may think. If it were a typical Isekai, this would get a lower score, but it isn't.Story is pretty straight forward, it explains certain character's backgrounds, of those that we want to...know. But also gives foreshadowing to possible events that can happen in the future. With most of it being centered around an Isekai dude that has been summoned here, and the drugstore itself. So not really much to go on when it comes to the story, it's a bit bland, but it isn't bad either. Suppose a better word for it, would be that they just feel...Normal.

Just a slice of life Anime, without anything special that elevates it from the rest. The animations are simple, the OSTs are very bland and the basic structure of the episodes are extremely repetitive. Without forgetting that the introduction of the Manga/Light Novel (how Reiji met Noera and Mira and how he has been ""isekaid"" to this world) has been cutted off, leaving us without a real exposition about what happened at the beginning of the series.

And what better way to edge this case than the abundance of the Isekai genre in its many sub-genres, from action to pure Iyashikei shows. And seemingly with this show etching in the new Isekai ""Slow Life"" sub-genre, unless you\'re looking for a show that you\'re very willing to waste your time on, Isekai Slow Life Drugstore (which is what I\'ll call the anime since...there\'s no short form for it) is that kind of show where nothing and everything random happens out just out of coincidence.Normally I would spell out the plot as usual, but in this case I would rather copy it off from that one good friend in MAL (that sadly doesn\'t exist anymore) that has a more positive reception to the series (not because I\'m lazy and would use an ounce of my brain cells for this):Disappointed in his corporate slave’s life and being unable to see anything enjoyable in the life overall, Reiji Kirio, one day, finds himself in the world that he has never seen before. However, this does not scare Reiji, he is glad to finally part with his old and monotonous life. Although, the only skills, Reiji acquires are appraisal and potion creation, which he later develops, Reiji manages to earn the respect of many people, whom he has helped. Now Reiji together with his companions open their own drugstore and their new life begins.It is quite difficult to come up with something new to make an Isekai story interesting and somewhat unique. Cheat Kusushi no Slow Life: Isekai ni Tsukurou Drugstore manages to do it: its protagonist does not acquire any superpowers and, of course, he is not immortal; he is just a simple young man. However, the two skills he gets are appraisal and potion creation, which immediately help him find a new companion, in the world he knows nothing about. While it might seem that there is nothing special in being able to create medicine, it will be wrong to think so. Reiji immediately wins recognition of the villagers and even opens his own drugstore, and so his new life begins.It does not involve harems and fanservice is almost non-existent. While it is still a mystery, why Reiji is transported to another world, I do not see this piece of information needed. All that matters is that he is in a new world, Reiji tries to find out more about, he, together with his companions, start his own business and help people, and it is quite enjoyable to follow. Reiji meets many people, who ask him to create them from love potions to something that will scare wolves. And that is the whole story so far. Those who like slice of life, this manga might be what you are looking for. Do not expect any epic action scenes, Cheat Kusushi no Slow Life: Isekai ni Tsukurou Drugstore is just a heartwarming slice of life that takes place in another world.For me though, I can agree that Isekai Slow Life Drugstore IS a good anime if you want to just relax on, but if you\'re looking for a hint at anything fresh and not yet seen of the Isekai culture, then you\'ve come to the wrong show. It\'s not that the characters here aren\'t just bland and boring at times, they feel like cardboard cut-outs that just exist in the fantasy world where they can do anything that they wanna do: which is to craft numerous types of potions with that same kiddy jingle (that gets old really fast) when Reiji gets into potion-making action with demi-human wolfgirl Noela and ghost Mina. Accounting for the fact that it\'s not literally a ""cheat"" of a slow life (that looks misleading), it\'s just a wholesome and heartwarming slice-of-life adventure that the trio who makes up the Kirio Drugstore does as the forefront of a main business entity, serving townsfolk and curing their problems with potion creation and building friendships along the way. It\'s just cutesy, child-like visuals meant to serve the fact that bland series such as this can still provide the reader/watcher with peaceful light-heartedness. If it did just that, then it succeeded with the vast minority.Even with Reiji being voiced by Kazuma\'s VA Jun Fukushima, the fact that Reiji\'s character is a stark contrast of a disparity, kinda doesn\'t elevate the fact that he once voiced the titular eccentric KonoSuba character. At least I can appreciate that Noela\'s VA Risae Matsuda gives the kid-like feels of her never-ending ""ruuuuu~"" wolf cries of her strong attachment to Reiji, so that\'s a thing right there. I could say the same for EMT Squared\'s low production values and the vibes of an OST, because everything just feels OK, not bad but not good either. If there was something I liked about the show, it would be the ED song alone with the whole childlike  quality that for me, never gets old, but something that can also get pretty repetitive pretty fast.Isekai Slow Life Drugstore is one of those completely average shows where there are 2 camps that define this love-hate series: either you just want to watch a show where no words are exchanged but just requiring your eyes and ears (that\'s all style), or you feel bored to the point of reaching for another anime that\'d best serve your time (that\'s no substance).

You would assume that a pharmacist isekai would follow the formula at the very least.To keep it short and sweet, here is what the show has:Your typical child-like character (I mean the whole show seems so childish but whatever) who really cares for MC, your typical servant like character who cares for MC, tsundere strong girl who cares for MC, little noble girl who cares for the...MC, etc.In addition to all this repetitiveness, pretty much each episode is the same, and it is so boring.I definitely wouldn't recommend this anime, it isn't bad enough that I had to drop it (I almost did though, stopped watching after episode 4 and then came back for the hell of it), but it isn't good enough for you to go out of your way to start it.Just leave this show in it's own little corner and move on, unless you want to show this to like your 7 year old siblings or whatever, then maybe it’s fine.

Now you could that its obvious that its in another world because it has a demon lord, but it could just be another time line.The characters are ok, you have an energetic beastling kid, a shopkeeper whom is smart in what he dose, and the supporting character that helps run the shop.This anime is more peaceful than anything, so if you wanted a short break from you usual action or romance anime this could work.

But... A pharmacist? Is that reliable?"" - That was the question I asked when I found out about the show. The only thing I had of information was the synopsis, the magazine the manga was published by (Web Comic Gamma Plus) and that the source material was a Light Novel. It is a path that many works take and with Cheat Kusushi it was no different. The biggest fear of the adaptation is that the magazine itself is new to the manga market and this anime was the first from this new publisher. Now with...the show already closed, I would like to say that they did a satisfying first job.Well, when they announced an adaptation of Cheat Kusushi no Slow Life, I was anxious about what would be presented. A show bringing an intriguing idea, where the isekai this time is... in a pharmacy. In fact, Reiji without much reason is inserted into this world, where he becomes a pharmacist (often mistaken for an alchemist). He, Noera and Mina live together in this universe, without much pretension or contextualization about how they met, but what was important for the anime was not this, but the casual, relaxing and... some boring. In fact, Cheat Kusushi is a show that oscillates in its ideas, as what used to be a scenario of discovering new medicines turns into a heap of things that are easily mistaken for alchemy.Not that I\'m complaining about this proposition, but when the anime idealizes Reiji as just a simple medicine maker to a creator of things capable of making a journal create a visual hologram of one of the characters\' mother, the verisimilitude built during the show is limited and at the same time significantly undermines the expected experience. It\'s a trivial theme within the show, but one that doesn\'t sit well with the series, no matter what argument is used to defend it.But the anime shouldn\'t be criticized for that alone. In fact, what really made the anime silly was the studio itself. EMT Squared is not very well known, except for having made a few anime such as Kuma Kuma Bear and Assassins Pride. The former was a recent project that didn\'t get that popular. To this day it is not a show that has interested many people. Assassins Pride was a waste of time, because besides being a generic story and very bad in the basic aspects, it got the status of one of the worst animes of 2019 (and rightly so). So a weak adaptation that would not improve its reading materials was already expected. That\'s what happened. As much as the anime has the charisma and comics with Reiji, Mina, Noera and all the rest of the group, the show evidently fails to be more than sudden moments. It\'s a synergy that doesn\'t bring anything new and even if it manages to spark interest during its story, it\'s not something that manages to convince.The production is tokenistic. It doesn\'t have that many serious problems, except for the totally IRRITANT AND ACCELERATED beginning, which I\'m sure made many people give up on the anime right at the beginning. The story? Well, if you want to focus on the clash between the culture of a human being living in this new universe, that\'s not what Cheat Kusushi really does. As much as I don\'t want to give that example, it is necessary for comparison. Mushoku Tensei is one of the anime in which the focus of the isekai is not to feed into the idea that Rudy has trouble living in the fantasy that is the new world. Mushoku\'s purpose relies on what Rudy learns in the world. Reiji, in Cheat Kusushi, as much as he also does this, does not actually learn something new. His insertion into the anime is already cemented and the only times he\'s really had that reminder that he\'s in a different world are in the last two episodes, which really isn\'t a good way to do it.Things like what led to Reiji and Noera meeting and Mina being a ghost who only became better acquainted with Reiji after a while are not explored. They are overlooked and the anime didn\'t really care about that. It would be more appealing to experience a relationship that is developed over time, unlike the very mechanized episodes where even the order of the episodes doesn\'t really matter. Seriously, the only changes the show has made is to add about four characters, some problems between them, and more and more things that don\'t add to the show. It is a factor that varies from person to person. Some admire this unconventional pace, others just find it okay and acceptable, just like me. It\'s not bad, but it wasn\'t good.Finally, Cheat Kusushi was a quick show, but it drained my energy as it was tiring to watch. What is positively marked is the fact that it is a show that managed to adapt a story coming from the Gamma Plus Web Comic, even though the Light Novel is published on other sharing networks. All in all, it was only a symbolic experience. No big deal. There was nothing that made it a remarkable anime, but it didn\'t cause any compromising feelings either. Maybe I\'m asking too much of a show like this....

Seeing as most people here have never touched grass at any point in their lives, you may want to avoid this show if you dislike enjoying the simple things in life, like cute anime girls....This is one of my favorites of the season. This is one of my favorites of the season."", ""If you've come across this anime on your own, then I'm sure you know what you're getting yourself into. This anime is simply a cute, episodic, low-risk adventure of a random dude getting transported into a video game-like world in which he serves as a pharmacist, typical isekai stuff. The show really sets itself apart with two simple factors; characters and setting. We've all seen isekai, but the fact that a drug store is the main location really sets this one apart, and without the colourful cast of characters, this show wouldn't be half as entertaining.Story:As mentioned previously, the story is mostly episodic with certain...things that bleed into future episodes, like new characters, stuff like that. We follow Reiji Kirio, our typical isekai protagonist who can do practically no wrong. We never learn much of his past life, but the story wouldn't benefit much from an explanation, so it shouldn't be minded much. Most of the time, episodes will include a citizen of the town asking Reiji for help with something, usually pharmaceutical-related, but not all the time. On rare occasion, the plots can be more character driven, and those usually hit, as the characters that surround Reiji are the driving force that keeps this anime watchable. Most episodes contain multiple stories as the anime is a manga adaptation, and I feel that element also tends to keep things interesting.7/10Sound:Relatively run-of-the-mill. All voice actors and actresses deliver solid performances and general sound design is as expected. Not bad, but really nothing amazing.6/10Animation:For the most part, the animation is also pretty much as expected. Characters are expressive, colours are vibrant, generally just a fun atmosphere. I will note that this anime features a single animation for Reiji creating new medicine which is used in every single episode, usually more than once. One may find this lazy, but I personally find it extremely charming, almost like a magical girl transformation scene in an early 2000s anime. All things considered, the animation is pretty solid.7/10Characters:As I've said repeatedly, the characters in this show are a huge selling point, each more fun than the last. Reiji himself is boring, but his sidekick, (and basically his servant) Noela is cute and fun, Mina is a ghost that haunts the pharmacy and is by far the most complex of the bunch, which isn't to say she's a buzzkill, she's just the one with the most depth. She also has one of the funniest scenes in the show, where she drinks a potion that shows her deeper thoughts and her calm and sweet demeanor is completely contrasted by her inner thoughts being the complete opposite. The majority of the rest of the cast is used very well and has plenty of standout moments, my personal favourite being Vivi, who we meet closer to the end of the show, but almost every line of dialogue she’s given is gold. The other standout is Garou, the demon king. I don’t want to get into what makes him so hilarious to me, as his development is one of the few things that actually progresses as the show goes on, so I won’t spoil it. The one character that I really disliked was Paula, the blacksmith. She’s extremely arrogant and I roll my eyes every time she has one of her rude and unfunny one-liners. Overall though, the characters are very well done.8/10Overall:This show will never have you at the edge of your seat, it will never have you laughing endlessly, but what it offers is a fun, leisurely time in which you can relax and enjoy watching some creative characters in amusing and interesting situations.

If you’re looking for epic plot you won’t find it here, it’s called a slow life for a reason. There’s a good variety of people which he recruits as members for his shop. It’s sort of wack how he can make potions for every situation but anime is anime I guess. Protag is apparently an isekai dude, but there’s been no backstory on him so far and he”s just been chilling with his drugstore and helping people out.

I don\'t expect my scores to change, as this show feels pretty episodic/formulaic and rather predictable.The original work is a light novel (big surprise considering the long-ish official title). I like the cutesy world, as I\'m in a spot where I don\'t really want to watch psych thrillers or dark fantasy. I saw a promising clip on the CR channel on YT, so I started watching.The premise is Yet Another Isekai Show (TM). This time, the hero retains all his memories and skills from his past life in modern Japan, and he uses them to open up a potion...shop. Sound familiar? Yeah, they\'re mixing the ""item shop"" and ""isekai anime"", only the problem is we are dropped into the world in what\'s arguably at the middle of the story, our hero already met his 2 companions and is smack in the middle of his adventures in {unnamed fantasy world}. There\'s practically no backstory other than 15 seconds of narration, and it feels like a Kairosoft game was turned into an anime (without the retro graphics).The visuals... how do I put this. It looks low-budget while trying really hard not to look low-budget. I\'m not sure if it\'s the animation itself or the character designs, but for some reason it looks like an animation club at a college somewhere drew the frames in Paint.net. This and another isekai show recently featured on said YT channel had promising clips but rather low-quality visuals, so that was a bit of a bummer. It doesn\'t help that in every episode, there is a 40-second ""potion brewing"" montage set to music that always has the same 5 or 6 recycled shots and they send off every episode with the exact same scene, adding to the 1980s Saturday morning cartoon feel.If the hero\'s voice sounds familiar, it\'s because his VA, Jun Fukushima, also voices Kazuma in another isekai show, KonoSuba. He brings a fair bit of Kazuma\'s snark to Reiji, except instead of a sleazy NEET adventurer, Reiji is a former corporate wage slave turned alchemist. The cast is well-directed, and put on an entertaining drama.Going by the opening animation, it might seem like the show will become an isekai harem, but so far there\'s little sign of that dynamic forming. This should be a decent isekai comedy for those who want to veg out or have something in the background, but the visual quality could be better. shop. Sound familiar?

They MURDERED this story. They cut out soooo much and what they cut out was all important. The first like 5 or 6 chapters WHERE EVERYONE MEETS is just.... skipped, including the whole Mina is a house spirit bit which leaves her character flat and the viewer wondering why she's there. They dont even real focus on the MC's power which was the focus of the books, it was a potion of the week type story for most of it, and in the anime is an....... character interaction? of the week.... maybe, but they either flated all the interactions or didn't show them meeting so the viewer cares even less about the dynamic. After the intro to the red cat brigade (where they changed the design to look idiotic) I couldn't watch any longer. Again I love the manga and the light novel so much but who ever was in charge of the anime ruined this so badly to the point I hope it doesn't kill the novel or the manga as they are truly better in everyway. .... character interaction? of the week.... maybe, but they either flated all the interactions or didn't show them meeting so the viewer cares even less about the dynamic.

It has more of a feel of something like non non biyori (which you should watch if you haven't, it's probably the best healing anime you will every watch) which is just trying to give you laid back entertainment that you don't...have to get too invested into.

I you read the current synopsis and expected a real isekai, you may be disappointed. As of the time of writing, we have no details on how the MC died or was transported, the difficulties of going to a new world, or how they came to become a pharmacist in the other world. Furthermore, we never find out where he used to work,...(as a corporate drone), or how he came to learn to make medicine. To elaborate, we get a bit of backstory on how the characters met (and I really do mean a bit), but nothing on how this guy learned to make medicine in the first place, how he came to the other world, or if he had died in the other world or not. The plot would be effectively the same if they were just in that world and had never been transported from another (just a fantasy anime).On top of that, if you expect any kind of explanation on how medicines are made, this isn\'t the right place. Just about every time a new medicine is made, a clip plays that always seems to be the same. Yeah, I will admit, it is kind of cute, but it gets old very very fast. Essentially, the MC will say ""bring me [vague ingredient]"" then the clip plays and he is like ""its done!"", with no real explanation on it.The anime itself isn\'t inherently bad, but calling it a ""cheat isekai"" feels like false advertising. From the story, there doesn\'t seem to be any cheat involved, as he doesn\'t seem to use knowledge from his previous life at all. I feel like a lot of backstory probably got cut at some point, which leaves the plot unstable.edit 9/11:At least *some* reference to other worlds but not very many. Still not much happening though.

This is something that puts it with master of Ragnarok and is only acceptable if you plan on showing this shortly afterwards, like in Arifureta. Skipping this part removes all possible interest in the MC as we have no clue how they got there.How did he die? How did he meet the other characters? How did he discover his cheat abilities? This is stuff that makes an isekai interesting.MC feels somewhat bland although better than some other isekai MCs out...there.Anime tends to reuse the same animations for when he creates new potion, which to me feels lazy and sloppy.Overall, this series feels like it had a ton of potential but was wasted in about every way. I would only recommend you watch this series if you are just bored and want to shut off your brain for 20 minutes. Deserves the stereotypical title of ""trash isekai"" for sure. there.Anime tends to reuse the same animations for when he creates new potion, which to me feels lazy and sloppy.Overall, this series feels like it had a ton of potential but was wasted in about every way.

Its not serious or deep, and very fun option.Story : 8This anime is short, and dont intended to be long arc anime. Its simple story, not so deep, 1 episode have 2-3 short part with different problems. Some is connected with previous episodes, but it really doesnt matter if you skip or miss it. The only negative in here is not so clear the MC background. It explained short in one episode, but I dont think its good enough explanation. reading the manga or LN may works.Art : 7The art itself pretty simple, pros and...cons gonna show in here. Some maybe like it much, while some gonna laugh at it. Characters is draw so simple, although some character not good enough as the others. Same goes by backgrounds and location. While the indoor kinda simple and home-feeling, the outside somehow kinda shiny and too bright.Sound : 7Okay, honestly, this is kinda personal. if it wasnt because Noella ""ruu (woof)"" sound, I can give this lower. The OP is generic one, giving me vibe of ""Hurry Love"" by Azumi Waki. The EP by CV is pretty good, although Im not enjoy that so much. The BGM while medicine making is soothing for me, pretty classy jazz vibe, and thats the only strong point of this anime based on sound. VA choices kinda okay, despite is pretty ""Kazuma Kazuma"" style, but nothing defeat Noella\'s VA.Character : 7Its solid. Just like the story and art being together. Decent art, decent VA, decent character development. It just decent. Nothing pretty stand based on character, either art or story. Some maybe have interesting story even with short background, but I think its not good enough to get higher score. The one who stands, perhaps Noella who can perfectly become your werewolf loli waifu (lol)Enjoyment : 8Here\'s fact. Never underestimate short story anime. Kinmoza for example is just daily life of cute girls, and its pretty interesting and worthy to watch over again. And same fact apply in this anime. Its short, it doesnt have deep and long story, and really fun to watch over. But one weak point about short story anime also apply, its not suit for serious or marathon anime, and most of all time, you gonna watch random episode while eating or skip some works (lol), and not from beginning till the end.One strength point here is its very child friendly, so if you have kids or some cousin come to your house, never fear of showing this anime, since its for all agesOverall : 7Its decent, short enjoyment, and ""good snack or side dish"" kind of anime. Its very fit if whole family, perhaps your parents or kids hanging out on weekend and watch this anime together, and its fun. You can watch it over again, since no deep storyline, or perhaps you miss some cute scene you like. But still, its never intended to be main point and just for coffee break one. Overall, I like itNext season worth : PerhapsI dont think its worthy enough to get next season despite the story of MC or some character isnt clear enough. But still in manga or LN already have more story, so I think its also worthy to get new season. IMO there\'s 2 choices : either some OVA short episodes, maybe 3 or 5 minutes of story, or yes continue the story with new season and some new short problems just like before, but it wont change or clear the characters background nor improve the development. cons gonna show in here.

Practically zero backstory is given for how the MC got there or his life before, as well as zero information on how he can make so many potions and remedies. Not...even an off-handed remark giving an excuse or hint to how.The MC is surrounded by the general loli harem, even if it stays mostly wholesome in the interactions.

Yes.Is it deep? No.Does it have actual story? No.But it is relaxing.No spoilers, as there is no story.Don\'t expect anything serious to happen here, scraps of story given are just a pretext for characters to play with each other. If you like fluffy tails and overly sweet voices this is anime for you. If you look for actual story or character development, look elsewhere.This series has isekai in title, but apart from first 30s and a part of last episode there is nothing that would make it one. And it doesn\'t need or even try to be one. Story follows...protagonist who can make any potion/elixir/medicine he can think of and a bunch of characters that come to him with (often imaginary) problems. Typical episode consists of one or two potions making someone\'s life easier and then everyone has good time, everything topped with some typical gags and tail wagging. MC makes a lot of friends, collecting standard harem zoo: cute pet-girl, cute maid-girl, cute tsundere, cute loli. There\'s even discount Aqua hidden in the lake.Everything is overly sweet and cute, Reiji (played by Fukushima Jun, VA of Kazuma) must have made some insulin there to survive this, we have to endure all the Noela\'s noises and tail wags without his OP medicine.But under this cutesy artstyle hides the monster of lacking. Characters may look good and attractive, but their animation is a bit stiff, there are a lot of recycled scenes/backgrounds and ""story"" repetitiveness is not helping. Lack of any real character development and story means that cast is one-dimensional, most of clients/friends have just one trait that distinguishes them apart and drives their actions: demon king, that falls for Noela, does everything he can to make her like him, local mercenary leader tries to look strong and capable etc. Only drugstore residents are given any backgrounds, even if shallow.All this does not mean the series is not enjoyable, just don\'t expect any sophisticated plot and deep meaning. This series never aspired to be the best isekai, or even isekai to be honest. But even with low budget and inadequate story it manages to be nice, easy and relaxing experience, good for watching after work or during mealtime to calm yourself at the end of day. protagonist who can make any potion/elixir/medicine he can think of and a bunch of characters that come to him with (often imaginary) problems. Typical episode consists of one or two potions making someone\'s life easier and then everyone has good time, everything topped with some typical gags and tail wagging. MC makes a lot of friends, collecting standard harem zoo: cute pet-girl, cute maid-girl, cute tsundere, cute loli. There\'s even discount Aqua hidden in the lake.Everything is overly sweet and cute, Reiji (played by Fukushima Jun, VA of Kazuma) must have made some insulin there to survive this, we have to endure all the Noela\'s noises and tail wags without his OP medicine.But under this cutesy artstyle hides the monster of lacking. Characters may look good and attractive, but their animation is a bit stiff, there are a lot of recycled scenes/backgrounds and ""story"" repetitiveness is not helping. Lack of any real character development and story means that cast is one-dimensional, most of clients/friends have just one trait that distinguishes them apart and drives their actions: demon king, that falls for Noela, does everything he can to make her like him, local mercenary leader tries to look strong and capable etc. Only drugstore residents are given any backgrounds, even if shallow.All this does not mean the series is not enjoyable, just don\'t expect any sophisticated plot and deep meaning.

There\'s no last boss or any competition within the story its just the main character going thru different events per episode. personally at the beginning i thought it was going to be a bit ""bland"" but I continued because the characters, story and comedy kept getting better each episode. And im actually glad i continued, now this anime is more like a ""breaktime anime"" as i would call it. where the whole point of the anime is to sit back, relax, have a laugh and enjoy as new events...come up per episode. I guess the only thing i didnt like but is not a big deal, is that the backstory of each characters was i guess a bit disappointing but then again it doesn\'t really matter much.other than that, i loved each characters personality i think it fits very well and i would certainly rewatch it when i need my ""breaktime anime"". come up per episode.

It's a crude attempt at disguising an average fantasy under the isekai banner to garner the coalesced viewership.The fleeting references of MC's previous world and life are dreary and unexciting. The plot does not have anything unique to offer, anything to provide this title a base of it's own. The main and recurring character's have very little to no development throughout the series, while supporting characters are better in this regard. One theme running across the whole twelve episodes is the change...in mannerisms of various obnoxious characters thanks to the earthly wisdom of reincarnated MC, which feels overused after a couple of episodes. MC's interaction with an isekai world is also missing. Lot of unexplained material in the plot, which may leave the viewer hanging.Animation style is not praise-worthy either. Each frame seems bland, lacks depth, and the colours don't contribute to bringing the scene and characters to life and light. The characters animations lack variability of expression, which further moves interest from the happenings of the plot.Constraint for this does not seem to have been a budget issue, but more of a lack of interest of the creators.Overall, it seems as though it's a filler title, or something targeted at the youngest of the shounen demographics. As, that alone can be the reason to compromise on every element which contributes and constitutes to an anime.Does this anime deserve a try? Sure, if you are ~09~13 years of age, or if you are older but can watch with the perspective of your youngest self. The only other time I would recommend this anime to be given a chance is if you have nothing else to watch and won't mind a bleak fantasy to keep the much needed anime drug to live on. Not un-watchable, but last on rear end of the priority list. in mannerisms of various obnoxious characters thanks to the earthly wisdom of reincarnated MC, which feels overused after a couple of episodes.

I’m not sure if I like or dislike the simplicity…Actually, I’m not a fan. The plain introduction and the flat coloring for the characters make the anime a hard sell. The first episode also starts off with the characters already aquatinted with each other with minor flashbacks throughout the episode. Wouldn’t be surprised if episode 2 was just the origin story for the group. Now we’re getting somewhere!...I was hoping most of the characters would be over the top like the eccentric Feris here but unfortunately, the rest of them are pretty normal. Though that being said, Feris doesn’t seem like a recurring character in the show, which is a bummer.The scenarios throughout the first up to the current 10 as of this writing episodes are, for the lack of a better term, boring. It’s so plain and straightforward that there’s little excitement to offer, even with the problems and situations that Reiji runs into. I do like the character designs of the show and many of the facial expressions! But the overall art and animation leave a lot to be desired.I will now drop this show at Episode 10 since I highly doubt it will develop into something more episodes 1-10 already made it clear, it’s a bit plain for me. If you’re looking for an easy-going anime with a pretty simple storyline then this one might be for you. While I love those types of shows, Cheat Kukushi no Slow Life just doesn’t quite hit the spot with its boring scenarios and, quite frankly, stale animation. I just stayed watching for the character designs and the hope that it’ll get better down the road, but sadly it did not turn out well.

One dimensional characters, simple themes and morals, bright setting, upbeat cast... there's nothing super special about it, but nothing terrible either. If it were a little more child friendly, I'd show it to my kids.Story: 6/10Very simple setting, which is great - but nothing is really done with it. It gives context to the protagonist's drugstore and their adventures, but it doesn't go any deeper than that. What makes it better than other high fantasy isekai/adventure series is that there's no huge, boring exposition dump at the beginning. It's...an open ended setting that allows for things to be done, and focuses on the drugstore's episodic adventures and requests.Art: 7//10Cute pastel colours, characters look nice but are nothing special. Minimal lighting and shading, which works in this case, because the vibe of the show is light hearted. Animations are occasionally awkward, but it's not like much is happening anyways.Sound: 6/10The medicine-making song is catchy, but the rest of the music isn't too memorable. OP and EDs are okay, sometimes I don't skip the ED.Enjoyment: 4/10I feel like I was watching this every week, just for the sake of watching it. Now that I've finished, I honestly wonder: was it worth the time? I dunno. I played every episode on 2x speed, got through the story, and don't feel like I got much from it - but I can definitely see why some people might enjoy this anime. It's slow, cute, and peaceful - a great escape from a hectic daily life.Overall: 6/10Its current MAL score of 6.5 is rather low, actually. I think the anime does what the story's intended to do perfectly: which is to depict a meaningless SoL where you can turn your brain off and enjoy in peace. I am generally biased against moe blob shows and just need something to waste my time on this season, hence my 6/10 - but most people who start this series should know what to expect from a SoL comedy isekai harem, and this show should, for the most part, fulfill those expectations. an open ended setting that allows for things to be done, and focuses on the drugstore's episodic adventures and requests.Art: 7//10Cute pastel colours, characters look nice but are nothing special.

It’s a bit rarer for such anime to be laidback with the protagonist living the slow life, though that’s still not enough to make it particularly novel. The English title uses the word pharmacist so I expected something like the protagonist being a pharmacist in our world and then using that knowledge in another world, in the process also teaching the viewer some real pharmaceutical knowledge. This anime is nothing like that, though apparently such...an anime does seem to exist (Isekai Yakkyoku).Based on some quick research, the English translation of Kusushi (薬師) to Pharmacist in the title doesn’t quite capture the nuance of the term exactly. It certainly isn’t incorrect, especially in light of how the “Drug Store” is also in the title, but it also doesn’t seem to capture the nuance of the term exactly. Kusushi doesn’t really seem to be a term that’s used for modern pharmacists. It was used historically for people that were akin to pharmacists, though I think apothecary might be a better term. However, I think the usage in the title of this anime is more referring back to how Kusushi is sometimes used as a class in RPGs, originating in Final Fantasy V as far as I can tell. The English translation of the class in Final Fantasy was Chemist, which I think may have been a better title, though using it also has it’s own nuance issues.But I digress. The larger point I was making is that this anime has absolutely nothing to do with pharmacology. The protagonist, Reiji, makes all sorts of stuff and not just medicine. And he does so seemingly through magic. He still has to collect ingredients, but he magically knows what ingredients he’ll need. And he still has to combine them, but the actual process of doing so feels more like a ritual than a science because he does pretty much the exacts same thing regardless of what he’s making and the ingredients just seem to magically turn into what he wants. Throughout the anime he gets called an alchemist to which he objects, but honestly I feel like that’s the best term to describe him. His abilities don’t really have any depth as magical abilities either. They just work and that’s it.The anime also surprisingly just starts right in the middle of things, which is really strange for an isekai as the whole point of using the isekai mechanic is that it’s easier to introduce things to the viewer. Reiji starts off owning a drug store, has a werewolf girl named Noela and a ghost girl named Mina as assistants, and just starts making things such as potions to deal with people’s problems. Initially there is zero explanation on how he got there. The only reason you even know it’s an isekai is that isekai is in the title. Over the course of the anime it throws around tidbits that explain things somewhat, but even then not completely. And the explanations aren’t really all that great either. Thus, the isekai element doesn’t matter either.So what then is the highlight of this anime? I would say that it’s how utterly simple characters seem to be. I suppose that this could be seen as them being one dimensional, but in the context of this anime and how it uses it’s cast, them being so earnestly one dimensional is quite charming. Reiji is an incredibly normal guy with nothing at all particularly special about him personality wise, but the circumstances surrounding him result in him being a pretty good person which is pretty comforting to watch. Noela is very naïve and innocent but super energetic and cheerful. Mina’s really nice but has an overactive imagination that goes off in weird directions sometimes, which results in her having an amusing dynamic with Noela at times. The rest of the cast is similarly simple, but in a similarly charming way.The comedy is also pretty great. Each episode is composed of multiple mini-episodes so it moves pretty fast. It also has a lot of characters and Reiji creates a lot of stuff, so in combination there’s a good amount of variety to it too. There always being something new happening, even if it’s incredibly inconsequential, keeps things interesting. And combined with the cast being so cheerfully likable and world in general so happy, it can be a lot of fun just watching how things play out even without any sort of progression whatsoever. It’s overall a really comfy anime from beginning to end.There are some attempts at having more substance and taking things more seriously. There are a lot of serious issues that are easily solved by Reiji just making something, but that’s not what I’m talking about. I mean more like the attempts at trying to have depth with things that seemed like social commentary on our world or topics, such as the guilt someone feels at always having to be taken care of due to sickness. These are handled nowhere near as well as they need to be to be effective and thus fall flat completely. These aren’t that common however so they aren’t that much of an issue.The art and animation are a bit weak bust mostly fine. I liked the character designs and I think the animation did a good job of using the cast effectively from a visual sense. There were some glaring errors at times though, such as a characters clothes changing instantly in between shots of the same scene. There’s a montage that repeats every time Reiji makes anything. It changes a bit sometimes to match the specific situation, but most of the time it just repeats the same things. If it always changed things up a bit I would be fond of it as it has pretty catchy music and overall fits pretty well atmospherically, but as usually just repeated footage it felt kind of cheap. The OP and ED are pretty solid in terms of songs and visuals.

That’s it. That’s the plot. Not one of them has any real sense of tension or drama. They are all structured the same and even rely heavily on the same type of humour:...loud, obnoxious slapstick.Normally I would go over the main cast but… I can’t here.

And when that happens it just tell us that he appeared in the new world and that\'s it, no further context is added on to what lead him to appear on that new world. As the title of the anime suggests, it just a guy living a slow life managing a...drugstore, making potions and such, there is nothing that leads to a significant story, he just creates potions. Also, there is no romance but some of the characters show feelings for Reiji and that\'s all, do not expect much more. (5/10)Art: Art is pretty not gonna lie, the scenarios are beautiful and do not feel empty at all. The colors are vibrant and make everything feel and looks happy. The character design is good and they are well drawn. This part is the highest scoring part on the anime. (8/10)Sound: The OST is nice, both the intro and outro are beautiful, it uses music when it is necessary and it do not feel weird. Ambient sound is meh but hey, I have seen worst animes with worse ambient sounds and music. (7/10)Characters: There is good and there is bad. However, Noera is the character that carries the show by being too cute to exists. It feels like they put much more effort into Noera that the other characters of the show.

If you are easily bored by ""slow life"" anime, this one will be no different.Story: None to speak of.  It is an isekai on paper only, the fact that the main character, Reiji, came from another world is barely even referenced until the last episode of the series, and there\'s almost nothing even worth saying about it.  Reiji hated his job and boom, he\'s suddenly in another world.  That\'s all there is to it.  The actual episodes...are formulaic, with a character coming into Reiji\'s pharmacy with a problem and Reiji inventing a medicine to solve whatever the issue is.  How well each of these segments works usually depends on the characters involved.Audio/Visual: The voice acting is pretty hit or miss.  Too many characters have high pitched cutesy voices, but Reiji\'s VA (Fukushima Jun, best known as Kazuma of Konosuba) does solid work.  Visually, it\'s a struggle.  It\'s clear that this show had almost no budget.  Animation is poor, there are a number of cut corners, and embarrassing errors like frames where Noela is just a head and arms with no body.  The saving grace here is that they manage to turn this into a joke at times, notably Reiji\'s medicine making dance where they use the same clips of him shaking test tubes or chopping lettuce over and over to the point of absurdity and it starts becoming funnier every time they do it once the series hits its stride.Characters: Mostly good and funny characters.  Reiji is your typical isekai MC, his reactions are funny but he doesn\'t have much going on other than being a nice dude that helps people with their problems.  The other main characters are Noela, the childlike wolf girl, and Mina, the ghost in the house that Reiji runs his pharmacy out of.  Both are cute in their own ways, but overly saccharine, all things considered.  The side characters are mostly good, other than insane, jealous woman from the first episode.  Paula, the foul mouthed blacksmith in a frilly pink dress, and Vivi, the powerless lake spirit, were my personal favorites, but there are plenty of fun characters here.  There\'s typically a rotating cast of part timers at the pharmacy, so they change up the combinations of characters in each part of the story, though Reiji and Noela are always involved.  They generally keep the show from getting boring and are the main reason to watch, though there are some misfire segments here and there. are formulaic, with a character coming into Reiji\'s pharmacy with a problem and Reiji inventing a medicine to solve whatever the issue is.

Somewhere along the line, an eponymous “they” decided that such an approach to the genre was simply not going to work anymore. It seemed logical that after spending so much time in the fantastical, a new approach would involve settling down with the mundane, where scenarios were more focused on being able to do something simplistic, or solving a mini-crisis rather than one that would shake the foundation of reality with the cool swords and the cool booms.""Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life: Making a Drugstore in Another World"" is...an anime I went into with a lot of apprehensions. If you were to ask me why I had even sat down to watch this anime in the first place, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I had doubts about whether the very premise would be decent enough to fill out a 12-episode season, but I suppose that one of the fun things about watching anime is that you sometimes just decide to take a chance on something for the hope of being pleasantly surprised. I could only hope that it wouldn’t end with me staring into the mirror and asking what I’m doing with my life.Kirio Reiji, a former corporation worker from his world, finds himself making a living as a potion maker and pharmacist in another world. With the ability to brew various potions, cures, and other aids for ailments, he lives and works with Noella, a wolf girl he once rescued, and Mina, a ghost who lives in the house that the pharmacy now occupies. As days go by, people from the nearby town come into the pharmacy seeking Reiji’s help in fixing whatever it is that’s troubling them. Sometimes, it requires a potion’s touch, and other times, it doesn’t.Because the show’s premise is so paper-thin, the series wisely avoids having a longer, overarching narrative from episode to episode. Instead, each outing focuses on tinier little stories that are connected rather loosely, or have small threads of continuity that carry over to other episodes. This allows the show to re-use some of the characters seen early on throughout the rest of the show, and even though the characters themselves are not terribly interesting, they afford at least enough material to last about eleven minutes at a time. Whether it be stories solely focusing on the main trio or introducing a new character altogether, each episode doesn’t feel oversaturated or bloated with content, making ""Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life"" incredibly easy to digest.Where the characters falter in regard to depth or interest, the comedy does partially make up for this. Because most of the scenarios that bring customers to the pharmacy are so silly, the show can play up the absurdity of the situation to decent effect. Especially since Reiji is the fish out of water in this new world, his reactions to things unfolding the way they do make him serve as an audience avatar, albeit not the most effective one. His reactions are at least somewhat believable, especially as he finds himself getting roped into the various situations that require his assistance. Most of the other characters have one or two aspects to their personality that can be used as comedic fuel.Though most are either a little amusing or at least acceptable if not overtly funny, there are some running gags or gimmicks that suffer from overuse, with Noella constantly doing her cute “woof” as the biggest offender. I could only hear it so many times before I got sick of it.As can be expected of someone having a maximized power in an isekai story, Reiji’s potion-making is considered legendary among the townsfolk. Part of the comedic value therein comes from the people desperately wanting potions for things that real-world medicine would never have any cure for, such as healing familial problems or making it so that people don’t need to exercise to build muscle in a healthy manner. In cases like these, Reiji’s potions serve more as a kind of workaround for the problem rather than being a cure. This usually leads to two different kinds of payoffs, with the comedic ones landing with more grace than the sentimental ones. ""Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life"" works best when it stays in its silly lane, not trying to bite off more than its premise can accommodate.Despite the skill that Reiji supposedly has for potion-making, we don’t see him ponder over potential ingredients or the actual potion-making itself for any significant time. In that sense, the show misses a few opportunities for further comedic value – potions exploding because the mixture was wrong, the potion accidentally doing the polar opposite of what it was supposed to do, and so forth. This is, in part, due to the show’s first episode already having Reiji established as an accomplished apothecary, so a lot of trial and error is not considered. The potion-making sequences themselves consist mostly of recycled animation of Reiji doing mixing and foot-tapping at his workstation. While basic and repetitive, it doesn’t get old thanks to the happy little music that accompanies the moment. It’s cheesy, yes, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t amused by its appearances.And “cheesy” pretty much sums up the entire series. In many ways, ""Cheat Pharmacist’s Slow Life"" is not aspiring to any sort of heights, opting instead for simplistic entertainment and perhaps the bare-minimum of what a story requires in regards to most things. It’s so bright and happy with its visual aesthetic, character designs, soundtrack, and overall affect that it is not trying to hide anything underneath the surface. What you see is what you get. Does that mean that the show is bad because it is so shallow? I suppose…?, but you know, sometimes I want something shallow.

The series being an anthology of short, loosely-connected stories may not mean much in the way of character development, it may not look or sound the best, and it may not be memorable, but it still offered some smiles to elevate it ever so slightly. It will never enter the pantheon of great isekai, and probably not even good isekai, but given what it is, it could have been significantly worse. I enjoyed it more than I expected I would.

Digimon Adventure:,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41074/Digimon_Adventure_,"[""“This is Taichi and Agumon’s last adventure” – Toei Animation, 2019.With that categorical catchphrase, Toei Animation lied to all of us Digimon Adventure fans two years ago. As a way to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series that kicked off the franchise, it announced with great fanfare that it would be making one last movie -eventually called “Last Evolution Kizuna”- and that it would truly be the last adventure. The last one. This was it. No more. To say goodbye to the series and characters we’ve loved for more than two decades now. Despite the bitter taste in our mouths with the disappointing result...of Tri, we were looking forward to it anyway. I, the same as many others, had a feeling that in this occasion Toei finally would get it right with an Adventure project ever since “Our War Game”. And so it was. It was a great farewell, wasn’t it? Except that, well…it never really was. In February 2020, the same month of Kizuna’s premiere, Toei announced that it would be soon releasing “Digimon Adventure:” (yes, being the “:” the only title-difference) a reboot of the initial series of the franchise that settled down to be the most iconic, financially successful and remembered of all. A new beginning, from scratch, that would this time take into account the technological and social changes (which include of course, the fact that unlike the 90s, when the idea didn’t even cross the minds of anyone, now kids own cellphones and that’s totally fine) of the last 20 years. Taichi and Agumon’s adventures were far from saying goodbye.Naturally, many of us were surprised and some felt betrayed: Kizuna wasn’t ever going to be really the last adventure. Or technically… it was… but in a deceptive way; it was going to be the last but only the last of the first run, so that this new one “didn't count”. But to us, lifelong fans, it very well did count. These are our characters and our creatures we’ve always loved. It wasn’t going to leave us indifferent. And as such, no matter what, we were going to be part of it anyway. Personally, being the original one of my all-time favorite anime series, just moving on and ignoring it was simply not an option. We were going to watch it anyway. Which leads us to the question: but can it be said that this was for us? To “milk on nostalgia” like many suggest? What exactly was Toei trying to do here, to achieve here? What was the intention? Who was it trying to appeal to? The historical fanbase, the current children generation to introduce the series to them in hopes of building up a new fanbase, or both?Well, after finishing the series now 1.5 years later, I can say with high degree of confidence that to us, the old fans, it definitely wasn’t.Or to be more precise…it couldn’t be. Because it’s impossible to believe something like that. Digimon Adventure (2020) (from now on: 2020), is so deeply inferior to its 1999 counterpart both in quality and emotional resonance that there is just no way. Despite the presence of numerous narrative similarities, references and tributes it pays to its inspiring series (even some shots were pretty much identical to the ones seen in the original and some similar events took place in exactly the same episode number) that any Adventure fan would identify immediately, it’s quite hard to think that they did this with us in mind with the intention to easily cash-in nostalgia-based bucks (I find it funny to still see people around believing this). Because no way, this reboot -that dares to bear the same name of the series we love-, wasn’t the Digimon Adventure we always knew and wasn’t ever even close to it. Basically, it has or shows little to nothing of the strengths that made the original great and catapulted it to be regarded as one of the best anime series for kids that could furthermore be also enjoyed by the more grown-ups (in fact, it’s among the few anime series I can think of that can be enjoyed by pretty much all ages: from a 5-year-old toddler to a 95-year-old elder), if not the best. With the exception of animation quality and action sequences (because credit due where credit is due: this time the budget was much higher and you could notice it, with consistent great visual quality and with the digimon battles being far more dynamic, kinetic and exciting than those of 1999, consisting in much more than just one-hit and that’s all, and I’d even dare to say it’s the best looking Toei Animation modern work, so nothing to complain about here), absolutely everything else was shockingly worse, for a lack of a better expression. But how worse exactly? What exactly happened here?To sum it up, the entire heart and soul of the original series are just gone now, leaving us only with an empty, lifeless body. While on surface it was about a group of kids and their creatures defeating evil guys with standard world-domination goals (for the most part though), at its core in reality was a story about them growing up, learning and becoming better people in the way in order to succeed with the task entrusted to them. It emphasized in relationships, bonding, life lessons, and the idea of overcoming impossible odds thanks to values and personal growth. It gave us and made us want to follow in their journey a large set of eight highly charismatic, immature kids as main characters (16 (!) if counting their pet-partners) all with distinctive personalities, backstories and interesting struggles and/or weaknesses they had to overcome, interacting with each other and receiving each a fair share of attention at some point, and all this channeled through a generally well-thought, ever-engaging narrative that knew how to build lots of well-earned powerful, unforgettable moments and was shrouded in a particular charm thanks to a careful artistic and musical direction, which in the end provided a very rewarding experience and turned it into a solid kids’ series that could also be enjoyed by adults and be appreciated forever.2020, has nothing of that. Our beloved characters went from these flawed kids that felt real and relatable with whom we could become fond of and be interested in their journey, to these lifeless, robotic superheroes who for worse saw themselves as the superheroes of the show with the duty to save the world always making sure to show their badassery fearlessly riding on top of their creatures while they were in fighting-mode and performed risky attacks even if that implied exposing themselves to unnecessary physical danger, and in the worst way possible. On this occasion, they don’t have flaws, they are perfect, very cool, they don’t suffer, they don’t have motivations, insecurities or anxieties and you can barely feel a soul inside them. They don’t live through a maturing or learning process where they have to learn how to get along and strengthen bonds. They don’t even at least feel surprised or confused to know about the existence of another world. This time they don’t miss home, don’t feel fear, they never argue, they don’t have internal conflicts to solve and they almost never commit mistakes to take lessons from. There’s barely anything of real interest humanly speaking going on for them. 1999 had normal, ordinary kids made of flesh and bones who behaved and spoke according to their age. 2020 has soulless, indestructible superheroes apparently made of iron, because now they can even be thrown to the ground at full speed from the skies, be crashed against giant logs at high speed, be engulfed in flames, even receive impacts of hyperbeams or other extreme situations, and survive like nothing. They just didn’t feel like real kids, and as a result it was impossible for us to connect with them and be interested in them, make us feel part of the group and making us care for anything they did or had to do or happened to them and feel empathy towards them at all. Thanks to this the series suffers from a chronic emotional weight deficiency which is shocking to notice for anyone who has seen the original and that wonderful ability it had of enabling us to project our inner kid souls into them, making us feel like kids again (one of the main adult appeals of the original) is gone now. Whatever great moments it tried to pull off were ineffective. And while this may not be a problem for a current kid, this evidently makes it significantly less valuable from the perspective of the now historical adult fan. So no, it couldn’t be for us. Because the cast we love wasn’t here, only their soulless bodies and in different clothes.While all main characters are an inferior version of their 1999 counterparts, in relation to character-wise mistakes, there are two of them that deserve a special mention for being the definite worst particular offenders. The first one is the absolutely obscene share of attention the main of the eight kids received from the writers. One thing we all loved from the original was how, despite acknowledging that the natural-born leader and the natural-born rival would need a bit more screentime due to their more relevant positions in the group and narrative, it still always made sure to give the rest a fair share of spotlight, participation and credit. They also mattered. This helped providing a sense of variety. On multiple occasions it even let another kid different than the main one finish an important enemy. But 2020 also forgot that. The attention gap is disproportionate. Here Taichi does everything important. Here he gets all the final glory. He gets a second mega before any of the rest even gets his first, in an episode where it looked like another character would get it. He gets to do the final hit even when it looked like the story was pushing for another powerful digimon of another kid to get the honor. He is the star of the opening and he’s always the eyecatch. And they didn’t even bother to hide it, through shamelessly contrived events to separate him from the rest and make sure they won’t interfere in his demonstration of badassery with his partner digimon. Even though I like the character, this just was excessive and unfair. The situation became increasingly worse to even reaching the point in the last part where he literally teleported through the Digitalworld to guarantee his presence in every single episode; even in those where he didn’t have absolutely anything to do there, he always managed to magically pop up. “Oh, I was just passing by and thought it was a good idea to be here right where you got to be too, what a coincidence!”. Yeah right. It essentially became trolling. There was even an episode with hundreds of Taichi’s clones!The second one was the Koushirou/Izzy case, turned this time into the god of information. Look, it’s one thing to be the smart, genius kid of the group, but another completely different one to be an almost omniscient god. He always knew and discovered everything immediately and effortlessly, had access to classified information a kid his age should never have, hacked international systems and organizations, controlled ships from his laptop, came up with solutions adults with way more experience than him for some reason couldn’t come up with before, and nothing was ever an obstacle to him. Even Yamato once asked “how he knew all that?” with Taichi literally answering “because he’s so cool and knows everything”. Yes, in the original he was also the boy genius, he also had his laptop and he also eventually knew what was going on, however there it was more grounded, not only because he was an actual character that felt real, but also because you could see he obtained information through actual time and effort, with more naturalism. Here instead, he was more like a robotic know-it-all problem-solver with this constant “oh yeah since I’m the smartest one here I’ll give you all the info you need immediately because I’m here to do that” attitude. Heck, even that solve-everything robot from the movie Interstellar had more soul than him. It was sad to see how the writers overexploited his skills and made him go from a character to a hyper-convenient tool.The digimon partners didn’t save themselves from the character-reduction either. They went from creatures who had a voice to creatures who are just there to battle whenever they were required at zero cost. They always evolve whenever they want or need or have to, never get tired and never go back to their in-training forms. This time they barely had any role or significance for the children’s growth and barely had anything of interest regarding relation-development, natural bonding or conflicts with their kid partners as it happened in 1999. You could almost listen to them internally screaming: “please, don’t treat us just like weapons!”, since they at least retained their personalities for the most part. In relation to them, the nice key concept of evolving-thanks-to-evolving (tying the creature’s power to growth as individuals of the kids) is also gone now. The digimon achieves the next stage quite cheaply, not triggered by an important event or spiritual evolution of the kid or a highly special occurrence, but instead out of random uninteresting, irrelevant circumstances which were not even framed within the true plot or character-story or just because they eventually had to appear with little to no proper buildup, so the heart and main idea of the series are lost. This was especially disappointing to see in the mega digievolutions since for them, being the final evolutionary stage, it should have been better; it’s supposed to be due to something more compelling and special, lacking the desired emotional impact and ending up being just dull show-ups. It should be noted that there are moments when it tries or remembers having to do that, but it arrives late (not even the crests were introduced when they should and didn’t play major roles here) and they don’t work because they feel highly forced and can’t feel earned or inspiring enough if the kid himself doesn’t feel relatable to begin with.Moving to speak about narrative elements, it doesn’t do any better. The original may have had some issues you could criticize it for, but in general it had a well-thought or structured storyline, with every episode being relevant and contributing for plot progression, with moments correctly timed, without ever losing focus (and I need to be emphatic on this) and virtually zero uninteresting, skippable-like moments in a 54 episodes run, never letting you go. Little of this can be said about 2020. Badly structured with wrongly, awkwardly timed events, with parts that should have come beforehand coming afterward and vice-versa, episodes that would have worked better as introductory coming during the end, others that would have worked better in the end coming in the beginning or in the middle (like Millenniummon: which should have been the last enemy given the size and scale of the conflict, with even god-digimons appearing to participate in a Magnus, heavenly-like fight, something more appropriate and effective for endings), with endgame stages even in the first episodes (it was nice if they wanted to pay homage to Our War Game, but that was not the moment). Many light, silly episodes in both the second and third arcs when they can only work and should only be placed at the beginning to establish characters, provide background and so on. There is a noticeable lack of true tension for several episodes even when there’s a risky threat just around the corner. In the second, instead of being worried by the imminent resurrection of a legendary monster, they have time for irrelevant, random trivialities like rescuing enslaved digimon in a theme park, episodes about digimons angry because couldn’t eat french fries, water disputes among digimon we can’t care less for and even time to relax playing soccer like nothing, and for about 10 episodes in a row it forgets to actually move the plot wasting time with useless content that altogether never amounted to anything of true value for the viewer. In the third, they say they are going on a mission to investigate the mystery of the crests, yet barely end up doing things that have to do with that or that could give them clues. Instead, we have random adventuring episodes where Joe helps digimons recovering their onsen, Hikari protecting digieggs, Mimi training in a digimon school or Yamato helping random digimon villagers with a ghost samurai, and all this in the final stretch when the great calamity great, even worse than Millenniummon, would be soon happening and shit was supposed to be real. No tension, no thrill, no drama, no fun. Most of these types of episodes were entirely worthless with our kids dealing with disconnected situations that contributed nothing of real value in terms of plot progression, character growth or bringing in a new digievolution, serving little to no purpose and leaving no impact on future events.Must be said that yes, the original did have light moments and our kids did occasionally deviate from the mission and took some time to rest (like when they went to eat burgers after coming back to the real world), however, this was minimal, always right-timed and never came at the expense of plot-progression, because these moments where framed within it and always brought in something of value, so they worked and provided tonal variety. Must be also mentioned that eventually (but lamely) it does attempt to develop a character (somehow), however, it didn’t matter much because similarly, that development wasn’t framed within a plot, limiting its potential. The original, to the contrary, cleverly made sure that the development always came hand-in-hand with progression, tying character with plot almost perfectly. Here, however, it’s like an attempt of one or the other. It comes as separated (if any development happens first of course). The idea is to bring it naturally while the story is also moving, however here it came during episodes with situations that had no relation to the stake of the arc. Another type of narrative sin was this absurd series of cyber world threats we could never care for because everything felt like a total joke with all of them coming right after the previous one, with no real sense of weight and which also felt like only secondary job assigned to Koushiro while Taichi and Yamato dealt with all the important stuff, in an attempt to create drama and tension which completely failed. That the missiles, the ships, the satellites, the NASA, whatever. Finally, the execution wasn’t as engaging; you won’t see this time the sense of mystery and feeling lost in another strange world of the Devimon arc, the sense of thrill of the Myotismon arc or the sense of drama and darkness of the Dark Masters arc of the original series, which largely helped to explain its entertainment value.So, as it should be clear by now, all this leads us to the inevitable conclusion that this reboot was definitely not intended for us (because it’s impossible to believe they could have wanted to give us such an inferior show), but in reality for a younger new audience; the current generation of new children, in hopes to capture their fresh interest and devotion, which makes things tricky when it comes to the general judgment of this series since, despite being a shameful near-worthless work for the historical fan, this automatically means in reality it should be judged according to how well it could have satisfied these desired new ones. And while -evidently- I don’t have kid-eyes anymore to know this exactly, reasonably my own experience as a kid watching the original series would serve as a fair approximation. Given that, I would say the series, even with all its notorious issues already explained, could admittedly have passed as fine entertainment for kids who mainly just wanted to see the cool creatures in action and know what their following new cool evolutions, designs and special attacks were going to be (who do we want to fool here), if not because i) the narrative is a mess and ii) the show also fails to properly build hype for said new evolutions.The first point was already described before. While kids may not pay much attention or care too much about the characters and their struggles, they can still notice or perceive some questionable plot developments or structures coming off as odd or get the feeling some things are not right. As for the second point, what I mean is that it fails to give value to evolutions, in terms of buildup and payoff; to make them memorable, you must first create the expectation and then after enough time has passed, deliver them in the right time. The original made sure to follow this by creating the expectations for them and once they arrived, use them for the right amount of time before the following did. However, in 2020 the ultimates just arrive too early in the story to be able to even create the hype (in the 10s, as opposed to the 20s-30s of original), one right after the other, under-using the adult forms, rendering them as only means or obstacles that the story should have to get rid of quickly and leaving little room for ultimate form-expectation. This also makes their appearances not living up to the potential emotional impact they could have enjoyed thanks to having made us wait for them for a significant amount of time. And while they did wait enough before introducing the mega forms (at least, for everyone who wasn’t Agumon), unfortunately, the way they did it wasn’t great or special anymore. They were just given too easily. They didn’t come due to situations of high emotional catharsis, high expectation or that were even at least framed into the plot, or thanks to special/unique occurrences (to not say “miracle”) that give more meaning and weight, but instead due to completely random, trivial circumstances we could never really care for, sadly devaluing their “final, special and rare stage” status. I appreciate they have decided this time to include the mega forms for everyone (though I argue the original still worked well without doing this), since that feels fairer to the rest of the cast, but now that you do, at least do it well, which unfortunately wasn’t the case. It almost felt like they brought them up just because “we have to” not caring too much (if any) about the “why”, the “when” and the “how” of their introductions. Given this, I have to even doubt it could have been an actually satisfying and effective experience to the real intended new audience. I doubt I could have been as intrigued with all these cool creatures and their hype-digievolutions watching this reboot as a kid as much as I did back then in 2000 when I was watching the original series.All in all, I think at this point it’s needless to say that, being the original series one of my all-time favorites, I’m more than just disappointed with the sole existence of this modern reboot. I won’t lie by claiming I wasn’t initially interested and enthusiastic about it, because as a fan of the original that couldn’t be the case, however, with a final outcome as poor as this one, in the end you cannot help but end up questioning what was even the point. The Toei team clearly wanted to reach the current kids' generation and introduce them to the Adventure universe, but what comes as incomprehensible is how could it be possible that they had come up with something so noticeably inferior when they already counted with a great original work serving as a basis or benchmark. Given its reboot nature, the bare minimum here was taking the original series and crafting a new work on par or at least close to its quality, and even taking advantage of the opportunity to improve on past flaws (because as much as we love the original series, it’s not like it was exactly free of them and for everything there is always room for improvement), but what happened here was the complete opposite; instead of improving or at least keeping the same quality levels, they only worsened them. Did they even notice what they were doing? Were they even truly caring? In the end, if they were going to deliver something this inferior, it would have been better doing so with other characters and another universe, so that the Adventure name and brand didn’t bear the reputational costs. The truth is, personally I don’t really care much about 2020 since the vastly superior original 1999 series will always be there, but what does bother me is that it’s a shame to realize how your beloved title, characters and creatures were used and humiliated in something so lame with none of the charm and strengths that characterized the original series and allowed it to earn its position as one of the best kids’ TV anime ever.And no, as a reboot, nobody expected an exact 1:1 copy of the first series, but what 2020 did was just unacceptable. Like everything else in life, doing things for the second time and doing them so significantly worse even when in the first time you already succeeded and you had all the tools in your hands (and even more than the first time) to succeed again, should never be accepted, because that can only happen when you deliberately reduce the efforts. 2020 is quite possibly the worst Digimon entry of the franchise and, as it isn’t already long enough, is yet another addition to the list of Toei Animation’s classics revival failures of the past decade. It only served to deteriorate the value of the Adventure name and didn’t work for any type of audience; for the old, historical fans that could have felt an interest in checking out a new version of the show, it pretty much felt like a bad joke, especially right after having experimented an already great conclusion to it with “Last Evolution Kizuna”, and for the new generations of kids this series was intended for, I can’t help but feel sorry for them for having been born in times where current Digimon producers thought they didn’t deserve better and had to grow up watching both uninspired and messy kids-oriented productions like this one. Even with all their huge flaws, at least the previous Adventure installments like 02 and Tri had a soul. 2020, didn’t even have one. 02 and Tri may have failed, but at least they tried. 2020 not only failed, it didn’t even try! And even though I’ve always insisted that you cannot treat and judge a kids-oriented series in the exact same way and with the exact same bars you would do it with a more teen and/or adult-oriented/designed one, and that it pains me having to give a low score to a class of series which on essence just want to bring entertainment (and hopefully, values) to the youngest of all audiences (since it is pretty much the equivalent of grabbing an innocent child who misbehaved and slamming him against the wall), the heart and care put into this series were so unbelievably low that this time I cannot give much of that benefit. Digimon Adventure (2020) is such a terrible involution (no pun intended) of the classic series whose name, success and legacy it miserably tried to capitalize on, that unfortunately, it leaves me with no other option. 3/10. of Tri, we were looking forward to it anyway. I, the same as many others, had a feeling that in this occasion Toei finally would get it right with an Adventure project ever since “Our War Game”. And so it was. It was a great farewell, wasn’t it? Except that, well…it never really was.

A new beginning, from scratch, that would this time take into account the technological and social changes (which include of course, the fact that unlike the 90s, when the idea didn’t even cross the minds of anyone, now kids own cellphones and that’s totally fine) of the last 20 years. Taichi and Agumon’s adventures were far from saying goodbye.Naturally, many of us were surprised and some felt betrayed: Kizuna wasn’t ever going to be really the last adventure. Or technically… it was… but in a deceptive way; it was going to be the last but only the last of the first run, so that this new one “didn't count”. But to us, lifelong fans, it very well did count.

It gave us and made us want to follow in their journey a large set of eight highly charismatic, immature kids as main characters (16 (!) if counting their pet-partners) all with distinctive personalities, backstories and interesting struggles and/or weaknesses they had to overcome, interacting with each other and receiving each a fair share of attention at some point, and all this channeled through a generally well-thought, ever-engaging narrative that knew how to build lots of well-earned powerful, unforgettable moments and was shrouded in a particular charm thanks to a careful artistic and musical direction, which in the end provided a very rewarding experience and turned it into a solid kids’ series that could also be enjoyed by adults and be appreciated forever.2020, has nothing of that. Our beloved characters went from these flawed kids that felt real and relatable with whom we could become fond of and be interested in their journey, to these lifeless, robotic superheroes who for worse saw themselves as the superheroes of the show with the duty to save the world always making sure to show their badassery fearlessly riding on top of their creatures while they were in fighting-mode and performed risky attacks even if that implied exposing themselves to unnecessary physical danger, and in the worst way possible. On this occasion, they don’t have flaws, they are perfect, very cool, they don’t suffer, they don’t have motivations, insecurities or anxieties and you can barely feel a soul inside them. They don’t live through a maturing or learning process where they have to learn how to get along and strengthen bonds. They don’t even at least feel surprised or confused to know about the existence of another world. This time they don’t miss home, don’t feel fear, they never argue, they don’t have internal conflicts to solve and they almost never commit mistakes to take lessons from. There’s barely anything of real interest humanly speaking going on for them. 1999 had normal, ordinary kids made of flesh and bones who behaved and spoke according to their age. 2020 has soulless, indestructible superheroes apparently made of iron, because now they can even be thrown to the ground at full speed from the skies, be crashed against giant logs at high speed, be engulfed in flames, even receive impacts of hyperbeams or other extreme situations, and survive like nothing. They just didn’t feel like real kids, and as a result it was impossible for us to connect with them and be interested in them, make us feel part of the group and making us care for anything they did or had to do or happened to them and feel empathy towards them at all. Thanks to this the series suffers from a chronic emotional weight deficiency which is shocking to notice for anyone who has seen the original and that wonderful ability it had of enabling us to project our inner kid souls into them, making us feel like kids again (one of the main adult appeals of the original) is gone now. Whatever great moments it tried to pull off were ineffective. And while this may not be a problem for a current kid, this evidently makes it significantly less valuable from the perspective of the now historical adult fan. So no, it couldn’t be for us. Because the cast we love wasn’t here, only their soulless bodies and in different clothes.While all main characters are an inferior version of their 1999 counterparts, in relation to character-wise mistakes, there are two of them that deserve a special mention for being the definite worst particular offenders. The first one is the absolutely obscene share of attention the main of the eight kids received from the writers. One thing we all loved from the original was how, despite acknowledging that the natural-born leader and the natural-born rival would need a bit more screentime due to their more relevant positions in the group and narrative, it still always made sure to give the rest a fair share of spotlight, participation and credit. They also mattered. This helped providing a sense of variety. On multiple occasions it even let another kid different than the main one finish an important enemy. But 2020 also forgot that. The attention gap is disproportionate. Here Taichi does everything important. Here he gets all the final glory. He gets a second mega before any of the rest even gets his first, in an episode where it looked like another character would get it. He gets to do the final hit even when it looked like the story was pushing for another powerful digimon of another kid to get the honor. He is the star of the opening and he’s always the eyecatch. And they didn’t even bother to hide it, through shamelessly contrived events to separate him from the rest and make sure they won’t interfere in his demonstration of badassery with his partner digimon. Even though I like the character, this just was excessive and unfair. The situation became increasingly worse to even reaching the point in the last part where he literally teleported through the Digitalworld to guarantee his presence in every single episode; even in those where he didn’t have absolutely anything to do there, he always managed to magically pop up. “Oh, I was just passing by and thought it was a good idea to be here right where you got to be too, what a coincidence!”. Yeah right. It essentially became trolling. There was even an episode with hundreds of Taichi’s clones!The second one was the Koushirou/Izzy case, turned this time into the god of information. Look, it’s one thing to be the smart, genius kid of the group, but another completely different one to be an almost omniscient god. He always knew and discovered everything immediately and effortlessly, had access to classified information a kid his age should never have, hacked international systems and organizations, controlled ships from his laptop, came up with solutions adults with way more experience than him for some reason couldn’t come up with before, and nothing was ever an obstacle to him. Even Yamato once asked “how he knew all that?” with Taichi literally answering “because he’s so cool and knows everything”. Yes, in the original he was also the boy genius, he also had his laptop and he also eventually knew what was going on, however there it was more grounded, not only because he was an actual character that felt real, but also because you could see he obtained information through actual time and effort, with more naturalism. Here instead, he was more like a robotic know-it-all problem-solver with this constant “oh yeah since I’m the smartest one here I’ll give you all the info you need immediately because I’m here to do that” attitude. Heck, even that solve-everything robot from the movie Interstellar had more soul than him. It was sad to see how the writers overexploited his skills and made him go from a character to a hyper-convenient tool.The digimon partners didn’t save themselves from the character-reduction either. They went from creatures who had a voice to creatures who are just there to battle whenever they were required at zero cost. They always evolve whenever they want or need or have to, never get tired and never go back to their in-training forms. This time they barely had any role or significance for the children’s growth and barely had anything of interest regarding relation-development, natural bonding or conflicts with their kid partners as it happened in 1999. You could almost listen to them internally screaming: “please, don’t treat us just like weapons!”, since they at least retained their personalities for the most part. In relation to them, the nice key concept of evolving-thanks-to-evolving (tying the creature’s power to growth as individuals of the kids) is also gone now. The digimon achieves the next stage quite cheaply, not triggered by an important event or spiritual evolution of the kid or a highly special occurrence, but instead out of random uninteresting, irrelevant circumstances which were not even framed within the true plot or character-story or just because they eventually had to appear with little to no proper buildup, so the heart and main idea of the series are lost. This was especially disappointing to see in the mega digievolutions since for them, being the final evolutionary stage, it should have been better; it’s supposed to be due to something more compelling and special, lacking the desired emotional impact and ending up being just dull show-ups. It should be noted that there are moments when it tries or remembers having to do that, but it arrives late (not even the crests were introduced when they should and didn’t play major roles here) and they don’t work because they feel highly forced and can’t feel earned or inspiring enough if the kid himself doesn’t feel relatable to begin with.Moving to speak about narrative elements, it doesn’t do any better. The original may have had some issues you could criticize it for, but in general it had a well-thought or structured storyline, with every episode being relevant and contributing for plot progression, with moments correctly timed, without ever losing focus (and I need to be emphatic on this) and virtually zero uninteresting, skippable-like moments in a 54 episodes run, never letting you go. Little of this can be said about 2020. Badly structured with wrongly, awkwardly timed events, with parts that should have come beforehand coming afterward and vice-versa, episodes that would have worked better as introductory coming during the end, others that would have worked better in the end coming in the beginning or in the middle (like Millenniummon: which should have been the last enemy given the size and scale of the conflict, with even god-digimons appearing to participate in a Magnus, heavenly-like fight, something more appropriate and effective for endings), with endgame stages even in the first episodes (it was nice if they wanted to pay homage to Our War Game, but that was not the moment). Many light, silly episodes in both the second and third arcs when they can only work and should only be placed at the beginning to establish characters, provide background and so on. There is a noticeable lack of true tension for several episodes even when there’s a risky threat just around the corner. In the second, instead of being worried by the imminent resurrection of a legendary monster, they have time for irrelevant, random trivialities like rescuing enslaved digimon in a theme park, episodes about digimons angry because couldn’t eat french fries, water disputes among digimon we can’t care less for and even time to relax playing soccer like nothing, and for about 10 episodes in a row it forgets to actually move the plot wasting time with useless content that altogether never amounted to anything of true value for the viewer. In the third, they say they are going on a mission to investigate the mystery of the crests, yet barely end up doing things that have to do with that or that could give them clues. Instead, we have random adventuring episodes where Joe helps digimons recovering their onsen, Hikari protecting digieggs, Mimi training in a digimon school or Yamato helping random digimon villagers with a ghost samurai, and all this in the final stretch when the great calamity great, even worse than Millenniummon, would be soon happening and shit was supposed to be real. No tension, no thrill, no drama, no fun. Most of these types of episodes were entirely worthless with our kids dealing with disconnected situations that contributed nothing of real value in terms of plot progression, character growth or bringing in a new digievolution, serving little to no purpose and leaving no impact on future events.Must be said that yes, the original did have light moments and our kids did occasionally deviate from the mission and took some time to rest (like when they went to eat burgers after coming back to the real world), however, this was minimal, always right-timed and never came at the expense of plot-progression, because these moments where framed within it and always brought in something of value, so they worked and provided tonal variety. Must be also mentioned that eventually (but lamely) it does attempt to develop a character (somehow), however, it didn’t matter much because similarly, that development wasn’t framed within a plot, limiting its potential. The original, to the contrary, cleverly made sure that the development always came hand-in-hand with progression, tying character with plot almost perfectly. Here, however, it’s like an attempt of one or the other. It comes as separated (if any development happens first of course). The idea is to bring it naturally while the story is also moving, however here it came during episodes with situations that had no relation to the stake of the arc. Another type of narrative sin was this absurd series of cyber world threats we could never care for because everything felt like a total joke with all of them coming right after the previous one, with no real sense of weight and which also felt like only secondary job assigned to Koushiro while Taichi and Yamato dealt with all the important stuff, in an attempt to create drama and tension which completely failed. That the missiles, the ships, the satellites, the NASA, whatever. Finally, the execution wasn’t as engaging; you won’t see this time the sense of mystery and feeling lost in another strange world of the Devimon arc, the sense of thrill of the Myotismon arc or the sense of drama and darkness of the Dark Masters arc of the original series, which largely helped to explain its entertainment value.So, as it should be clear by now, all this leads us to the inevitable conclusion that this reboot was definitely not intended for us (because it’s impossible to believe they could have wanted to give us such an inferior show), but in reality for a younger new audience; the current generation of new children, in hopes to capture their fresh interest and devotion, which makes things tricky when it comes to the general judgment of this series since, despite being a shameful near-worthless work for the historical fan, this automatically means in reality it should be judged according to how well it could have satisfied these desired new ones. And while -evidently- I don’t have kid-eyes anymore to know this exactly, reasonably my own experience as a kid watching the original series would serve as a fair approximation. Given that, I would say the series, even with all its notorious issues already explained, could admittedly have passed as fine entertainment for kids who mainly just wanted to see the cool creatures in action and know what their following new cool evolutions, designs and special attacks were going to be (who do we want to fool here), if not because i) the narrative is a mess and ii) the show also fails to properly build hype for said new evolutions.The first point was already described before. While kids may not pay much attention or care too much about the characters and their struggles, they can still notice or perceive some questionable plot developments or structures coming off as odd or get the feeling some things are not right. As for the second point, what I mean is that it fails to give value to evolutions, in terms of buildup and payoff; to make them memorable, you must first create the expectation and then after enough time has passed, deliver them in the right time. The original made sure to follow this by creating the expectations for them and once they arrived, use them for the right amount of time before the following did. However, in 2020 the ultimates just arrive too early in the story to be able to even create the hype (in the 10s, as opposed to the 20s-30s of original), one right after the other, under-using the adult forms, rendering them as only means or obstacles that the story should have to get rid of quickly and leaving little room for ultimate form-expectation. This also makes their appearances not living up to the potential emotional impact they could have enjoyed thanks to having made us wait for them for a significant amount of time. And while they did wait enough before introducing the mega forms (at least, for everyone who wasn’t Agumon), unfortunately, the way they did it wasn’t great or special anymore. They were just given too easily. They didn’t come due to situations of high emotional catharsis, high expectation or that were even at least framed into the plot, or thanks to special/unique occurrences (to not say “miracle”) that give more meaning and weight, but instead due to completely random, trivial circumstances we could never really care for, sadly devaluing their “final, special and rare stage” status. I appreciate they have decided this time to include the mega forms for everyone (though I argue the original still worked well without doing this), since that feels fairer to the rest of the cast, but now that you do, at least do it well, which unfortunately wasn’t the case. It almost felt like they brought them up just because “we have to” not caring too much (if any) about the “why”, the “when” and the “how” of their introductions. Given this, I have to even doubt it could have been an actually satisfying and effective experience to the real intended new audience. I doubt I could have been as intrigued with all these cool creatures and their hype-digievolutions watching this reboot as a kid as much as I did back then in 2000 when I was watching the original series.All in all, I think at this point it’s needless to say that, being the original series one of my all-time favorites, I’m more than just disappointed with the sole existence of this modern reboot. I won’t lie by claiming I wasn’t initially interested and enthusiastic about it, because as a fan of the original that couldn’t be the case, however, with a final outcome as poor as this one, in the end you cannot help but end up questioning what was even the point. The Toei team clearly wanted to reach the current kids' generation and introduce them to the Adventure universe, but what comes as incomprehensible is how could it be possible that they had come up with something so noticeably inferior when they already counted with a great original work serving as a basis or benchmark. Given its reboot nature, the bare minimum here was taking the original series and crafting a new work on par or at least close to its quality, and even taking advantage of the opportunity to improve on past flaws (because as much as we love the original series, it’s not like it was exactly free of them and for everything there is always room for improvement), but what happened here was the complete opposite; instead of improving or at least keeping the same quality levels, they only worsened them. Did they even notice what they were doing? Were they even truly caring? In the end, if they were going to deliver something this inferior, it would have been better doing so with other characters and another universe, so that the Adventure name and brand didn’t bear the reputational costs. The truth is, personally I don’t really care much about 2020 since the vastly superior original 1999 series will always be there, but what does bother me is that it’s a shame to realize how your beloved title, characters and creatures were used and humiliated in something so lame with none of the charm and strengths that characterized the original series and allowed it to earn its position as one of the best kids’ TV anime ever.And no, as a reboot, nobody expected an exact 1:1 copy of the first series, but what 2020 did was just unacceptable. Like everything else in life, doing things for the second time and doing them so significantly worse even when in the first time you already succeeded and you had all the tools in your hands (and even more than the first time) to succeed again, should never be accepted, because that can only happen when you deliberately reduce the efforts. 2020 is quite possibly the worst Digimon entry of the franchise and, as it isn’t already long enough, is yet another addition to the list of Toei Animation’s classics revival failures of the past decade. It only served to deteriorate the value of the Adventure name and didn’t work for any type of audience; for the old, historical fans that could have felt an interest in checking out a new version of the show, it pretty much felt like a bad joke, especially right after having experimented an already great conclusion to it with “Last Evolution Kizuna”, and for the new generations of kids this series was intended for, I can’t help but feel sorry for them for having been born in times where current Digimon producers thought they didn’t deserve better and had to grow up watching both uninspired and messy kids-oriented productions like this one. Even with all their huge flaws, at least the previous Adventure installments like 02 and Tri had a soul. 2020, didn’t even have one. 02 and Tri may have failed, but at least they tried. 2020 not only failed, it didn’t even try! And even though I’ve always insisted that you cannot treat and judge a kids-oriented series in the exact same way and with the exact same bars you would do it with a more teen and/or adult-oriented/designed one, and that it pains me having to give a low score to a class of series which on essence just want to bring entertainment (and hopefully, values) to the youngest of all audiences (since it is pretty much the equivalent of grabbing an innocent child who misbehaved and slamming him against the wall), the heart and care put into this series were so unbelievably low that this time I cannot give much of that benefit. Digimon Adventure (2020) is such a terrible involution (no pun intended) of the classic series whose name, success and legacy it miserably tried to capitalize on, that unfortunately, it leaves me with no other option. 3/10."", '(incomplete review based on the first 13 episodes)While I was expecting a remake of the original Digimon, Toei makes a reboot with a completely different story. I feel like this version of the original Digimon has been made with the intention of being a classic for this generation of kids/teenagers, just like the original one was, so the topics it touches are things common in this modern age (intercontinental nuclear missiles, smartphones, etc).Story: 5It tries to be more ""mature"" than the original Digimon using topics like weapons of massive destruction (nuclear bombs), I like that.What I dislike about this is the way the story...is developed, too rushed and mediocre. Matt and Taichi just met and they already know how to create Omegamon all of a sudden. When the kids find their Digimons, they don\'t even bother so much about what they are or why they are with them, they just accept them easily without further curiosity. Episode 9 and full evolved Digimons are already shown. Something that bothers me so much is the fact that Izumi can literally do anything he wants with his laptop, he even has contacts inside foreigner national security agencies, like bruh, even if he is a genius, he is an elementary school student, so unrealistic.Animation, character design and scenarios: 5The animation for the first episodes is bad. It\'s not fluent or smooth, the fights sometimes remind me of puppet shows where there\'s a scenario and behind there\'s a puppet being controlled by a person. The evolution sequences are good tho, all the money goes there.I understand that the forced quarantine in Japan affected the creation of the anime, so I won\'t blame Toei for the first episodes. Episode 5 had decent animation tho, idk if the quality will stay the same from now.The character designs are clearly meant to be similar to the first Digimon, maybe trying to get some nostalgic feelings.Scenarios are ok for the public this anime wants to reach.Characters: 4Some of the characters are kinda unrealistic, sometimes even plain robots. Not much character development given to us from their introduction chapters, it feels mediocre.I want to think that Taichi won\'t be the only relevant character throughout the story and the rest of the kids will have enough screentime.1) Sora: I feel her plain sometimes, like a robot or a cliché School/Action/Comedy/Harem male main character. She\'s supposed to be an elementary school girl.2) Taichi: He keeps the same personality he had in the original Digimon, so it\'s ok for me. He\'s the leader and the main character of this new Digimon Adventure.3) Izumi: Nothing changed about him, he\'s the same genius kid. The fact that he has contacts with even nacional security agencies of other countries is kinda ridiculous tbh, more if we ad that he can actually hack nuclear missiles.4) Matt : He acts like if he was some kind of ""badass"" main character, just like Tatsuya from Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, which I find unrealistic because he is an elementary school boy. His old personality was more realistic and less plain.5) Mimi: She\'s not a crybaby anymore and I like that, but her original personality is way more realistic, after all she is a 10 years old girl.6) Joe: I don\'t remember him being that careless at the beginning, he\'s in a brand new world and only thinks about studying, not even surviving in first place. At least he realized about it and decided to go with the other kids very fast.7) Digimons in general: Talking about the irrelevant Digimons, some look like actual dinosaurs instead of monsters or fantastic creatures.I miss the basic Digimons having different personalities, but i bet this will happen later, this is only the beginning after all.Sound: 7Background music is ok, opening an ending are cool. I wish it had the old opening, but the one it has is cool either. Personally, I never liked the old endings, so the new one gives extra points to the show because I like it.Voice acting is nothing out of the world, but its not bad.Enjoyment: 5I\'m not enjoying it enough, nothing compared with the old one and I\'m not saying this because of the nostalgic feelings.I\'m still positive about the future of the show, I want to believe that it will get way better. is developed, too rushed and mediocre.

I do not see this as a new anime, and I will be harsh for an obvious reason; when you recreate such a classic work of fiction, with the same characters and main concept, you know your job must not disappoint. It seems that most Digimon Adventure fans - like me - are not satisfied with this reboot. The reasons are simple, so let’s examine them carefully. But before I begin, I must make a wish:I wish the next generations will know watching the reboot is the wrong choice.Another...point to be made before I start my analysis is that Toei Animation, after a bad comeback with the Tri. movies, managed to create a masterpiece of a film to bid the old fans a tear-jerking farewell and end the Digimon Adventure. The nostalgia was there, we felt that, the movie was amazing in all aspects too, so let\'s make it clear from now; Digimon Adventure 2020\'s target audience is not the \'90s fans. These fans had enough and loved their completed journey.So, since the target audience is mainly kids of the new generation, there were some things concerning Koushiro (the genius child) and the world which obviously showed that this anime is newer. And these are the evolution of computer science and technology. Unluckily for Toei, they didn\'t think that making Koushiro hack big companies or take over ships in seconds from his laptop would seem extremely unrealistic. Back in 1999, he may have had hacking skills but they actually seemed more magical and all took place in the digital world, showing he is charismatic and that he can do great things from a laptop; he is the future of humanity in his own way. This time, it didn\'t feel like this at all, he was just a plot convenience for surreal things to happen. As a result, the use of modern technology to suit today\'s younger audience better was a failure and it was negative for the character writing as well.Digimon Adventure was not just a TV show with cute or cool-looking monsters; it was far more than that. It was the journey of a group of ""chosen"" children and the road to maturity, where everyone had a digital partner of their own, the famous Digimon. Unlike the reboot, the original anime focused on all characters. Everyone had their flaws and immature behaviours, so the Digimon helped them grow up and see the world differently. The reboot does not focus as much on the characters and their development, while Taichi gets most of the credits and still, his character development is not even close to the good old Taichi we knew. This is because he feels more than a superhero, rather than a child who makes both mistakes and good deeds to mature.Even if the reboot lacks in character, it is definitely more impressive in terms of fights, action and animation. The Digimon are mostly used as war tools, the interactions between Digimon and Chosen Children are far less and unimportant, and from episode 1 the real world is in panic due to a continuous huge catastrophe caused by the Digital World. If you\'re here for some supernatural action, pick the reboot but trust me, it will be a forgettable and shallow experience, giving you or your young friends/family only temporary pleasure.The Digimon Evolutions were originally triggered by the children\'s character development and it was beautiful to see them surpass any borders by powering up mentally and psychologically. In the reboot, this is not the case. The Digivolutions are far easier to happen, and their flashiness is a big part of the series\' selling point. Sometimes, they just evolve out of nowhere, as if there is no sense of fatigue. The Digimon are undoubtedly more powerful and more in numbers; a mix of Digimon found in Adventure, Tamers and other spin-offs. But all the magic of progressing and maturing allegorically by Digivolving seems lost, and this is one of the biggest turn-offs for old fans - and one of the reasons this version is forgettable.Another big minus here is the use of the Chosen Children\'s crests. In the 1999 version, the crests were awarded to them as they faced and overcame many hardships, and each crest had a unique characteristic (courage, love etc.) that suited its owner as a result of their character development. It did not feel the same in the 2020 version; it felt forced, since the character development was clearly inferior as the anime mainly focused on showing off well-animated fights between Digital Monsters. It is actually funny because the episodes were more this time, but we still didn\'t get to know well some characters.Another thing to take into account is that the villain writing and what surrounded it was uncanny. For example, Milleniummon seemed like he would be the last Digimon the children would have to face, and insanely powerful Digimon fought him and as a result, it looked like a climax. But it was not like that, the last episodes introduced us other Digimon and an anticlimatic way to end the series. The most bizarre thing Digimon Adventure 2020 did was to introduce the legendary Omegamon in one of the first episodes, to beat a powerful virus type Digimon. I guess there was a metaphor behind that which was not clear and did not work. Or maybe it was made to give us old fans nostalgia from ""Bokura no War Game"" movie, which is nonsensical because the reboot wasn\'t even made for this purpose.The soundtrack follows the regular Digimon pattern; there\'s an opening song, an evolution insert song and an ending song in every episode. The only difference, here, is that the ending songs change every 12 episodes and there are some great artists like Reol performing them. In my opinion, the opening and insert songs are decent, but cannot compare to the legendary ""Butter-Fly"" and ""Brave Heart"". Wada Koji\'s absence hurts a lot and Digimon Adventure could never be the same without him.To sum up, Digimon Adventure 2020 is one of the biggest question marks in anime history. It is a forgettable, chaotic hypefest with shallow character writing and almost no significance for kids, made to visually impress them and show off powerful Digimon fights. If you want your kid or young sibling to watch a cool looking kids show with monsters and action, here you are. If you want them to watch a meaningful story which includes both, and one that they can remember for the rest of his life, you should definitely show them the classic, original, beloved version of Digimon Adventure. In my opinion, the best kids shows are the ones who combine good visuals with morals and understandable life lessons.Thank you for reading! point to be made before I start my analysis is that Toei Animation, after a bad comeback with the Tri. movies, managed to create a masterpiece of a film to bid the old fans a tear-jerking farewell and end the Digimon Adventure.

These fans had enough and loved their completed journey.So, since the target audience is mainly kids of the new generation, there were some things concerning Koushiro (the genius child) and the world which obviously showed that this anime is newer. And these are the evolution of computer science and technology. Unluckily for Toei, they didn\'t think that making Koushiro hack big companies or take over ships in seconds from his laptop would seem extremely unrealistic. Back in 1999, he may have had hacking skills but they actually seemed more magical and all took place in the digital world, showing he is charismatic and that he can do great things from a laptop; he is the future of humanity in his own way. This time, it didn\'t feel like this at all, he was just a plot convenience for surreal things to happen. As a result, the use of modern technology to suit today\'s younger audience better was a failure and it was negative for the character writing as well.Digimon Adventure was not just a TV show with cute or cool-looking monsters; it was far more than that. It was the journey of a group of ""chosen"" children and the road to maturity, where everyone had a digital partner of their own, the famous Digimon. Unlike the reboot, the original anime focused on all characters. Everyone had their flaws and immature behaviours, so the Digimon helped them grow up and see the world differently. The reboot does not focus as much on the characters and their development, while Taichi gets most of the credits and still, his character development is not even close to the good old Taichi we knew. This is because he feels more than a superhero, rather than a child who makes both mistakes and good deeds to mature.Even if the reboot lacks in character, it is definitely more impressive in terms of fights, action and animation. The Digimon are mostly used as war tools, the interactions between Digimon and Chosen Children are far less and unimportant, and from episode 1 the real world is in panic due to a continuous huge catastrophe caused by the Digital World. If you\'re here for some supernatural action, pick the reboot but trust me, it will be a forgettable and shallow experience, giving you or your young friends/family only temporary pleasure.The Digimon Evolutions were originally triggered by the children\'s character development and it was beautiful to see them surpass any borders by powering up mentally and psychologically. In the reboot, this is not the case. The Digivolutions are far easier to happen, and their flashiness is a big part of the series\' selling point. Sometimes, they just evolve out of nowhere, as if there is no sense of fatigue. The Digimon are undoubtedly more powerful and more in numbers; a mix of Digimon found in Adventure, Tamers and other spin-offs. But all the magic of progressing and maturing allegorically by Digivolving seems lost, and this is one of the biggest turn-offs for old fans - and one of the reasons this version is forgettable.Another big minus here is the use of the Chosen Children\'s crests. In the 1999 version, the crests were awarded to them as they faced and overcame many hardships, and each crest had a unique characteristic (courage, love etc.) that suited its owner as a result of their character development. It did not feel the same in the 2020 version; it felt forced, since the character development was clearly inferior as the anime mainly focused on showing off well-animated fights between Digital Monsters. It is actually funny because the episodes were more this time, but we still didn\'t get to know well some characters.Another thing to take into account is that the villain writing and what surrounded it was uncanny. For example, Milleniummon seemed like he would be the last Digimon the children would have to face, and insanely powerful Digimon fought him and as a result, it looked like a climax. But it was not like that, the last episodes introduced us other Digimon and an anticlimatic way to end the series. The most bizarre thing Digimon Adventure 2020 did was to introduce the legendary Omegamon in one of the first episodes, to beat a powerful virus type Digimon. I guess there was a metaphor behind that which was not clear and did not work. Or maybe it was made to give us old fans nostalgia from ""Bokura no War Game"" movie, which is nonsensical because the reboot wasn\'t even made for this purpose.The soundtrack follows the regular Digimon pattern; there\'s an opening song, an evolution insert song and an ending song in every episode. The only difference, here, is that the ending songs change every 12 episodes and there are some great artists like Reol performing them. In my opinion, the opening and insert songs are decent, but cannot compare to the legendary ""Butter-Fly"" and ""Brave Heart"". Wada Koji\'s absence hurts a lot and Digimon Adventure could never be the same without him.To sum up, Digimon Adventure 2020 is one of the biggest question marks in anime history. It is a forgettable, chaotic hypefest with shallow character writing and almost no significance for kids, made to visually impress them and show off powerful Digimon fights. If you want your kid or young sibling to watch a cool looking kids show with monsters and action, here you are. If you want them to watch a meaningful story which includes both, and one that they can remember for the rest of his life, you should definitely show them the classic, original, beloved version of Digimon Adventure. In my opinion, the best kids shows are the ones who combine good visuals with morals and understandable life lessons.Thank you for reading!', '--- SHORT VERSION ---Pros:+ character designs+ nice visualsCons:- pacing of the story is trash...- character development no longer required for evolution- the story itself is a ""reimagining"" and not a very good one (Omegamon appears before the Dark Masters do, that is *IF* the Dark Masters even exist in this reboot)- the songs used during key moments consist of generic & uninspired J-rock shouting that funnily enough sound like something Etemon would sing--- LONG VERSION ---Let me first say that I\'m a huge (classic) Digimon fan. I love the first four seasons and I look forward to rewatching them whenever I have time. This is a franchise I LITERALLY grew up with, so you\'d think this would be a 10/10 review, right? Well... no. Far from it. This all new Digimon Adventure 2020 takes everything that made the original such a highly valued classic among the Digimon fandom and spits on it before throwing it all out of the window in an attempt to reboot/revitalize/reinvent the series for the next generation of (what I assume Toei intended to be) new Digimon fans. I\'ll never understand why the companies/people in charge of certain brands think that this is necessary. If anything, reboots almost invariably result in something inferior and mediocre, and this never-ending cancer inducing trend can sadly be observed across all sorts of different media from TV series, movies, to video games. I\'m literally trying to challenge myself here as I\'m writing this and think of one reboot that has actually managed to surpass the original work and guess what.... I can\'t think of any! The only medium people haven\'t started rebooting yet are books. Can you imagine a \'reboot\' (for modern generations) of \'The Great Gatsby\' or \'The Catcher in the Rye\'? I know I can\'t possibly compare Digimon to classic works of literature with a straight face, but that\'s exactly why the sole idea of a reboot triggers an unpleasant taste in my mouth because my philosophy is: if the original work is great, future generations will connect with it sooner or later. Reboots are only necessary if the original is shitty to begin with, which Digimon Adventure NINETEEN-NINETY-NINE is not. This is like Sailor Moon all over again. Leave the classics alone and create new ORIGINAL material.Next, a small history lesson for the uninitiated among us (feel free to skip this long ass paragraph if you\'re familiar with the last 20 years of Digimon\'s existence): The Digimon anime is no stranger to reboots... the fandom has experienced (and/or suffered through) several of them (in a way all the seasons after Adventure 02 are their own \'self-contained universes\' so reboot may not be the right word to use, but hopefully you get the point). Only the first and second season are set in the same universe, while the third (Tamers) was a fresh new beginning that introduced not only brand new protagonists, but also a brand new concept & form of evolution and the Digital World (there is a certain character that has existed in both Adventure and Tamers timelines, Akiyama Ryo, but he\'s a huge exception). This first departure from the original storyline was received well & was most likely a blessing for the writers working on the Digimon anime as it provided them with the opportunity to experiment with fresh new ideas and plot. In spite of the favorable reception, 2002 saw the release of Digimon Frontier -- another ""reboot"" of sorts that, once again, like Tamers did before -- reinvented the concept and story behind the Digital World while completely abandoning the tamer X Digimon partner dynamic as the new protagonists actually evolved into Digimon themselves. This made the protagonists feel more involved and the battles a bit more personal. In spite of that, this new plot was received less favorably and it greatly polarized the fandom. You\'ll either find people who loved the idea of humans turning into Digimon, or those that hated it with passion. Those falling in the latter category also often tend to wish Toei had continued fleshing out and building upon the world introduced in Digimon Tamers as opposed to having a new Digital World again. After Frontier finished airing, it took three long years for the next season to arrive and when it finally did, Digimon underwent major overhaul for the THIRD time. However, while Digimon Savers (2006) distanced itself from its predecessors even further by (you guessed it) introducing brand new characters and Digital World, it also employed an entirely new art style quite different from the one used in the previous four seasons -- regardless, Digimon Savers also saw the return of many familiar elements: humans were partnered with Digimon once more and the way the story was paced was still quite Digimon-esque in nature.  Savers is additionally often cited as being one of the most mature seasons (which, imo, is debatable -- although, yes, the fact that the three main protagonists are in their teens lends itself to a much darker tone than ever before, although that\'s not to say that the previous seasons lacked darker themes – e.g. Ken\'s character arc in Adventure 02 or Juri\'s and Impon\'s in Tamers). The reception to Savers was ultimately lukewarm, and little did Digimon fans know that Savers would be the last Digimon season for a while, as it took Toei record-breaking FOUR years to produce the next season -- Xros Wars (2010). Xros Wars and its many seasons were, in my honest opinion, a DISASTER (and I know this might sound controversial given how it tends to be praised for ""making Digimon feel like Digimon again"" and whatnot). Everything from the bland one dimensional protagonists with ZERO depth to them to the boring plot that drags on forever and never develops into anything noteworthy, a complete disregard for the power hierarchy among Digimon previously established in the card games & the TV series, mediocre OST, and sloppy looking art style and animation – to me, Digimon had hit ROCK BOTTOM.The paragraph above was a setup for me stating the obvious:  in an attempt to keep up with the times, and owing to multiple resets of the series instead of sticking to one continuity -- Toei have completely lost sight of what made Digimon so great and admired in the first place, and their recent attempts at resurrecting the television series seem to be one major disappointment after another. Just look at the abysmal travesty that was Adventure tri. masquerading itself as some sort of a sequel to the Adventure seasons while partially retconning certain events of 02, reducing the entire 02 cast to an afterthought, never touching upon Ryo or Millenniumon (as well as Millenniumon\'s relation to the dark seeds Demon was after and Dagomon\'s ocean) + the art style is so different and simplistic looking that it\'s almost like watching a different anime entirely. And the few good things about it -- namely, grown up versions of Taichi and the rest of the Adventure cast, as well as the intriguing subplot involving the original five chosen children and the aftermath of their battle with the Dark Masters-- were not enough to save it because the majority of screen time was wasted on a new character that nobody asked for and nobody wanted as opposed to developing the good stuff.  Seriously, where have all the good writers gone....? Because they are no longer working on Digimon, that\'s for sure.Believe it or not -- I was, never the less, quite excited at the thought of Digimon Adventure possibly having a new chance at extending its life span. Sadly, the more episodes that I have seen, the more I\'m starting to think this series is just a soulless reimagining that preys on the nostalgic factor of the original audience. Digimon Adventure (2020) is, similarly to Adventure tri, a ginormous slap in the face to all Digimon fans who\'ve been following the franchise since day one. The only thing I find to be an improvement over the trainwreck that was Adventure tri. is the art style and character designs which are faithful to the original this time around and look very nice. Besides that, it\'s all downhill from here. Part of the charm of the first four seasons of Digimon lies in the great score by Takanori Arisawa (also known for composing music for the original Sailor Moon). The music in Adventure (2020) is mostly unmemorable and not nearly as iconic as Arisawa\'s. The pacing of the story is all over the place and there\'s no real sense of progression and growth. I don\'t mind the fact that the storyline isn\'t exactly like the original, but if you\'re going to introduce new plot twists at least make sure they\'re actually BETTER than the original material. It used to be that the kids and their Digimon had to work hard to earn their evolutions and do some serious self-reflection, confront their fears, and resolve whatever struggles they had which provided a lot of great emotional moments (entire FEATURE FILMS were produced back in the day centering around some powerful evolution) and yet, few episodes in, and Taichi and Yamato are already warp evolving like it\'s nothing. Subsequently, evolution is no longer an ""event"" – a rare occurrence only the strongest can achieve – now it\'s just like downloading a new cool app. The Digital World has also been boredified. In the original series, the Digital World actually felt like this mysterious, campy, and fairy-tale-like place with some creepy horror-ish elements (e.g. the iconic telephone booths, the abandoned ruins or factories), you\'d not only feel worried for the kids, but you\'d react with the exact same sense of wonder and disbelief to the things in the Digital World as they do. One could also sense an underlying depth to it, it was this vast unexplored place alien to the main characters who only knew the little info they learned from the Digimon they encountered. All I kept asking myself while watching Adventure (2020) was where has all that great sense of mystery/wonder disappeared? This, once again, highlights how poor the writing is. This all new Digimon Adventure 2020 is rumored to have about 60 episodes. I\'m really curious where they plan to go with this mess when they\'ve already managed to pack mega evolutions and jogress into the first nine episodes. I guess we can """"""""look forward"""""""" to a time jump and have the reboot butcher the entire Zero Two season as well? Or they\'ll devote the second half of the season to one of the blandest and most atrocious characters to ever grace the Digimon anime -- Meiko and the overdesigned atrocity she has the audacity to call a Digimon, Meicoomon. Also, can\'t wait to find out all the things they\'ll retcon with this one for absolutely NO reason.To sum it up, Digimon Adventure (2020) is a WASTED opportunity. Instead of recreating the already near-perfect original, this could\'ve been a great addition to the original two seasons which could greatly benefit from a WELL-made third season that would extend the lore of the Adventure universe and (potentially) tie up some loose ends and plot holes (of which there is an abundance of for the writers to deal with). It could\'ve also covered the material from the WonderSwan games and/or CD dramas. Instead, there\'s long been a secret agenda to RUIN the Digimon franchise through the systematic production of underwhelming sequels that all suffer from atrocious writing, awful designs, and a lack of good direction. Oh well, I get the impression Toei no longer cares and frankly neither do I after the crimes against humanity that were Xros Wars, Adventure tri. and now this abomination. - character development no longer required for evolution- the story itself is a ""reimagining"" and not a very good one (Omegamon appears before the Dark Masters do, that is *IF* the Dark Masters even exist in this reboot)- the songs used during key moments consist of generic & uninspired J-rock shouting that funnily enough sound like something Etemon would sing--- LONG VERSION ---Let me first say that I\'m a huge (classic) Digimon fan.

However, currently (6 episodes in) it hasn't lived up to my expectations and that's because of the characters.To start of with something positive; I enjoyed the story so far because it opens up a wider scale of importance compared to the original show. It creates an essential, longlasting goal that the protagonists need to accomplish while also delivering engaging lore about the digiworld. I love lore, especially the lore that's given to me in this show.Nevertheless that's as far as the upsides go. So far we're not given any actual...progression, especially when it comes to character-progression. Something I remember from the original show is that the characters all had flaws that they struggled with to overcome. But in this reboot they all feel...perfect. The characters show no personal obstacles nor any problems in general. I'll attempt to explain what I mean by giving a general description of two of the characters:Taichi is an 11 year old martial arts master who demonstrates his prowess by battling digimon on his own. He can 1v1 digimon and they show him doing just that.Izumi on the other hand, who's also 11 years old is a genuis (and that's putting it lightly). He manages to reprogram his normal laptop to compensate for the difference in the flow of time between the digiworld and the real world. Essentially, he can hack in to time itself with his laptop.Leading to the conclusion that we've not been given any actual character progression. Rather, and I believe this describes the current 6 episodes more accurately, we've been given introductions. We've been given an introduction on some of the characters and, frankly, their far too unrealistic abilities. We've also been given an introduction on what they need to fulfill but we haven't been given any content that shows progression towards that goal because the show is too busy introducing overpowered characters.And the fact that we've yet to have seen all the protagonists, leaves the impression that this progression-empty way of telling the story is going to continue in the upcoming episodes. Yet, I still believe that this reboot has potential and that's because of the lore that they've been introducing. I feel like the writer's have managed to make the lore more appealing compared to the original Digimon series and if they manage to emphasize on that more while simultaneously creating some form av struggle that keeps us hooked, we might yet get an entertaining story. But so far, it's mediocre experience at best. progression, especially when it comes to character-progression.

Growing with Digimon Adventure as my childhood weekend show, I highly set my expectation in this new series to be good as the OG or even better.After following the story until the end, I can genuinely say that this new series is failing me. But it's unfair to say that the series is trash without looking up on the good side. Therefore to balance the review, I decided to make some pros and cons fair and equally. Here you go,Pros :1) Battle movements are improved and slightly more varied at some point2) There...is a lot of new and old Digimon who makes their debut on the series3) The animation of evolution sequences are so much better compared to the OG4) Those villains appearance is felt to be the more dangerous with some massive size5) The art and also the animation that they put in the credits are all fun and catchy to watch with 5 different ending songs too.6) They've got three decent insert songs for each Digimon evolution level (Adult, Perfect, and Ultimate)Cons :1) The storyline is totally trash. Unclear plot and goal most of the time2) The digital world environment feels tedious compared to OG3) The Digi-Analyzer is not as informative as the OG version4) Those villains are mostly unspoken and they're trying too hard to stir up emotions and a sense of danger while never putting actual danger in any of the episodes5) Relied too much on people being familiar with the 90s anime and the personalities and backstories given to the kids6) Lack of BGM variation, some of them are sounds similar but with a different arrangement is a lot of new and old Digimon who makes their debut on the series3) The animation of evolution sequences are so much better compared to the OG4) Those villains appearance is felt to be the more dangerous with some massive size5) The art and also the animation that they put in the credits are all fun and catchy to watch with 5 different ending songs too.6) They've got three decent insert songs for each Digimon evolution level (Adult, Perfect, and Ultimate)Cons :1) The storyline is totally trash.

Apart from the updated artstyle (though not the animation) I don\'t feel like it beats the original in any way or form. The pacing is all over the place, the characters and their growth (which was by far the most important aspect in the original for me) are lacking, the classic soundtracks got completely replaced with rather generic ones and the story is only meh even if we ignore the original.I went in without any expectations and still got massively disappointed. Really, unless you can\'t stomach the older artstyle at all, I recommend just watching the original...instead.I can understand if people disagree and actually like it for one reason or another, but please ignore the reviews giving this show a straight 9 or 8. That kind of rating is insulting to many other great anime out there and is obviously just a protest review to ""counter"" the low rating reviews. instead.I can understand if people disagree and actually like it for one reason or another, but please ignore the reviews giving this show a straight 9 or 8.

The lovable cast, has been reduced to mere expressionless  shells, with no personality or motivations.The sound and especially the animation are better than the original. There\'s a variety of pretty good tracks, and the evolution sequences are spectacular. Sadly, that sums up almost all the positives of this show.The first ~12 episodes were ok, but after that, it divebombed into endless catastrophic events and ludicrous amount of fighting. Our protagonists also realised they are not kids, but robot soldiers that can only grunt, shout eachothers\' names, and telepathicaly communicate stupid...plans that somehow work. The worst offender is probably Koushiro who became expressionless hacker know-it-all problem solver and information dumper. Essentialy just a plot device.The digimon also suffer from the above issues. Instead of digital monsters, they act more like digital war machines. They have no personality (with a few exceptions) and fight tirelessly. Exhaustion occurs only when the writers want it.Despite all the fanservice and mega ""epic"" battles, this show, like our protagonists, lacks the soul that the original had. plans that somehow work.

Exhaustion occurs only when the writers want it.Despite all the fanservice and mega ""epic"" battles, this show, like our protagonists, lacks the soul that the original had.', 'Let me go ahead and preface that I\'ll use the original Digimon Adventure series as my main comparison. Despite me really liking the Digimon franchise, I don\'t feel any attachment to Adventure 1 or 2 since I was too young at the time to even understand it and my Digimon introduction was basically left to Tamers and Frontier. Having finally watched the original series only about 2 years ago, I don\'t think nostalgia should really play a role in my opinion of Digimon Adventure:. Also, I\'ll not judge this anime as I would most other anime since I think it would be unfair to compare...an anime intended for younger kids as I would one intended for older kids and adults. So with that out of the way let\'s get right into it.The Good:1. Adventurous - Okay, yes Digimon Adventure: is Adventurous *ba dum tss* in the sense that they weren\'t afraid to explore concepts that weren\'t explored that much in the original Digimon Adventure series like digimon eating other digimon in order to digivolve or them breaking the mold and creating new ways to digivolve.2. More digimon - To be fair, the original Digimon Adventure series only had so many digimon it could use and they created some specifically for the anime. But I\'ll have this as a positive because it had diversity which is something that lacked in series like Digimon Adventure Tri. I always thought it was weird how, in a world that is supposedly inhabited by digimon there were forests, jungles and deserts without any digimon and when there were it was always the same ones. That\'s not how an ecosystem works.The Bad:3. Character Development or, may I say it , the lack of it - The character development is basically non existent, that is, for everyone except Tai. I\'ll talk more about it in the next point but Tai is the only character in this series that seems to get some attention. Not that I was expecting them to give the same amount of attention to every character but it seems crazy to me that even Yamato has been relegated from rival/counterpart to sidekick. Not even the digidestined digimon seem to be getting that much attention. It\'s like it expects you to have an entry level knowledge of the characters, it gives little to no backstory and their personalities has been boiled down to MC, Cool ""Rival"", Brains, Main Girl, Brat Girl and Scaredy-Cat.4. Writing - ""Our expectations for you were low but holyfuck"". I know this is a kids show and knowing how low the bar for kids shows has been lowered in the past years I wasn\'t expecting anything great, but goddamit this was worst than hot garbage. This anime makes the original series feel like One Piece, that\'s the level of depth were dealing with this shit. Don\'t know what to do with a character? Just say they\'re occupied with idk being in a hot spring or collecting gems and now you can just ignore them until you need their digimons to evolve into the next form to catch up to Tai and Agumon so that Agumon can finally digivolve again to Omnimon to defeat this enemy that only Omnimon can defeat.5. Art - Again, I understand this is a kids show and that they were trying to recreat the original artstyle but that doesn\'t mean you can just regurgitate the same animation 21 years later. First of all, it doesn\'t work because you\'re using different techniques. The original kinda worked because it was still mostly hand drawn, but computer animations simply can\'t achieve the same effect. The way the skies and the background used to be colored gave a otherworldly feeling that made sense in an isekai like Digimon Adventure (yes Digimon Adventure was an isekai, let\'s go mai boissss). Now, you look at the background of Digimon Adventure: and what you get is blue sky with no feature, just blue and boring. Second, the animation is trash. Apart from the first 3 or so episodes and some ""boss fights"" episodes, the animations is just still images with lip flops and movement shots with very few FPS going on for half a minute each. How is your animtion still the same as it was back when the original series came out. If you\'re using computer animation then get a proper animation right. A good example of how you can achieve the same feeling as an older kids show without putting the animation in jeopardy is Dragon Quest (2020). Does every episode have top tier animation? No. But is it consistently good? Yes. Did it sacrifice the artstyle? Nope. A media franchise as big a Digimon shouldn\'t be struggling to make a decent anime, let alone one at the level of Dragon Quest (no offence meant to DQ).The Stupid:6. Koushiro is a hacker - If I remember well, Koushiro is supposed to be 10 yo right? Then please explain to me how the hell is he hacking missiles and satellites. It makes no fucking sense. As ridiculous as the original series was, it never made Koushiro out to be some super genius that can hack into any computer system. Also this combined with the lack of character development has made him just some kid behind the computer while Tai, Yamato and Sora solve the problems.7. WHY DO THEY RIDE THE DIGIMON WHILE FIGHTING? - I swear every episode I get this much close of just quitting for how stupid this is. I can get behind Yamato riding Garurumon while fighting bu why does Tai need to ride Greymon every damn episode while fighting. It only puts him in danger while making Greymon having to worry about him while battling. What\'s even more ridiculous is that the digimon do backflips at high speed with their digidestined on top of them without them falling. It makes no sense. It\'s stupid and I hate it. This didn\'t happen in the original and I don\'t remember it happening in any of the series.In summary, Digimon Adventure: is a reboot that makes promises to achieve a lot while delivering nothing. Please don\'t waste your time watching this husk of a show and just go watch the original. an anime intended for younger kids as I would one intended for older kids and adults.

Although on surface level it was just a proxy battle show that was only aiming to sell videogames to kids, it was also the perfect isekai. Despite being a trapped in a videogame story it didn’t have the bullshit of the 2010 isekai. It had a complete story, it wasn’t rushed, it was allocating screentime to all its main characters, and it wasn’t about forming a harem in a fantasy realm since the characters wanted to return home. They weren’t killed and removed from their world, just so they could permanently be...having a jolly time while playing videogames, as is the trend nowadays.The second season lost a lot of the charm of the first since it had basically turned into another power fantasy. The kids were now chosen ones who were coming in and out of the videogame whenever they felt like it, they were having fun in it, and their monsters were at max level. The tension of the first season just wasn’t there anymore. And as it turns out the reboot of the franchise suffers from the exact same issues.A lot of things have changed in those 20 years it took for the reboot to happen. The demand for better animation has skyrocketed, which is why we longer get those awful CGI transformations of the original. Along with it the need for instant gratification also skyrocketed, as people of today lose their interest a lot easier if they don’t get a dopamine fix every few minutes. That means nowadays the pacing has to be a lot faster and there has to be a lot more spectacle in every episode. Something that becomes a huge detriment to characterization and power escalation.The original show was spending a big portion of every episode in showing one of the kids facing a problem in a coming of age way. The ending was reserved for a battle with an enemy monster where you would get a couple of transformations and a few minutes of spectacle. The plot structure was simple, but it was functional in giving you the time to like what is going on. The new version doesn’t do that as it’s rushing to have as much action as possible; meaning it doesn’t give the characters the time to think about what to do next. Heck, it tells them right away that they are special chosen ones. You cannot empathize with them since you don’t feel they are going through important shit. They are messiahs amidst dozens of transformations and special attacks per episode, which makes the whole thing to be hollow spectacle instead of character drama.The power scaling is another issue with the new version. They were rushing to introduce all the different evolutions instead of doing it gradually. As a result, because of their frequency transformations quickly became redundant. More importantly the last evolutions eclipsed the lesser stages very quickly and made them feel like filler, something which wasn’t the case with the original, since over there every new evolution would stick around for a dozen episodes before the next one comes up.Another issue is that in the reboot Taichi and Agumon are always at a far higher level of power than the rest. In the original the kids were at the same level the whole time and thus felt equally important. Over here Taichi monopolizes the action in every final showdown and the rest feel like a bunch of Yamchas waiting for Goku to arrive and save the day with his broken powers. It just makes them to not be important. Even as far as spectacle goes, most of the times they don’t even get the impressive transformations of Agumon. If the very animators don’t care about them, why should you?Along with that, the conflicts don’t feel important either, because they are same-y. Instead of gradually introducing more and more powerful enemies that raise the stakes as the episodes go by, in the reboot you get planet-threatening monsters since episode 1. The writers had the brilliant idea to begin the show with Our War Game, which is the first movie and a major highlight that happened after the end of the first arc. You get god-level Digimon enemies in the freaking pilot episode! There is no room for escalation after that; every other big bad had to be planet-threatening and thus the order they fight them doesn’t matter. Furthermore many of them were supposed to be lieutenants of even bigger bad guys, which didn’t make any sense power-wise because they were all equally powerful.So yeah, as a whole it was hollow spectacle and nowhere near the quality of the original. There were only two minor improvements compared to it, one was the much better visuals (which don’t mean anything if the characters are Yamchas) and the other is the removal of the naughty stuff that were making the original unnecessarily creepy at times. Beyond that I don’t recommend it, stick with the original because retro always wins. having a jolly time while playing videogames, as is the trend nowadays.The second season lost a lot of the charm of the first since it had basically turned into another power fantasy.

So my viewpoint is base on the actual quality of story-telling and characterization for this Digimon reboot.Unlike most people, I can actually easily get pass all of the ""childish element"" of Digimon series (which would bother a lot of teenagers/ adolescent audience and they\'d rate it down because of that ) and go straight into the core theme, the storytelling, and...the characterization of Digimon series. What it means is the childish element will not diminish my value and viewpoint toward a Digimon serie.First off, the pacing of this reboot is way too fast for us to get any emotional investment out of the characters. Compare to the original which the children spend a lot of time going through different scenario of adventure, be it joy, be it sorrow, or even fight and get mad at each other, the bond between the new children seem very weak/ shallow/ forced. The only bond done right so far is the bond between Taichi and Koshirou, which they spent 3 full episodes developing friendship.Secondly , which is my biggest gripe for the serie so far, the catalyst for the digimon partner to shinka is way too weak compare to the old serie, especially for the important iconic shinka of Complete form on the 2 main mcs for the lastest 2 episodes.The complete form shinka is a representation of chosen children\'s mental development throughout the serie, so without enough emotional investment , the shinka itself feels soulless. In the past serie the children went through way more serie of event, as well as revealing more of their mental growth to achieve all those complete form shinka.However, this reboot just feel like they\'re giving out shinka like candy, like every episode need to have 1 shinka so you don\'t get bored. However, all I get from this is a soulless shinka on top of cheap character development.These whole issus all come back to super rushed pacing and plot , which failed to give characters enough screen time to highlight their development. Especially considering how Yamato\'s crest is about ""friendship"", they didn\'t give him enough screen time to justify his friendship shinka.As someone who\'s a big fan of the buildup done by the original Digimon serie and Digimon Universe App monster, can\'t say I wasn\'t disappointed by this Digimon adventure reboot. the characterization of Digimon series.

I know a lot of people have bad experiences with reboots or remakes, but personally I have watched quite a few remakes which were amazing, sometimes better than the original. Some examples I can give are HunterXHunter, Fruits Basket, and Full Metal Alchemist.I had lots of nostalgia with Digimon, so as soon as this new reboot came out, I watched the...first episode without hesitation.The first thing I can say is I like how the characters looked more their age, and the art was great. That's... The only thing good about it in my opinion.I understand the changed story, and some aspects I could put up with if it was just some of the minor things. However they not only changed way too much with the characters and story, but it was MUCH too fast paced!I was only able to watch 1 episode. Reason? Well, let's put it this way.The original series, storyline aside, spend many episodes developing the characters, where they learned to grow, develop, overcame challenges with each other and you got to connect with all the characters and learn each of their stories. It took several episodes for them to gain the strength and determination to push past something, enemies were actually challenging, and you could feel the effort and bond the humans had with their digimon.In the reboot, however, just in the first episode they defeat the enemy, and they are already able to digivolve without any effort. There's no sense of bond, character development; everything is just so rushed and it hardly makes you empathetic to their situation.Out of curiosity, I checked into the series after a few episodes had aired, thinking well, it was only one episode, maybe I jumped the gun.NOPE.By episode 3, they're already able to do a fusion, a certain fusion that took them originally the entire series to achieve, lots of trials, bonds, learning about each other. It's like all this effort it took for them to achieve these forms was just tossed and left up to everyone's imagination. There's no connecting with the characters and learning about how they react in certain circumstances, how they react to those around them, it's just fight fight fight and forget character arcs and having people connect with the characters.I'm sure looking at it from the perspective of someone who didn't watch the original series it's not as bad, I understand that. It seems like it's aimed for younger generations who haven't seen the original, and I can see a lot of younger people like seeing all these digimon and don't care about connecting with the characters. However, from the perspective of an older person, and someone who watched the original, I can say the original is far superior and would recommend watching that over this reboot any day, including to younger generations. first episode without hesitation.The first thing I can say is I like how the characters looked more their age, and the art was great. That's... The only thing good about it in my opinion.I understand the changed story, and some aspects I could put up with if it was just some of the minor things.

Someone must have read my thoughts and now all I can say is you shouldn\'t make an anime based on what an 8yo kid found cool, specially when you can\'t keep up the animation quality of these battles, become less and less imaginative and force all your episodes to have the same predictable structure where the minimum of plot and character exposition feels like a breeze of fresh air,...a very small one by the way, and then you\'re throwed back into a tropical forest full of Kuwagamon and start crying and questioning why someone would do something so cruel. a very small one by the way, and then you\'re throwed back into a tropical forest full of Kuwagamon and start crying and questioning why someone would do something so cruel.', 'Credit where credit is due, the first 25 or so episodes were freaking awesome, but then… the best way i can describe the plot post episode 30 is like if you had a very well drawn map, flushed it down the toilet, and then fished it out of the toilet and tried to read it hoping it won’t get you lost! Well, at least it was pretty to watch and had it’s fun and cute moments, so it’s not like it ruined my childhood, i haven’t finished yet thoughThe mega-digivolutions make no sense! Cool flashy special effects is not gonna make up for good story...telling, and timing, a mega-digivolution is suppost to be special, your last hope at defeating a bad guy that seems impossible to beat, none of the mega-digivolutions made the impact they should’ve, it felt like just another power-up and that’s it.

But, I feel that this only works as a nostalgic series. If you look at it as a new series, by ignoring the original, this remake is terrible. The story is terrible. It has no development and the characters lack that deep connection that we all loved. But... let's go in parts.Taichi is by far the one with most character development. Which is super annoying because they skipped the best parts...from the original. The first time he got scared to death while trying to pass the electrified fence to save Sora. And all his relationship with Hikari. He is the most developed, but at the same time, not remotely enough.Yamato is lacking so much it's sad to even watch him. In the original he was this lone wolf. Which fits with his Digimon. And in this one he was introduced like that but that never stuck. He never had moments with his Harmonica or alone to think.Sora never got her moment with her overprotective mother. As a matter of a fact they've barely shown the character's families. Basically only Yamato's and Takeru's, due to the divorce.Kouchiro is the one that is annoying me the most. In the remake he is a super genius which doesn't even make any sense. They never explained that his notebook doesn't lose battery in the Digital World (at least I don't remember wearing it) and he can hack NASA, he knows exactly what is going on with the ISS and where is it falling and the trajectory without any explanation. They never mentioned Genai as a matter of a fact. Which to me just sucks. He was one of those characters that could explain a lot to the Digi-chosen and help them understand the whole Digital World.As for the remaining characters they are just shells of their original selfs. It's so annoying to see Mimi as this Queen of every little place she sets foot in and basically making subjects. She used to be this spoiled brat and with kinda mean ideas of friendship and beauty. Joe is nothing. He had his moment to shine two episodes back, but even that was so much boring and pointless. He used to be called the leader because everyone could depend on him, they could trust him. And now... he is just there for humor. Takeru and Hikari as just there for the ride. They pretty much add nothing and, there is no point in having them in this. Without them the series would be, pretty much, the same thing. Only their partner Digimon are useful and if you take Frontier's approach their partners are not even required.Now... a couple more things that are really bothering me.1) For some reason the kids have this idea that they should be fighting on top of their partner. And, why? The fights are crazy dangerous. Their partner Digimon gets tossed on the ground from high altitudes and the kids just stay there. It's like there is this magnetic force keeping them in place. This is bothering me so... so much. Specially when AtlurKabuterimon used a spin attack while Koushiro was on top of him. No nausea no nothing. Would be so much better if he stood on the ground or the spin never happened.2) The villains are boring. Basically we've only had one major villain, Devimon. And he was so pointless that if you skip his fighting episodes you can keep watching the series without a problem. No Etemon, no Datamon, no Myotismon, no Dark Masters, nothing. I mean... what is the point of having a series with 66 episodes if you are not going to use them in a useful way? I know the original series had problems too, but come on... at least use the good parts.3) Tailmon is a Champion for no reason what so ever... Not using Myotismon and the way he was scared of the 8th Digi-Destined and how he tortured Tailmon explains why Tailmon is a Champion Level Digimon all the time in the original. And this is completely lacking in the new series. They just ignored it and never explained it. I don't think they will, to be honest. And with this, they won't have the Human World Part of the original series with the Digimon invasion.4) No Tags. Something that is lacking in a lot of series actually. A way for their digimons to evolve that doesn't relay too much on the moment. This is something that is only explained in the Adventure, Adventure 02 and Tamers. Adventure 2020 just makes it so that they can evolve when the plot requires it. And this is super annoying because it removes their search for more power and gadgets and just rely on the relationship with their Digimon. Can you honestly say that in the episode 41 Yamato shouldn't be able to evolve Weregarurumon to Metalgarurumon? I mean... Taichi and Agumon are on that level. Why not them? So is Taichi and Agumon closer than Gabumon and Yamato? I don't think so!! And the way they reach Wargreymon and Metalgarurumon in the original is so much better because they rely on their brotherly connection to their angel Digimons.5) No Warp-Shinka. Again... why? The whole point of Warp was to bypass the Shinka and Shou-Shinka sequences. They have removed the Shinka sequences for everyone except for Agumon and Gabumon, but now even the Warp ones? Why? I see no point in doing this. This means the last episodes will be super slow in pace and they will reach their Mega after a ton of sequences. Which is a problem in the original too. But, if they all reached Mega (as it was hinted in this new series) and they had Warp it would be an amazing moment for the series.6) Armor-Shinka Pegasusmon. I mean... we can already say that Adventure 02 won't be having a remake like this. At least not in the same way. Which is just sad. One of the best series by far. Why not just have Patamon evolve to Angemon? This wouldn't be a problem at all. And the episode would work the same way.But, not everything is terrible. The level of detail in the animation and during fights is breathtaking all the time. I don't think I saw a single fight scene that was lacking. I can see that the animators, producers and directors of this are fans of Digimon Adventure. I just wish the writers were too. And as a fan of the original it is just sad to see this level of animation in a story as terrible as this one. And the songs are slowly growing on me. I feel they could be better or they should have more insert songs, maybe one for each character, but... they are pretty good. The way they showed the Digi-Destined getting into the Digital World was another thing that I really liked. It was something that the original was seriously lacking. But, since they all came from different locations in the Digital World there was no reason for Takeru and Hikari to stay behind. I guess this is a positive and a negative for the remake. from the original. The first time he got scared to death while trying to pass the electrified fence to save Sora.

Reused animations to pad episodes, extremely slow plot that had to rely on the same formula, and altogether a great show for children, but didn\'t offer much in the way of depth.By contrast, this version is a lot better. They cut digivolution animations to fit more dialogue and plot into the episodes. They don\'t rely on the same animations for attacks, making battles a lot more interesting to watch. The characters seem to have been perfected, no longer changing personalities depending on...the plot, but are instead likeable and relatable. All of this with a fresh coat of paint and a something for digimon fans to be hopeful for after the disappointment of other Adventure sequels.The show isn\'t without its faults however. Two big ones stand out.The music is good, but doesn\'t hold a candle to the original soundtracks. I understand why it needed to change, as the flagship song ""butterfly"" was sang by the late Wada Koujo, and putting his music to this new story may be in bad taste.Also the first 3 episodes are a very poor retelling of ""our war game"", complete with an inexplicable omegamon digivolution. This is worrying, not because it spoils an end-game digivolution level, but because digivolution has always been linked to character growth. I worry that all other digivolution will feel lackluster and distract from the character growth that triggered it, but I am happy to be proven wrong in time. As for the retold story itself, as these characters are new, to both the viewer and eachother, it loses an awful lot of emotional attachment that the original drew on so well.Its worth noting that those 3 episodes act almost as a separate story entirely and only serve to introduce 2 of the 8 main characters to digimon. In that respect it could be likened more to the digimon adventure ""episode 0"" story, except with plot points from ""outlr war game"". Either way, it\'s a messy introduction that could have been done better.These issues aside, the show has many more positives than negatives, and if it\'s able to maintain this quality, I will be happy to rank it above all other digimon anime. the plot, but are instead likeable and relatable.

Like many others who had stuck it through the Tri movies, Toei\'s lackluster attempts to create compelling characters and a coherent story had me wondering if they could even manage it. Unfortunately, going by the first three episode rule, they failed. Horribly. From here on out, spoilers.Episode 1:It opens on a note-for-note ""re-imagining"" of ""Our War Game"" (a movie which came second in their Digimon movie catalogue and acted as the second act for the American Dub\'s movie). Okay, that\'s fine. The issue is, they rush...through establishing character dynamics before the second episode. Koshiro is the tech guy/info-dump guy. Taichi is the brave, headstrong guy. Also, it seems like they saw Project Mouthwash\'s Tri Abridged series, because they have Taichi utilize Digimon as an improvised weapon multiple times. Yikes.Episode 2:The fight animations are great in these first couple episodes. Unfortunately, having blown their load on establishing the status quo, there is no longer anything for the kids to do aside slog along towards the end of Our War Game. Yamato is the lone-wolf (another dynamic established). Toei decides to up the ante by giving us an unwinnable situation, and then throws Omegamon at the situation. Two episodes in, and we\'re already at the endgame evolution. Not looking good.Episode 3:We\'re going to summer camp and then... back home. In a move that only JJ Abrams would be proud of, our expectations for the story to mimic the original series is wholly subverted. Rather, the story forces the kids to head to the digital world when a blackout starts spreading in Tokyo.Episode 4:The opening shot is a recreation of when everyone arrives on the island in Jurassic Park. I shit you not. This is what peak anime performance has become.Episode 5:Piyomon learns to FLY LIKE AN EEEAAAGLE! Also, inconsistencies in size ratios and animation. Also, also, Taichi is apparently a fully-fledged carpenter. A student of the Tom Paris School of Savants, I see.Episode 6:If you made it this far, stop. Some shit about destiny. I guess Homeostasis is speaking, but we\'re never given any real indication who it might be. We get a ""mysterious"" Digimon at the end of the episode who gives orders to Ogremon. Except we know who it is, even if you haven\'t seen the original series. At the very least, he looks like he learned from what happened in the original series and decided to put some hours in at the gym. Dude looks swoll af.The problems with the remake series aren\'t just at pacing, although that is one of the most egregious ones. No, the issue is that, even putting aside the issues with pacing, there is absolutely no redeeming factor. The digivolutions get an absolutely generic rock composition meant to hype the viewer, but it fails where Brave Heart worked. Brave Heart was an escalation of emotion coupled with the sensation of feeling like we were watching the power of courage push through adversity. This generic rock shit is just lots of yelling into microphone and some bad instrumentation.Honestly, if you want your fill of a GOOD Digimon  series, go back and watch Adventure and Tamers. Maybe watch Xros Wars, but don\'t because that\'s a mistake nobody should make twice. Either way, give this remake a skip. through establishing character dynamics before the second episode.

Either way, give this remake a skip.', 'Disclaimer: This review will predominately be making comparisons between this anime to its alternative counterpart (Digimon Adventure 1999). Furthermore, the comparison to the counterpart series will be based on memories when watching it - though it was around 2006. From this moment onwards I will refer to the counterpart series as the ""1999 series"".Story: I will separate this into two parts. The first part is the difference between the 1999 and 2020 series in terms of the presentation of the story and the second part discusses the similarities/difference of the story structure between the two series.A definite difference to its 1999 series where instead of...characters being the focal point of the story it really focuses on the lore and plot of the story - or you can say it focuses more on the world-building than anything. This can be observed where the main characters you meet early on in the 2020 series have pretty much fully developed personalities and traits that any further focus on them will just highlight the same personality and traits they already had since our first introduction to them. Therefore, the remaining episodes focus on the story, world-building, and lore on the Digiworld and its inhabitants along with its connection to humanity. Of course, if we take into account that the anime was designed for a younger audience then the reasoning above may be attributed to this as well. Since it is much easier to follow the story with easy-to-understand characters rather than the other way round where the story gets paused because the characters have to go through a soul-searching montage. However, a larger component that probably makes this series different from its 1999 series was probably how much lore it has developed since then. It is easier to understand this by comparing it to Yu-gi-oh or similar children\'s shows where it starts getting better as the show gets longer (in the case for Yu-gi-oh the rules for dueling was only established when GX started and all of Yu-gi-oh was experimenting with new and more ways of playing the various card types they had, so GX started playing around archetypes e.g. Hero-type decks, Dragon-type decks. Afterward, the rest of the spin-off series started experimenting on newer and more interesting summoning methods along with newer monster archetypes). For Digimon it got a larger library of the various digital monsters as well as their evolutionary line along with the lore of the role for each digimon - this was reflected in the 6 part movies for digimon. Therefore, the 2020 series being a reboot for the 1999 series it makes sense that the developers would want to take full advantage of all the knowledge and lore they have expanded for the last 20 years and make use of it. As a result, we have more information for the Digiworld and its connection to the digidestined in exchange for the character development for all of the characters.There are similarities and differences between the two series and these differences stem from (previously mentioned) the focus on the lore and world-building rather than the characters. The 1999 series uses exploration of the Digiworld as a medium to enable the characters to interact with each other and learn about themselves thus we can see a lot of character development. However, the 2020 series used exploration for the sake of exploring more about the Digiworld. This is not a bad idea and in fact, the 2020 series does a better job of making the Digiworld more interesting and fun with its mysteries as well. In addition, the characters with their established personalities and a common goal they can settle their differences much quicker in the early part of the series to achieve their common goal. However, both use a similar story structure; 1) exploring the Digiworld for information, 2) encountering friends and enemies to reach the initial evil, 3) defeating said initial evil, 4) understanding the bigger picture and bigger evil, 5) further exploration in the Digiworld for more information on the bigger evil, and 6) defeating said bigger evil. This works for the 1999 series since steps 4 and 5 heavily rely on the exploration for character development but the 2020 series use of steps 4 and 5 has a weaker impact compared to the 1999 version. The 2020 series does have a reason for understanding the bigger picture and the bigger evil along with the exploration but you can argue that at least 10 of those episodes can be placed in step 2 so (overall) it has a weaker impact on the story.Art and Sound: Art is bold and colourful with a similar style to the 1999 series. The sound/music was good and it definitely felt a more modern version of the Digmon adventures. Of course, I prefer the 1999 series\' music and soundtracks but I have to admit that the 2020 series does have its own unique style that does not pale to the older version. Although, I will say the ED theme songs for the 2020 version are very catchy and definitely capture the spirit of being a child.Character: I believe this may be the key factor that might have split the Digimon fan base community a little bit. Like I have mentioned in the story section the 1999 series was good (for many viewers) because of the character development between all the characters. The main plot point was that each character was placed a specific personality trait that they have yet developed or already displayed but were not aware of it. This required each character to come to terms with this revelation and to understand this was (predominately) their core personality. In addition, this required the others to come to terms with the other\'s personality traits as well since they all had to work together. However, the 2020 series does not try to focus on this aspect since they made it clear near the beginning what each character\'s personality traits when seeing them for the first time and this gets highlighted more as the series goes on so it makes it more clear that this is their core personality. The major difference for this is that the starting point between each character is different in the 2020 series compared to the 1999 series. In the 1999 series, all of the characters were ""isekaied"" to the Digiworld at the same time so everyone had to individually cope not only with each other but with the new world they were in as well. This obviously leads to character interaction and development where their personalities become a large theme throughout the whole series. However, the 2020 series has each character isekaied to the Digiworld at different times where one of the characters stumbles the other who has already lived/stayed in the Digiworld without knowing how long they have stayed there. As a result, you can argue that each character has already done the initial hurdle of coping with the Digiworld so the only thing they need to do is to interact with the other characters - which only takes around 10 episodes or so. Thus, the series sometimes have the ""episode of the week"" feel to it since there is not much to focus on. Furthermore, the villains the characters go against are less impactful in the 2020 version compared to the 1999 version for the same reason that the theme between the two is different. The villain used in the 1999 series focuses on the characters\' personality traits and (to a larger extent) all of humanity to symbolise its strength and defeat whereas the 2020 villain was more or less a concept that so happens to endanger humanity and just gets stronger. However, lore-wise the 2020 series makes sense (in my opinion) compared to the 1999 series where it was more impactful. In the end, I cannot say which one is better but I can see where the strengths and weaknesses lie in either of them.Overall: The 2020 series definitely has a more modernised style to it with a more focus on lore and world-building than the character development. This makes the story more straightforward and easier to follow with little room to doubt that the characters will have a falling out. However, this does make it less interesting since the 1999 series provides a larger impact from the characters falling out and reconciling with each other providing a stronger bond between them. In my opinion, if you were to ask me which one to watch, I will say watch: the 1999 series for context on the characters and impact of each character\'s personality; alternatively watch the 2020 series first for a general understanding between the connection of the Digiworld and humanity along with a more up to date version of Digimon lore. Both have their ups and downs and I will say I enjoyed both of them with their own unique styles. Keep in mind that this is based on the assumption that the show was meant for a younger audience to watch so I am not going to be super critical on which one is better than the other. characters being the focal point of the story it really focuses on the lore and plot of the story - or you can say it focuses more on the world-building than anything. This can be observed where the main characters you meet early on in the 2020 series have pretty much fully developed personalities and traits that any further focus on them will just highlight the same personality and traits they already had since our first introduction to them. Therefore, the remaining episodes focus on the story, world-building, and lore on the Digiworld and its inhabitants along with its connection to humanity. Of course, if we take into account that the anime was designed for a younger audience then the reasoning above may be attributed to this as well. Since it is much easier to follow the story with easy-to-understand characters rather than the other way round where the story gets paused because the characters have to go through a soul-searching montage. However, a larger component that probably makes this series different from its 1999 series was probably how much lore it has developed since then. It is easier to understand this by comparing it to Yu-gi-oh or similar children\'s shows where it starts getting better as the show gets longer (in the case for Yu-gi-oh the rules for dueling was only established when GX started and all of Yu-gi-oh was experimenting with new and more ways of playing the various card types they had, so GX started playing around archetypes e.g. Hero-type decks, Dragon-type decks. Afterward, the rest of the spin-off series started experimenting on newer and more interesting summoning methods along with newer monster archetypes). For Digimon it got a larger library of the various digital monsters as well as their evolutionary line along with the lore of the role for each digimon - this was reflected in the 6 part movies for digimon. Therefore, the 2020 series being a reboot for the 1999 series it makes sense that the developers would want to take full advantage of all the knowledge and lore they have expanded for the last 20 years and make use of it. As a result, we have more information for the Digiworld and its connection to the digidestined in exchange for the character development for all of the characters.There are similarities and differences between the two series and these differences stem from (previously mentioned) the focus on the lore and world-building rather than the characters. The 1999 series uses exploration of the Digiworld as a medium to enable the characters to interact with each other and learn about themselves thus we can see a lot of character development. However, the 2020 series used exploration for the sake of exploring more about the Digiworld. This is not a bad idea and in fact, the 2020 series does a better job of making the Digiworld more interesting and fun with its mysteries as well. In addition, the characters with their established personalities and a common goal they can settle their differences much quicker in the early part of the series to achieve their common goal.

However, I tried my best to give my review from a new view point.Firstly, the story. tbh the plot of digimon 2020 is not that good, its quite mediocre and even a bit weak, its like u can see the reason behind most of the fight, maybe this is due to the length of the anime, but it quite ruin the mood.moreover, the character seems always full energy even after several fights they can just keep going without rest which makes me feel quite unrealistic. not only that, when they...get hit by attack from other stronger enemy, the most damage done to them r just some bruise or the digimon devolve. which is also quite unrealistic. (in other digimon series when the mc's digimon get hurt badly they also risk get killed) however, in digimon 2020 the plot armor is thicc as hell.the last downside of this series that i would like to mention is the relationship between the kids and the digimon. unlike the other series that the kids and digimon slowly form a bond between them, in digimon 2020 the digimons r just simp for the kids for no reason (not sure is simp is the right terms but it just be too friendly and too protective which feel kinda weird since they were just met)lets talk about some good side of this series. the animation and music for the evolution is just top notch. its been a while that i get hype when digivolve, especially wargreymon evolution. it is so hype.furthermore, i can sense the effort of the team that try to make this a nice reboot. they really tried their best of creating new plot and new direction.However as i said the plot is still weak. So, its a 7/10.Is it worth to watch? yes! but dont have too much expectation for it. just take it as a nice reboot and you will enjoy it. get hit by attack from other stronger enemy, the most damage done to them r just some bruise or the digimon devolve. which is also quite unrealistic.

I was expecting it to be just a retelling of the same story, but I was wrong, not that that is a bad thing, though. I do like that they brought back some of the older seiyuu for some of the supporting characters, like how they had Neemon voiced by Kikuchi Masami (why couldn\'t they have him back to voice Jou? :-P).I will give credit for them trying something different as far as story and such goes. It\'s interesting showing how these Digimon partners are for...this version, and them having to somewhat revive old memories. This is about the only thing I can fully praise this series on. Oh, it is also cool that there are alternate evolutions, so I\'ll give them credit for that as well. Art is okay (although there are times where you can tell that they didn\'t have the budget), I suppose and the music is okay too. Now, on to what I have an issue with and why I prefer stuff that\'s in the 1999 series.The pacing of this series is a big let down. It\'s too fast-paced. Time the characters finish up with one thing, they\'re off to doing something else without time to reflect on the events. This is an issue with most modern shows, movies, and media in general. It\'s a go go go attitude and things just happen. Like the situation with Takeru and how he just showed up in the Digital World and all the junk surrounding that. It also feels like there is no real story....stuff just happens. No real build up.  Thirty-something episodes in, and I still feel as if I don\'t know what the real story is so far. As mentioned, we know that the partner-Digimon have pasts and memories need to be returned to them to recall that stuff, but that\'s about it.The defying of physics and how these kids should\'ve been killed by now. I hate the fact that the kids ride on their partners while they are using attacks that should harm or kill them too.  For instance, Taichi was riding on MetalGreymon and a fire attack was used against MetalGreymon, but no...he wasn\'t burnt to a crisp from being on something partially metal that should\'ve heated up like a magnifying glass harnessing light from the sun and burning the ground. Sora riding on Birdramon while she\'s using Meteor Wing...nope, she didn\'t die from that. It\'s ridiculous! I know this is a fictional show, but it seems that for the old show, the Digimon prioritized the safety of their partners. They would never use such attacks or fight with their partners right there. It just really bugs me that this is what they do now.I hate the fact that these kids *never* have issues with hunger or energy. The same goes for their partners.  I know this is a fictional show, but despite it being about monsters and such, the original version was partially grounded in reality. The Digimon constantly being able to evolve all easily to higher forms and then devolve and still be ready to fight again...no way! What happened to having stakes? These kids never feel like they\'re in danger or have any real issues being in the Digital World.  So yeah...this is bothersome that they never focus on that or even have an inkling of it. It\'s go go go! No time to worry about a meal or our Digimon partners needing food to replenish their strength! We have another fight to get to!  Stakes? What are those? -_-Other issue, characterization and character development! IMO, Mimi is the most interesting of the group. It\'s also interesting to see that for this iteration her character is rich. Anyway, the character development is non-existent practically. All of the characters come across as flat. They all were taken to the Digital World in some way, but no one seems to actually react to it. Older series, the kids acted more human. ""What are we going to do? How will we get back?  Should we look around?""  Stuff like that, which is a realistic reaction if forced to a place you\'ve never been before.  Since this series has that go go go attitude, the character development is suffering too. For the most part, none of these evolutions feel earned...\'minus Mimi, imo. The evolution from Togemon to Lilymon actually felt like a genuine earned evolution. All the others just feel like, ""OH, we need them to evolve...do it!""  We aren\'t getting to know the characters that well, I feel and because of this, it\'s difficult to get attached to any of them.  There hasn\'t been any reflection or internal struggles for them because the plot is moving so fast, they don\'t have time to show that.I give this series as a whole a 4.5 out of 10.

I will try to keep this review spoiler-free, in case those reading wanna know whether or not to give this a shot.All in all, its a mess. If you already watched the original Adventure and other Digimon seasons and wonder if you should also dip into this one: My only answer to this is - only if you like non-stop, brainless Taichi & Agumon Screentime and action and nothing else.Other characters are barely given any screentime, and if it does, it is executed in a way that makes you seriously question why these characters are even in this show at all.Characters...like Mimi, Joe or Sora get extremely sidelined in favor of more Agumon & Taichi, ultimately portraying the other members as pathetic cannon fodder if anything else. The animation is only subpar, even fights are often not animated with enough care. Sounddesign is ok, the evolution songs are really good, so if you are into Digimon OST, you should definitely listen to it seperately, if interested.A plot is not really given, most episodes, especially in the latter half of the show, are just brainless filler that can be easily skipped without you noticing that you might have missed anything.In conclusion, if you are looking for something on par with the other Digimon seasons or at least something with some kind of sense and direction, this anime isnt for you. I'd rather recommend you to turn to the older seasons of Digimon, if you want to get some Digimon experience again. like Mimi, Joe or Sora get extremely sidelined in favor of more Agumon & Taichi, ultimately portraying the other members as pathetic cannon fodder if anything else.

Sounddesign is ok, the evolution songs are really good, so if you are into Digimon OST, you should definitely listen to it seperately, if interested.A plot is not really given, most episodes, especially in the latter half of the show, are just brainless filler that can be easily skipped without you noticing that you might have missed anything.In conclusion, if you are looking for something on par with the other Digimon seasons or at least something with some kind of sense and direction, this anime isnt for you. I'd rather recommend you to turn to the older seasons of Digimon, if you want to get some Digimon experience again."", 'This anime is a reimagining of the 1999 original series, giving our beloved Digiverse a new origin story, starting off with how the crests come up.This is a TL; DR at the end of this thing if you prefer a quick summary.I was in primary school when Digimon Adventure (the original from 1999) came to this world and since then I\'ve been hooked. I\'ve watched every single show, movie, OVA, special of this entire franchise. When this remake was announced, I was super excited. I thought I would feel like a kid again and be amazed by the visuals. Boy, was I wrong!...Visuals:1)they\'re terrible. Sloppy and inconsistent. To exemplify, there\'s a fight on the 10th episode and it literally felt like I was watching a slideshow.2) Weregarurumon has been my favourite Digimon since 1999 but for some reason that I can\'t quite explain I hate his new design and his digivolutionsequence was also a major downgrade compared to the original3) Garudamon looks perfect4) Zudomon looks freaking adorable!!!!!5) Digimon size in this series does not follow the same rules as the other ones; one of the major examples of this is WarGreymon6) Wargreymon digivolution was amazing7) Goddramon and Holydramon are the uggliest Digivolutions I\'ve ever seen.8) Garudamon looks so much more badass than Houhoumon. I\'m thrilled about the idea of giving new digivolutions to everyone except Taichiand Yamato but good lord, make them look awesome!Sound:1) no iconic Brave Heart song. If you want to cash in on nostalgia, the dumbest decision they made was to not include this legendary song that has been a Digimon icon throughout the decades2) really dislike the narrator\'s voice in this one3) don\'t agree and can\'t understand the decision of hiring a different cast that has been voicing these characters for 20 years. They\'re alive and they\'re still working.4) 8th episode: Garurumon howls and it\'s plainful to anyone\'s eardrums5) sometimes there\'s dialog but the characters\' mouth movement is delayed, which shouldn\'t happen everStory and characters:1) as stated in the beginning of this review, this is re-imagining of the original story so expect plenty to be and feel different2) although we get to see a Digital world in the first two episodes, the “real” Digital World (where Digimon exist) only makes an appearance by the 3rd episode3) early dialog between Taichi and Yamato is cringe as can be4) On the 2nd episode, we go from actual Garurumon and Greymon to freaking Omegamon/Omnimon (whichever name you prefer). This was the first piece of evidence that the pacing for this ""remake"" would be constantly all over the place5) Sora\'s introduction to the Digital World and the way that her bond with Piyomon is formed was terriby done6) when I was 7 years old, back when Digimon Adventure from 1999 introduced itself to the world, Gomamon was my least favourite. Why? Well,his design didn\'t look “cool enough” to me and his human was a boring kid. As I grew up and rewatched the entire Digimon series, I realize that Gomamon is the best digimon in the entire franchise and Joe is a worthless piece of selfish trash. He\'s trapped in a foreign environment, he\'s informed that his planet/city is facing a very serious crisis... and his concerns are to study???????? And anyone that says “he\'s not that bad because he wants to be a doctor”, listen: his motivation to become a doctor isn\'t even the right one (helping, healing people). He\'s just concerned about his family reputation. Screw that sunovabitch! Gomamon deserved a much better partner. Seriously... your house is on fire and instead of worrying about that, instead you go shopping because you\'re also out of milk at home. Long story short: I hate Joe and I want to punch him. Yes, I am aware it\'s a 2D fictional character but this rage has been building inside me for over a decade7) I hate how the digivolution scenes are shown randomly: I\'d rather have equal treatment between all digimon characters and not random ones showneach episode. Either show them all or none at all. Also... Greymon always gets his digivolution shown. ALWAYS.8) 10th episode – MetalGreymon\'s digivolution sequence was non-existent and since it was its first appearance in this “remake”, it was disappointing asheck9) the OP and ED are major spoilers for those experiencing the Digimon World for the first time10) too many episodes revolver around Taichi & Yamato bs drama and when that\'s over... WELCOME TO THE TAICHI & AGUMON SHOW11)  39th episode - Joe literally grabbed Zudomon\'s hammer to atack another evolved Digimon and succeeded in defeating it. I\'m sorry, what?!If Joe is so powerful, why isn\'t he smacking every bad Digimon around like he aparently could?! -.-\'12) To give you another idea about the absolute awful pacing of this new version of Digimon Adventure, by the 40th episode we get randomfiller-type episodes. While the real world is going into chaos, our Digicast is enjoying their time in a Digirestaurant, playing soccer, etc... If thiswas the beginning of the show, perfect! They\'re bonding with eachother and their digimon but literally in the middle of a disaster and no senseof direction, purpose or even urgency to their journey?! Ridiculous.13) Taichi & Agumon get so much more screentime than the rest of the cast that it\'s even worse compared to the original 1999 series. And to make things even more ridiculous, Wargreymon appears on the 24th episode. MetalGarurumon only on the 45th episode. This should\'ve been named DigiTaichi Adventure or something to fully reflect what it\'s about. During the last 3rd of the season, Taichi keeps teleporting himself all over the place. To explain this: Joe and Mimi are on complete opposites of the map. Taichi will show up on both episodes without the rest of the cast progressing anywhere.14) The final 3 episodes end the show abruptly without a logic build up to it and the ending sucks so bad... They only show... Taichi after the final showdownTL;DR: 1st episode was awesome, everything else sucked. No brave heart song, DigiTaichi & Agumon Adventure 90% of the time, terrible animation, not many cool design choices, no consistency with Digimon lore and the pacing was the worst pacing I\'ve seen in a very long timeThis version of the original 1999 season didn\'t make me hate Digimon as a franchise but I sure as hell wish this version didn\'t exist. If you\'re new to the Digimon franchise, skip this one and watch the original.It\'s a 5/10. Visuals:1)they\'re terrible. Sloppy and inconsistent.

If you\'re new to the Digimon franchise, skip this one and watch the original.It\'s a 5/10.', ""I grew up to the original Adventure series and I was expecting a semi-trash reboot but this out better than I thought they are taking time in introducing each character and bring hype to each Digimon and chosen childbut I'm sad they didn't use Butterfly and Brave Heart just for the nostalgic feeling but is fine, is a reboot not a remakeBut the evolutions are going too fast less than 10 eps in we already have Ultimate and a Mega, with not much strong story/ reason for the Digimon to get level so quickly and so early but I do glad there some upgrades to...the evolution formIs turning out great so far, story is great and I'm just glad they didn't throw all 7 children to the Digi-World all at once and mix it the real world adventure as well the evolution formIs turning out great so far, story is great and I'm just glad they didn't throw all 7 children to the Digi-World all at once and mix it the real world adventure as well"", 'You know that feeling when you\'re driving and notice a car crash on the side of the road, and as you pass by you slow down and turn your head unconsciously to catch a glimpse of a dead body lying on the ground ? Well, that sum up my experience with this reboot.(some spoilers in the ""story"" part, go to the tl;dr if you wish to avoid them)Story: I\'ll do a parallel with the original show.In the original show (OS), 7 tennagers friends (more or less I concede to you) are sucked up into a digital world where they meet their digi companions, and they...go to explore their surrounding altogethers in search of answers and a way to get back home.In the reboot (R) theses 7 teenagers don\'t know each others, some even never spoke to their digimates. And they aren\'t surprised nor scared about digimons, as if it was perfectly normal. And they go on a walk in the forest, looking for a way to get back home, or cool looking fruits, whatever it\'s all perfectly normal and there\'s no reason to be worried at all.OS, a really evil digimon appears and try to split them up, scare them, hurt them, kill them, aside working on a global domination plan. after being separated, facing trials and terrible dangers while learning more about the digiworld, and becoming stronger aswell as their digicompanions, they are ultimately reunited to face the big boss but soon learn it\'s only the beginning of their journey.R, they roam around without a clear goal, sometime they talk to each others, no real trials, no bonding with their digicompanions, but the really evil digimon is now a treat to mankind, as he manage to affect the real world in a terrible way: a power outage in Tokyo. A few blocs, at best. The teenagers destroy a big bad digimon and tadam, the world is saved.OS, they go through an ocean to meet their destiny, training themselves to the limit and realising they can effectively die in this world as well as in the real one. This strenghten their bond with their digicompanions and their friends, as they walk together toward an ennemie far more dangerous than the previous one.R, walk in the wood, befriend some useless digimon we\'ll never see ever again, oh no another treat to mankind: GPS failure, the super tankers are going full speed into each others (no they can\'t change direction, no they can\'t shut down their engine, well yes they could but they won\'t because that\'s why). How will the digidestined save us all ? Find big bad digimon, blast off big bad digimon, world saved, let\'s go for a walk in the forest or a night at the onsen. Oh btw, you can\'t die in the digiworld, Takeru and his friends take full blasts for mega digimons and get out of the smoke without a scratch, several time, in 67 episodes they have never ever been at least slighty wounded nor scared while facing a treat.OS, another evil digimon mastermind appear, able to open a portal toward the real world, he can and will invade and conquer the whole planet with an army of terrible creatures. Only the teenagers can do something to prevent that, but they\'ll have to learn, fight, train, and become stronger togethers.R, oh no a space station is desorbiting and will crash onto Tokyo in a few minutes. Big bad digimon, boom headshot, we\'re all safe now. What, the space station ? Meh, it crash into Tokyo\'s bay with a big splash and people livestream it with their phones. I\'m not kidding, this is litteraly what happen. At this point you should understand my rating.OS, fast forward to the end, after lot of trials, difficults time, friendship lessons, and after they learn to use their true power, the teenagers go at war agaisnt the ""elite 4"" of the digiworld. Mankind is once again endangered (for real), and the victory of our friends isn\'t guaranted at all.R, the big bad very big very bad evil digimon which has been teased as the final boss all over the show is awaken, let\'s kick his ass in half an episode then go have a cheesburger at McDonald\'s. No I\'m not joking, I wish I was but I\'m not, this is a real thing. Oh btw there\'s another very big very bad evil digimon far more powerfull, somewhere, perhaps you\'ll find him if you roam around helping random digimon clean up their garbages or play a racing minigame ? Again not joking.OS, finaly the ultimate fight, the last effort, the end of the journey, the victory of the light over the darkness. A splendide final to this amazing adventure.R, if you saw the first Digimon Movie with Diablomon/Diaboromon, you saw the next fight aswell. And don\'t expect a good conclusion, according to the animation during the last fight they were already out of budget and couldn\'t afford a scenarist to end the show.tl;dr: The original show was showing a group of friends on a journey in a wonderful yet dangerous world, the further they go into it the stronger they get and together they save the world. The reboot show a group of teenagers with 0 background and low to no personnality as they do random stuf wandering across the land in search (more or less) of their destiny. Take your average 12ep slice of life ecchi highschool seasonal anime, add dinosaurs remove the ecchi  and stretch it over 67 episodes, and voila.Art: to be fair it\'s not bad. The original art style is here, the characters and the digimons are almost identicals to their originals counterparts, and the animation is (most of the time) fairly well made. Some digimon received a visual look.. different.. from the original, but it\'s a reboot and as long as we recognize them easily I won\'t say a thing about it. Tbh it even had me burst of laughter as some of their looks are really ""interresting"". The graphism are either fairly good or low-tiers seasonnal slice of life, sometime you get a grandiose panorama or a well made battle scene, sometime you get a poor background with some touch of colors here and there to not make it feel like it was completly rushed. 50/50 I\'d say.A bad point for the ending however. If most of the fights were well animated, the very last one had a DragonBall Super feeling if you know what I mean. The digivolutions however are cool, differents from the originals but they keep the same style and add some nice details. Sadly only Agumon and Gabumon really take profit from it, it would\'ve been nice to see all the digimon go full power with the same style.Sound: nothing to say, generic slice of life music, generic shonen music, and some erzatz of rock, the original was overwhelmingly superior but you know what they said about music tastes. Please don\'t take it in account as it\'s really my personnal tastes, I just wanted to be exhaustive in my review.Characters: what characters ? I still don\'t know anything about them. In the OS we learned to know them as they were learning to know themselves, accept their mistakes and errors, and grow up. In the reboot they don\'t change at all from ep1 to ep67, mostly because they haven\'t faced any obstacle that forced them to adapt and grow up. There is no death, no wounds, no loss, and the few ""real"" menaces they encounters are far away from them. Also no backstory and no usefull interaction between them or the digimons they meet along the way. It\'s the same way of thinking, the same convictions, the same behavior over and over again. is it that hard to put a teenager at risk so he can face his fears and become stronger ? I mean there\'s countless mangas and anime about that, brillants or not at least they have what lack to the character\'s developpement of this reboot: a character\'s developpement.Enjoyment: a bunch of characters you don\'t care about who can\'t be harmed in any way and doesn\'t change a bit in 67 episodes. I won\'t say there was no good moments at all, but honestly it\'s like watching an old sitcom without the laughtrack, nothing important happen and if it does nothing change afterward. Boring, bland, annoying, at least it helped me going to bed as I had no more motivation to do anything else after watching my weekly episode.Overall: let\'s be concise here. The story is a giant teaser to a massive treat that last only for a few minutes and doesn\'t feel like a real treat at all. The art is mostly close to the OS in terms of design, with modern animation, but goes from good to meh/bad between two camera angles. The OST is correct, I personnaly don\'t like it but it\'s really subjective (original OST masterrace). The characters are a bunch of immortals empty shells with no personnality who doesn\'t change at all through the show (I repeat myself about that but clearly this is the biggest problem of this show by far, with a good characters writing I probably would\'ve gave it a 5 or even a 6). The enjoyment was inexistant beside some funny moments, not because their were made to be funny but because they were ridiculous to the point of making you question if it\'s not a school project they mistook for the real show.In one single sentence, this reboot is an insult to the original show, a slap in the face of digimon\'s lovers, and a complete failure as an anime of it\'s own. go to explore their surrounding altogethers in search of answers and a way to get back home.In the reboot (R) theses 7 teenagers don\'t know each others, some even never spoke to their digimates.

I watched almost every single TV show, including tri. I didn\'t yet watch Xros Wars and Applimon series, but I am up to date with Ghost Game. I had different opinions on different series. There were series I didn\'t like and those that I adore. Despite those, every one of them had both good and bad sides. There is no flawless series, neither there is series that is completely bad... Or is it?As a big fan of Digimon, whose favorite series is original Adventure (it\'s both my favorite Digimon and ex aequo...favorite anime with Slayers) I was really interested and curious about it. I was hyping, but I knew that I have to hold my horses until I actually see the show. So it happened - I watched the whole Adventure:. And it\'s really not something I would like to see. Both, because it profanes the amazing Digimon Adventure and because it\'s just bad. As I said, I had Digimon series that I didn\'t quite like, but I seen good sides that didn\'t made it that bad and I quite enjoyed them. But I can\'t enjoy cheap story with no character development and no plot whatsoever. But let\'s explain things a bit...I didn\'t really expect it to be something extraordinary, but the show has many serious issues. Pace was totally destroyed, the strongest character just appeared in 3rd episode and there was really big threat to the whole Earth by that time. Imagine 67 episodes long show, where 3rd episode has already escalated to some titan fight level. This is what happened there. Meanwhile in original show, in third episode kids were lost in who knows where and they didn\'t know what to do. They desperately tried to contact their homes but they just didn\'t know what happened. In reboot... one character just had all the informations at hand. Literally - in smartphone. He could just ""google"" the answer, or rather chat with no-names about what\'s going on. Like... Internauts. Yes, he was informed by random people from Internet. It\'s not end of the problems. While original adventure set the plot around finding what they had to do and why they are here, here, in reboot they had all the answers on silver plate. The show failed to provide real threat and story whatsoever. Compare it to original, where kids had real life issues, that were linked to their special traits and the bond with their digimon partners were the key. And while I am saying the problems were real, it were real. It was about their own past, life, relationship with family and digimons, as well as them evolving, changing into better themselves. This didn\'t happen at all in reboot. Actually they just removed any personality issues completely. And while some of the character did have similar traits like not being to confident or being too selfish, it didn\'t provide the problem to their story progress. Plot in original Digimon Adventure really was orbiting around the kids. Everything they did was to understand why they have those traits assigned to them and how to find it. Not everyone was happy with their traits too. And the human-digimon bond was deeper with more relationship issues, that also originated with their traits and their real life problems. All was about the kids, the change, personalities. It just wasn\'t there for the reboot. Like they had some simple traits, but it didn\'t provide any story-related things. For example, relationship between them in original was not always perfect. Sometimes it was negative. Sometimes they mocked each other, sometimes they didn\'t trust them... but sometimes they were loyal to the end. Their bond wasn\'t just made in an instant. It was changing and finally they established big friendship and love. This was something I didn\'t see in the rebooted version of the show.Plot in the Adventure: is just not there. They had learned about the threat and that they have to defeat it, because it\'s bad, but... that\'s it. They just fight with random monsters, defeat them, then at the end they fight big boss, struggle, but ""miracle moment"" happens and they defeat it. But there was nothing more than that. Okay, there were some moments that You can say were good. But basically story itself was... just poor. I missed the threat of main villains. They weren\'t just bad guys that do bad stuff with bad power. In original it was about what they did and how they did that, not how powerful or ""evil"" they were. In original show You could feel the threat. They were constantly attacked and threatened to death. Big bad guys weren\'t just there to appear at the end of the show. They were very active villains that were attacking kids directly or sometimes via minions. But all of it was their doing, not just random enemy attacking. While in the reboot... they got the prophecy about bad guy that appeared almost at the end. Before that there was another bad guy, that was a bit deeper in personality. And there was a third one that appeared at the very end, unannounced before. Their motives were just ""I am evil, so I evil"", meanwhile in original show they did all those things for different reasons. It\'s like comparing an evil guy that likes to see people suffer with a guy that just destroys everything, because he is a destroyer. Nothing else is needed. I really couldn\'t feel a threat from those villains in 2020 version, because they were just bigger, stronger variants of any other digimon. And if we are here... all the other enemies were just random digimons that appeared. They weren\'t directly minions or anything like that. They were just attacked by wild digimons.So, we know there is no story, no threat and no character development. Is it that bad? Umm... no. It\'s 4/10 afterall, there are some elements that were better. Specifically visual style. I hate when reboot, remake or something changes original style, like I hate it with Shaman King for example, that also rebooted the old anime (or rather made new that is more faithful to manga). But Digimon Adventure: nailed it perfectly. The shows looks like the old anime, literally. If I didn\'t know better, I could have seen a random screenshot of the reboot and think it\'s from old anime. But also they improved things, like the effects and the evolution sequences. They also had really good ideas... just the poor plot made the execution of those ideas bad. It also had some good moments that were done properly. Although it\'s like one flower in the pile of crap. Also the other good things is that they give all of them highest evolution...... but it didn\'t really matter, as there was one guy that appeared every time, stealing the spotlight, so even if the character did cool stuff, him appearing ""coincidentally"" was annoying and ruined the moment. Plus those high evolution forms appeared once, so it wasn\'t really much. The other good thing was side evolution. I am not really a fan of side evos in Digimon, but they nailed it nicely... but that idea was too not really well executed. Two of the forms were used once, other forms were used instead of base forms, instead of making them change those forms while needed. For example, if they need form A, they use it, because form B is ineffective. It wasn\'t done like that.Did I enjoy the show? A bit. But more I was annoyed by the fact that those things that were done so greatly in original, was completely screwed there. At the end few decent stuff couldn\'t cover everything they failed to do. And most of things, even those positive, had bad sides anyway... I really hoped for at least anime that I wouldn\'t like, but will be decent. Instead I got a failed product that were written poorly by someone, who didn\'t thought it through.Overall I give it a 4. That much, because there was some good things there. Without them it would be solid 1.PS Sorry for a bit of chaos, I just wanted to tell about few things, but the topic is so wide and it\'s hard to not spoil anything, especially comparing things with original series. Thanks for Your understanding. favorite anime with Slayers) I was really interested and curious about it. I was hyping, but I knew that I have to hold my horses until I actually see the show. So it happened - I watched the whole Adventure:. And it\'s really not something I would like to see. Both, because it profanes the amazing Digimon Adventure and because it\'s just bad. As I said, I had Digimon series that I didn\'t quite like, but I seen good sides that didn\'t made it that bad and I quite enjoyed them. But I can\'t enjoy cheap story with no character development and no plot whatsoever. But let\'s explain things a bit...I didn\'t really expect it to be something extraordinary, but the show has many serious issues. Pace was totally destroyed, the strongest character just appeared in 3rd episode and there was really big threat to the whole Earth by that time. Imagine 67 episodes long show, where 3rd episode has already escalated to some titan fight level. This is what happened there. Meanwhile in original show, in third episode kids were lost in who knows where and they didn\'t know what to do.

Thanks for Your understanding.', ""Okay let me get this straight. I have seen almost all of the digimon series there is to watch including all of the movies (only missing the Xross Wars and aplimon) and having played most of the games and read some original stories and scripts and even some mangas there is I think I am in pretty good position to write this review. So as I said I have a pretty good understanding of the franchise as a whole. I love digimon and thats why writing this review hurts in more than one way. But here we go anyway. After the good send off that...Last Kizuna was for the original Adventure I had my own suspicions on this one when I heard they were making a reboot of the original series that I keep in high regard for being a good show overall and having huge nostalgia classes on my head. And for the most part this new series turned out to be even worse than what I had anticipated but hear me out. There are some real neat things in the show like references to the older games and some proper backstory of the digimons in general that have not been touched in the anime so far.And it got me laughing a couple times just like the old show. But not all is well and now on to tell what is not so good in this reboot. Firstly writing is the biggest challenge this new series suffers. Episode pacing is all over the place and it seems like that the writers just went with the attitude of writing one episode at the time and therefore missing the whole overarching story as a complete package. So while the story has some cool elements that could have been really neat they for the most part are left really underdeveloped and stay just as cool ideas.Characters feel very underdeveloped too in many ways compared to the original and seems like the focus was more to just write characters and not to make memorable characters. In the original series all of the children had their own problems and personalities and they were explored more deeply and they had to overcome those problems of theirs and mostly they get solved during the course of the series. Here that happens too but like fraction of it what the original has to offer. Children rarely anymore interact with other digimon (just by nuking or fighting them) which make the digital world feel very much like that all of the digimon or atleast a huge portion of them are there to fight for the dominance of this world and are otherwise just soulless killing machines. Evolutions happen just for the sake of plot for both sides for the children and for the bad guys. They just happen for the most part. They are not in most cases earned in any way to justify the evolution or some digimons appearing so soon in the series. In the old series there was always something preventing that evolution to happen. It felt earned when finally that evolution could be achieved.And while I get that agumon is like the pikachu of the franchise it has too much involvement in the progression of the story and most of the fights. Agumon is everywhere and is involved in all too many fights that he does not have to be in. Original series gave a good amount of epic time to all of the digimons and chosen children and yes I know that Taichi and Yamato had more attention in the original too its way more obvious here. Even Yamato is most of the time in the shadow of Taichi and did I mention that he gets most of the screen time also. Taichi is in almost all of the episodes and even when he would not be needed and you start to think that hey this might be an episode without him he magickly happens to appear from thin air (which starts to get quite humorous in a way during the show as you start to guess where he appears next xD). I am huge fan of agumon and I like Taichi as a character in the original but even I started to feel very bored that they get to do most of the cool stuff that happens in the series.But even with these problems  that I mentioned there are some properly good episodes here and there and almost all of the cast get atleast one great episode where they get to shine. Its just sad that this series is 67 episodes long and if you are a fan of some of the other children other than Taichi and Yamato you might have to wait for a long time before the next time comes for that character to get the spotlight they all deserve. And they are always smaller than what Yamato and Taichi get to achieve. So while as a whole this series is a big mess of development favoritism and writing they have managed to capture some of the older series energy in some of the episodes for the very least.Mimi and Jou are way better in this reboot than in the original and most of their episodes are more than great but then again characters like Sora and Koushiro have been ruined pretty harshly in my opinion. Like I mentioned earlier some of their defining personalities have been forgottten somewhere not to be found in this reboot. It does affect all of the cast but those are the characters that get the shortest stick in my opinion here. Most fight scenes in this series are one of the best animated over the whole franchise and some even having some properly good choreography in the fight but some of these are ruined by the favoritism and tipping of the power scaling massively. One of the strongest digimons the series has is introduced in the beginning of the series and one of the most powerful digimon that we knew before this show is beaten very easily in just couple minutes later in the series.Villains have evolved in some areas and have taken some real setbacks in others. Some of them are familiar from the original like Devimon and his story is probably the best of them in the early run of the series and his story involved as a whole would have had so much more potential if written more deeply because there are some real neat ideas and lore involved here. And the end of his arc could have been the final episode of the whole series and this happens couple of times during the show. First half of the episode three could have been the last episode and so could have been the episode 50 and couple others. The show loses most of its momentum as almost all of these encounters have Mega digimons in them way before they are even introduced to the children (excluding that one that I mentioned earlier that gets introduced in the episode two) and most of them are dealt with ease. The sense of danger is rarely a factor here. Of course the children are going to win in the end but in the original the sense of danger and defeat was somewhat present.  You start to expect that each fight is going to be won and that certain digimon to appear everytime situation gets too desperate and you hope they would give a good explanation for it in the end. Well they do give answer to that in the end but its very loose and not that original idea. Overall the villains are just there to be villains but they don't have a proper target or solid motives for their actions as in the original series they mostly seem to have a clear purpose. The real finale of the series has really cool fight scene but that kinda is the whole thing.Almost all the show has to offer in many ways is very predictable story pieces and how the fights end in a bad way (excluding those great episodes I mentioned earlier). But for me the saving part and the best part of the series is the music Takayoshi Tanimoto and Toshihiko Sahashi have done and ou boy have they really out done themselves this time and I can properly say that these songs do fit the new anime way better than what they would have if they had used the old songs. I was always hyped to hear the songs starting play and the faster pacing and more hype atmosphere of this show really shows in the music and its neatly tied into small package that plays throughout the soundtrack and still be able to sound like they could be from the original series (some parts have been taken from the old soundtrack if listened carefully and brave heart can be heard in the new evolution songs). And speaking of the new evolution songs all three of them are great rivals for the the masterful and legendary work of Koji Wada (may he rest in piece). Unfortunately we could not have his work in this version too but what we now had is the best we could get and I can see myself listening to these for the years to come. All of the digivolution stages have song for them concluding in a whopping three songs that all kick ass and do fit for the show.Now time to wrap this up somehow. In conclusion if you are huge digimon fan I suggest you to give this one a try just don't expect something outstanding but other than that its really hard to justify who this show was made for. New viewers have no idea about the game references or the first couple episode being like a nod to the good old boku no war game movie and many others. We old watchers and fans get those but the show is not what we liked in the original adventure about the characters and the story ? So its a like hybrid that tries to capture the hearts of us old fans with neat little tricks and old characters but still tries to make it something that some new fans would be able to call a classic and wait for the series to continue in the future and it really cannot succeed in any of these objectives. So now we have mediocre show that wasted so much potential and episodes to tell a story that is not very memorable with sometimes beautiful animations and very cool songs.Overall I did not give this one a really high score as the negatives really outweight the positives here. But when I enjoyed it I really did enjoy it. I probably forgot to mention something here too but I don't want this to be any longer xD. See for yourself if you like it. Not a huge recommendation from me but a recommendation nonetheless as a digimon fan. Now let me go watch those couple really good episodes again and try to forget most of this series exists while listening to Break the Chain in the background.Story 3/10Art 6/10Sound 6/10Music 9/10Enjoyment 7/10Overall 6/10 Last Kizuna was for the original Adventure I had my own suspicions on this one when I heard they were making a reboot of the original series that I keep in high regard for being a good show overall and having huge nostalgia classes on my head.

This is without a doubt one...of the better reboots for sure!Taichi is way more heroic than his older counterpart and I absolutely love this new version of him although I'm still a big fan of the old one!

You go into any episode knowing what you will get; good guy meets bad guy, good guy is in a losing fight, good guy powers up, victory, next episode.  An episode feels like it has 2-3 minutes of content worth paying attention to, if that.This is only an anime I\'d recommend to hardcore fans, and even then it would be surprising if they stuck with it more for enjoyment than obligation or dedication to the series.', 'Although I wouldn’t describe it as outstanding, this revisit to Digimon Adventure is a fun ride. It does have a lot of failings, but for this 90s kid, it offered some great callbacks to the original series and made just a few improvements. I wouldn’t discourage anyone from watching and enjoying it. This reboot does fail in a lot of areas as well, though, mostly in the areas of pacing and character development. The pacing was funky, offering random glimpses in each episode at what various character groups were doing or charging headlong into boss battles that weren’t really all that earned. I often found...myself confused about how situations developed until I rewatched the whole thing in reverse order so I could see the connections between episodes from a different angle. I saw a reviewer who described this show as having extreme acts of random heroism in place of character building, and that feels accurate to me. There is character development, but it is weak. If you’re debating if you should watch this, I’d say give it a try but don’t expect the storytelling to be quite as good as you remember. myself confused about how situations developed until I rewatched the whole thing in reverse order so I could see the connections between episodes from a different angle.

I even love Mimi’s character development in this one. She also became a big sister to Kari and cheered her up when Taichi and Agumon disappearedAnd I’m actually glad all eight kids got their mega forms for their Digimon respectively!

One of my favorite anime this season. They really going full throttle for this one.The graphic transition is so smooth, the soundtrack were really kicking (I mean, really, you guys should hear it), a lot of new evolution line/ slide evolution, the new storyline, the new enemy...At first, it was like ""Taichi and Agumon"" centered adventure. They inserted those two like in every adventure/episode. but as the story goes on, each character have their own adventure, and many question about the ""Chosen Children"" were answered.It maybe didn\'t be as good as the original, but this one...really deserved to be called the ""Reboot"". really deserved to be called the ""Reboot"".', ""I enjoyed it, but not having Milleniumon as the final boss was a big disappointment for me. A few episodes before the end I was a bit angrier because I thought Deathmon would be the final boss, but Abbadmon and Negamon are quite nice by design and powers so I did not find it that bad, It has some pacing issues though, it seemed to me they did not know if they wanted to do a quieter progression or just battle after battle episodes with no time to rest so they just tried to do both, the battles are nice but the music is very...bad, it does not even reach the level of the previous seasons, i don't like drama that much so i didn't really care about the Sora crest drama on the original so i'm not the right person to talk about character development bad, it does not even reach the level of the previous seasons, i don't like drama that much so i didn't really care about the Sora crest drama on the original so i'm not the right person to talk about character development"", '[This review will be updated as I catch up with the anime.]Digimon Adventure 1999 was not good. A prototype for 02 but without any of the subtle character writing that makes 02 such a masterpiece, with a soundtrack consisting of such memorable tracks as ""oops! all Bolero"" and ""oops! we made a slow rock ballad instead of battle music,"" and with such great characters as ""what if Ken, but instead of a scathing commentary on parents who treat their kids like accolades to show off to their friends, she was instead the most boring person you\'ve ever met"" and ""guy who cares about his family...slightly too much, but has no other character traits.""

Gakuen Heaven,https://myanimelist.net/anime/850/Gakuen_Heaven,"['5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Not a lot of actionAs a yaoi fan girl, nothing pleases me more than a transfer student asking to be corrupted by his new school mates who are into &ldquo;different extracurricular activities&rdquo;. Such is not really the premise of Gakuen Heaven, but yaoi fan girls like me should know otherwise, right?Gakuen Heaven is about Ito Keita, seemingly an ordinary, supposedly straight teenage boy, who is suddenly invited to a prestigious all-boys school named Bell Liberty Academy, or BL academy (How ominous XD). As soon as he gets there, his bishounen school mates start fawning over him because he&rsquo;s cute. It&rsquo;s...almost like the yaoi counterpart of Strawberry Panic, if you ask me.I like the story, I think it&rsquo;s cute as a whole, but I thought there wasn&rsquo;t enough material to work with. Most of the episodes dealt with Keita trying to adjust in his new school, when 3 episodes would have been enough. Also, just when it was about to end was a climax that came out of almost nowhere. I thought it didn&rsquo;t fit the image of the story. Heck, Ham-ham heaven was better than that climax.Now for the more important part &ndash; the &ldquo;action&rdquo;. Yaoi fan girls should know what I&rsquo;m referring to. Sadly, there wasn&rsquo;t enough &ldquo;action&rdquo; in Gakuen Heaven. Most of the &ldquo;action&rdquo; were fake and plain teasing. There was only one kiss throughout the whole thing, and I thought that kiss was kinda awkward and disappointing.I have to say though, that Gakuen Heaven has a beautiful cast of bishounens. Yes, the cast is heavily dominated by men. There was only one episode with women, and they&rsquo;re not even that significant, nor attractive. Not that it&rsquo;s important. My favorite characters are Niwa a.k.a. King. He&rsquo;s like a dashing prince that reminds me of Conrad from Kyou Kara Maoh. I also like Shunsuke&rsquo;s playful nature, the impish twins, and the cute Keita.You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;ll be contented with the bevy of bishounens, but I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m a little disappointed because there wasn&rsquo;t enough differentiation between the characters. They all look almost completely alike, except for Keita, Shunsuke and the twins (probably explains why I like these characters the most). Everyone else had the same facial structure and would look the same if they had the same hairstyle. That&rsquo;s just a small qualm though. Overall, visuals really look nice. I like the coloring, because a wide variety of colors were used. The illustrations and the backgrounds were all very detailed but not overwhelming to the eye.As for the voice acting, 2 names immediately caught my attention. The first name is Jun Fukuyama, who was Lelouch Lamperouge in Code Geass, and Watanuki Kimihiro in xxxHOLiC, and is Ito Keita in Gakuen Heaven. What a talented guy &ndash; I almost didn&rsquo;t recognize it was him since Lelouch and Watanuki have such strong voices, while Keita has such a soft, almost girly voice. The second is Takahiro Sakurai, one of my favorite male voice actors. He was Shun in Gatekeepers, and Cloud in Final Fantasy: Advent Children. In Gakuen Heaven, he is Kazuki, who&rsquo;s actually my least favorite character, but at least he has a talented voice actor to back him up.I usually wouldn&rsquo;t like songs similar to the OP &ldquo;School Boys&rdquo;, but I really like that song. I think it&rsquo;s poppy and catchy, and I even dance to it when I hear it sometimes. It&rsquo;s the same for the ED, &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t expect I would like it at all. However, I still prefer the OP since it&rsquo;s more upbeat.In the end, the story seems to be Gakuen Heaven&rsquo;s weakest point. I know it may seem that yaoi fan girls are more concerned about BL when it comes to yaoi, but the story&rsquo;s important too. If the story had a different, more suitable climax, I probably would have liked it more, but Gakuen Heaven was still worth watching. almost like the yaoi counterpart of Strawberry Panic, if you ask me.I like the story, I think it&rsquo;s cute as a whole, but I thought there wasn&rsquo;t enough material to work with.

I happen to come across this by chance and I'm glad I did. Now its a storyline based upon the main character (Keita) who suddenly receives an invite to an exclusive academy for boys. Unknown to him, the invite is from an old childhood friend. Throughout the storyline you meet the rest of the characters, like Naruse who automatically falls &quot;in-love&quot; for Keita and spends the entire series fawning over him, calling him his &quot;Honey&quot;.You also see a bit of an &quot;evil&quot; side from the other characters in the story. Keita's doubt at being able to attend BL Academy is very apparent...throughout the storyline, especially when the Ozawa twins taunt him, saying he's not fit to attend the school because he has no special talents.This is very much a Shounen-ai, and you do see romantic tendancies in the show, and apparently almost all the characters have a bit of a &quot;crush&quot; on Keita. Throughout the storyline you slowly notice the real reason for Keita being there (I'll be a bum and not expose why if you haven't seen it).Long in a short, I found this SUPER funny and really cute. The best parts are the &quot;commercial&quot; areas that show screen shots of various characters... some a little more PG-13 than others *grins* Total love for fangirls. If you haven't seen this, and you want a good laugh, I'd recommend it. throughout the storyline, especially when the Ozawa twins taunt him, saying he's not fit to attend the school because he has no special talents.This is very much a Shounen-ai, and you do see romantic tendancies in the show, and apparently almost all the characters have a bit of a &quot;crush&quot; on Keita.

I failed to remember the names of most of the characters, besides Keita, Kazuki and Naruse, so I’m just going to refer to the rest of them by the nicknames that I ended up calling them with (don’t worry, it’s pretty much obvious who’s who by nicknames too, so there will be no confusion).Story - 3The overall story is just what it is/what it seems: light, simple, funny, fanservice-y; nothing more and nothing less than what I already expected when I dived into it: your typical highschool BL reverse harem set in the elite Bell Liberty Academy, which is...literally shortened up to ""BL Academy"" and I\'m not even kidding you! (I see what you did there, author!) Well, at least for the first half it was entertaining to follow Keita getting in all sorts of questionable and funny situations with the rest of the guys.Second half was rather unbalanced from all points of view. The main problem was that it tried to add up different genres into the story to develop a kind of drama between the main characters, but seriously, it felt like it turned into a different show entirely. It tried to insert some half-assed assassins that got pawned by 16 years old kids because POWER OF MAIN CHARACTERS!! Then some workplace-family tragedy regarding Kazuki and his ""secret"" because WHY NOT, WE NEED ANGST. And lastly there was some sort of sci-fi virus situation because YAMI NO MATSUEI RIP-OFF(and for those that know that manga/anime, I can say two things: silver hair and medical experimentation. Hello, Muraki of the Red Moon!). But before you go and cheer expecting a Gakuen Heaven MurakixTsuzuki situation, don\'t get ahead of yourselves because it definitely doesn\'t go to that extent, no no, because we must not forget the absolute POWER OF BROMANCE! ... and the power of the main guy motivational speeches. This is a LIGHT show, people! Full of hearts and flowers!Characters - 3The characters were overall pretty under-developed, but it\'s anything but a rare issue when it comes to multiple-endings visual novel adaptations. However, not even Kazuki, the obvious main love interest, had as much development as I would wish and expect. He loved Keita by default, his ""secret"" was just a way to cause drama and in the end, nothing ever mattered. The other characters? They can\'t be really called ""characters"".They are the most basic of anime archetypes with some ""gimmicks"" to them, sometimes not even that. Kingu (Yes, Kingu, because I can\'t help but make fun of Japanese Engrish) was nothing but the baddass student council president who had way too little screentime to even be able to remember him, Emo Painter was just an emo painter who sometimes acted like decoration just to be able to say ""See? I\'m here!"", Queen is a feminine-looking guy and head of the school Treasury/Accounting department whose gimmick was acting like a ""Queen"", being beautiful and having an issue with it, his love/hate towards Kingu and his soft spot for a sketchy looking hacker/childhood friend (and he\'s voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi in his early seiyuu days coughs worth mentioning), Genki Guy was the typical genki guy with Kanto (?) accent which made him sound as if he was meowing for the most part so we got ourselves the Neko-guy too, who in the end literally did nothing but being ""genki"", then ""megane""-san sent me creepy shivers in more ways than one, but he also went nowhere, then...well, you get the idea. The rest aren\'t much different or important either.Honorable mention goes to Naruse because everytime he appeared on screen I couldn\'t help but grin widely for his over-the-top flirting sessions and I doubt I\'ll be able to get ""HONEY!"" off my mind for awhile. And then there\'s the twins, which surprisingly had to offer some development and conclusion regarding their feelings towards Keita, which I praise immensely seeing how awful the rest of the cast was treated.Art&OST - 4,5Art-wise, it was quite generic, nothing too bad or too awesome-looking. Some backgrounds looked unfinished though and I\'m mostly referring to the forest backgrounds. OST is quite generic as well and didn\'t exactly pop out, however the opening song, if listened to more than once, becomes quite entertaining in the long run.Enjoyment - 7Well, I personally enjoyed it for what it was. It was my ray of sunshine in some days and I\'m sad that it\'s over! I recommend it to those that want to shut their brains and have something to laugh or d\'aww at or to people that like BL in general. I don\'t recommend it if you\'re looking for an involving story with twisted Yami no Matsuei-like BL elements or something similar to Junjou Romantica or Sekaiichi Hatsukoi.

Nevertheless... I may have the unpopular opinion here but i think Gakuen Heaven is  completely dull.Gakuen Heaven follows the typical formula of ""the new dude in school who is fawn over by all his classmates"" which is a typical cliche in yaoi/yuri, shoujo and every other anime which involves school romances.But you can have this setting and still make a great story, but in the case of this anime the plot is boring, all twists are hand-fed to the viewers from the start, and the only one...which isn\'t (which i won\'t spoil because it happens in the end) it\'s completely random and pointless. The characters are dull stereotypes who doesn\'t add nothing rather than being handsome love interests to the main character.

Valentine's is this week so let's look at a romance. In this case, Gakuen Heaven a shounen-ai series based on a video game from Spray. The adaptation was handled by Spray, Visual Art's and Tokyo Kids. Let's dive right in and see if the love is in the air or if this is one of those painful romances.Story:The tale opens with Keita getting an acceptance letter to Bell Liberty Academy, a prestigious boys' school where the most elite of elite students attend classes. Keita wonders why he's been accepted since he can't think of anything that makes him special, but he...goes because it's a great opportunity. At the Academy he meets a bunch of kind, attractive guys who readily accept him in spite of his own doubts. Everything seems to be going well, particularly with Kazuki who is always by his side, when Keita finds his qualifications suddenly challenged and has to prove himself worthy.The biggest issue with the story is that the series doesn't take a lot of risks in its story-telling. As such, a lot of the events and turns are really predictable. If you've seen or read a decent number of romance stories then you've probably seen every turn the story takes used enough times that you know the pattern it's going to follow. Gakuen Heaven tries to compensate for that with its humour, which does work to an extent, but even that isn't always well done. To give a concrete example, the story uses the joke where characters sound like they're doing something naughty and the camera shows things in the background to imply that there may be something naughty going on that they can't show you until, big surprise, it shows the characters doing something completely innocuous. It's a setup that can work and that can be really funny, but it loses all its impact when you keep using it at the beginning of episodes.Now, the plot being standard and predictable doesn't make it bad. There are a lot of good things about the story too. The foreshadowing is really good, although I'm, not sure if that's because they expected the plot to be hard to follow or because they knew it was going to be predictable but still didn't want to have anything happen in the climax that introduced new elements and wouldn't make much sense. Either way, I will give them credit for establishing everything early. There are also some really cute romantic moments that work well and the humour, even with those moments that don't work, is generally funny and entertaining.Characters:The characters in this are pretty archetypical. You've got the twins who have the same personality, the hyper flirtatious guy, the sensitive artist, the kind athletic guy who takes care of everyone, and so on. None of them are bad characters but they don't have much depth to them. My only real complaint is that Hideaki is kind of creepy in a way that doesn't really mesh with the rest of the series. To be fair, he doesn't do much in terms of things that are actually creepy, but those few scenes where he does are just strange and a little uncomfortable. I will also give the series credit, though. I do like that Keita has a pretty subtle character arc that demonstrates exactly what makes him worthy and even remarkable in spite of his own uncertainty. The character dynamics are also really well done, in spite of most of the characters being pretty standard.Art:The art is pretty good. The backgrounds can be a bit sparse, but the character designs are really good and the animation flows really well, particularly in those scenes where there's some kind of action. The series is also really good about using art to set up atmosphere, which it does do in several scenes and there are some really nice details for objects that are actually going to be important.Sound:Gakuen Heaven has an amazing vocal cast. Our main couple is voiced by Sakurai Takahiro (the voice of Cloud Strife and Kururugi Suzaku) and Fukuyama Jun (the voice of Lelouch Lamperouge and Albert de Morcerf.) Incidentally, I now understand why Code Geass has so many shounen-ai fans. They aren't the only big name actors either. We've got Morikawa Toshiyuki (Sephiroth,) Konishi Katsuyuki (Lloyd Irving,) Miki Shinichiro (Kudou Youji,) Kawakami Tomoko (Utena,) Suzumura Kenichi (Kokutou Mikiya,) Kamiya Hiroshi (Levi) and many others. They all deliver really spectacular performances in this too. The music is really good. Yoshikawa Mei does a good job delivering a suitable score.Ho-yay:As surprising as it may be, this shounen-ai romance has a lot of ho-yay in it. The ho-yay factor is a 10/10.Final Thoughts:Gakuen Heaven is a simple, light-hearted romance. A lot of it is pretty standard stuff, but it manages to have some really good aspects too. A lot of the humour works, the cutesy moments are absolutely adorable, the vocal cast is amazing, the character dynamics are good and it is consistently entertaining throughout. If you're in the mood for a cutesy romance, check it out. If that isn't your thing then you aren't going to be into this series. For myself, I give it a solid 7/10.

The foreshadowing is really good, although I'm, not sure if that's because they expected the plot to be hard to follow or because they knew it was going to be predictable but still didn't want to have anything happen in the climax that introduced new elements and wouldn't make much sense. Either way, I will give them credit for establishing everything early. There are also some really cute romantic moments that work well and the humour, even with those moments that don't work, is generally funny and entertaining.Characters:The characters in this are pretty archetypical. You've got the twins who have the same personality, the hyper flirtatious guy, the sensitive artist, the kind athletic guy who takes care of everyone, and so on. None of them are bad characters but they don't have much depth to them. My only real complaint is that Hideaki is kind of creepy in a way that doesn't really mesh with the rest of the series. To be fair, he doesn't do much in terms of things that are actually creepy, but those few scenes where he does are just strange and a little uncomfortable. I will also give the series credit, though. I do like that Keita has a pretty subtle character arc that demonstrates exactly what makes him worthy and even remarkable in spite of his own uncertainty. The character dynamics are also really well done, in spite of most of the characters being pretty standard.Art:The art is pretty good. The backgrounds can be a bit sparse, but the character designs are really good and the animation flows really well, particularly in those scenes where there's some kind of action. The series is also really good about using art to set up atmosphere, which it does do in several scenes and there are some really nice details for objects that are actually going to be important.Sound:Gakuen Heaven has an amazing vocal cast. Our main couple is voiced by Sakurai Takahiro (the voice of Cloud Strife and Kururugi Suzaku) and Fukuyama Jun (the voice of Lelouch Lamperouge and Albert de Morcerf.) Incidentally, I now understand why Code Geass has so many shounen-ai fans. They aren't the only big name actors either. We've got Morikawa Toshiyuki (Sephiroth,) Konishi Katsuyuki (Lloyd Irving,) Miki Shinichiro (Kudou Youji,) Kawakami Tomoko (Utena,) Suzumura Kenichi (Kokutou Mikiya,) Kamiya Hiroshi (Levi) and many others. They all deliver really spectacular performances in this too. The music is really good. Yoshikawa Mei does a good job delivering a suitable score.Ho-yay:As surprising as it may be, this shounen-ai romance has a lot of ho-yay in it. The ho-yay factor is a 10/10.Final Thoughts:Gakuen Heaven is a simple, light-hearted romance. A lot of it is pretty standard stuff, but it manages to have some really good aspects too. A lot of the humour works, the cutesy moments are absolutely adorable, the vocal cast is amazing, the character dynamics are good and it is consistently entertaining throughout. If you're in the mood for a cutesy romance, check it out. If that isn't your thing then you aren't going to be into this series. For myself, I give it a solid 7/10. Next week I'll take a look at Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka."", ""In every aspect(story, art, sound, character, enjoyment), I rate this anime 10/10.I loved this story, I am not into BL, but this was a touching and wonderful story, I can't compare it to anything I have ever seen.It is one of the best anime I have watched. If you miss this anime, it will be like missing a great moment in your life.The story is a very simple one and cute.Gakuen heaven is a boys x boys cute and beautiful anime.This anime shows a great and profound innocence between the main characters.Watching this anime makes one realise that true love is extremely innocent and...much beyond physical level .And believe me watching this anime will be a great experience. Everyone has his or her tastes and this anime depends a lot on which angle you watch it.Ito Keita is a common boy, and he has nothing to be recommend except his good luck. One day he receives a letter. It is a certification of the entrance to an elite boy's boding high school. At this school he is supposed to spend days of battles and sweet romance with handsome boys. He constantly questions his worth at the school. He's just an average normal young teenager.The story revolves around Ito Keita, who can't believe he can go to Bell Liberty Academy, shortly known as BL. (Yeah, I know BL also means Boys Love.) There he meets a lot of new friends, one of them Kazuki Endo  (my favourite character), who he is closest to. But there are some people who just don't want him in BL... And aside from that, what's with Kazuki anyway? What's he hiding from Keita? And why does Keita feel so comfortable around Kazuki?In fact kazuki has deep feelings for keita.He has connections with Keita's past and is very concerned for him. The anime shows a kind of spiritual relationship between them.The first few episodes are only there to get to know the big cast that support Gakuen Heaven. Later we get to be delved deeper into the story. The mysteries of why Keita was able to get into BL in the first place, since the school is only there for top students. Of Kazuki Endo, his past with Keita and his real identity. The people who are plotting to work against Keita. And then the last mystery involving Jin-san, who is close with Kazuki. In the end they will all be solved and you will feel satisfied after watching this series.The art is beautiful and bright and there are tons of bishonen to boot. Funny being the keyword, the slash is really teasing you, but there is hardly any real action going on except for that anly one kiss and the hugs. However, the relationship of the main paring is very nicely and beautifully built and that's more important to me than some steamy/hot scenes.You should not expect every shounen-ai animes to have steamy scenes. I believed that if steamy scenes were to be present in 'Gakuen Heaven', the innocence of the anime would have been ruined... What I like about this anime is that its innocence and profoundness has been preserved perfectly.And yes, I have seen many people mistaking the term 'SHOUNEN-AI as 'YAOI', especially when it comes to yaoi-fan girls. There is actually a world of difference between the two terms. Shounen-ai animes are animes that show emotional tendencies towards boys and boys. Shounen-ai animes are not supposed to show steamy scenes ,whereas yaoi animes indicate presence of physical, steamy scenes between boys and boys.So I request people to learn the difference first because there are many yaoi fans who tends to get dissappointed because they already judge shounen-ai animes as container of steamy scenes...which is absolutely wrong.Overall Gakuen Heaven is a nice series worth watching. I definitely recommend this series to you! If you miss this anime, it will be like missing a great moment in your life.And lastly, a very important lesson: patience will be rewarded. (Something you'll need when watching this series. Good luck!) much beyond physical level .And believe me watching this anime will be a great experience.

It's a 13-episode series that really knows its audience and isn't afraid to target them with fan-service (straight guys, that's your cue to move on; this isn't for you).It's a very light boys' love story with a ton of hot guys...and literally no females (though they claim there are female students). At the beginning, it's a little hard to understand why people like Keita, our protagonist, so much; his only talents seem to be luck and being really sweet. But by the end, you love him, too, so you can't really blame them.There are other plot devices that make no sense but I ended up liking anyway, like the chairman situation, that random bear, what exactly Shunsuke does, why the biology professor can't get a better password. And there are some things that are absolutely hilarious, like the student council vs. the treasury rivalry (side note: I adore Karou and Omi, who run the treasury, and the computer hacking battle between Omi and Nakajima is genius), the twins, and how utterly devilish this anime is with innuendo.The plot also massively improves towards the middle-to-end of the series, and you see how they've been setting it up from the beginning.

But with the help from the other students, will he be able to make it in BLA?My Thoughts:I really enjoyed this anime. Some would categorise this anime as yaoi, but it doesn't show that much; just a bit of skin here and there. No sex scenes at all. It's...mostly all innuendo and feelings between Keita and Kazuki.

If you\'re looking for obvious romance throughout the whole thing, this isn\'t like that. (Does that count as a sort of spoiler???... not sure).

Gundam Build Divers Prologue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37247/Gundam_Build_Divers_Prologue,"[""Gundam Build Divers Prologue operates less like an actual prologue and more like an exhibition of the concept; it’s a demo that shoehorns a relevant main character in an eye-rolling manner at the last second. That aside, there’s no denying the spectacle provided by this demo reel.The visuals are as good as ever, with impressive new designs that finally give some love to Gundam Age and most cathartically, Gundam Thunderbolt. The battles are as flashy, destructive, and fun ever, but with a slightly grander and more chaotic scale. No longer bound to reality, we get to see new character designs based on animals and whatnot....Call it cashing in on the popular Virtual Reality concept, but you need to remember that Gundam Build Fighters is the epitome of the commercial side of Gundam, with it being the most open about selling plastic model kits and showcasing the appeal of giant robots to a wider audience.The music is unfortunately less praise-worthy. There are no new tracks of note, which is a shame since while the OSTs of Build Fighters and Try are both good, they cannot be the only ones used for what is the demo for the third big installment in the Build Fighters timeline. Nothing is particularly bad, just not worthy of note.The characters do a passable job for what they are, largely irrelevant teammates showing off a 10 on 10 battle where the objective is to take down the most important member. They are nothing more or less, with some decent banter and rivalry between the two team leaders.

This season has really good fighting scenes. The character growth and MC's self-realization are something that the creator worked on this season. Although, the Jianghu does not deserve a hero like Shen Jianxin.  Many new characters have been introduced in this season. It also introduced a new Female lead with a saddening background story and a little bit of a rom-com vibe between the ML and FL.The story is enjoyable and the animation is very good with some really good fighting...scenes.

Jinsei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23121/Jinsei,"[""I don't know exactly how I feel about this series. I like it, but then again, there are some things I don't.I'll just have to tell you something important before you watch this show;It is not a harem.Yes, the main character, Akamatsu, does hang around several girls at all times. But, there's only one girl in which the show romantically develops. This is a good thing, and although it's not a huge change, it feels different from the norm when it comes to romantic comedies involving several girls.I'll make this a quick first impression, for people who are curious. I'll just...say right now, this show isn't anything special. There's a lot of cliche involved here, mainly having to do with the sort of accidents where the main character ends up grabbing a girl's breast when falling over, and then getting hurt for it.Thankfully, he's not necessarily dense. He notices and takes opportunities to get closer to Rino, the girl whom the show romantically develops. Although these aren't anything major, they're refreshing.Other than that small difference, the show is an ordinary romantic comedy in terms of plot. For some odd reason, this show stands out for me this season, when compared to the other romantic comedies that are airing. I think it may be the atmosphere, which feels... I don't know. It just feels comforting, I suppose is a good word for it. It's silly and it's really not that serious at all.I'd say give it a shot if you're looking for a relaxing romantic comedy to watch. The characters aren't too crazy or loud and neither is the execution or pacing.  There are some scenes that made me laugh, but only a bit.Don't come into this series expecting anything serious or unique. It's not. That's really all I should say.Another thing I noticed that makes this show feel different than the other romcoms is it's type of comedy and it's lack of fanservice. Both I see as a good thing. There's fanservice involved but, it's not nearly as much as you'd think. It leaves more room for dialogue and actual character interactions in which both are fun to see in this show.In the end, the show is average. It has its cute moments, and I'm glad the main character Akamatsu retains some sense of self in the end by doing what he wants, unlike a lot of dense main characters in romcoms. It's a good show, but nothing worth recommending or buying. It's relaxing, and it's good if you just want something to pass the time. say right now, this show isn't anything special.

'Cept for the fact that he can actually make a decision after all. and the rest of the girls actually supported them, i found that very cute. the ending was enjoyable of course, however...throughout the anime i fell asleep a few times.

This is a majoritively negative review.Story; 6/10For some reason that I can\'t recall being explained, this high school has two different newspaper clubs. Our main characters are in the Second and run a life advice column. But oh darn it, they can\'t ever agree on anything because they\'re all ridiculously opposite to one another. In comes Yuuki Akamatsu, the new member tasked with getting this club\'s shit together.An /okay/ sounding story on the surface, Jinsei had...its moments.An episode generally has someone write to the club with their problem, the girls can\'t decide on an answer, so they go do something and pull an answer out of their asses by the 20th minute.Art; 7/10I\'m no expert, but I can\'t say Jinsei is bad looking. Quite the opposite, really. The show is colorful and pretty nicely animated.Sound; 6/10Again, not really confident to say a lot about sound. The OP is catchy enough and has managed to get stuck in my head as I write this. Upbeat and generally matches the tone of the show. I didn\'t really like the ED, though.Character; 5/10I feel like this is where Jinsei needed to sell itself. With plots only lasting an episode or two, the characters need to be likeable. For the most part, they\'re okay. Just okay.More or less archetypes on legs, the Second Newspaper Club really aren\'t anything special to me. Ikumi Suzuki the tomboy sports player, Rino Endou - a nerdy, tsundere Homura Akemi, and Fumi Kujou, the boobs.The other member, Yuuki Akamatsu, is so far into the ""normal guy"" territory that there\'s just nothing noteable about him other than his mandatory love interest in Rino. Which, surprisingly, is the enjoyable aspect of the show.No real development in any of the characters over the episodes I watched other than the relatonship between Yuuki and Rino edging closer to the \'dating\' zone.Enjoyment; 6/10As I said in the beginning, Jinsei does have its moments. Over the episodes I managed to sit through I found myself both laughing out loud and taking a break half way to do something else because I could not keep watching.Jinsei is nothing if not mediocre.

Otherwise, go watch something else.', '""Everyone knows that handles are the weak point of any closet""The quote above properly depicts the deepest moments of the slightly glorious anime that is Jinsei.Jinsei, directed by Keiichirou Kawaguchi (Hayate no Gotoku/SKET Dance), immediately throws its audience into the world of Yuuki Akamatsu, the newest member of the Kyuumon High School Second Newspaper Club (One newspaper club was just not enough). Akamatsu was placed in charge of the club\'s ""Life advice"" column and was assigned three girls with extremely differentiating social standpoints to help address the concerns of Kyuumon students looking for help of some sort.That\'s it. There really isn\'t much more story to...it. It\'s just a day-in, day-out look into the second newspaper club and the outrageous tasks they must undertake in order to help a specific student get over their fears/problems/anything else that burdens high-schoolers nowadays. But that alone doesn\'t stop the anime from being loads of fun.What makes Jinsei great (Kind of) is that it is spontaneous, hilarious, and self-aware. It knows that it is an anime, and you just don\'t get to see that often. The characters aren\'t complex, the situations are outrageous, and the dialogue is so fast-paced that there is never a dull moment on screen. With a few tweaks, this show could have gone somewhere. And so I will break it down into a few key components to better detail what went right and what went wrong.Music: 6/10There really isn\'t much to expect as far as music goes in a slice-of-life school comedy. And I\'m not saying that background music doesn\'t matter for the genre, I\'m saying that it doesn\'t make much of an impact. It was fitting, but it wasn\'t memorable. The opening was as fast-paced as the dialogue contained within the shows, and the ending songs were fun and filled with dry-humor for viewers to chuckle at as they dragged their cursors to the X on their media players.Characters: 8/10Don\'t misinterpret this -- the characters in Jinsei are not particularly unique. They can even be viewed as carbon copies of characters from other shows to a certain extent. Each one fulfills an anime stereotype of some sort. There is the rambunctiously sporty girl (Who is also the best), the quiet, yet extremely smart girl with glasses, and the girl with huge boobs whose only character trait is that she has huge boobs. And so I\'m not directly handing each character a score card with the number 8 on it, I\'m handing them a giant 8 to share based on their interactions with each other. The conversations exchanged between Ikumi (Sporty girl), Rino (Smart girl), and Fumi (Boobs) easily craft an enjoyable experience for anyone that doesn\'t feel uncomfortable engaging in young-adult humor.Art: 7/10I have no complaints about the art of this show. I also have no good things to say about it. It\'s all just normal. Considering a good 90% of it took place in a high school, I can not commend the artists for painting a memorable landscape. I can also not commend them for character design considering the characters were limited to school uniforms and looked essentially like characters from any other slice-of-life anime you can find out there. The art was nothing above or below average, and because of this it does not deserve to be demeaned or praised in any manner.Story: 6/10The main problem I had with Jinsei is that there just wasn\'t a story. And without a story, character development ultimately becomes extinct. Don\'t get me wrong, I enjoyed almost every episode of this show, but I never felt the drive to watch another one. Problems were announced on a piece of paper in the beginning of the show (Like, for real. Akamatsu held up the paper and read it to the girls), and were then resolved in the last scene. It wasn\'t until the last four episodes where there was an actual problem the second newspaper club faced. Even then it wasn\'t a problem big enough for viewers to care about.I feel like Jinsei forgot what it was supposed to be somewhere down the line. If it had stuck to just quirky dialogue and irrational high school problems, it would have most likely been received a lot better than it was. It isn\'t often that I actually find myself laughing at anime, but Jinsei succeeded so many times that I would need to grow around three more hands to be able to count those times.Jinsei is an anime with minimal plot and maximum comedy. And because of that, if you go into it with expectations higher than the arm on a ""You must be this tall to ride"" sign, you are going to be let down. But just because it lacks in plot doesn\'t mean that you can\'t pick it up and have yourself a damn good 24 minutes.Overall score: 7/10 it.

Ayaka is one of the many female leads and she is also the club president she honestly really isn't around a whole lot of the anime until really the end of the anime but for her she is pretty determined person in the sense of trying to find the student council president corrupt otherwise she is a pretty straightforward and determined person. Rino is another female lead and she is the sciencey person of the anime she also goes have a crush on Yuuki otherwise a pretty nice and good character. Ikumi is another female lead and she is well she has A LOT of things going for her from kinda being perverted in a sense to eating candy almost all the time to being somewhat a air head she also is the athletic of the others otherwise she is a decent and also cute character. Fumi is yet another female lead and shes from the lit department honestly to describe her she usually tends to bring samurai stuff into the questions but also she is pretty has here head straight (well most of the time) otherwise again another sweet and charming girl. Emi is the last female lead and well is part of the art department she also really doesn't appear until like episode 8 im pretty sure but rather than that she is a total nut about art almost to the point of stripping naked cause of art and her viewing of people and such otherwise a pretty cute and likeable girl.Enjoyment: Things that i liked: the comedy in this to me at least is really well done and also that i personally liked all the characters in the anime i just found them to me to be all likeable which is good for me and aside from the comedy it was just really enjoyable for me also the ecchi isn't a bad touch either . Things that i didn't like: the comedy can be hit and miss even though what i said about it honestly that's really my only complaint otherwise though this anime does have ecchi but on the slight side of not being a lot i love ecchi but this is for people who might watch it i love ecchi just a warning to people.Overall: im giving this a 8 i watch debating on giving this a 7 but in the end i came out with a 8 cause the ecchi is pretty good but also the fact that i loved all the characters in this anime and also the comedy was really well done as well id recommend watch this anime whenever you can. art nothing really here to complain about the OP and the ED are both decent in there own right and the some back music that plays when the anime is going on is good as well.Characters: Yuuki is the main male lead of the anime and well hes the one the ends up getting stuck with the 3 girls (well one more you comes later on) basically he says the stuff to the girls and than the write down what they should do he honestly has a pretty straight forward personality to the answer of the person and the girls but he his a pretty nice and chill person overall.

These new voice actors have never done an anime before and were not bad at all, but the focus was on them learning not the anime itself.Two enormous problems that cannot be overlooked in the slightest1. NO constancy with episodes. I watched this while it was ongoing and on I think the summer 2014 list and it finished I believe...late 2014 or 2015 while being 12 episodes. Episodes would come out on a random day once a week until I believe episode 4 but than became more sporadic being once a month or twice a week even. It was halfway done when that list was over putting it barely halfway through its airing time while other 12 episode animes have finished.You cannot miss deadlines I have never seen this in an anime before.2.Subitles and I do not mean it was badly translated, I mean that the jokes were so bad that the authors had to put up separate text explaining the joke which is just sad.3. The rest of the series was boring as hell or clishe and takes the place of the second worst anime I have ever watched. Might deserve a 2 or 3 but since I watched it ongoing with those problems I cannot rate it higher it barely even animated and a disgrace to anime more like an experiment or test run anime for new voice actors or others in the field. late 2014 or 2015 while being 12 episodes.

Also his eyebrows look slightly disgusting.The anime revolves around a handful girls giving advice to troubled students, in the form of Eyebrows presenting messages from students and the girls give mostly amusingly terrible advice until someone says something useful and that becomes the official reply. Since this (and small sidetracks) is all there is to the story you should watch with your focus entirely on the comedy that is thankfully sort of goodish. Eyebrows is the only character without real personality, I'm guessing pathetically hollow guys who...never get anywhere with girls are meant to be able to relate to him easily.The art and sound certainly won't disappoint, even if nothing particularly stands out the quality is high. Overall this anime is a mildly amusing way to kill some time if you're not in the mood to watch anything with story. never get anywhere with girls are meant to be able to relate to him easily.The art and sound certainly won't disappoint, even if nothing particularly stands out the quality is high. Overall this anime is a mildly amusing way to kill some time if you're not in the mood to watch anything with story."", 'At some point in their lives, everyone has needed to ask for advice from someone they find trustworthy, but it\'s questionable as to whether or not their advice is actually credible. I\'m not sure how credible MY advice is, per se, but here\'s some that I\'ll give to you right now; you\'re probably better off watching something other than the anime I\'m reviewing today. It was an anime from the Summer 2014 season that caught my attention for rather odd reasons; despite its license from Funimation and the fact that the final episode aired in Japan on schedule, subtitled versions of each episode were taking...their sweet time being released, especially for the last few episodes. I ended up watching the first episode and putting it on hold for years, but now that I\'ve finally finished it, I have to ask myself this question.Can I really give solid advice to other anime fans about whether or not watching ""Jinsei"", or ""Life"" in English, is a good decision? Well, only one way to find out!To start, Jinsei revolves around Yuuki Akamatsu, who is roped by his cousin, Ayaka Nikaidou, into the Second Newspaper Club. In this club, the members - at least, those in charge of the life advice section - read over the problems of the students of their school, discuss potential solutions to those problems, and then publish their answers in the school\'s newspaper. Through this club, Akamatsu ends up acquainted with three girls: Rino Endou, a smart girl with glasses and a disbelief in the occult, Fumi Kujou, a sweet, big-busted girl from a wealthy family, and Ikumi Suzuki, an energetic girl with sport smarts but not so much brain smarts. Get these four together with a question from a student seeking advice, and hilarity is abound....or maybe not.Believe me when I say that I\'m pretty sure you\'ve seen all of this before; you may not believe me, but it\'s true. A guy joining a school club and finding himself in many awkward situations with the female members, who, by the way, are the only other members of the club? A plot like that has been recycled time and time again, and some further anime will succumb to that fate with that one thing to distinguish them apart from the others; Jinsei has the whole ""life advice"" thing, but that\'s pretty much all. It doesn\'t really try to do a lot of new things, and I found that aspect of the series rather boring.The characters aren\'t much different, either; every last one of them are walking, talking cliches. In all honesty, Akamatsu is the worst of them all; he has his moments, but overall, he\'s just a generic copy-and-paste protagonist that you can find in many other anime. The girls aren\'t much better, as they\'re the kinds of girls you can find in any harem anime; I found Ikumi and Emi rather amusing, but I know that even they aren\'t particularly unique. However, I will give credit where credit is due; while I never really laughed or even giggled at these points, their chemistry is undeniable in their clashes over the advice to give. Their conflict with the Student Council President wasn\'t really as interesting, however; in fact, was it really needed?The art and animation aren\'t anything too groundbreaking; I\'ve seen better from Feel\'s other anime, such as Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru, which is also a slice-of-life anime. However, it goes to show you that they\'re capable of a better animation quality than that in Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete, which is sad considering the fact that it aired the season after this one and even had a better story! The voice acting isn\'t terrible, either; the voice actors for the main characters may not have had a lot of voice work at the time that this anime came out, but they did a good job. The opening and ending themes were rather catchy; however, they don\'t really stand out from other songs, and it\'s not like I want to listen to them on loops.Hopefully, the question I asked earlier has been answered; after all, I\'ve given my reasons why Jinsei isn\'t that great of an anime to the best of my ability. Now, I might as well give my advice to those interested in it; you\'re probably better off watching something else.

I suppose it is because the theme really just stems down to the central focus of the anime, being to help other students with life problems.That is the premise and it kind of just throws that into your face as...soon as you start watching. So, don\'t expect any character backstory. In fact, what I am about to write about them will not take that long, since they have little to no development. And since the significance of all the main characters is rather even, I will simply sort them out by favorites.Ikumi is your typical energetic redhead, sporting some unique flavor to the tropes found in these characters, but not by a whole lot. I will say right now that she unarguably had the funniest parts in the anime and it rarely ever felt forced. This is how you write an energetic character. I always enjoyed her charisma.Ayaka is the obnoxious president of the Second Newspaper Club and basically screws over her club members all of the time by provoking the student council president. I guess I really only enjoy her for her unique design, sporting light cyan hair, yellow eyes and skin tone that contrasts fairly well. She is just pleasant to look at overall. Really wish she had more personality. For some strange reason, I ship her with the male lead, despite their status as relatives. Though in Japan, cousins are basically no different from other women if memory serves me right.Fumi is, um, different in a ""we are trying something fresh"" kind of way. She brings lots of Japanese history into her dialogue for life opinions and is surprisingly diligent for the character type she is representing, sporting the biggest breasts in the group and usually sorts out the chaos that occurs in the club. Her design is pretty adorable as well, as opposed to hot, due to the nature of her character. If anyone, Ayaka has the most advantage for being the ""hottest"" girl in the anime since you, well, see the most of her throughout. She has a little sister as well, but the anime does not use her.Rino is the one I grew to dislike the most, as she also managed to shave points off my overall score due to her characteristics alone. She has the most generic personality among the group and has my least favorite trope in any romance anime ever, despite this anime not even aiming at that. She is the one who gets angry at the male lead for gawking at other women, so I expect others to not enjoy her presence either.And I mean she gets angry whenever ANYTHING the viewer could consider remotely sexual is occurring. One instance, for example, one of the girls was harassing the other (despite not being in that genre, groping does happen a lot) and Rino was very quick to judge the male lead. Simple enough. Then there was a scene where Itsuki was hugging the male lead and she still had the audacity to judge him for something as basic as a warm embrace. Granted, Itsuki did kind of jump all over him, arms and legs wrapped around, but her character is so innocent that you know she did not mean anything with the inadvertent groping. And the way she was hugging him is kind of similar to how a child would hug an adult that they have not seen in a long time, albeit less wiggly.I would forgive this, and just assume Rino is stringent by default, if it weren\'t for her also liking the male lead. And thus, it falls into the trope that I hate the most, being the tsundere that never admits her feelings throughout the whole anime, but it is very, very obvious to the viewer and everyone else in the anime. She accidentally confesses at one point during a comedy scene, but that is the most development the romance has. This whole garble alone made me have to write way longer about Rino than anyone else.Emi is the last ""main"" character, so to speak. Though she is not a member of the club, she basically becomes a pseudo-member when she starts joining their activities after her late debut into the anime. And her presence is, um, tolerable I suppose. She tries to mix a lot of personality types, but they come out flat and unmemorable. Her sole purpose in the anime is to be the ""outsider"" that assists the club and also shifts the anime into Ecchi more than any other character did prior. She also goes nude at one point, alongside trying to strip a lot throughout, so I guess if you are into that kind of thing, look no further than Emi, president of the Art Club.Oddly enough, she is in the opening and closing songs from the beginning, which only further raises the question of why she was introduced so late into the anime if she was going to appear in every subsequent episode following her debut. I do not mind it when an anime gets creative and adds in more main characters out of the blue, but her entry was so late that there was really not enough time to love her character, even if you tried to. She just missed out on a lot of the better moments the anime had during the first half and I feel she could have contributed better to those. I can not even imagine how misleading it must have been for viewers to see her in the opening and closing credits, but not be introduced to her for about a couple of months.I would talk about the male character, but if I am too lazy to even remember his name, then I doubt I could write much about him. The only thing I enjoyed about him was that, well he still had a bit of the wimpy trait found in typical male leads of harems, he was not afraid to stand up for himself as well. He never came off as too submissive, though his role still felt a bit minor in contrast to the girls. Maybe if he actually dated Rino by the ending, alongside having adequate development with her, I would have been more optimistic about him.Other recurring characters are rather boring and I do not remember any of their names. Not in a sense similar to the male lead, however, as I could at least think of his if I took the time to remember. But, doing that right now with these ones, I genuinely can\'t remember any of their names. They kind of dipped in and out of the anime at times, serving purely as comical relief or plot devices.I consider Jinsei above average, simply because it managed to crack a laugh out of me quite a bit. I only judge it poorly based on certain conventions it has that make me dislike it a bit more than I expected to. However, this anime does kind of have a good enough vibe where I could suggest it to newcomers of anime. Well it may come off as mediocre to veterans due to some generic tropes and adequate writing, newcomers of anime may find something very enjoyable here since it spices things up just enough to feel fresh. But, if you have even a little bit of experience with anime, I would suggest something else. Jinsei is more of a fill-in anime for when you have nothing else to watch, for anyone that is a veteran or slightly below that. soon as you start watching. So, don\'t expect any character backstory.

Although the characters are not exactly annoying, I\'d say they all lack personality.Regarding the anime itself, it constantly says ""check our website to see more"" like, wth am I watching this then, just put it here already. This anime is about a school club that reads some letters and give advice, and it\'s not funny nor interesting in any way I\'d say. It\'s not completely boring either,...but it\'s not good as other animes of this kind.The art is good, the op is so-so, the ed is horrible, the humor is meh with few exceptions, and the characters are really lame, except Ikumi who I would say that she made this show somewhat enjoyable. but it\'s not good as other animes of this kind.The art is good, the op is so-so, the ed is horrible, the humor is meh with few exceptions, and the characters are really lame, except Ikumi who I would say that she made this show somewhat enjoyable.']"
IS: Infinite Stratos 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/18247/IS__Infinite_Stratos_2,"['Infinite Stratos 2 is the anime equivalent of a lobotomy. An anime so insipid, so devoid of intelligent thought that a trip to the garbage can would likely yield something more interesting. Maybe you\'ll feel dirty afterwards, but hey, at least you won\'t receive brain damage for it.I struggle to think of a single good thing to say when describing Infinite Stratos 2. Even the absolute worst of the medium (from the infamous Mars of Destruction to the nonsensical Cipher) can at least be laughed at in their awfulness. Not Infinite Stratos. It is everything wrong with the harem genre and the anime industry...as a whole, assembled into one cretinous pile of filth. You would need standards so low that they pass the Earth\'s core and leave the other side of the planet in order to appreciate this trash. Nothing went right. Everything went wrong. Hell, this is awful even by the first season\'s standards.Allow me to describe one of Infinite Stratos\' most asinine scenes. In the sixth episode, Charlotte finds herself in a situation where her panties have magically disappeared. Rather than simply tell Ichika the situation like any sensible person would, she convinces herself that lifting her skirt and directly showing him is the only way to get her point across. Ichika does as she asks and looks. Her response? ""Pervert!""Another scene involves Ichika being forced to take body measurements of all the girls in the school (which every single one of them is happy about for some incomprehensible reason). He closes his eyes, so embarrassed by female cleavage, thinking to himself that a measuring tape does not require eyes to see. His complete lack of understanding about human anatomy results in him fondling the girl. Every single member of his harem then appears out of thin-air and catches him in the act, screaming and assaulting him as the camera pans away.Even from the very first episode, we know that a trainwreck awaits. The antagonist walks down a dark corridor and meets five soldiers armed with assault rifles. They open fire... and all the bullets somehow manage to land in front of her feet or behind her. She jumps into the air, pulls out two pistols and shoots them all with perfect accuracy. Yep. Even the most brainless of Hollywood blockbusters aim for better than this, but I suppose Infinite Stratos never cared for quality in the first place.The final episode is the most brain-damaging of all. The antagonist\'s sidekick willingly reveals to one of the girls the location of a hidden bomb, and the main antagonist then unleashes a laser attack on thirty or forty armed mech soldiers, annihilating them all instantly. Of course Ichika (the most worthless soldier in the entire school) and the members of his harem can take her on in a one-on-one fight, however. As the final insult to the audience\'s intelligence, a deus ex machina unfolds, placed in direct sight of the enemy at the most convenient time possible. They then escape, and the story ends with a random onsen scene wherein Ichika passes out in the girl\'s bath. OK.I do not know how a show so stupid could have ever been produced. Even putting aside the abysmal writing, the harem aspect (the anime\'s sole appeal) fares no better. The two new additions to his harem (Tatenashi and Kanzashi) suddenly fall in love with Ichika for no bloody reason at all. In the case of Kanzashi, all Ichika ever had to do was smile a lot and play the white knight role once for her to be head over heels for him. There are so many damn members to his harem that you may as well just throw in the entire school at this point. What do they even see in Ichika, anyway? He is one of the most insipid protagonists ever created, absent of any personality. The animators should have just drawn a rock instead - at least that way there would be one less thing to infuriate the audience.Aside from having the intellect of a toddler, Ichika has the maturity of one, too. He is so adverse to any female contact (even visibly cringing in one scene where a girl\'s breasts rub against his arm) that you would ordinarily assume he is a homosexual. The fact that he has seven girls blatantly chasing after him and does not recognise it is a testament to how dreadful his characterisation is. A decent harem series would have the protagonist aware long before this point, if not already actively pursuing one of the girls. Future harem anime should take notes from Sora no Otoshimono and HenNeko, and treat Infinite Stratos like the plague that it is.Unsurprisingly, the female characters are just as bad. Even the two with a brain (Houki and Charlotte) inevitably fall victim to the show\'s abysmal writing. The most obnoxious is by far Cecilia, her voice so excruciating that it would be more appropriate in the 9 Circles of Hell. Lin on the other hand has about as much presence as a shadow while Kanzashi lacks any sort of personality or defining feature except ""has glasses"".Infinite Stratos 2 is terrible even from a technical perspective. All of the action scenes are rendered in low-budget CG and many times the characters\' faces will look as if they were drawn by a 10-year-old with a cheap ""How to Draw Manga"" textbook. The soundtrack is also rubbish and comprises mainly of elevator music and a tuba endlessly making the same two-three notes. During the action scenes, the music is so turgid and over-dramatic that it almost becomes hilarious when combined with the infantile dialogue.It is rare to find an anime as bad as Infinite Stratos. It is the exact kind of tripe that gives anime such a bad image in mainstream society. Regardless of whether you enjoy the harem genre or despise it, absolutely nothing of value will be found here. Even as mindless entertainment it fails miserably. Avoid it like the plague, or better yet, convince yourself that it doesn\'t even exist. You will save yourself some sanity that way.If this is the future of the anime industry, then god help us. as a whole, assembled into one cretinous pile of filth. You would need standards so low that they pass the Earth\'s core and leave the other side of the planet in order to appreciate this trash. Nothing went right. Everything went wrong. Hell, this is awful even by the first season\'s standards.Allow me to describe one of Infinite Stratos\' most asinine scenes. In the sixth episode, Charlotte finds herself in a situation where her panties have magically disappeared. Rather than simply tell Ichika the situation like any sensible person would, she convinces herself that lifting her skirt and directly showing him is the only way to get her point across. Ichika does as she asks and looks. Her response? ""Pervert!""Another scene involves Ichika being forced to take body measurements of all the girls in the school (which every single one of them is happy about for some incomprehensible reason). He closes his eyes, so embarrassed by female cleavage, thinking to himself that a measuring tape does not require eyes to see. His complete lack of understanding about human anatomy results in him fondling the girl. Every single member of his harem then appears out of thin-air and catches him in the act, screaming and assaulting him as the camera pans away.Even from the very first episode, we know that a trainwreck awaits. The antagonist walks down a dark corridor and meets five soldiers armed with assault rifles. They open fire... and all the bullets somehow manage to land in front of her feet or behind her. She jumps into the air, pulls out two pistols and shoots them all with perfect accuracy. Yep. Even the most brainless of Hollywood blockbusters aim for better than this, but I suppose Infinite Stratos never cared for quality in the first place.The final episode is the most brain-damaging of all. The antagonist\'s sidekick willingly reveals to one of the girls the location of a hidden bomb, and the main antagonist then unleashes a laser attack on thirty or forty armed mech soldiers, annihilating them all instantly. Of course Ichika (the most worthless soldier in the entire school) and the members of his harem can take her on in a one-on-one fight, however. As the final insult to the audience\'s intelligence, a deus ex machina unfolds, placed in direct sight of the enemy at the most convenient time possible.

Though many anime fans didn’t love the latter because of this specific trope, the former focused on the anime community with its quirky characters. Nowadays, the harem genre isn’t as it once was, not in terms of merit but popularity. Once in a while, we get trying to put different ideas on viewing the genre in terms of parody, comedy, and character development. But some don’t...try to do anything unique to it as a whole and most likely felt like it could’ve been a lost harem idea back in 2002.Now we have the 2nd season of Infinite Stratos. The continuation of a series that most people, even fans of Harem, show no restraint in voicing their hatred of it. Somehow, it has gone to sell like hotcakes despite being anything more than drab and generic. The one question that pops into my head is: Why is this show getting all of the attention from people buying up the OVAs and BDs when there are better harem shows out there and continue to this day?Some that come to mind are Hentai Ouji, Sora no Otoshimono, To Love Ru Darkness, Kore wa Zombie, and Haganai. All of which have an infinite amount of personality and creativity to their comedic writing and overall creative charisma that the series could ever have in its little world. But, of course, I’d have to explain why I think of Infinite Stratos this way, but I only bring this whole comparison thing up because there isn’t that much to say about this next installment in the franchise. Other than the fact that it pales in comparison to shows like it.There are indeed some awful characteristics to be made public about the 2nd season. It’s pretty apparent how poorly written the story is for Infinite Stratos. What makes it even more perplexing is just how there’s so little plot, to begin with, and what little serious drama that is present comes across as muddled and overly not well-paced at all. All it is is just the characters going through different kinds of problems that typically might involve Ichika to help them, which eventually leads to him in a suggestive situation. These situations involve him getting kicked or beaten to a bloody pulp for accidentally changing or saying something that made them blush. From what you could get out of this description I made, you might think that they’re sacrificing the plot to emphasize comedy that can succeed. Unfortunately, this sacrifice only provided a lukewarm reception in all aspects.The way to describe the comedy in Infinite Stratos in one word is “haphazard.” There are hardly any clever gags to most of the jokes to the point where it’s as if the writers copy-and-pasted the jokes on the scene in question and prayed that the audience would get a laugh from it. A few do garner a little chuckle here and there, but the vast majority don’t even deserve a snicker. We’ve all seen the typical Onsen and the accidental peeking scene in every harem show, so why keep milking it to the people who are already tired of it? I’m sure many people don’t mind that kind of humor, but there comes a time when they need to inject new life into these kinds of jokes. If not, it will be the equivalent of getting your face passively slapped multiple times by the people who come up with this day after day.The writers do not put any new effort into the jokes themselves, but even the ones they wrote are so messy and confused about their reason for existing in the first place. One prime example is when Charlotte forgot to wear her panties, and she’s too embarrassed to tell Ichika. For some reason, that is never explained. After noting Laura, she finds out later that they are back on and pulls up her skirt and tells Ichika to look at them even though he doesn’t want to. Despite this, she still feels embarrassed and calls him a pervert, despite the fact she had no problem telling him to look. It’s almost as if the writers forgot what the punchline was supposed to be and, in a desperate attempt to be smart, just with the generic route of letting Charlotte call him a pervert for no reason. Good job on that one.With the writing automatically becoming a one-trick pony, the overall character cast doesn't provide better reception, but a few do get some laughs. The new character Sarashiki is quite humorous in her attempts to be sneaky and conniving in messing with Ichika and his romances, even with her muddled reasoning for liking Ichika in the first place. But the charms stop there in the 2nd half when her appearances are only brief. We have to sit through her sister, who doesn’t have anything going for her except that she’s there for the 2nd to the last arc for no reason. As for the rest don’t improve from the 1st season, nor do they decline in quality since they weren’t even that strong to be with other than cute girls. Lingyin hardly makes an impression this season, indicating that she might have been the least popular of the girls, even though Cecilla would’ve been the more reasonable choice.Then we have Ichika, the main protagonist, just about the by-the-book harem protagonist that you could find in the entire catalog of dense male protagonists. It’s safe to say that Ichika represents what most otaku love to see, a poor guy who acts so brainless to the male hormones that he can’t even muster up the courage to express his genuine emotions to feel better about themselves. Here’s a unique idea: How about a strong male protagonist who acts like an actual male would in that typical scenario? Now I’m not saying that being a total pervert is a good thing, nor does this indicate that we need more protagonists to think of females as sex objects. But when you’re like me, and you constantly see someone like Ichika that does the same shtick where he always acts like he doesn’t have any interest in any of the girls yet somehow later on does. He can’t find the courage to admit it openly. You’d think that we would be tired of this kind of thing around 2005, but nope.The technical prowess of the show isn’t of any exceptional value because of the generic designs of the mechs, the average attempts on CG, and the average character designs. The girl designs are colorful and pleasant to look at. The opening and ending animation is almost like they recycled previous ones from the first season. Then we have the ensemble cast, to which I must ask how, in the name of all that is good and decent, these talented voice actresses sign up again for this? Granted, Kana Hanazawa is in every show that comes out these days. Still, actresses like Yoko Hikasa, Chiwa Saito, and Inoue Marina deserve better in something else than this. They attempt to be charming as usual, but it doesn’t dull out the pain of going through mediocrity even with those in mind.Infinite Stratos 2 could’ve been an attempt to pull out a full-blown rant into tearing this show apart like some of my colleagues are willing to do, but in all honesty, you could sit through way worse as far as harems go. You could probably dig deeper into the lost collection of thrown-out harem shows that the studios have dumped and see how much worse they can be. However, since Infinite Stratos is headed by a well-known studio, 8bit, it can be seen as a high-profile failure to reboot the series for a second season that was in dire straits of regaining some merit. Not something that I would ever watch fully again in my life, maybe only a few amusing clips of it, but as I said before, I’ve seen way worse.Grade: D+ try to do anything unique to it as a whole and most likely felt like it could’ve been a lost harem idea back in 2002.Now we have the 2nd season of Infinite Stratos.

Not something that I would ever watch fully again in my life, maybe only a few amusing clips of it, but as I said before, I’ve seen way worse.Grade: D+"", 'Chances are that if you are plan on watching Infinite Stratos 2, you probably want to see how the story goes on between Ichika and the friends he has made at IS Academy in this brand new adventure. After all, season 1 didn’t end with an exactly a high note with its indecisive conclusion. Yes, I’m talking about Ichika and his dense mind along with the irrational decisions he makes. The story itself only had some moments that shined while others fell under the typical harem tropes with little development. Unfortunately, Infinite Stratos 2 doesn’t get any better. In fact, it went backwards and became...even worse. It’s a continuation of a story that set itself on a time bomb ticking away at its destruction.Infinite Stratos 2 is the sequel of the first season based off of the light novel in the same name written by Izuru Yumizuru. The series continues directly from season 1 with a young man named Orimura Ichika. To refresh some memory, Ichika is the first male pilot of the exoskeleton mech known as the IS (Infinite Stratos). Because the system was designed for female pilots, Ichika becomes the first user of the technology.  The government obviously has plans for him and sent him directly to the world famous IS Academy. That means it’s a paradise for him because he is set to an academy where everywhere around him is: girls.Like I mentioned previously, this series begins exactly where the first season left off. Ichika is still the talk of the academy because of his status and kindness. It’s no surprise that girls are interested in him in some way because most if not all of them came from a girls-only school previously. Among these girls include the return of the five female protagonists known as Houki, Cecilia, Ling, Charlotte, and Laura. Although most of them had some spotlights in season 1, this sequel puts them to shame. Their development is in ashes because the a big chunk of the series concentrates on some nonsense where everyone tries to get Ichika’s attention. Unfortunately, Ichika is dense as ever and hardly understands any of the girls’ attempts. In fact, he seems them a sign of gratitude while all the while being ignorant of its intentions. This comes early in the series in many shapes and sizes. These include the typical pool episode, absurd cosplays, surprise party extravaganza with absurd gags, and even an entire episode dedicated to a pair of panties plying around the lost & found game. While all this seems to fun at first, it quickly grows old because of the lack of depth in its fun.The comedy is also killed thanks to Ichika’s dense personality.On more a directional side, the series does contain a story that expands further somewhat. Even in harem series like this, there is a story because the concept is serious with the IS being part of the system. In this sequel, the story introduces two new characters - one of them with an authoritative control, skill of a pilot, and ability to flirt with Ichika like no tomorrow. There’s some problems wrong with her character though. For one thing, she seems almost too perfect. Furthermore, Ichika is confused throughout the series as to her true intentions. Her smile often seems to be a like a mask that hides her purpose as a facade. But behind that smile also lies a girl whose skills is unrivaled in IS combat. To make matter worse for the girls though, she seems to be also possesses the skill to tame all of Ichika’s harem. Initially, she stands out as the boss of the series, like a game that the girls must overcome.On the other hand, there is also another character that represents the opposite of her. It’s quite odd seeing Ichika interact with her as someone that hardly gives him any attention. In many ways, she represents the opposite of the typical girls in this harem anime.To say that Infinite Stratos 2 completely sicks under the ocean with no chance of salvage is also an exaggeration though. Despite the lack of development or engaging storyline, the sequel does expand on a more darker side as the characters learns the existence of an organization. Their purpose stands for what terrorism is and their actions speaks louder than words. In fact, this organization declares war against IS Academy along with Ichika and his friends. There is also some mystery related to one particular member of this organization whom bares a strikingly similar appearance to another character from the series. Calling herself by a name that shocks Ichika, she becomes a pivotal antagonist that brings out the dark side of IS.Action wise, Infinite Stratos surprisingly has some decent movements with its mechanics. The system itself is designed to fight efficiently in almost any circumstances. Also depending on the skill of the user, each IS has its own specialization or customized weapon that can inflict additional damage. In this sequel, new models are introduced with even more devastating abilities. The new models also gives them an impressive look from its exterior with its threatening design. Even with the harem tropes all over the place, the IS does stand in as a prominent factor as each time they are shown on screen, the camera angles focus exclusively on them with a more detailed look.Unfortunately, that’s not where the only place where the camera points to...The fanservice is all over the place in this sequel. It shouldn’t surprise viewers considering the way season one was handled. However, the show goes on with even from the beginning such as Laura crawling into Ichika’s bed or the swimsuits coming off just because. Cosplay also seems to make its way into this sequel because the show wants to try out some new ideas to cover all the field of a harem anime. This includes the form of odd animal outfits with skin bearing. There’s a hidden reason behind this but is definitely one that Ichika is not pleased with. Even when he doesn’t try it, Ichika is the center of attention just because of who he is. There’s almost no credibility in any of the characters’ attachment to Ichika in this sequel either thanks to a lack of exploration in their past/histories with Ichika. The characterization is shallow and doesn’t get anywhere. Even when there’s some hope, there are those moment killers (thanks to our new characters) that ruins the fun for Ichika; if he even depicts as fun in the first place. It’s absurd, idiotic, and a disgrace to the main story.Artwork wise, the series maintain the same style as the original. What that means is the characters all retain their generic designs. Most of them retain the way they still look while new characters make their way with their flashy introductions. The new threat that is presented in this sequel does bring out a dangerous outlook but also confusion as one of the characters has a familiar outlook. Unfortunately, her character is never really explained at all so you’ll be guessing who she is towards the end. Our main male protagonist Ichika doesn’t even change an inch in either his outer or inner appearance. There’s little to in depth with any of the designs besides the Infinite Stratos models. Luckily, the backgrounds of the series is rich enough to give the feeling of a high level technology environment. The way both the inner and outer exterior of Infinite Stratos Academy is designed stays true to its terms by standards of high level technology. Unfortunately, that doesn’t really mean much with its generic traits that is thrown almost everywhere artistically.The standards of its soundtrack has a so-so presentation judging by the OST. Most of the action scenes contains an explosive tone thanks to its intensity. Like mentioned before, the primary concept of IS means serious business so the series portrays it seriously with its standards. The OP song True Blue Traveler foreshadows some ideas of what to expect from season 2 while at the same time throws generic concepts all over the place. Kouki Uchiyama also returns as the voice actor of Ichika whom surprisingly has a decent acting ability that portrays the typical harem lead well. New characters voiced by Chiwa Sato and Suzuko Mimori also represents their characters well despite their opposite personalities. To say the least, the soundtrack department isn’t half bad but honestly, that isn’t saying much.Finishing this series should only be a priority if you want to see how the franchise concludes rather than expecting greatness from it. There’s nothing really great about this sequel considering its lack of characterization, poorly constructed plot clustered with fan service , generic subplots, and weak progression. This adaptation also omits some parts from the light novel that could have enhanced the comedic side of the sequel. Unfortunately, it backfires in the end. There’s no doubt some fans will be disappointed at how this show turned out to be. Infinite Stratos 2 is a perfect example of an adaptation gone wrong with no redemption. There might not of been infinite possibilities to expand this continuation. However, the excuse of its story is beyond miserable. So if you plan to watch this series, I’d recommend you to hit the fast forward to save some time. Time for you isn’t infinite after all… even worse.

Calling herself by a name that shocks Ichika, she becomes a pivotal antagonist that brings out the dark side of IS.Action wise, Infinite Stratos surprisingly has some decent movements with its mechanics. The system itself is designed to fight efficiently in almost any circumstances. Also depending on the skill of the user, each IS has its own specialization or customized weapon that can inflict additional damage. In this sequel, new models are introduced with even more devastating abilities. The new models also gives them an impressive look from its exterior with its threatening design. Even with the harem tropes all over the place, the IS does stand in as a prominent factor as each time they are shown on screen, the camera angles focus exclusively on them with a more detailed look.Unfortunately, that’s not where the only place where the camera points to...The fanservice is all over the place in this sequel. It shouldn’t surprise viewers considering the way season one was handled. However, the show goes on with even from the beginning such as Laura crawling into Ichika’s bed or the swimsuits coming off just because. Cosplay also seems to make its way into this sequel because the show wants to try out some new ideas to cover all the field of a harem anime. This includes the form of odd animal outfits with skin bearing. There’s a hidden reason behind this but is definitely one that Ichika is not pleased with. Even when he doesn’t try it, Ichika is the center of attention just because of who he is. There’s almost no credibility in any of the characters’ attachment to Ichika in this sequel either thanks to a lack of exploration in their past/histories with Ichika. The characterization is shallow and doesn’t get anywhere. Even when there’s some hope, there are those moment killers (thanks to our new characters) that ruins the fun for Ichika; if he even depicts as fun in the first place. It’s absurd, idiotic, and a disgrace to the main story.Artwork wise, the series maintain the same style as the original. What that means is the characters all retain their generic designs. Most of them retain the way they still look while new characters make their way with their flashy introductions. The new threat that is presented in this sequel does bring out a dangerous outlook but also confusion as one of the characters has a familiar outlook. Unfortunately, her character is never really explained at all so you’ll be guessing who she is towards the end. Our main male protagonist Ichika doesn’t even change an inch in either his outer or inner appearance. There’s little to in depth with any of the designs besides the Infinite Stratos models. Luckily, the backgrounds of the series is rich enough to give the feeling of a high level technology environment. The way both the inner and outer exterior of Infinite Stratos Academy is designed stays true to its terms by standards of high level technology. Unfortunately, that doesn’t really mean much with its generic traits that is thrown almost everywhere artistically.The standards of its soundtrack has a so-so presentation judging by the OST. Most of the action scenes contains an explosive tone thanks to its intensity. Like mentioned before, the primary concept of IS means serious business so the series portrays it seriously with its standards. The OP song True Blue Traveler foreshadows some ideas of what to expect from season 2 while at the same time throws generic concepts all over the place. Kouki Uchiyama also returns as the voice actor of Ichika whom surprisingly has a decent acting ability that portrays the typical harem lead well. New characters voiced by Chiwa Sato and Suzuko Mimori also represents their characters well despite their opposite personalities. To say the least, the soundtrack department isn’t half bad but honestly, that isn’t saying much.Finishing this series should only be a priority if you want to see how the franchise concludes rather than expecting greatness from it. There’s nothing really great about this sequel considering its lack of characterization, poorly constructed plot clustered with fan service , generic subplots, and weak progression. This adaptation also omits some parts from the light novel that could have enhanced the comedic side of the sequel. Unfortunately, it backfires in the end. There’s no doubt some fans will be disappointed at how this show turned out to be. Infinite Stratos 2 is a perfect example of an adaptation gone wrong with no redemption. There might not of been infinite possibilities to expand this continuation. However, the excuse of its story is beyond miserable. So if you plan to watch this series, I’d recommend you to hit the fast forward to save some time. Time for you isn’t infinite after all…', ""Sometimes at night when I'm having trouble sleeping, I find myself wondering; if you could shove in as many dere heroines as possible (with individual fanservice, of course) into an anime, what would it look like? My highly philosophical questions of utter importance have been answered: IS 2. In a way, I'm genuinely impressed. How did they think of this? Or rather, how did they not think of anything else than stereotypical characters falling in love with the main character which, coincidentally, has the stereotypical brain that consists of concrete. Is he supposed to be portrayed as stupid? If so, apologize to the stupid people,...as they (the whole population of idiots) have been portrayed faultly.I had somewhat high hopes for the first season of IS, since it sounded cool for a 16-year-old me, and they even managed to get me to watch through it without smashing my head into a wall. Impressive. Now, with a critical eye to it as well, I'm disappointed in the 16-year-old me. This entire series has been nothing but a disgrace. The first season of IS did indeed try to progress, albeit slowly, but there was without a doubt some progress. The second season just seems like the producers gave up and threw girls at the fans. Yay, sex and stuff. Although I'm used to fanservice taking place more and more in anime (which, by the way, is not a good thing), IS 2 is on a whole new level. As I said, it feels like they simply threw the storyboard away and let everything happen as it happened. Like they didn't give a shit.If there's anything good (or rather, something to not really complain about) in IS 2, it ought to be the animation. It would literally be better if the whole series were the fighting scenes combined into one long (not really) fight. But noooooooo, the producers chose to draw figure-8's and got a brilliant idea.I give IS2 the final rating suicidal tendencies out of 10. as they (the whole population of idiots) have been portrayed faultly.I had somewhat high hopes for the first season of IS, since it sounded cool for a 16-year-old me, and they even managed to get me to watch through it without smashing my head into a wall.

I can't help but feel the need to throw this series a life-line. For a summary skip to 'enjoyment' section.Story: 5The only word I can think of to describe the story in IS2 in a nut-shell would have to be 'filler'.The story is effectively non-existent consisting mostly of the girls (Ichika's harem - which he remains completely oblivious to as is now a custom with harems echii or not as it would seem) throwing their...boobs and panties thrown in every possible direction with the occasional fight here and there... (here it comes) ... HOWEVER...  whilst this season is effectively fan-service there is a small plot running throughout that left me wondering 'how long until #### goes down' with a sense of excitement.In addition a number of the antics that were thrown into the mix left me laughing or giggling at the very least and I liked the art quite a lot too.I think the issue people have here is that things don't 'go down' until the end where things finally begin to heat up, but even then there isn't a conclusive end to the arc... This leaves me with the feeling that the producers are planning to develop it in a third season (or at-least I hope - I'm not sure how closely it follows the manga either). I know its hopeful but it really could pull the series back into perspective story wise.Art: 8Nice art work which felt fluent and well drawn throughout the series with some nice detail on the IS's (which are used more than you might think they would after reading comments about the story). The characters looked fairly good including in any echii scenes for those who are interested.Sound: 6Sound was average in all honesty with ok intro and outro music. Although some credit has to be given to the voice actors who did a decent job (I'd be shocked if they didn't considering some of the talent there).character: 5All of the characters remain the same throughout this season as you (probably and if you haven't then go look at the first series) saw at the end of the first without any character development what so ever; even the 'near-ish romantic' bit is completely forgotten about for all those hopefuls.The only glint of development from season 1's characters arises from Ichika's big sis which is towards the end if at-all.The saving grace (if it can be called that) is the introduction of two new characters of which one shows some development over a few episodes.Enjoyment: 8Overall despite a stagnant story, very little character development and feeling slightly let-down from season 1 as a result... I somehow really enjoyed this series to put it bluntly. I loved some of the scenario's however cliche some of them may be simply because of how they were executed. I liked the well-drawn art style and loved the battles that were included in it (though I wish the battles were focused on a little more and I've seen more 'epic battles' in other anime). I can't quite explain it... All I can say is that despite its criticisms IS2 is still worth a watch & that I'm still left wanting a season 3. boobs and panties thrown in every possible direction with the occasional fight here and there...

This sequel to IS has the same amount of bullshit as Old McDonald\'s farm. Once you\'re on the tip of your chair or what ever you\'re sitting on, it pushes you back down making you say ""Really...you\'re really going to do that"". Of course this isn\'t the first time it did this *cough* season one *cough* but this time I was really,really, really let down.The story from season one.... really didn\'t move. Even though the series did have some highlights like mecha fights, getting chased...by girls, misunderstandings...., and...how Cecilia can\'t cook to save her life. All those high...lights... But don\'t worry guys and girls! We have two new characters!Like most sequels to any animes, Infinite Stratos also gives us new characters, two new characters. You guessed it! A student council president and her sister! The Sarashiki sisters (Tatenashi and Kanzashi) both have blue hair and are totally ""totes"" for Ichika...you know like how the rest of the school is....The other characters, that play as the villain,Madoka Orimura, who obviously is not Chifuyu and Ichika sister, does not get much screening time. And once she does, she is there to just make shit happen. Leaving out explanations, and leaving the viewers with sooooo much questions just to be turned down with ass and tit shots. (Did I mention that Ichika forgets his own birthday. Seriously, who does that?)You know the art was the only thing this anime could have kept going on. The art was pretty much on par as any 8-Bit producers want it to be.

Honestly, my thoughts haven\'t changed since season one nor has my enjoyment. I have read a few pages of the light novels and they are pretty much the same. Really disappointing but really I wasn\'t hoping much, just a little. And that little hope got tossed out to the nearest four way intersection, right in the middle of street. The reason why I was hoping just a little change, was because of some other series with the same genres and elements, changed during the second season.

Yes, only if you like to lose more brain cells.', ""With an ending as open as Infinite Stratos's was, there was a lot to expect when the sequel was announced a little over a year later. As with most sequels, people come to expect that with the introductions and character building out of the way, a fresh start can open new possibilities for the title to showcase with more air time. Unfortunately, there are titles that take advantage of this gargantuan amount of free space and use it to try and attract a larger audience through obscene amounts of fan service and the unnecessary plot devices that arise out of it. While these types of...sequels are fine and dandy toward those who expect nothing of the series, Infinite Stratos 2 tries to do the unthinkable: combine illogically contrived fan service with a full-fledged plot focus.Infinite Stratos 2 starts off where the debut season ended; with Ichika Orimura and his band of merry miracles flying through their schoolwork as if it didn't mean a thing, and to all fairness, it probably doesn't. What this anime likes to portray, especially in this current season, is the mirage of a typical harem/slice of life series with some added robotic plot devices for good measure. However, later on, it tries to force itself into a plotline involving an unknown team of evil-doers that really have no purpose in the series except for driving Ichika, the bland, uninspiring main male character, to show off his use in times of dire need; in typical shounen fashion. When a large amount of time spent on a series is contributed to fan service and moments of unrivaled bliss, it's hard to incorporate a necessary dose of serious scenarios to it. With Infinite Stratos 2, it's the equivalent of driving a monster truck into a library; it's loud, obnoxious, and ultimately as far a match as anyone could imagine.To spice up more of the fun that is Infinite Stratos, the series takes it upon itself to introduce two new characters: Tatenashi and Kanzashi Sarashiki. Conveniently enough, these two characters are sisters, which only provides an excuse to give some characterization to the younger of the two, Kanzashi. Somewhat of an instigator of the fan service that arises, Tatenashi is the self-proclaimed student body president of the school that all of the original characters attend. With that symbol of invincibility, Tatenashi places Ichika into inconvenient situations that most other males of his age group would probably trade for anything. As Tatenashi causes trouble for our hero, Kanzashi is the complete opposite, as most series like to portray this template for sisters. Kanzashi is timid, vulnerable, an introvert, and a whiz with computers. She gets the most amount of character development than any other character in the series, but only for a limited time, as is typical of harems. While Kanzashi's entire arc feels natural and fresh, Tatenashi seems to pop up out of nowhere whenever both trouble and an instance for fan service comes to fruition. Overall, they're mostly remembered for their blue hair.Of course, all of the fan service can't be compared to the original source of the madness. Cecilia, Laura, Charlotte, Houki, and Lingyin are as presentable as ever whenever meaningless plot shows its ugly face. Throughout this season, however, each of these character don't get an equal amount of screen time. During the first season, Ichika's childhood friend, Houki, was focused on as the prime suitor for Ichika's affection, and it seemed as though she had a good shot at him as a romantic interest. Unfortunately for those who cared, Houki is barely even shown outside of scenes where Ichika is placed in a precariously obscene situation. Lingyin is also noticeably missing from most of the series as well, with her being the least shown original character out of all of them. Cecilia, Charlotte, and Laura all get their own individual arcs of varying lengths and substance. All of them are forgettable to a point and laughably silly. It seems that Infinite Stratos 2 wanted to put more emphasis on the original characters' assets and Tatenashi moving the chaos along than trying to develop these characters into more than simply plastic.With this series being notorious for fan service, it's safe to say that the art suits the desires of those who view it. With two years difference, Infinite Stratos 2's artwork is noticeably more full of shine than its predecessor. The character designs remain the same, as though the series wanted to remain nostalgic, with the student uniforms and shaky CGI looking as though they were cut straight from the first season. What was noticeable to a point, however, was the CGI itself. What's different about the CGI within the second season is that the quality isn't different whatsoever. During minimal movements, the machines are still shaky and lazily bulky. The animation comes to shine when the action comes into view. Although, with the amount of time spent on the characters' assets, those watching could forget that the IS machines even exist. For those who are expecting any action from this series could look forward to the ending sequences of this anime. Whether or not the ending disappoints you, at least it will look presentable.Why not try and make it better? While fan service and an overexaggerated amount of female body parts isn't enough to completely disregard an anime's effort, it's hard not to cringe when an anime tries too hard to be something it isn't. Infinite Stratos 2 wants to be something fantastic, something so fantastic that it can combine fan service and dramatic, life-threatening predicaments into a giant heap of animated excellence. The harder it tries, the easier it is to expose its flaws, and it certainly has them; lots of them. Perhaps if this series tried to be one or the other, maybe it wouldn't seem so forced.

I was unfortunate to be invited in by the concept alone, expecting some good science-fiction action. I was very upset only to find it to be a very poorly written and generic harem with few redeeming qualities. However, I looked forward to the second season with almost no expectations, only to find that it had slaughtered said redeeming qualities from the first season.In case you didn\'t know what Infinite Stratos is all about, let me remind you: It\'s set in the near future where the eponymous weaponized armors are the norm in military warfare....The only drawback is that only females can pilot them, and so the Infinite Stratos Academy was founded for the sole purpose of training future pilots. However, the main protagonist, Ichika Orimura, is the only male who can pilot an IS. Throw him inside an all-girls school and harem antics ensue. Dumb, cliche harem antics.That\'s it. The first season never goes on with that premise because apparently harem is more important. Most harem anime tend to be rather flimsy when it comes to story and plot development, but in Infinite Stratos 2, ""story"" does not even exist. There\'s a group of terrorists known as Phantom Task who want to kill Ichika and his older sister, Chifuyu, for unexplained reasons. There\'s a certain plot point with a member of Phantom Task named Madoka, who is revealed to be Chifuyu\'s evil twin sister and has a vendetta against her for unexplained reason. That\'s right, ""unexplained reasons"" is pretty much how this entire season runs on. Any plot threads concerning this are left completely unfinished. Wouldn\'t it be a good idea to actually elaborate on who these guys are and why they\'re doing bad stuff? According to the writing staff, apparently not. They only take action for about less than two and a half episodes total. All other episodes is basically ""How much can we pander to the viewers\' cocks until their nutbladder explodes? I mean, nobody will care about the lack of character and plot when we can give something for our viewers to fap to every week."" A whole season of filler had better writing than this.Now the characters: First, you got Ichika himself who is just your standard harem protagonist whose about as dense as a brick. Then you got his harem; all but only one or two are nothing but generic cookie cutter stereotypes who has about as much personality as a piece of cardboard. But wait, there\'s more: They\'re unique from other harem girls in that they\'re a multinational harem! So you got the Japanese childhood friend/abusive tsundere, the German girl who hides weapons in her locker, the Chinese tsundere, the English chick, and the French reverse trap. All of them have nothing special about them and they only want Ichika because he\'s the only male in school. You might as well throw the entire student body at his bones, while you\'re at it.Production values are decent for the most part. The music is forgettable, much like the first season. One thing I actually did like about this was the IS designs and the battle scenes. Even if the harem part was badly written, the fight scenes kept me entertained, even if it isn\'t the major focus as I hoped it would. Unfortunately, harem comes above all else in Infinite Stratos, so the military warfare part is left high and dry.Infinite Stratos in general is not a good anime, let alone a good harem show. This mistake known as the second season turns it into an unsalvagable, burning wreck. There have been very few good harem anime in this day and age, but this is just another one tossed under the ""pathetic"" pile. And the second season shoved it into the ""worst ever"" pile. If 8-bit were smart, they should save themselves even more embarrassment and don\'t even bother with greenlighting a third season because it won\'t fix anything. Instead, just do the right thing and leave Infinite Stratos to die in its own filth. The only drawback is that only females can pilot them, and so the Infinite Stratos Academy was founded for the sole purpose of training future pilots.

Then you got his harem; all but only one or two are nothing but generic cookie cutter stereotypes who has about as much personality as a piece of cardboard. But wait, there\'s more: They\'re unique from other harem girls in that they\'re a multinational harem! So you got the Japanese childhood friend/abusive tsundere, the German girl who hides weapons in her locker, the Chinese tsundere, the English chick, and the French reverse trap. All of them have nothing special about them and they only want Ichika because he\'s the only male in school. You might as well throw the entire student body at his bones, while you\'re at it.Production values are decent for the most part. The music is forgettable, much like the first season. One thing I actually did like about this was the IS designs and the battle scenes. Even if the harem part was badly written, the fight scenes kept me entertained, even if it isn\'t the major focus as I hoped it would. Unfortunately, harem comes above all else in Infinite Stratos, so the military warfare part is left high and dry.Infinite Stratos in general is not a good anime, let alone a good harem show. This mistake known as the second season turns it into an unsalvagable, burning wreck. There have been very few good harem anime in this day and age, but this is just another one tossed under the ""pathetic"" pile. And the second season shoved it into the ""worst ever"" pile. If 8-bit were smart, they should save themselves even more embarrassment and don\'t even bother with greenlighting a third season because it won\'t fix anything. Instead, just do the right thing and leave Infinite Stratos to die in its own filth.', 'Wow. It\'s hard to decide where to begin. I suppose I should mention in advance that the first season of IS was one of the first anime I had ever watched, and I was naive enough to think, ""This is pretty good!"" I assumed the dialogue and plot were supposed to be cheesy and nonsensical. I laughed at what a silly guy that Ichika was! And so, after rewatching this franchise, I wish to apologize to every person that viewed my list in the last year and saw an 8 or 9. Undoubtedly, you shook your head in shame and wept at my foolishness, with...good reason.However, don\'t misunderstand me, I\'m not completely disregarding this series. I can understand the viewpoints of both those for and against this show. It\'s likeable, but please, don\'t make it out be all that great. It is not the ""bee\'s knees"", because even people of the 20\'s wowed by early Mickey Mouse cartoons would probably not be in love with this show.I\'ll lay out the few good points first. The animation is good. When I say this, I\'m mainly referring to the mecha fight scenes. This has always been the best part of IS, and it continued into the sequel. It\'s a harem, through and through. So if you\'re really into that genre, you\'ll get plenty of haremness to fill your harem quota. Plenty of women fall for the main guy. In fact, aside from his sister and the girl who invented the robot suits, there is not a single female in this show that does not show some romantic interest in our hero. Lastly, IS 2 creates some depth and plot in the new season! Hooray!Unfortunately, in order to discuss the bad stuff, I have to rip apart most of the preceding paragraph. Because IS 2 is bad. It is worse than the original. Yes, IS 1 had its flaws: a moron for a main man, lack of depth or character development, and on and on. So while IS 2 did some things slightly better, the flaws were kept and got worse.What little character depth and romantic progress from the prequel almost completely disappeared. Laura, for example, had some backstory and development. She was originally confident and somewhat headstrong and forward, despite the little attention the show gave her. IS 2 degraded her character, and gave me the impression that she was simply socially naive and blunt. Nothing new is revealed about the other girls either, nor do they do anything but drop semi-subtle romantic hints and act as comedy/fanservice tools. Speaking of which, both comedy and fanservice are reused from the first show, maybe even dumbed down a bit. If you liked the humor in IS 1, rejoice. You\'re getting the same thing this season.(One running gag is Ichika getting attacked by his harem. In the first ever episode of IS, they mention regulations and when they\'re allowed to use their suits, because they make such a big deal about how dangerous Infinite Stratos is. Naturally, this goes out the window for the sake of comedy, and in 24 episodes, the protagonist is ALMOST MURDERED 14 TIMES BY HORMONAL, LOVESICK TEENAGE GIRLS WALKING AROUND WITH THE WORLD\'S MOST ADVANCED WEAPON ON THEIR ARM.)There is kind of a plot, I\'ll give you that. But it fails. It is more present in the show than the 2-episode plot of IS 1, and yet it goes nowhere. You learn someone\'s name, and her relationship to another character, then nothing else. The bad guys attack throughout the show, but absolutely NOTHING else is revealed. The last two episodes feel incredibly rushed, except nothing really ends and you\'re left pondering the point of it all.Finally, I\'m going to torch Ichika, the protagonist. Without a doubt, the lamest and worst protagonist of any I\'ve seen in the almost 20 years I\'ve been alive. Yes, he is dumb and oblivious. He is constantly suprised, embarrassed, or confused. Apparently, his hearing should be checked because he can\'t hear the comments his harem makes in front of him to each other with clear romantic implications. Often times he plays them off or just doesn\'t react to any \'subtle\' advances, because god forbid the story advance. IS 2 also makes Ichika afraid of women and female contact at times, because his character has to stay fresh, of course. He also cannot win a fight whatsoever. He\'s pathetic. He\'s constantly being saved.Okay, rant over. Basically, there\'s a reason IS 2 can\'t even average a 7 out of 10. It\'s watchable, and it can be enjoyed, but it definitely helps if you are:-into watching terrible tv/movies-slightly masochistic-blind-deaf good reason.However, don\'t misunderstand me, I\'m not completely disregarding this series.

If you're into hot chicks, then watch this (specifically Episode 5). IS 2 is just a continuation of the first season, with no improvement, however with new characters. Amazing VAs in the series, but I didn't like the plot. I enjoyed it thanks to Charlotte Dunois and Tatenashi Sarashiki. Hopefully, season 3 would mark a big improvement to the series, and let's just hope Ichika isn't that dense anymore (it probably wouldn't happen, read the light novels/manga/wiki). GG. "", 'Bueno, as the info states this season 2 was compose of chapters from 5 to 8 of the manga and quite frankly the way studio 8-bit executed it was not very impressive compare to season 1, now, it\'s difficult to say as to whats going on in the mind of this anime\'s director, Yasuhito Kikuchi and writer, Fukihiko Shimo that they\'ve decide to come out with a season 2 where a clique harem was more profound than the action. Also, the introduction of Tatenashi didn\'t do much, for I hated her more than the antagonists called ""Phantom task,"" which brings us next subject as to...who really is Modoka Orimura? Where, there isn\'t much info about her, except that she\'s Ichika\'s twin sister, such info actually conflicts the notion that it is only Chifuyu and Ichika were the only siblings, all in all this anime has left us with a lot of loose ends where one thing conflicts another. Going back to the harem part, ok, I\'m really disappointing that the Ichika X Houki arc becomes more choice than before, in fact it wasn\'t just Houki, rather it also involves other member of the guy\'s harem where a newbie Kanzashi joins in. Ichika, for some reason become more like your typical stupid harem guy who allows two new competition to his already complicated romantic situation which proves to be quite annoying for me. So here are my ratings for this pathetic anime.Story: Mediocre 5.Because, studio 8-Bit just recycled the usual harem thing from season 1, and even with the addition of ""Phantom task,"" and the Sarashiki  sisters didn\'t help at all.Art: Good 7.It\'s only the fanservice that interest me.Sound: Good 7.Both op and ed also interests  me.Character: Pathetic 1.Ichika- usual harem guy who has gone from dumb to dumber with his harem members and not much improvement with his combat skills.Houki, Cecilia, Char, Huang and Laura...still hoping to be Ichika\'s girl.The Sarashiki sisters- with the exception of Kanzashi, Tatenashi was pretty much the girl I hate.Phantom task- if studio 8-Bit would have given them such air time in a way that they really did a lot of bad ass thing and unable to succeed, then this season 2 would have been more enjoyable to watch.Modoka- they should have added some info as how she came to be.Chifuyu and Maya- nothing from the ordinary.Enjoyment: same as above.Boring, so why did I kept watching it up to the end....well, I was hoping for some action where there will be an epic battle between Phantom Task and Ichika with his harem, too bad it ended in a cliffhanger where it\'s added OVA is yet to be shown next year 2014.Overall: sameStudio 8-Bit should never had made a season 2 this boring and just leave as a manga. Like I\'ve said season 1 was better than season 2. who really is Modoka Orimura?

You would imagine by this point that...he would undergo some kind of character development - but, in reality, he is as dense as he was in season 1. His dense nature is probably why this anime was just so unbearable - everything about him was very predictable. Someone making a move on him, for example? You can pretty much guess how he would respond.The other main characters do not change much either. They behave and act with all of their weird little strange idiosyncrasies - which is obviously fine up to a point. Their idiosyncrasies are a way for viewers to differentiate between the female leads; I guess you can call them personality ""quirks"", if you will. But where IS 2 goes wrong is that these same ""quirks"" are used over and over, up to the point where it becomes predictable and bland.There are also new characters, obviously, but their introductions into the series are incredibly forced. Orimura continues to build his harem, new villains are introduced... you know, the same old cliches and what not. Again, new characters are fine, but what is not fine is their entrance into the series. Each new character appeared in the series just for the heck of it - they were not well-integrated to the surrounding plot (if you could even call it a plot).The plot is awfully forced too. The plot is too focused too much on the fanservice/harem aspect, and thus, most of the time, it doesn\'t even seem like there is a plot most of the time. When there is an attempt to make a plot, it flowed extremely poorly - an utter and complete mess.The plot execution is flawed too. Here\'s one example (trying very hard not to spoil anything!): IS 2 attempts to incorporate a number of cut scenes but a lot of the times it is difficult to interpret their true purpose or whether they are even necessary.The only plus to IS 2 is the art and sound, and even then, there\'s nothing exceptional there. Which just tells you how bad this anime is.This anime should be a sin. I try not to give any 1\'s to any anime series, but IS 2 was just too unbearable for me.

The first two episodes were fine, but from there on it just went downhill.Story (5/10): The first season of Infinite Stratos helps to put in place most of the characters seen in Season 2. At least back then, there was something to be achieved, unlike this continuation of a series. Aside from the fact that there is a bare minimum of what a ""plot"" there is, the MAIN flaw would have to be how there is this ""alternation"" between plot and no plot every alternate episode....For example, one whole episode would be spent showing how the girls chase Ichika around, and at the last few minutes RIGHT before the credits when Ichika is alone, he gets ambushed by the enemy. And of course, the next whole episode after that is spent resolving the issue. This definitely wasn\'t the case in the first season, where there was somewhat a blend between the two in each episode.Art & Sound (8/10): Not much to point out here. Since the first season I was always a fan of how the characters were drawn and how they looked. For the soundtrack I prefer the opening and ending song of the first season as compared to this.Character (5/10): Pretty much no character development at all. Ichika is still dense as hell, like all main characters in all harem type shows. The original 5 girls from the first season are even more clingy to him this time, but with the addition of 2 more girls into the harem and slight personality changes in a few of them as the episodes progress.Enjoyment (7/10): Even though this anime is FILLED with flaws, I still enjoyed certain parts of it, laughing at how absurd some of the scenes are (those which are certainly not possible/probrable in real life). One thing is for sure though, the ending was a letdown since it wasn\'t a good one anyway.Overall (7/10): Giving it a 7/10 is really kind of stretching it, when compared to the many other masterpieces out there. Would I recommend this to the people who finished the first season? Not really. It isn\'t much of a sequel anyways.

Mixed the feelings when watching this show are.First, it was heavily criticized by the viewers it seems, and like them I totally agree with the negative point. This show was awful in its structure and totally cliché with fanservice all the way. No originality.There was a plot. We pretty much forgot about it until a few reminders sometimes, the pace is horrible. To make things worse, they rushed it totally at the end of the show, with nothing answered at all even though something was...starting to get interesting(I liked the little development at the end of episode 10, that was a pure detail but the character was one I liked and it was interesting to see more of what she can do).And there\'s a awful lot of useless episodes, the main one, totally ridicule, being the one with Charlotte and her disappeared panties, which I didn\'t enjoy at all... There are a lot of cheesy situations too, while I don\'t mind, sometimes it\'s a bit too much (still Charlotte\'s episode, or the measurements scene, as said by other reviewers. Hell, good thing the action was off-screen because I don\'t even know HOW he can lack anatomy knowledge to the point of mistaking it this much and how he ends up doing what he does).Honestly , a few less of those nonsense and a bit more development on the plot or better introduced gags would be welcome. At least, I hope they\'ll make a season 3 because else that would just be truly a pure shitty show judging from how it ends with questions. TO me, it\'s bad, but there\'s worse, and I hope they\'ll make better in S3. I think this season would have gained some benefits from getting 24 episodes instead of 12 (well, 24 is a bit much, more like 20. Ep 13-15 being plot related to develop a bit of what was going on at the end of 12, 16-17 being a bit more comedy-centered, and back to the plot on 18 to 20 to reveal the intentions, motivations, and some final fights)Yet, I liked it. Well, not as much as I liked others harem shows, but well... aside from the few useless episodes, I liked the cliché setting. Yeah, sure, no originality, but why always seeking pure originality? It\'s also rather enjoyable sometimes to see good ol\' scenes in other shows, when you enjoy the genre.Like, I dunno, Death note. Death Note was a nice thrilling story and I liked it. Then Lost Brain was published with a similar plot (student with great intellect fooling the police with great ""tactics"" and all), and everyone was like ""this is just a death note copy with hypnosis instead of killing books"". Heck, I liked it because it was similar to Death Note! The ""it\'s not original so I don\'t like it and don\'t want to see it"" mentality is comprehensible, but then I think it\'s a bit of a waste as you can never be allowed to get into the same ambiance than the first you ever read in that style.So yeah, I enjoy seeing the harem cliché, that\'s rather funny seeing them back. Although I have to say a lot of the gags were bad-written, some were quite enjoyable anyway, as some relaxing show.I can understand the lassitude of always seeing the same things, and if you\'re watching a lot of harem oriented shows recently, I suggest you don\'t watch IS. Not now. What I usually do is getting into periods of anime style: watching a few shows of serious, good plot without much of a comedy (duno, for example, Psycho Pass, Kara no Kyoukai, Shingeki no Kyojin), and then switch the change to mood and not being too overwhelmed by the heaviness, dark ambiance of those animes, by watching a few lighter things, like harem, simple romantic comedy, stories with a plot but still having somewhat of a plot or pure WTF colorful shows (dunno, for example, watching To love, Dog Days, and D frag).So indeed the harem cliche was strong, but I did enjoy quite a lot IS and IS2, because that has been a while since I\'ve watched a good old harem show with colorful characters like this. The last light animes that I saw were a bit less cliché, but not as lively in consequence as there\'s not a whole bunch of girls trying to get your attention, more like a few scenes here and there without much boldness coming from them.  So it was kinda refreshing seeing a show like IS. Back to IS2, I was grateful for the new characters, Tatenashi being someone that lacked in the harem, the almighty always-plotting-troublemaker who only gets things worse, and is the boldest of all (even if her timing isn\'t all that great), and yet is strong enough to be able to keep doing this without fear.Also, the voicecast is good. I was pretty happy to hear Kana Hanazawa, Marina Inoue, Yukari Tamura, Megumi Toyoguchi and Yukana(the last one being awfully rare in the shows I usually watch, yet I really like her. Still, I think Yukana was playing a bit too high-pitched in this). Sure, the show isn\'t great, but it\'s rather enjoyable to hear those voices when you like them.So, to conclude, IS is  a mere continuation of the first season, with an interesting background not exploited at all and it just feels like an horribly long intro plus a few OVA-type episodes mixed in the middle, but while it\'s not a good show, it\'s not the worst of what we can see either. It\'s abit frustrating sometimes, true, but well, just watch it when your brain is off. Seeing IS after a while of not watching typical harem anime can be nice, if you want one without much of a thinking, just for relaxing after a long day.Let\'s hope a season 3 will be coming to finally develop that poor plot who was totally neglected during this season. starting to get interesting(I liked the little development at the end of episode 10, that was a pure detail but the character was one I liked and it was interesting to see more of what she can do).And there\'s a awful lot of useless episodes, the main one, totally ridicule, being the one with Charlotte and her disappeared panties, which I didn\'t enjoy at all...

What I usually do is getting into periods of anime style: watching a few shows of serious, good plot without much of a comedy (duno, for example, Psycho Pass, Kara no Kyoukai, Shingeki no Kyojin), and then switch the change to mood and not being too overwhelmed by the heaviness, dark ambiance of those animes, by watching a few lighter things, like harem, simple romantic comedy, stories with a plot but still having somewhat of a plot or pure WTF colorful shows (dunno, for example, watching To love, Dog Days, and D frag).So indeed the harem cliche was strong, but I did enjoy quite a lot IS and IS2, because that has been a while since I\'ve watched a good old harem show with colorful characters like this. The last light animes that I saw were a bit less cliché, but not as lively in consequence as there\'s not a whole bunch of girls trying to get your attention, more like a few scenes here and there without much boldness coming from them.  So it was kinda refreshing seeing a show like IS. Back to IS2, I was grateful for the new characters, Tatenashi being someone that lacked in the harem, the almighty always-plotting-troublemaker who only gets things worse, and is the boldest of all (even if her timing isn\'t all that great), and yet is strong enough to be able to keep doing this without fear.Also, the voicecast is good. I was pretty happy to hear Kana Hanazawa, Marina Inoue, Yukari Tamura, Megumi Toyoguchi and Yukana(the last one being awfully rare in the shows I usually watch, yet I really like her. Still, I think Yukana was playing a bit too high-pitched in this). Sure, the show isn\'t great, but it\'s rather enjoyable to hear those voices when you like them.So, to conclude, IS is  a mere continuation of the first season, with an interesting background not exploited at all and it just feels like an horribly long intro plus a few OVA-type episodes mixed in the middle, but while it\'s not a good show, it\'s not the worst of what we can see either. It\'s abit frustrating sometimes, true, but well, just watch it when your brain is off. Seeing IS after a while of not watching typical harem anime can be nice, if you want one without much of a thinking, just for relaxing after a long day.Let\'s hope a season 3 will be coming to finally develop that poor plot who was totally neglected during this season.', 'Ohhhhhhh, Infinite Stratos! How I loladkv----loveevasfdsa-love-hate this! Okay, I\'m just kidding I don\'t actually hate this show, but I am joking when I say I love it.Season 1 of this show, was well pretty good. (I\'m hesitant on actually writing a review on that season) Not good enough to make me go, ""OH MY GOOOOOOODNESSS!!!"" But more to the point of, hmm, okay let\'s just watch season 2 of this show, for poops and gigs.Before I continue on, if you want someone more experienced, and someone more in depth on this series, go right ahead and skip this read. I do also expect...you to have SOME background knowledge so that I can actually, ""spoil"" some of the more obvious stuff. For those of you who actually read this, thank you.I have watched 12/12 episodes.Story 3/10 (Let\'s dive right into it~)The story was ""decent"" not a bad plot, it was sort of ""meh."" The plot itself doesn\'t really seem to be going anywhere, for the plot is not really a plot. What I mean by this is, sure the main characters have special missions, there\'s a group of villains, and yeah they fight and square off with each other to see who is the best, it\'s just that fan service got in the way. In my honest opinion, everything in this season, felt like it was being brought up too late... Timing is key for a good story. Like the villains being introduced at a good time, but not really doing anything a certain episode/s. And before I go on about the fan service, I just wanted to say that the story takes place right after the events of season 1.The story and plot got to heavy reliant on the fan service. Now what I really hate about this is that the story was going to be actually pretty good, if you didn\'t have all this other nonsense going on at the same time. If the creators put in more time and work on the actual story, and got things rolling, instead of making a FULL episode (spoiler, they make an entire episode dumb!), a ""Fanserviceode"" then things might have been different.Art 7/10I\'m not usually picky when it comes to animation, but like many anime, Infinite stratos just isn\'t as good as other anime in it\'s time. The animation is pretty standard, nothing I haven\'t seen before. Also with the fight scenes I would have wanted more strategic  battles, with cool attacks. Rather than the ""BOOM-KA-PAW-WHAM"" type of explosion animation.Sound 7/10With sound, I\'m not that picky either. What I look for in sound, is good opening/s and closing/s. If the show doesn\'t have these I don\'t mind, but just make sure to have enough music to not make every scene sound the same. (Which IS did fairly well at.) The music wasn\'t ""amaze-ballzzz"" but it was probably the best thing about this anime. They didn\'t really change some of the osts from the first season, which bothered me, because some of them were bad and made the scene a bit awkward. But at the same time some of the music just fits the show to well, for it not to be in there. The voice actors did a nice job also, no complaints on this end. Although, sometimes I just cringe.Character 2/10When I watch anime, I look at the characters and say, ""is that someone I can sort of relate to, or even just hang around with?"" Because for me anime is an escape from my daily life. So when Infinite Stratos made these characters, I got pretty mad, and then just straight up bored. These characters are ALL so one-sided and predictable, AND cliche. You have the dumb MC, and his harem, not much more to say here...Like I\'ve stated before this show became HIGHLY dependent on the fan service aspect, so when that happened, the characters all went to poo. There was almost no character development at all for the old season 1 characters, and for the new main season 2 characters, the character development was more like 30% development and 70% fan service. Overall, for the character part of the anime, I got bored, I stopped paying attention when the dumb fan service parts happened, and well I even wanted to skip a certain episode...Enjoyment 4/10Okay from what I\'ve been stating, this anime looks grim, hella grim. Don\'t get me wrong, it is hella bad, but that doesn\'t really mean I didn\'t enjoy this anime. Actually this anime got a couple laughs from me, in some scenes I actually smiled and hoped for something good to happen. (KEK)   It\'s just that story/plot and character is all I truly enjoy, sure when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, I love the art and the sound too. But when you strip the 2 main aspects away from me, I feel like this isn\'t good anymore, it\'s just there. Sure I enjoyed it, but to a very, very, very limited extent.Final Verdict 3/10In all honesty I was actually pretty hyped up for this season, seemingly only to be disappointed. When you ask me or someone asks me, ""eyyyy, you know any good anime with lots of fan service??"" I\'ll simply just reply with, ""Watch IS."" Because that\'s all Infinite Stratos is, fan service. I\'m disappointed because the first season, wasn\'t this terrible, it was actually quite OK. I simply just hate anime that lose face, and do not use any of its potential and waste it.I strongly do not recommend this, there are plenty of others that can fill this ones place. But I guess if you are into harems with dumb MC\'s then this is for you. If you like cat fights with kawaii faces, then this is for you, you to have SOME background knowledge so that I can actually, ""spoil"" some of the more obvious stuff.

The first season wasn\'t the greatest thing ever animated but how far are you willing to fall before you fall into the abyss known as IS2? Read on please!STORY: 1One could argue there is no story! Only emptiness. There is a story however and it sucks. If they had no specific storyline and instead centered on tournaments fighting for Ichika\'s happy sacks until they graduated, I would be totally unopposed to it and it would\'ve garnered it a 7 or 8. Unfortunately...it follows the light novels, and the light novel does something extremely groundbreaking: It puts in an evil organization. Never mind how original the name ""Phantom Task"" is. (Say it out loud! it sends shivers down your spine!). No anime or manga has ever DARED  put in an evil organization into their storyline. EARTH SHATTERING! The planet is desperately trying to glue itself back together! Help! I\'m entering space!CHARACTERS: 5IS2 gets half a full score only for it\'s character design. The girls are quite preetee!! I want to hold hands with Charlotte Dunois, pet Laura Bodewig\'s head, spy on Cecelia Alcott while she makes toilet, wipe my nuts all over Huang Lingyin\'s sleeping face, and ambush Houki Shinonono with my golden shower as she washes up after kendo practice. IS2 does not fail with the pretty ladeez!They introduce two new chracters: Tatenashi the student council president (because that\'s required in every high school harem) and her ugly sister who would look fine without glasses but sadly only exists to serve those with a fetish for NURDZ!Ichika Orimura.. Has changed.. During the first season he had this expression on his face that made him seem like a 5 year old in a older teen\'s body - In other words he looked like an idiot. Now Ichika is a cool calm Harley driving thug who takes nothing from no one and takes everything from everyone. He looks that way at least.However one character really pissed me off. Tabane Shinonono the genius rabbit chimp hybrid. I enjoyed her in the first season, she was quite adorable and moe. However, her scene in the final episode was the most cringe inducing thing I\'ve ever seen. It was bad enough they introduced a cliche ""secret organization"" into the mix but now they try to make the cute random critter-like Tabane all BA and overpowered in a scene that may have got some of you excited, but made me slap my hand right through my head. It\'s stuck in there and I can not see!!SOUND: 8The OP and ED for the first season were great. The OP for the second season on the other hand SUCKED! The ED was aight doe\'.The soundtrack production team really messed up picking this anime to create music for. They did wonderfully but there talents could have gone to a show that deserved it much more.ART: 8No complaints. The art and character design are great. As usual the mecha battles are excellently rendered although the ""technology"" (such as the mechs user interface) designs are very questionable.ENJOYABILITY: 8This show makes me want to barf into my lap just so I can see the barf and barf again to ease the nausea from watching this piece of shit. This is possibly the wor- wait what?? an 8?? N*GGA IS U HIGH?Yea that\'s right! This show is very enjoyable! Yeaaa I said it! Overall this definitely deserves a 4, possibly less but the enjoyablity deserves an 8! ECHHI IS EPIC! EIE..IO! AND ON HIS FARM HE HAD A TSUNDERE! EIEIO! WITH A ITS NOT LIKE I WANTED TO HERE AND A ITS NOT LIKE A WANTED TO THERE! While the ""main plot"" is cringe worthy and should be blocked out of your mind sit back relax with a six pack and enjoy the fanservice.This anime is highly recommended!

FOR ANTS!!', 'Compared to the first season of IS: Infinite Stratos, the second season feels very similar. Just like the first season, the mecha theme is brought back, along with the harem, the ecchiness, the gag. In simpler words, it doesn\'t feel like anything has changed.Like other harem animes, IS: Infinite Stratos 2 brings a cast of girls chasing one guy, but the difference is that the setting is in a girls-only school with the protagonist, Ichika, the sole male in the school. Judging it as a harem anime, sure, this is a pretty smart idea. However, since both the characters and the story are ridiculously...weak, the anime as a whole simply cannot be taken seriously, similar to many other harem animes. We have the prototypical protagonist boy whose strong male presence (considering he is the only male in the school) attracts a whole lot of girls, but he is oblivious towards their feelings. We have two types of girls in the school: the first type is the type that falls in love with him for no reason at all, and the second type is the type that falls in love with him because he promised to protect them. Basically, the characters are very one-dimensional, sounds very similar to the first season, right? Charlotte is the only girl who has an enjoyable and understandable character, which is why she is also the best character across both seasons. The story is a minor improvement from the first season, since at least a few episodes have antagonists in them (the Phantom Task), but it is still very poor, as the story is full of holes and a very important antagonist gets introduced out of nowhere, which leaves me wondering many many times, ""Who the **** is that? Why the **** is she not introduced in the first season? What the **** is wrong with this storyline???""Other minor aspects are just OK. Art is what you would typically expect in a mecha anime. The ISs look pretty good, characters are like any other anime characters, animations are average, nothing to ""Wow"" about. Sound is also average, but it does its job to fit in with the anime. You\'re not going to hear any sound that\'s going to make you cry or fire you up.Among all these negative aspects of this anime, the one shining star is: it draws cheap laughs out of you. This anime isn\'t going to leave a lasting impression like Steins;Gate does or Gintama does, this anime isn\'t going to give you an anime hero that you will think about for the next week like Death Note does or One Piece does. The most you should expect is laughing at silly, ecchi scenes with tsundere girls. Bored? Want a break from your routine? Want to laugh at stupid things and drool over breasts?

I might rant on Facebook, but I would probably not to do so.2. The reason that I would not write anything for IS is that it does not need any review. Simply put, nobody would care if IS had got any actual plot or not. The first episode already proved my point by having the French and The German (that’s my acronym for the characters inside this show.) eating Crapes, The Male (yes, there is only one...male) and The Chinese, The French and the British outdoor, or The Japanese’s door being knocked while she was having a shower. Anyone counting this as serious drama should have their brain checked, and yet many watched joyfully every week.What? Oh you mean Phantom Task? Someone stealing an IS from the school? Who cares? At least not the script writer.3. Main plot of IS: a bunch of girls and a boy having operations.Please feel free to interpret and imagine what kind of operations was being referred to.4. Another clue showing that there would not be any serious bits inside the show: by comparing the ED of the first season and the second season, they just look the same aren’t they? It could be summarized as a bunch of girls running around and more girls running around on the 2nd version.5. the Correct way of reviewing this show should not be in ordinary points. It should be count as “X out of the 10 Moe”. For episode 1, I originally give 7 Moe, since my favorite character didn’t showed up. There are also some new settings that probably they won’t even used again so that’s another 2 moes.6. This Show lacks any actual drama. The one thing that it doesn’t lack of is the original script writer Yumizuru Izuru7. The most interesting factor of IS isn’t about the characters. IS is a good indication of How light novel publishers trying the best to hang on to popular writers. Even thought his new novel “Afterschool Battlefield” received loads of bad reviews and he was being kicked out of his old publishing company, his still got another publishing deal. It reflects the competitiveness of the light novel industries nowadays.Also, the reason that IS is able to sell well is not because it is a well written novel, nor because that Yumizuru is a good writer or a nice person (in fact, he is an ass). It is all because that IS had a good illustrator. Since everyone are buying light novels without any chance to read the content (At least, this is true for Hong Kong and Taiwan), the illustrations, cover pages and popularity of the series are often the key component for consumers to decide whether they would like to purchase or not.8. Rather than reading the novel or watching the show, the true battlefield Is in Comiket and Doujin. Have I not told you that C85 already started? BTW I like Chika Arimura.9. Since I was in college studying English and we do have an unbalance portion of boys and girls, I can surely tell that Harem is all just a dream.10. if Ichika dies, I will give this show a 10.

NOT an aspiring story with some harem, ecchi, and comedy in it (yes there's a difference).The anime follows Ichika with all the main characters from the first series placed into this one. A lot of it becomes the awkward harem ecchi that is to be expected from Infinite Stratos with little deviation from the original seasons. The  character development wasn't too bad...considering most of it was done in the first season although it feels like the ecchi and harem parts have been taken up a few notches.The problem comes into play mostly as they hint of an arc or story that rarely comes to light in each episode. In the end if your hoping to watch an enthralling story the anime will quickly feel like 10 episodes of fillers and 2 episodes of story.Overall its fairly hard to critique the second season as it doesn't do too much from the first. They both had fairly average story, the art is similar along with the sound and the characters are the the same as well with few editions. With the haphazard use of the story it becomes difficult to review an anime that doesn't add too much to the series. A few things are found out particularly about the antagonists and how they relate to Ichika but it doesn't seem to delve much deeper then that. The last episode is where the story really comes into play and sort of wraps up, but it feels quite obvious that this seasons was made to push the story along a bit and set up for another sequel.Still though taking the anime like it is, its one of my favorites. The females flock to Ichika as expected in a harem. There is ecchi scenes and times when they are being really cute or really strong. Ichika is still as weak as ever but its good to see him fighting for his friends and I particularly enjoyed the strength that Charlotte and Laura bring into play.In closing (or TLDRthrough its an interesting anime, in which I feel if you enjoyed the first series you may likely enjoy this one. Although don't expect too much from the story as a lot of it will feel like a group of people doing random stuff for a while until the last episode. considering most of it was done in the first season although it feels like the ecchi and harem parts have been taken up a few notches.The problem comes into play mostly as they hint of an arc or story that rarely comes to light in each episode.

Although don't expect too much from the story as a lot of it will feel like a group of people doing random stuff for a while until the last episode."", '""He\'s been closing and opening his left hand for a while. When that habit shows up, he usually makes simple mistakes.""And that mistake my friends, was the second season if IS: Infinite Stratos.To start off, let me just say I was a fan of the first season. I understood where everyone was coming from when they were talking about the cliche harem aspects of the anime, as well as the completely dense protagonist, but I enjoyed it anyways! Why? It had good visuals, some of the characters were awesome (IE Charlotte and Laura), and the action scenes? Beautiful. I was looking forward to a season...2, hoping for it to be as awesome as the first season, and maybe even find out if Ichika will ever be even the slightest less dense...But sadly, my dreams were shattered...I think the worst thing about this season was the storyline. That\'s the thing though, there was no storyline. There was the idea of one, but it was never carried out. Instead, what we got were a bunch of filler episodes, with a few action scenes here and there. The fillers ranged from a slutty costume contest, a reenactment of some crazy fairy tale, and trying to get a shy girl who dreams of her prince charming to become friends with an idiot who doesn\'t realize he has 6 other girls hanging off of him like bananas on a tree. What I was hoping to see was the idea I was previously talking about turn this ruined season into a story that might just save it. Sadly though...One of the few things they did right were the animation and the sound. The animation was beautiful, but the only thing preventing me from giving said animation a 10/10 was the fact that they barely ever put it to good use with action scenes. Instead, they decided that it would be fun to see how graphic they can make a slutty costume competition without getting the video flagged on YouTube. And then there\'s the sound. I enjoyed most of the actors and actresses\' roles, but the thing is, I watched the first season dubbed, mainly because I liked the cast, so it was difficult to get used to the subbed as I watched each episode the day it came out. But in the end I found the subbed version entertaining and well done.Now, we get down to one of the biggest problems with this season... THE CHARACTERS. The thing is, I still like Charlotte and Laura, but the problem is that they are completely different from the first season... like most of the other girls as well... it seemed like the only thing I was hearing them talk about was how much they loved Ichika, and what they would do to be with him and stuff like that. There were no interesting ""Oh hey, I just learned something new about them"" moments or backstories, just a bunch of girls drooling over the most dense person on the planet. Luckily, there were 2 new characters we got to know... well, at least one of them were okay in my opinion. One of them turned out to be exactly the same as the rest of the girls, but at least the other one had some skepticism about it. But overall, very disappointing to see Charlotte in a sexy dog outfit... wait... I guess it wasn\'t THAT disappointing... but still...Overall, IS: Infinite Stratos II was somewhat of a trainwreck... it had it\'s pros, although there were very few of them, but it had so many cons I really wish I could unwatch season 2 and wait until they release an actual, well done, great story, backstory included season 2. Sadly though, that won\'t be happening... at least not for a long time.Story: 3Art: 8Sound: 8Characters: 5Enjoyment: 5Final Score: 5 2, hoping for it to be as awesome as the first season, and maybe even find out if Ichika will ever be even the slightest less dense...But sadly, my dreams were shattered...I think the worst thing about this season was the storyline.

A sequel that's not mediocre at all, but bad! Like, really badThat's the case with Infinite Stratos 2. Somehow, that last season was enough to warrant a sequel despite its awfulness.The good thing is, it builds itself on top of its predecessor. The bad thing is, it builds itself on top of its predecessor.I'm gonna review this based on the assumption that you people who're reading this have seen the first season. If you live through that, than you just might live through this.Story - 3/10With the same setting as the previous season, the story didn't really...change much.This time around, they tried to incorporate more Action. They even have an evil group now! But alas, it was all for naught. Because the evil group didn't really do other things aside from being, well, evil.That's all that happened really. Bad guys does bad things, then was stopped by the students with personal IS.But the amount of action is still overshadowed by the FANSERVICE!!!Really, every episode is some kind of Boob Showroom. It's really annoyingArt - 7/10Same thing with the previous season too. The new ISes' designs are rather awesome.Sound - 6/10Same ol', same ol'Character - 1/10Can I rant here a little? Really? Okay here goes...The characters are so goddamn boring!Especially Ichika! I know that guy is supposed to be clueless. But the level of his cluelessness this season is so annoying it almost killed me!I never knew i can get irritated by a character that much...(Rant over)The girls didn't really change much.Although there are two new members to the harem.They're sisters, Tatenashi and Kanzashi.Tatenashi, the older one, is the Student Council President and acts like a bigger sister. A perverted one at that. And even though there's literally no reason for her to fall in love with Ichika, she fell for it anywayKanzashi, the younger one, hates Ichika at first due to some things. But since he's so nice, she fell for him too.Because a guy who can accidentaly grab boobs every episode is a nice guy everyone loves.The enemy characters are mostly boring, except for one, whose name i'm not gonna say. But even then, she didn't even get deve... screw development! They didn't even EXPLAIN, why she's like that. Even by the end of the season, we know nothing about this girl!So Character-wise, IS2 was a flopOverall - 4/10This thing must be crazy popular in Japan, because aside from... well... i can't really think of any good things to set aside.I don't think this thing is worth to watch, if you like School Life Mecha that much, you can always watch Valvrave.*shudder*...

Valvrave... *shudder*"", 'I imagine there are two core audiences who would be attracted to a show like Infinite Stratos: There are those who enjoy the Mech genre, and thought it carried a somewhat interesting premise, despite the underlying signs that it could go in a number of questionable directions. Then there are those who enjoy carefree slice of life stories that have love triangles, harems, and plenty of awkward situations. Before I dive into what I think about this anime, not just within the confines of the second season, but as a whole, I\'d like to preface that I had no idea what this show was about...before I randomly started watching it. I can safely say that regardless if you are Mech junkie, or a harem lover, this show will ultimately waste your time. I will not be including any major spoilers in this short review.Let me first begin by explaining my grades. I don\'t really have a good eye for art, unless it is absolutely fantastic, and the same goes for the sound. It isn\'t annoying or peculiar in any way, and unless you are very selective or attuned to sound and art, you shouldn\'t notice it. The story has elements and pieces of intrigue or interest, but they never amount to anything and ultimately will betray your expectations in frustrating ways. The cause for such mediocrity in story stems from the fact that many of the characters are annoying and are truly victims of ridiculous plot lines that can\'t even be considered as \'story\'. Even the most casual viewers can find something more entertaining to spend their down time watching than Infinite Stratos, whether it is the first season or the second. Allow me to venture further.The premise of the story is quite simple. Orimura Ichika is the only man in the world who can use an IS, and so that in of itself makes it perfectly okay for him to attend an all-girls school where he is to learn how to master and utilize a powerful military grade machine that is apparently is used for sport. This plot invites a multitude of misunderstandings between Ichika and every single female student he encounters, which definitely increases in number from season to season. Although this academy he attends is focused on training IS units, it also functions as a military base of operations, using emotionally charged high school students  as soldiers who are sent into battle to confront threats that even the armies of the world can\'t handle. Season two throws in an evil organization that has a terrible habit of appearing every other episode, no doubt to make room for overly cliche fan-service sequences, that will ultimately have no closure whatsoever. Although there are some specks of greatness reflected throughout the duration of Infinite Stratos, it is hardly worth the time or effort to suffer through. One moment Ichika\'s life will be threatened by an intriguing assassin, and the very next day he\'ll be on some play date with one girl or another, unknowingly angering the others, as if his life was never in danger. Most viewers will question whether or not the show has a serious case of short term memory loss, as it continually picks up and drops the plot several times throughout the season.The battles and fight sequences have their moments as well, until the animation zooms out, leaving two colored balls streaking across the sky and ignoring the finer details of mech on mech combat. I won\'t deny that some of the designs are pretty darn cool, but it doesn\'t matter because most of the fights are short lived, and ultimately lead up to more slice of life moments that are jam packed with awkward moments that become so redundant, it becomes near unbearable. The second season ends with even more questions than answers, and if a third season ever emerges, it seems quite unlikely that anything will get resolved from it without a change of director or author. For anyone who finished season one thinking that the variety of unanswered questions would get elaborated on in season two will be sorrily disappointed. In fact, the entire premise of the plot is only vaguely hinted at, and never truly expanded upon at all.In regards to the characters who are apart of this jumbled mess of plot and harem pointlessness, there are some stars among the mix, though ultimately they will frustrate you with their cliche behavior or pointless interjections into the story. The main character, Ichika, is a fairly basic male protagonist, who wants to protect his comrades and is overall a very nice person. There is no doubt that he is purposefully designed to be incredibly oblivious, and while that may invite some hilarity at first, it becomes very stale, and very quickly. Naturally, surrounding him are a cast of female characters, the most important being his childhood friend, Houki, who clearly has a stronger bond with him than the other girls. Houki may be my personal favorite among the bunch, but like everything in this show, her character and morals are often broken for the purpose of setting up a pointless interlude in the plot for fan service. The Houki of season one, was a respectable and hardworking girl who actually carries genuine feelings for Ichika, which are more than likely mutual. The Houki of season two periodically falls to Cecilia and Lin\'s level of attention grabbing nonsense. While Lin is also Ichika\'s childhood friend, she and Cecelia are nothing but obnoxious intrusions who serve little to no purpose to anything relevant within the story. Their personalities are bland and predictable, and you can pretty much expect what they are going to do. In fact, Cecelia\'s only redeeming quality is her inability to cook remotely edible food, which provides a single episode of laughs, but is still irrelevant. Much like Houki, Charlotte is another character who has many respectable qualities, but ends up drowning them in the obvious pursuit to be the one chosen by Ichika. It is unfortunate because Charlotte is an intelligent and well-meaning person who probably could serve as a good source of information for Ichika in terms of how the other girls think of him. Surprisingly, the only character I don\'t have a problem with in terms of the fan service and the cliche harem tactics is Laura. Perhaps it is the fact that I gave up on expecting a serious female student to appear and stay for long, and Laura benefits from being somewhat clueless about society, and doesn\'t overplay the ""blushing girl who wants to go on a date no matter what the cost is"" stereotype the others do. Of course, season two had to add on a few other characters to the list, including the student council president, and her kid sister, who ultimately take up a few episodes of drama that don\'t really have much to do with anything.The best characters of the show are those who aren\'t involved with the harem whatsoever. This includes Ichika\'s older sister, Chifuyu, who just happens to be a teacher at the academy. She is a serious, no-nonsense, military-minded instructor who once was one of the greatest IS pilots the world has ever known. It is unfortunate that her much needed presence is put to waste by locking her up in a control booth giving orders. The times I smiled the most while watching this anime was when Chifuyu would call out the ridiculousness of the other girls, and ultimately deny them their right to be Ichika\'s girlfriend. While I feel that Houki is a good and decent person who has been victimized by the show\'s designs, her sister is undoubtedly one of favorites of the viewers. Tabane is a super genius who originally created the IS, and is pretty much an unstoppable god who plays tricks on the other characters just for fun. While she is a vital piece of the story\'s plot, her appearances are so rare, it hardly amounts to anything until its too late.To conclude, I would advise not to venture into this anime, even if you found the first season somewhat intriguing. I would say that Infinite Stratos 2 is best enjoyed by those who don\'t mind a redundancy when it comes to typical cheap anime romantic troupes such as: feeding a girl her lunch and saying ""aah"", accidentally seeing a girl\'s panties, accidentally pissing off the other girls repeatedly by showing accidental favoritism towards one over the others, going on pseudo dates, blushing excessively and playing coy, and most of all, hitting the male protagonist many times for being accidentally stupid. If in the hands of a suburb writer or producer, I believe Infinite Stratos could\'ve been a very successful anime. One thing that makes it so difficult to watch is that there are moments when it truly feels awesome, only to knock you down with overused heroics. The peak of this show occurred near the end of season one, and as hard as season two tried, it never came close. before I randomly started watching it.

Instead we got a ending that was a lot like the ending to S1 (everyone against OP IS and jobs it save Ichika and Houki), but managed to be so much stupider just from the last minute and a half as a BUY THE BDs measure.Having read the LNs, Vol 5-7 would have been fairly entertaining to see adapted because...Yumizuru bothered to offer some action in a harem series, along with actually character development for Cecilia instead of Charlotte and Houki getting jammed down our throats like S1. To a certain extent, some scenes had to be omitted because of choices made from S1, such as taking Natasha Fairs out of Silver Gospel, so that couldn't be helped.But so much stuff was skipped/omitted it's not even funny:>Gotanda siblings>Student council>Cannonball Fast Race>Ichika's core actually being extracted from Byakushiki during that part of the Cinderella Ball>Cecilia training her bits to bend beams like Madoka did>Cecilia and Madoka rematch where Cecilia's hard work and guts paid off though it's a Pyrrhic victoryInstead we had about 70% of the content from those volumes skipped for an episode about Char's hammerspace panties. Not saying all of that was skipped so Char could run around with no panties for an episode, but the episode itself offered absolutely nothing otherwise in terms of plot or even fanservice.And even after that, they bothered to fuck around with the viewer more by offering slideshows over actual animation as a ploy to get viewers to buy the BDs. Granted, as a Cecilia fan, I did like her section of the birthday celebration as well as her episode because she didn't try to kill Ichika during those times (not saying she didn't try like during Cinderella ball, but Yumizuru's sense of slapstick violent humor has never been IS's strong point).I can understand that some of the QUALITY issues from IS artwise were because of the fact that 8bit was also working on Tokyo Ravens and Walkure Romanze at the same time, but I didn't like feeling gyped to buy the BDs. IS S1 was this studio's project they had the most control over and was rather enjoyable: you'd think they would have put a little more thought into handling their flagship series and not run it at the same time as two other shows.That being said, I still like the novels, so if we get a S3, I suppose I'll give it the three episode rule, but I gave S2 9 episodes too many in the long run.

I\'m only writing a review for this season, as I found the first season a lot more enjoyable than the second one. Therefore, I just want to get straight to the point with my review and why I rated the anime as I did and how enjoyable it was for me. (This is my first review by the way.)Story----------------Infinite Stratos 2 did not have a good story in my opinion. There was little to no story development, only a small preview of what\'s going to happen in the beginning of the anime, then it suddenly jumps into the end. That preview almost seems like...it was rushed into the end and placed uncomfortably. Most of the episodes in the beginning were as you so call \'fillers\', as they had nothing to do with the main storyline at all. (I never expected there to be fillers in a 12 episode anime...) Of course, it\'s only a 12 episode anime, so I didn\'t expect the storyline to go too far, but they could\'ve progessed it little by little instead of just introducing more characters and watching them hang out with the main character. I think that the writers did not do a good job of focusing on the story, but more of comedy with a little bit of ecchi.I give this show a story rating of: 1/10Art---------------As someone who does art and wants to become an animator, I see the art as amazing. The IS mecha was so cool to me. (Besides the main character\'s, His suit looked mediocre compared to the other IS suits. -_-;;) There were nice and unique effects to each IS suit and weapons. The art made the fighting look super intense and really cool. Also, for an ecchi show, it was nice to know that the girls didn\'t have a 4 cm waist and DDs. I\'ve seen shows such as Highschool of the Dead, Kampfer, and all the girl\'s bodies seemed the same with different faces. I do believe the Art was a good aspect of this anime.I give this show an art rating of: 10/10Sound---------------The sound was also a very good aspect of the anime. Just like the art, the sound of the weapons clashing together and the missiles shooting away made the anime much more enjoying to me because of the intensity it gave. The voice actors (seiyuu as I should say because I didn\'t watch the dubbed version.) were good at showing emotions whether it be shy, angry, or proud. I would also like to point out that not every girl\'s voice was a squeaky 4 year old\'s voice. The cute characters had a cute voice while the more mature characters had a mature voice. The sound fit in with the character and the sound fit in with the situation. The soundtrack was the best part. It captured each moment well. It gave intensity when it needed to and gave comedy when it needed to. The opening and ending songs were great. I loved them every time I went to a new episode.I give this show a sound rating of: 10/10Character----------------This is where the downfall of the anime begins. The main character is so dense when it comes to girls that it makes me want to punch my computer screen, go into the anime world, and rip his eyes out. I understand that this is a harem anime and that his character shouldn\'t really go into ONE of the girls, but he could\'ve at least progressed with them. Also, it felt like he couldn\'t really improve his skills with maneuvering his IS. However, not ONLY was the main character really stupid/frustrating, the character development was a big thumbs down. There was little to no character development AT ALL. (Mostly because most of the episode were \'fillers\') I felt like the characters stayed the same since the first season ending and that there was no change at all. It felt like they introduced each character\'s problem in the first season, and completely forgot about it and made them into robots. I did not like the character set in this anime WHATSOEVER besides the comedical aspect of each of them.I give this  show a character rating of: 2/10Enjoyment--------------------As horrible as the storyline and characters development was, I still did find this anime to be mediocre. Why? Because even though the main character was dense, it was still really funny. I kept watching this anime mainly because of the comedy. It gave me a good laugh every episode and didn\'t fail to make me quit watching. I\'m not too into ecchi, but I don\'t mind it at all as well. Sometimes, when they incorporated ecchi into an episode, I thought, ""How in the world can this happen."" Its like you try to open a door and it turns on the light instead, you know? But they rescued those areas with a comedical turn and the anime DID have its cute and  shounen like (?) moments.I give this show an enjoyment rating of: 5/10Overall-----------------I didn\'t like the story or the character, but it wasn\'t an anime that I would cross out of my list. It still is enjoyable to watch. It isn\'t too plot heavy, (And I actually mean the PLOT. Not boobs plot.)  I guess but more enjoyable. It\'s more of an anime to watch when you just wanna watch a short anime that had a simple storyline (Although it didn\'t do well with the storyline xD) and comedical features. Why do I put comedy, comedical and enjoyable so much in this review? Because IT REALLY IS VERY FUNNY. Its nice to watch when you\'re having a bad day and really want a good laugh.Therfore, I overall give this show an OKAY rating of.......4/10!Thanks for reading this review, I hope it had shown you what experience I had when watching this anime and what kind of experience you\'d GET from this anime. :)Goodbye! it was rushed into the end and placed uncomfortably. Most of the episodes in the beginning were as you so call \'fillers\', as they had nothing to do with the main storyline at all. (I never expected there to be fillers in a 12 episode anime...) Of course, it\'s only a 12 episode anime, so I didn\'t expect the storyline to go too far, but they could\'ve progessed it little by little instead of just introducing more characters and watching them hang out with the main character. I think that the writers did not do a good job of focusing on the story, but more of comedy with a little bit of ecchi.I give this show a story rating of: 1/10Art---------------As someone who does art and wants to become an animator, I see the art as amazing. The IS mecha was so cool to me. (Besides the main character\'s, His suit looked mediocre compared to the other IS suits. -_-;;) There were nice and unique effects to each IS suit and weapons. The art made the fighting look super intense and really cool. Also, for an ecchi show, it was nice to know that the girls didn\'t have a 4 cm waist and DDs. I\'ve seen shows such as Highschool of the Dead, Kampfer, and all the girl\'s bodies seemed the same with different faces. I do believe the Art was a good aspect of this anime.I give this show an art rating of: 10/10Sound---------------The sound was also a very good aspect of the anime. Just like the art, the sound of the weapons clashing together and the missiles shooting away made the anime much more enjoying to me because of the intensity it gave. The voice actors (seiyuu as I should say because I didn\'t watch the dubbed version.) were good at showing emotions whether it be shy, angry, or proud. I would also like to point out that not every girl\'s voice was a squeaky 4 year old\'s voice. The cute characters had a cute voice while the more mature characters had a mature voice.

My rating of the story is a 3/10Art: I say lantis did a pretty good job with the art but messed up on the...3D they tried to add in the second season when i looked closely you could barley tell who it is but when up close they decided to switch from 3D back over to 2D but that did not really bother me,The Art made even me to try and master this art style so if you love to draw try this style once. rating 8/10Sound: Now here is where it counts the feeling that your in the battle or you can tell that ichika felt that beat down great sounding not like when some anime use to blocks of wood and slam them together no, it sounds like skin getting hit by a huge mecha arm still ichika you need to read the mood. rating 9/10Character: I say i loved all the females following ichika one they just bring the mood to the scene like how laura comes in a serious say ""Your my wife"" and all that but as we all know she has a soft side that she barley shows to anyone and when[spoiler] with the cake bunny scene lol made my day[/spoiler]now the rest of the girls give the same feeling just in there own way like Houki and her Tsundere act and her helpless act she makes you feel like i would not want to mess with her.now this is how i feel about all the females in the series you will understand when you watch you will laugh tons.10/10The Enjoyment was a good amount because of the comedic affect but the fighting i could not take seriously[spoiler] only the part with the sisters i say that is a family right there[/spoiler]there were like half the episode while other mechas make it 3 or the whole series about fights with mecha no this anime just adds two fights and ichika always being useless,but i say if this anime would have used the mecha battles to be a sport then the anime would have made sense to make the battles,well still in the end its the comedy and the spoiler in the first episode with a scene of the last episode keeps this anime alive Lantis you have found a way to trick our minds. 7/10Overall: I will say it again still a pretty good anime to waste time on but raging at the same this my OVERALL Rating is 8/10 3D they tried to add in the second season when i looked closely you could barley tell who it is but when up close they decided to switch from 3D back over to 2D but that did not really bother me,The Art made even me to try and master this art style so if you love to draw try this style once. rating 8/10Sound: Now here is where it counts the feeling that your in the battle or you can tell that ichika felt that beat down great sounding not like when some anime use to blocks of wood and slam them together no, it sounds like skin getting hit by a huge mecha arm still ichika you need to read the mood. rating 9/10Character: I say i loved all the females following ichika one they just bring the mood to the scene like how laura comes in a serious say ""Your my wife"" and all that but as we all know she has a soft side that she barley shows to anyone and when[spoiler] with the cake bunny scene lol made my day[/spoiler]now the rest of the girls give the same feeling just in there own way like Houki and her Tsundere act and her helpless act she makes you feel like i would not want to mess with her.now this is how i feel about all the females in the series you will understand when you watch you will laugh tons.10/10The Enjoyment was a good amount because of the comedic affect but the fighting i could not take seriously[spoiler] only the part with the sisters i say that is a family right there[/spoiler]there were like half the episode while other mechas make it 3 or the whole series about fights with mecha no this anime just adds two fights and ichika always being useless,but i say if this anime would have used the mecha battles to be a sport then the anime would have made sense to make the battles,well still in the end its the comedy and the spoiler in the first episode with a scene of the last episode keeps this anime alive Lantis you have found a way to trick our minds. 7/10Overall: I will say it again still a pretty good anime to waste time on but raging at the same this my OVERALL Rating is 8/10', ""This is a review for both 1st and 2nd season. They are basically the same anime with different names.First off all, Infinite Stratos is NOT A ROMANCE anime. It is not even trying to be one. It doesn't involve anything I would call romantic. It is an exaggerated example of harem genre. Yes there are also anime with both romance and harem in it, however IS:Infinite Stratos is NOT one of them. This is pure harem. So if you keep that in mind and set your expectations that way, it is actually pretty enjoyable and I will tell you why.1- StoryThere is no plot...that is worth mentioning in this anime and I couldn't care less about it. The very first scene of the anime already shows that. A guy in an all-girls school. WTF are you expecting??? There is this guy and the girls around him and they are doing standard harem things. Time to time everyone in the school also joins them. That's all. Also he has a sister who was a legendary IS pilot and now a teacher. Bonus: There is no incest and siblings relationship with each other is, altho a little bit overshadowed by standard harem things, still gives a little warmness to the show. Heck, it is the only thing that is a bit realistic and warm here.Some might enjoy the action scenes but I certainly did not since I don't really like those nonsense characters are spouting rather than actually fighting.(I am looking at you Bleach). Now put mecha here and I am done.Overall it is average harem with lots of fan service and time-to-time fun. Nothing serious happens and even if it does  I didn't and you shouldn't care.2- CharactersGirls are cute and they differ from each other. We have the standard set:-tsundere childhood friend-loli tsundere childhood friend with twintails YAY!-foreigner noble overly self-conscious blonde-clueless to love, villain to yandere girl-a girl with a little bit of logic and looks more reliable than the others yet still acts foolish with the flow sometimesThese two will be added in 2nd season:-A shy and hard-working glasses girl overshadowed by her big sister-Perfect senpai with a daring personality and easy-going attitude, always teases the guy and claims to be a big sister etc.Finally MC:Think about a general unrealistic harem MC and increase denseness to the max. I have watched lots of anime like that however this guy was something else. It is so ridiculous that the show itself intentionally highlights his impossible denseness. I gotta say tho, he is not that unlikable due to his genuine over the the top denseness. So dense that it has adverse effect on  the viewer.Just from these explanations, everyone with enough harem experience can now guess most of the story given the context.Technical aspect:Nothing out of ordinary. Fitting voice acting, poor soundtracks. Animation is nothing amazing but doesn't suck either, easily watchable. Characters look cute and likeable too.Overall;this anime is a generic harem for easy watching. Don't even try if you are tiny bit serious. Also much better and realistic than School Days imo. that is worth mentioning in this anime and I couldn't care less about it. The very first scene of the anime already shows that.

This is the main idea of the story but there is one other thing the is a boy named Ichika who can use the mechs as well. This boy is forced into the I.S academy where he...is surrounded by women.Next we have the story which is about Ichika and his harem life while haveing to deal with problems with the school and training. After the first couple of episode a the action begins and Ichika is left to fight with his personal I.S and those of his other female class mates.With the characters you have the main male Ichika and his other lovers. This includes the 5 from the first season and 2 new. First is the Student President Tatenashi Sarashiki who is also the strongest in the school which is why she has the title of President. Next is her sister Kanzashi Sarashiki who is not as strong and has always been not at the same level as her sister.After this is the sound which is ok in my eyes but with me i dont pay to much attention to it other then the Opening and Closeing. The opening was cheerful and average not very memorable. The Closeing was better. It kept the cheerful feel and found its way to something i listen to often.Animation on the other hand is different when i say that i mean it was done by someone else. It was similar but if you compared them side by side you would see the differences other than that is was nice art work but not interesting or amazeing.This leaves me with my final verdict giving it a 7 out of 10. Also saying if you like the harem, sci-fi, romance genres to watch it is surrounded by women.Next we have the story which is about Ichika and his harem life while haveing to deal with problems with the school and training.

Also saying if you like the harem, sci-fi, romance genres to watch it', ""So here we have season 2 of IS and to be completely honest, what a waste of a season it was. 12 episode and guess what, 90% of it is fan service and the other 10% is split between action scenes an actual honest to goodness storyline and plot development. Art remains pretty good good and sound is likewise. As for character develop on the other hand, forget about it. I mean they did try something but even then it only serves to make you realise how weak the main protag is. By far the most frustrating thing about season 2 is the wasted potential....With the new characters introduced and the events that were set in motion, i personally thought at the start of the season that we were in for something great, after episode after episode after episode of disappointment however i'm beginning to wish i had watched something different. IMO if you don't watch it, you're not missing much, if you do still watch it, don't expect much out of it With the new characters introduced and the events that were set in motion, i personally thought at the start of the season that we were in for something great, after episode after episode after episode of disappointment however i'm beginning to wish i had watched something different.

Consisting mostly of bottle episodes wherein the characters spend enormous periods of time at the academy doing uninspired and rather uninteresting activities, the second season doesn\'t even pick up the fecal-stained ball dropped at the end of season one.While character development in season one was weak, it\'s nonexistent in s2. The characters literally don\'t change.  So with no character progression and no story progression, what do we have? Mostly just a series of *unexpected* (sarcasm) bouts with a...mysterious cult that presumably hate\'s Ichiga\'s harem enough to try and kill him every 2-3 episodes. It\'s truly mind boggling how the show might have improved dramatically if they\'d succeeded!  But I digress, after a series of predictable and cliche engagements they only managed to ""gain sufficient data"". Which I don\'t entirely understand because *SPOILER ALERT* they defeat Ichiga and the ladies. So if their main priority was to kill Ichiga and his sister, why not just do it? Oh, because it makes more sense to defeat him in battle so you can gain valuable intelligence on... how to beat him in battle.In conclusion, I\'d say this anime is best viewed while you\'re doing something more important. Perhaps you could leave it playing while you clean, cook, study, feed your cat, or whatever it is you do. The main point being that it\'s not really worthy of your full attention, but it\'s not so terrible that it can\'t be used in the place of the windows bubbles screensaver. mysterious cult that presumably hate\'s Ichiga\'s harem enough to try and kill him every 2-3 episodes.

I recently chanced upon the reviews on the final episode of Infinite Stratos and to my utmost astonishment, the vast majority of posts were absolutely negative and offered blatantly scathing replies regarding the termination of another season of Infinite Stratos. As an avid supporter of anime and artists of all genres, such comments regarding the twelve hard-won episodes stirred something within me and hence I took to crafting this review which I believe is an accurate reflection of what I believe in as a positive supporter and compassionate patron of the anime and manga arts.As an anime, Infinite Stratos Season 2 is doubtlessly...not without its faults (like all of its other counterparts, predecessors, and works to come) however it is also not without merits; the spirit and zeal that went into producing this particular season and the combined efforts of the artist, production personnel, and most importantly the fans who never gave up on this project that almost never happened epitomize what anime is all about and gave this work a place in my heart. Instead of offering a bleak and bludgeoning critique on this work, I believe that an anime (just like everything in life cannot be objectively judged) and remains ostensibly a unique opinion that can only be determined by the viewer which also restricts its validity to encompass only the latter. If there is to be an objective interjection, I welcome and beckon all to view, experience, and come to a unique conclusion on what Infinite Stratos means. Perhaps it may be a bad experience, perhaps a good one (like mine was) or even an ambivalent one; however  I sincerely hope that all may embrace it for what it is.The plot was great (albeit involving a vast amount of fanservice just like last season which is not surprising for a harem anime) if one cares to keep track of it and involved a great deal of cliffhangers which should not be an issue for inquisitive audiences now that all twelve episodes are finally out. Despite the fanservice, the plot is still existent and contributes greatly to the suspense and cathartic poignancy of the work. The addition of new and entertaining characters like Kanzashi and Tatenashi keeps individuals on the balls of their feet and the fun never subsides. With fantastic and dramatic fighting scenes IS 2 features a vast array of designs and action that will not disappoint either returning viewers or new viewers who want a part of the action. The artwork (especially the stunning details in mech designs, equipment, and characters) was phenomenally rendered and the girls just keep getting cuter with innovations in technology. Despite having a new artist and animation company producing the work, the characters resemble their counterparts in season one so there are no discrepancies regarding appearance. Needless to say, the characters were likable and overall the anime was thoroughly enjoyable. While Infinite Stratos 2 is not the best anime that I have watched it has certainly been an exceedingly pleasurable and great experience.After all the hate and highly negative views on this anime, I sincerely hope that I have helped in some way and contributed my positive opinions on IS 2. Thank you for your time and best wishes!

We lived on a mountain of sorts and the main industry of the village was mining ceramics, due to the high abundance of the material and the relatively cheap labour cost. I really, really hated it back in that village. The air was nasty as hell, the water was always polluted with mud and dust and all sorts of germs, and every time you walked back into your house you\'d cover the entire floor with dust that would choke every breath you took and...cover every carpet in ash. My grandma would always tell me about how, just a few hours south, there was a whole, beautiful city, where the water was clear, and the air was clean, and you could wear shoes indoors without the risk of covering your soles in orange and pink. I studied day and night, listening to my grandma whisper to me the wonders of the city. I dreamed about it from dusk to dawn, and worked my very hardest to earn a scholarship for a middle school in the big city.When I arrived, everything seemed exciting. Everything was fresh, and new, and sparkly and clean. The streets had more cars than motorcycles; the shops sold more clothing than food; the streets were wiped clean by cleaners and janitors; the water looked green instead of the brown-ish hue I had become so accustomed to. One day, I stumbled into a small store in a backalley 20 minutes away from my school. It was covered in grime and smelled of cigarette smoke, and the shelves were filled with these strange, plastic models of these cartoon women. But I wasn\'t attracted to any of the girls. In the corner of my eye, I saw a figurine of a cool looking boy with blue hair and red-brown eyes. He had a white uniform lined with red stripes, and had a black collar that seemed to flow past into the wind. I instantly fell in love.I asked the store owner who he was. The store owner was about 5 feet tall, and wore a ripped, stained, white tank top that exposed his belly hair. When he walked close to me to answer, all I could smell was the stench of ash and alcohol. But I didn\'t care. I needed to find out the answer. The store owner glared at me with death-staking eyes, and said in a low, sub-masculine voice: ""What? That guy? From Infinite Stratos? You don\'t even know who he is? You some sort of fucking normie? The hell are you doing here?""The moment I arrived home, I opened up my 2006 ThinkPad laptop running on Windows XP and fired up 360Browser, smashing the keys into Baidou. Every cell in my body went into hyperdrive and every pore dripped down sweat as I overcharged my arms and legs and quadro-wielded four separate keyboards for the optimal keypress positioning. ""I"", I had entered into the search bar. This wasn\'t fast enough. I pulled out my second monitor with the fifth appendage that had mutated out of drinking sewer oil for 15 years from my 50 yuan wooden shelf and activated my Sharigan to cast Tsukyoumi on my own eyes so that I could sate the temptation for just a bit longer. ""NFINITE"", I had entered into the keyboard. I had grown faster. Much faster. My keyboard skill had finally soft-capped at 95, but I coudln\'t bear it for much longer. The only way to close the gap was to find the last 4 levels worth of XP, but the hardest zone had been locked behind a dark, deep, wilderness. But I knew I had to do it. I started moving two mice with both my elbows like a parpalegic CSGO player and booted up the on-screen keyboard with sound-activation. I started peeing my pants to make the average temperature of the room hotter to make the particles move faster. I channeled my spiritual energy into the top of the caps of my keys as my hair accented straight and expanded twentyfold vetically. I was not pokekevin anymore. I had become pokekevin-san. ""STRATO"", I had entered into the keyboard. I was so close. I had come so far. But I knew, I couldn\'t keep it up for long. With my last, dying breaths, I cemented my willpower and gathered my mana, and vibrated my wrists like nobody had ever done before. But I had been too late. The tendon on my wrist had already snapped from years of 280bpm dt playing and the pain had finally picked in. I dropped dead on the ground as my balls detached from my body and snapped in half. I couldn\'t do it. I could never see the anime. But the character design for season 2 was pretty hot, so this show is probably pretty good. cover every carpet in ash.

The harem and comedy elements of it were good and although I\'m not really a fan of mecha I could stomach it and thought it was a good anime altogether and rated it pretty high. When I found out a 2nd season was coming out I was excited, like I bet all IS fans were, but sadly the 2nd season was a huge let-down.[Plot: 4/10]No plot what-so-ever. It was episodic and pretty much random throughout the whole series. The whole basis of the anime was only only visited in like 2 or 3...episodes and then the rest of the anime was followed but ""The Daily Lives Of Ichika And His Harem"" .The fight scenes were lazy, the storyboard was lazy and altogether IS 2 was horrible. The only good thing about IS I can think of is the comedy which entertained me for most of the anime but then the same gags kept getting repeated over and over again and after awhile you just get tired of it.Characters: 2/10S.H.A.L.L.O.WIn the first season of IS, the characters were just being introduced so Ichika\'s Harem had a lot of character development and we went through their back stories. Each character had episodes dedicated to them and we got to know them better. Since IS 2 continues were IS 1 left off, all we get is Ichika\'s mindless harem who are blindly in love with him for god knows what reason. Ichika is the most stupidest protagonist I have ever seen. There\'s a limit to how ignorant you can be. The girls are freaking throwing themselves at you and nothing comes to mind. If i had a penny for every time Ichika said something stupid or corny to one of the girls I\'d be a billionaire. So the fans don\'t find this too weird they even added 2 more girls to his harem. The first ones personality was ok but her sister was as generic as can be and it was a pain to hear her say anything.[Art: 6/10]The art was actually really good. Its nice to look at and was a redeeming factor of the anime.[Sound: 8/10]I actually liked the OP and ED. They had somewhat good replay value but are easily forgetable.[Overall 4/10]Infinite Stratos 2 was trash and the worst anime of the season. I normally don\'t say this but after watching all 12 episodes I regret every second of this and think it would of been better if IS 2 was never made. If your an IS fan go ahead and watch this because it brings back all your favorite people from the first season but be prepared to be disappointed severely. Also to top everything off the ending was horrible too. It started off average but then turned into a snow ball going down a mountain and kept on getting worse and worse until your hit with the impact from the giant snowball crying for help but no one can hear your calls. episodes and then the rest of the anime was followed but ""The Daily Lives Of Ichika And His Harem"" .The fight scenes were lazy, the storyboard was lazy and altogether IS 2 was horrible.

Infinite Stratos 2 is one of the worst anime I have ever had the displeasure to watch. The story continues from where it left off in season one (kinda?) and it seems alright up to episode 3. After episode 3 is where season 2 spirals down into a void so deep that no amount of drugs will get you high enough to get you out of there.Story (4) - As I said before the show was alright up until episode 3. By the end of episode 3 there is a new character who appears and...proceeds to give the show an actual plot that could have turned the show into a more serious and interesting; however, it was all scratched and instead the only story there is to be told is Ichika’s growing harem that will most likely never end. Some of the events in this show are just utterly ridiculous. A perfect example of this is episode 6, in which Charlotte’s panties disappear for reasons not properly explained at the beginning of the episode. At the end, the problem is solved (how?) and Charlotte proceeds to call Ichika a pervert when she tries to show him what was going on.Sound (5) - While I do enjoy the majority of opening and ending themes, I found the opening and ending of this show were mediocre at best. There isn’t much to say about the soundtrack either as every track was entirely forgettable in my opinion, but everyone has their own taste in music, so my own opinion shouldn’t stop you from liking this soundtrack. The voice acting is, for the most part, good; however, I find Cecelia’s voice incredibly irritating.Art (5) - The animation is rather average and fight scenes are mostly CG. Even then there are very few fight scenes worth mention.Characters (1) - I find that I dislike just about every character in this anime, especially the females (oh wait, that’s 99.9% of the cast…). Ichika has to be one of the worst protagonists I’ve ever seen in an anime, specifically his denser-than-dense part of his character (oh wait, that’s almost all of his character interaction…). His IS piloting skills range from average to just plain bad, as he is never able to take care of himself in battle for very long without help. The main girls aren’t any better. Here is a list of the main girls and their personality:•\tHouki - Japanese childhood friend, easily jealous of other girls being with Ichika.•\tRin - same as Houki, but is Chinese.•\tCharlotte - French girl, appears cute, calls Ichika a pervert when she herself causes the perversion in the first place.•\tLaura - German girl, doesn’t know culture if it hit her in the face (in her defense, she was very strictly raised as a solder). She calls Ichika her wife (no excuses on this one…) even though they aren’t even together.•\tCecelia - British girl, everything about her is annoying, likes Ichika for one reason: he has “strong and idealistic eyes” (what does that even mean?)•\tTatenashi - An absurdly powerful student council president, tries to seduce Ichika, make Ichika do impractical things like take the girls’ measurements (apparently the teachers allowed it... so did the students...), and likes him for reasons unknown.•\tKanzashi - Tatenashi’s little sister and Japan’s IS representative, jealous of her older sister’s talent (which makes one wonder why Kanzashi is the representative…) and, because of that envy, insists on building her IS herself without anyone’s help. Luckily, Ichika saves the day by helping her and gains yet another girl in the harem.Entertainments (2) - There are much better harem anime out there such as Clannad, The World God Only Knows, and Heaven\'s Lost Property. The only ""entertainment"" that this show provides is within those ephemeral fight scenes; everything else not pertaining to the plot is simply blatant fanservice. I had hoped that, like most second seasons, this season would have actually picked up in terms of plot. The ending of episode 3 really made me look forward to episode 4. Unfortunately, the plot was tossed aside for a whole bunch of needless ""comedy"" and fanservice. Due to this terrible season, I have absolutely no hope for the upcoming “World Purge” arc due to the synopsis of it. I believe it\'s safe for me to say that I will never touch this show again...unless it’s for a drinking game, in which case I will be too drunk to care. proceeds to give the show an actual plot that could have turned the show into a more serious and interesting; however, it was all scratched and instead the only story there is to be told is Ichika’s growing harem that will most likely never end.

This second season was a lot more fan service and more romantic approaches from the heroines to the main character, This season was purposed to that angle and the uncovering of ""Phantom Task"", The explanation on why was ""Ichika Oremura"" was kidnapped on his early youth and why Ms.Oremura had to step in when she was at a tournament at the time. Many reviewers don\'t understand the directors point of view or...why did the writer did what he did to make this season. This a fanservice + base of what will happen on Infinite Stratos 3rd season, Since ""Phantom Task"" will take a heavy lead on the upcoming anime and A background of Dr.Tabane will be revealed and show her real intentions.

It just has an unfinished taste to it, Because like i said it\'s a background anime with some action but serves as base to avoid certain explaining on the next seasons and at the same time raise questions.A word of advice to ya all would be, Develop what i call an Spherical Understanding, You don\'t get it? Well how many sides does a sphere have? I guess that was hint enough. Don\'t approach an anime from just 1 angle if you do you\'re no different than a BLIND MAN trying to judge an animes graphics. why did the writer did what he did to make this season.

But sadly it caught up to the light novel. The second season of IS was great but, had a lot of filler moments and episodes. Some episodes are meant to be very funny and has nothing to do with the story which disappoints. Harem moments within the show don't last, and certain character moments are quite lacking.  Overall it's an average, good adaptation to a light novel series. Plus it has it's first video game to come out and is some what popular within Japan.Overall 8/10 "", 'So let\'s get this out of the way early: this is not what one would consider a ""good"" anime, even by the standards set by the first season. It\'s not even a good ecchi. This is the second season of a harem ecchi that toned down just about everything from the fanservice to character development. Actually, it\'s one of the rare anime that would have really been helped by adding more (or any) tits - as the whole show is based on a ridiculous harem-ecchi premise that fails to deliver. Going for pure fanservice ridiculousness I get, hell I even support it, but this lacks...even that.That being said, it\'s entertaining if you go into it with the right mindset. Nothing here is going to make you think, or make you feel, or tickle your nether regions, but it\'s an amusing kind of bad at least. I\'ll try to avoid spoilers, but honestly nothing is surprising enough that could be spoiled.Story: Underdeveloped at best. There is no resolution, and the entire ""real"" plot revolves around a team-rocketesque secret group known as Phantom Task that randomly show up in what should be very rare personal IS machines, mess up some scenery, then retreat. Stuff just kinda happens.3/10Art: For the most part this is the highlight. Not much different than the first season, the characters are designed well and uniquely enough, though admittedly not in a groundbreaking kind of way. The girls are cute and varied, and even most of the extras are well designed from an artistic standpoint. The mechs are well designed, however in combat and motion they range from very fluid to clunky-as-hell like the CGI was never completely finished.6/10Sound: Nothing of note here really. Not bad, not good, completely average anime soundtrack.5/10Character: Lets take a moment to talk about the main character, Orimura Ichika. To say this guy is dumb would be a compliment. He\'s so amazingly oblivious all the time it\'s amazing he isn\'t constantly wetting himself. Not only is he dumb, he is awkward and about as sexual as a can of beans. God forbid he take a girl\'s measurements with his eyes open - the only thing he has going for him is he is the only outie in a sea of innies, and he\'s really good and bashing his head into things until they break. 95% of what this guy does is suck and lose, his entire purpose is to throw himself in front of whatever high powered beam weapon is being shot at a cute female companion. This is the guy that is the linchpin of the whole story.As for the rest of them, there\'s only one real stint of character development in the whole season and it boils down to a shy girl falling in love with a moron, the same moron who is already being half-seduced by that girl\'s sister. Every other character was deemed developed enough in the first season I suppose, so they all go on the back burner until it\'s time to randomly beat some Ichika ass for accidentally seeing side-boob while adrift in a sea of women.4/10Enjoyment: All that being said, I did enjoy it for what it was. You definitely have to turn your brain off to get any enjoyment out of this show, but hey - it\'s flashy at times and almost ecchi. As I said before, everything was dialed back and it exists in this strange in-between gray area for an anime. There are some suggestive poses, but a severe lack of fanservice and tits to be anywhere near a good ecchi. It would have done itself a big favor to just embrace its ecchi soul and go with it, but it didn\'t. At the same time, it\'s not anywhere near developed enough or even tell a coherent story enough to be the anime it wants to be. However, it\'s amusing and the art is pretty, so that\'s something.6/10Overall: Add it all together, and you get something exceptionally average. No risks were taken, and no meaningful story was told. Then again, it\'s not like I\'m lamenting the time I spent watching it, so that\'s something. It is at least worth looking at for a palate cleanser.5/10 even that.That being said, it\'s entertaining if you go into it with the right mindset. Nothing here is going to make you think, or make you feel, or tickle your nether regions, but it\'s an amusing kind of bad at least. I\'ll try to avoid spoilers, but honestly nothing is surprising enough that could be spoiled.Story: Underdeveloped at best. There is no resolution, and the entire ""real"" plot revolves around a team-rocketesque secret group known as Phantom Task that randomly show up in what should be very rare personal IS machines, mess up some scenery, then retreat. Stuff just kinda happens.3/10Art: For the most part this is the highlight. Not much different than the first season, the characters are designed well and uniquely enough, though admittedly not in a groundbreaking kind of way. The girls are cute and varied, and even most of the extras are well designed from an artistic standpoint. The mechs are well designed, however in combat and motion they range from very fluid to clunky-as-hell like the CGI was never completely finished.6/10Sound: Nothing of note here really. Not bad, not good, completely average anime soundtrack.5/10Character: Lets take a moment to talk about the main character, Orimura Ichika. To say this guy is dumb would be a compliment. He\'s so amazingly oblivious all the time it\'s amazing he isn\'t constantly wetting himself. Not only is he dumb, he is awkward and about as sexual as a can of beans. God forbid he take a girl\'s measurements with his eyes open - the only thing he has going for him is he is the only outie in a sea of innies, and he\'s really good and bashing his head into things until they break. 95% of what this guy does is suck and lose, his entire purpose is to throw himself in front of whatever high powered beam weapon is being shot at a cute female companion.

I enjoyed it as much as any other harem lover would, but the thing that really hit me is this. Us Infinite Stratos fans waited for a sequel, and they give us a sequel. They give a totally incomplete series and although good for the most part, it was totally ruined by the ending. I honestly like this one, because unlike newer harem animes, they are more concerned on the trope of the harem genre, Infinite Stratos 2, like the first season, gave a blend...of both harem and its action. Its a good combination for those harem lovers who seek a new blend, unlike the usual school life RomCom. However, despite all these, why do I give it only a 6 and not a good rating of 8 like its previous season? ITS ENDING THAT\'S WHATUnlike the previous season, the ending actually gave way to a sequel, but it was good enough even without it. The second season gave an ending that was simply saying ""I STILL HAVE MORE PLOT TO SHOW AND MORE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER, BUT I WON\'T SHOW YOU ANYMORE"". The season as a whole was good and enjoyable but the ending simply drove it all off away, I really feel it could have been much much more had it been at least 2-3 more episodes long. They gave the climax of the story and the main battle in less than an episode, if they had not compacted that into a single episode, It would have been much better. Also, had they given a little bit more, and not cutting us off right at the middle of the action, but not only did they cut off the action right at the middle, they only gave a 3-5 minute cool-down from all the action. You raised the tension and you expect to lose that tension from 3-5 minutes of cooling down? To add it all up, not only did the anime not answer the questions it even first presented, after the ending of the 12th episode, it even gave twice the amount of questions, unlike the 1st season that didn\'t give so many questions after the ending that would bother the audience even after the show, OH NO, this season gave us a complete set of questions that they didn\'t bother answering and cutting us off like that, it FELT LIKE A VERY ST*PID ending, but beyond that, it was enjoyableStory (6/10) - The story is as typical as any other harem genres, but with a mix in of good action. It\'d get an 8/10 or a 9/10 for me had they given more plot than harem. I was fine with all of the harem moments, but the climax was half done and it was barely an ending, more of a ""calm before a storm"" type of feel, so it leaves even more questions.Art (9/10) - gotta admit, the art is enjoyable. Although a few problems here and there, but not enough for one to notice unless you watch it multiple times. The 3D elements make it seem very action packed, though transition from 3D to 2D is a bit annoying at times but no worries, the 3D elements are only a few selected battle scenes. The OP and ED gave it even more spice since every episode features the girls running(along with Ichika) in different outfits based on the episode\'s settingSound (10/10) - How can you NOT like the sound? the OP was great (the ending didn\'t beat SUPER STREAM of the first season in my opinion, but it was enjoyable), and the voice actors did a very good job. As usual, the 5 girls\' voice actresses did a wonderful job in portraying their character, and the BGM is very catchy and is most of the time spot on with the episode\'s situationCharacter (7/10) - I\'d give it a 4/10 supposedly since none of the girls ever even made any progress, and all of them are usually together when there are harem moments. The only reason I gave it a 7/10 is because of Tatenashi, and Kanzashi. In contrast to the previous season, where I\'d given a 8/10 score because all girls were given their own chance to develop their characters and even show different sides of themselves, in this season they all had their moments, but they barely showed any character development or anything new from twhat the previous season had already shown. Most of the characters were very predictable and never really went out of their character tropes or pretty much anything that the 1st season ever showed. This is not the case with Kanzashi and Tatenashi, as they were properly given development, and they gave out more mystery to their true character than what they already show. Ichika and Chifuyu also shined here, since we find out more on Ichika and Chifuyu, more of what they feel and more of their character, unlike the previous season that simply showed Ichika getting kicked in the as* by other girls.Enjoyment (6/10) - Yeah, I\'d give it an 9/10 if not for the ending. Although most of the characters\' development were slow and relied on harem moments to even get screen time, other characters still showed fair developments on their own, and they were very enjoyable. The story was very enjoyable up to the episode before the last. I really think it would have been better had they allotted at least a 24 episode season than a 12 episode, because there was simply too much plot to cover. Even if it wasn\'t a 24 episode season, at least 1-2 more episodes, one to cool down the tension form the previous fighting and another to answer all the questions, or at least give hints on them, not leave them on our face at point blank.Overall (7/10) - well, what can I say? it was good, but it could\'ve been better. So many unanswered questions, and it\'ll only leave me wanting to know more, but knowing this anime, I\'d only get it way after I\'d already lost interest in wanting to know more. My advice to the people who are diligently watching the series and is still a big fan of the series is to read the light novel, since it explains all the questions that this season 2 never bothered to answer. Beyond the ending, it was a very enjoyable show of both harem and its action. Its a good combination for those harem lovers who seek a new blend, unlike the usual school life RomCom. However, despite all these, why do I give it only a 6 and not a good rating of 8 like its previous season? ITS ENDING THAT\'S WHATUnlike the previous season, the ending actually gave way to a sequel, but it was good enough even without it.

Beyond the ending, it was a very enjoyable show', '""Second season of Infinite Stratos.""- Synopsis as of February 17, 2016This season is so bad that even the synopsis struggles to come up with anything to say about this garbage. So allow me (and all of the other negative reviews) to give it a helping hand.Infinite Stratos 2: Electric Boogaloo is a perfect example of not only how not to write a sequel, but also how not to create an anime with any redeeming qualities whatsoever.I\'ll be honest with you. I actually... kinda enjoyed the first season, if only just for Charlotte....Besides that, it was typical harem formula, ie. not much actual story.This sequel follows suite with the harem formula as well, having little to no plot.So, why do I let the first season slide away with a 6 while this gets the only 1 rating I\'ve ever given to a show as of the time I wrote this?BECAUSE IT DIDN\'T TRY TO FUCKING LIE TO US.You see, what the second season did was introduce a fairly interesting plot point in order to add some needed depth to the series, and if the writers continued with this idea, the show could\'ve had some kind of legs to stand on.Sadly, the writers decided not to expand on this fairly neat idea, and instead chose to try to expand our pants instead, with an endless stream of T&A (and not even GOOD T&A!).And when the writers actually CHOSE to think even a little bit about creating something of quality with that idea, what did they give us?2 minute cliffhangers every so often that barely progressed the story.Are you fucking kidding me?For the writers to lie to viewers like this is completely underhanded and totally insulting; I don\'t even know what else to say to be honest.Even when factoring out the blatant lies, the show is still utter shit on its own.As previously stated, it\'s nothing more than bad T&A, but what\'s even worse than that is that apparently the writers weren\'t done demonstrating their incompetence, so they decided to flanderize pretty much every character in show.The girls (even Charlotte!) are noticeably more bitchy, pretty much rendering some of them almost unlikable.And as for Ichika?H O L Y S H I T.He went from being dense yet at least still showed signs of competence in other areas, to being nothing more than an insufferable, idiotic, pushover of a ""man"".So basically a self insert for the writers.And the Sarashiki\'s are nothing more than an addition to Bitchka\'s harem. Seriously, take them out and the show wouldn\'t be much different. Or good._______________________________________________________If it wasn\'t obvious enough, Infinite Stratos 2 is little more than an insulting cesspool of bad fanservice, horrible characters, shit writing, and LIES. Besides that, it was typical harem formula, ie. not much actual story.This sequel follows suite with the harem formula as well, having little to no plot.So, why do I let the first season slide away with a 6 while this gets the only 1 rating I\'ve ever given to a show as of the time I wrote this?BECAUSE IT DIDN\'T TRY TO FUCKING LIE TO US.You see, what the second season did was introduce a fairly interesting plot point in order to add some needed depth to the series, and if the writers continued with this idea, the show could\'ve had some kind of legs to stand on.Sadly, the writers decided not to expand on this fairly neat idea, and instead chose to try to expand our pants instead, with an endless stream of T&A (and not even GOOD T&A!).And when the writers actually CHOSE to think even a little bit about creating something of quality with that idea, what did they give us?2 minute cliffhangers every so often that barely progressed the story.Are you fucking kidding me?For the writers to lie to viewers like this is completely underhanded and totally insulting; I don\'t even know what else to say to be honest.Even when factoring out the blatant lies, the show is still utter shit on its own.As previously stated, it\'s nothing more than bad T&A, but what\'s even worse than that is that apparently the writers weren\'t done demonstrating their incompetence, so they decided to flanderize pretty much every character in show.The girls (even Charlotte!) are noticeably more bitchy, pretty much rendering some of them almost unlikable.And as for Ichika?H O L Y S H I T.He went from being dense yet at least still showed signs of competence in other areas, to being nothing more than an insufferable, idiotic, pushover of a ""man"".So basically a self insert for the writers.And the Sarashiki\'s are nothing more than an addition to Bitchka\'s harem.

It didn't even put effort into progressing the plot that it was setting up for in the previous season. Each episode is 17 minutes of fan service and 5 minutes of substance. This season has decided to push any chance to have a story or character development out of the window just for cheap and dull fan service we already experienced in season one. I can't even remember the story because of how little the show spends on it for all 12 episodes. This season spends 20 minutes focused on...the plot. Anyone who enjoys this season, I'm positive are new to anime and are here for the harem and titties. There cannot be any other reason to say you enjoy this show.Art: Here's the most positive thing I can say about the show and that's the art is pretty good and the color scheme is solid. Yeah the mecha designs are pretty generic, but I can let it slide. The character's design is also somewhat charming and memorable. I admittedly suck at remembering character's names, but their interesting design helps.Sound/Music: As for sound effects and voice acting, this anime has done an acceptable job. It's not unbearable, so thank goodness. The soundtrack of this season smacks, so credit given where credit is due.Character: Now that we're done with all of the positives this show has to offer now it's all down hill from here. Yes the characters are memorable, but that's strictly because the art style makes them so. Other than that, the characters don't have anything worth mentioning. Yeah, it's cool that all of the harem girls are of different ethnic background, but that's all your getting for anything interesting about them. Now let's talk about the elephant in the room, Ichika Orimura is THE harem protagonist. When you think harem protagonist, this is the guy you think of. No personality, no real interesting trait; other being the only male being able to pilot an IS, and the reason he has a flock of girls falling for him is because he's a nice guy and you know why he's a nice guy? Because you're a nice guy. He's literally an empty vessel for you to project yourself onto. He's as boring as mine and your middle school and high school love lives. He has no depth, he isn't funny, and/or doesn't have an actual motive or goal. I am confident that if the studio swapped him with a cardboard box in the middle of an episode, no one would notice. With the introduction of a few more girls this season to join the harem circle jerk, they are both completely forgettable. I actually had to go check what their names were whilst typing this review.Enjoyment: I did not enjoy this in the slightest. I believe gargling a bowl of nails would be more entertaining and fun than re-watching this season. I can tolerate season 1 because it did have fun battles and actually attempted to push a story, but if I had to choose to either watch this again or to fight Madara Uchiha solo? Then hand me my ninja headband and allow me to get folded properly.Overall: This show is awful and I could theoretically recommend the first season, but I would always suggest that they should stop right there. I wouldn't recommend this show to my worst enemy. I can't even sarcastically suggest this to someone. If you're reading this right now and you haven't watch this yet, you are currently blessed.

His relationships with these girls go nowhere and we are deprived of the maturing ichika since he still seems to show no interest in girls whatsoever and is not any less clueless than he was in the first season.I was really looking forward to seeing a more developed matured or at least not quite as oblivious ichika but that wish was not fulfilled.  We still watch in agony as ichika fails to sieze the opportunities with any of these girls.I  also hated the...adding of additional girls to his following.  I realy would have rather seen a decrease in the number of active females... as in like elimination some of them from the group so that there were less girls but still a conflict over ichika... just a side note: my favorites for the group would be the brittish girl, charl, Laura, and his first childhood friend (who he was rooming with in the beginning of the first season)But ya lots of dissapointment with the lack of progression in the ""contest"" between these girls Tiny SPOILERso if you are just continuing watching this series to find out who he ends up with then STOP NOW and save yourself the time because his relationships with these girls make no progress at all.The thing with the new girl bad guy with the same last name was dissapointing and left alot of unanswwered questions.The season is definately worth a watch though if you have the free time. adding of additional girls to his following.

If your reading this then you have either watched the first season and enjoyed it even a bit, then have already watched the second and wanted to see what I think or honestly are contemplating watching the show, and need a reason to say ""sure, why not?"" I enjoyed the first season and was wishing for the same enjoyment I got from the first that I sadly did not completely get it, but it does not mean you wont enjoy it. The story has all the action,...semi-fan service, and harem you need to make a fun show, which it was don\'t get me wrong, but the story doesn\'t bring anything new to the table in means of tougher battles or plot elements that supplement this mediocre story they set out to make money off of. I\'m not saying the plots bad, but it pails in comparison to the first season, in all honesty.Characters: 5. IS: Infinite Stratos 2 is a continuation of the first season, and that entails exactly as it says it is. All the girls from the first season still love Ichika, god knows why, but its still the same, and Ichika is still dense enough to not notice any of the lovely ladies affection for him.  He always goes back to the namesake phrase, that I put at the top of the review, with a red slap mark basically pasted on his blank staring face. I think they should have changed the dialogue so he wouldn\'t say that line more times in a few episodes than he has complimented the girls for the entire series. Even though I disliked this part of the show I still did love the cast of characters, flawed as they appear to be. I sometimes wondered if it was because he\'s the only boy in school or because who he is that makes the ladies so excited, but hey simple questions. It sadly even seemed like all the love interests of Ichika were pushed back a bit except for some particular episodes, Ill call them filler episodes that were meant for nothing except possibly growth?, I couldn\'t tell, to focus on the plot which was kinda saddening. Its just that barely no character development or teasing that something might happen in between one girl and the main character that makes me herald this aspect a 5.Art: 8. The art and animation is colorful, very beautiful to look at, and makes you want to keep your eyes on the screen for the whole episode, as long as the aforementioned doesn\'t stop you.Sound: 7. The sound in this show is actually quite enjoyable from the opening song to the ending song, to the voice acting that I thought was really well done, cough Kana Hanazawa cough, and even the laser and rocket sounds. Some of the sounds of the battles are the same as most other mech anime but I do understand they\'re metal and metal obviously hitting metal will sound the same no matter how it goes, so yeah.Enjoyment: 7. From the music, to the characters, to the plot, I still enjoyed every minute of this show, it definitely has a certain pull to it. The characters are all fun from the childhood friends to the shy girls, they are all colorful, not completely new but funny in their own ways. The music for this show I think most will enjoy because it is upbeat and makes you ready for whatever is coming next be it random tripping into breasts, or mech fights. I felt that if the plot was lifted a bit in the beginning and middle episodes with more be it comedy or a battle and the main character chose someone or even noticed them as women, it could have fared better in my eyes and maybe many others.Overall: 6. I\'ve explained most of my reasoning up above, but I will say my last comments and if you have made it this far, I thank you. I normally give a show I sat through and enjoyed watching a little better fare but my forehead turned read from how many time I face palmed myself over Ichika reacting as if he was afraid of women, he might as well be, or his moral system is on overload. There is a line in between showing attention to the women that adore you and wanting to jump off a cliff when any woman holds your arm. This show was a great example of a mech show done in a fun and light hearted matter but still had a bunch of parts where you go, ""come on man, do something, please"" without actually caring what Ichika does because hes respectable yet predictable in his actions. I have chosen a 6/10 for this show, and I hope you read my future reviews. semi-fan service, and harem you need to make a fun show, which it was don\'t get me wrong, but the story doesn\'t bring anything new to the table in means of tougher battles or plot elements that supplement this mediocre story they set out to make money off of. I\'m not saying the plots bad, but it pails in comparison to the first season, in all honesty.Characters: 5. IS: Infinite Stratos 2 is a continuation of the first season, and that entails exactly as it says it is. All the girls from the first season still love Ichika, god knows why, but its still the same, and Ichika is still dense enough to not notice any of the lovely ladies affection for him.  He always goes back to the namesake phrase, that I put at the top of the review, with a red slap mark basically pasted on his blank staring face. I think they should have changed the dialogue so he wouldn\'t say that line more times in a few episodes than he has complimented the girls for the entire series. Even though I disliked this part of the show I still did love the cast of characters, flawed as they appear to be. I sometimes wondered if it was because he\'s the only boy in school or because who he is that makes the ladies so excited, but hey simple questions. It sadly even seemed like all the love interests of Ichika were pushed back a bit except for some particular episodes, Ill call them filler episodes that were meant for nothing except possibly growth?, I couldn\'t tell, to focus on the plot which was kinda saddening. Its just that barely no character development or teasing that something might happen in between one girl and the main character that makes me herald this aspect a 5.Art: 8. The art and animation is colorful, very beautiful to look at, and makes you want to keep your eyes on the screen for the whole episode, as long as the aforementioned doesn\'t stop you.Sound: 7. The sound in this show is actually quite enjoyable from the opening song to the ending song, to the voice acting that I thought was really well done, cough Kana Hanazawa cough, and even the laser and rocket sounds. Some of the sounds of the battles are the same as most other mech anime but I do understand they\'re metal and metal obviously hitting metal will sound the same no matter how it goes, so yeah.Enjoyment: 7. From the music, to the characters, to the plot, I still enjoyed every minute of this show, it definitely has a certain pull to it. The characters are all fun from the childhood friends to the shy girls, they are all colorful, not completely new but funny in their own ways. The music for this show I think most will enjoy because it is upbeat and makes you ready for whatever is coming next be it random tripping into breasts, or mech fights. I felt that if the plot was lifted a bit in the beginning and middle episodes with more be it comedy or a battle and the main character chose someone or even noticed them as women, it could have fared better in my eyes and maybe many others.Overall: 6. I\'ve explained most of my reasoning up above, but I will say my last comments and if you have made it this far, I thank you. I normally give a show I sat through and enjoyed watching a little better fare but my forehead turned read from how many time I face palmed myself over Ichika reacting as if he was afraid of women, he might as well be, or his moral system is on overload.

I've noticed a lot of people have been very negative about this series, and that's OK. What I have to say is a little different though. Some anime series are to provoke though, some are here for multitudes of other reasons. This season of Infinite Stratos DID lack in plot development, BUT it did what it was supposed to do. It was very entertaining. This is one of those anime series that is here for the soul purpose to entertain you and I'd say it did a good job at its...purpose. It lacked in story development, the art was really good though. The soundtrack was not extensive, but what it did have sounded really really good. The character development could have been done better, but I grew attached to the characters quite easily. This series was enjoyable to me. Over all...Im going to give this a 7/10. purpose.

season didn't really do was a story and even though it wasn't amazing it definitely gave us something interesting about Ichika's family history.The story continues with Ichika Orimura and the IS girls as they carry on fighting over Ichika however with the introduction of new female characters and the appearance of Phantom Task the situation is about to change.Now I will give the second season credit for trying to create a story and honestly it wasn't too bad because we get to learn a little more about Ichika's past and what one of...the members of Phantom Task has to do with him which does cause some revelations to happen.We also get to see the girls relationship develop more despite their obsession with Ichika they can actually get along until more competition arrives, we even learn more about the IS units and how vital they can be as tools or weapons.The characters do develop a little more this season although most of the characters pretty much remain the same.Ichika is still the usual dense protagonist that he is and pretty much ends up in the same predicament as the first series where he gets injured and sees the mind of the IS unit before defeating the bad guy again.Houki, Lin and Cecillia are pretty much unchanged as they continue to bicker and whine as always although Cecillia does have a few moments that make her a little likeable.Laura and Charlotte actually become much closer as friends this series and they both seem very adorable especially when their either dressed up in cat suits or beating up some bad guys in an attempted robbery.However there is a few new additions to the group and they are Tatenashi and Kanzashi who are both sisters, but very different people Tatenashi is very energetic and is very flirty with Ichika not really giving a damn about the other female characters, but she is technically what this group needed which was more hyperactivity than Tsunderes, Kanzashi is a very shy person mainly avoiding her classmates and focusing on building her IS and because her IS was set back in development because of Ichika's IS she hates him at first until Ichika changes her view of him.There is even a few villainesses since Ichika is the only guy to pilot an IS, these women that are part of Phantom Task can be quite ruthless in their methods which includes bombing the Academy and even planting a bomb on a train, we don't really know why they are doing so hopefully we'll know at some point in the future.The artstyle pretty much was on par with the first season other than some new interesting looking IS units there isn't really much else other than the group going to a water park and a monastery, the monastery and it's surrounding's did look pretty good though.The action was definitely improved this season as we get to see Ichika and the girls fighting real opponents this season rather than robots that have been hacked and the battles did feel more hectic since the weaponry the Phantom Task brought to the table were damn destructive.There were some funny comedic moments especially whenever Tatenashi was on screen who I felt was created for this specific reason since the comedy in season 1 was lacking in some areas since there wasn't really a character that had a comedic personality.The fanservice definitely increased this season as there was an entire episode dedicated to it and that was the surprise show that the girls put on for Ichika where they put on sexy outfits and played games with him or gave him something to eat or drink, but I will admit all of the girls did look good during this episode so even the girls I didn't like did well when it came to looks.Overall this was either slightly better or on par with season 1 it was pretty difficult to tell, but for a sequel it wasn't too bad and it remained entertaining for me. the members of Phantom Task has to do with him which does cause some revelations to happen.We also get to see the girls relationship develop more despite

slightly better or on par with season 1 it was pretty difficult to tell, but for a sequel it wasn't too bad and it remained entertaining for me."", ""tl;dr: A sequel season to IS that has less in terms of lighthearted moment but a more substantial story.This season was quite a bit different from the first season I thought, and to sum it up I would say that it was messier and less cohesive, but more interesting. The reason for that is it felt like in addition to the standard lighthearted antics that made up the first season, there was a second story with substance going on in the background that would sometimes show up. The lighthearted aspect I think was a bit weaker than the previous season, in that there was a...lot less of it, especially focused on the already introduced heroines. What was there was still good however.\xa0Ichika\xa0being super\xa0dense was originally somewhat annoying but it was actually kind of growing on\xa0me, and him being a sis-con at the center of everything was super amusing.\xa0In regards to the actual content,\xa0Ichika's\xa0birthday probably being the best lighthearted event in the series and the adventures of Laura and Charlotte also being quite fun, but it felt somewhat lacking after the expectations set with the first season. In terms of new characters,\xa0Tatenashi's\xa0introduction was pretty weak.\xa0Kanzashi's though was probably the best so far other than maybe Charlotte having a pretty well-developed arc. Still, it wasn't them that took away time from what most people expected from IS. Rather it was the story involving Phantom Task. This story was much more intense than anything else in the show, this season or previous, with a much stronger sense of danger. This was especially apparent in that the transitions to this were quite abrupt, appearing out of nowhere and cutting off whatever was happening on the more lighthearted side.\xa0As for the story itself, I thought it was reasonably solid so far and felt that something like it, some sort of overarching serious story line, was definitely needed to keep IS interesting. The villains seemed interesting enough and it seemed there was a lot happening behinds the scenes. However, because it is so intermixed with the\xa0lighthearted\xa0content, it really doesn't go all that far. It feels like we got a third of an arc, and nothing has been resolved at all. The ending had a pretty amazing battle, but the last episode was incredibly rushed, and ultimately ended in a way that had no impact, feeling like the ending to any other episode.\xa0So\xa0ultimately,\xa0I really liked the direction they were going in, but it didn't quite get there.The art and animation were about as good as the previous season.

Why? Because Bahamut exists. To be frank, this show isn\'t for those who can\'t do absurd, unrealistic moments that seriously question how many drugs it took the writers of the show to approve. What I\'m getting at is this anime shouldn\'t be set to high expectations, because it doesn\'t intend to aim for them. This show is something that you should only watch if you\'re familiar with ecchi/harem. If you are, then you\'ll be pleased to know that this is a step ahead of some of the trash you may encounter when trying to watch a...good show. Think of it like Highschool of the Dead compared to Highschool DxD. Similar to DxD, Infinite Stratos goes in hard and comes away with a few questionable moments, a few WTF am I watching scenes, but at times, a few memorable and inspiring parts that show the potential it has. Anyways, enough with the pep talk. Let\'s dive in...STORY6/10If I had to give you a story about what this anime is about, I couldn\'t. There are machines called IS Units, which (for some plot development) can only be piloted by women. Why does this matter? Because a boy for the first time in history can wield one as well (again, why? I don\'t know plot armor I guess). Having the ability to do so, he goes to a private school to learn more about the IS Units, how to control his own, master the mechanics, and potentially become a representative of his country (Japan). The problem is that the school he goes to is an all-girls one (since only girls at that time could pilot an IS), and he has to adjust/adapt accordingly. See what I\'m getting at? The show consists of his training, some combat tournaments, and a few fights with a mysterious organization, where one of the members has a bone to pick with the main character\'s older sister (who is a teacher at the school). The show also dives into his personal life and day-to-day interactions with other characters (again, this is an ecchi anime, so you probably know what to expect ;3 ). There\'s not a lot of backbone to this anime in terms of story, but it gives a somewhat reasonable set-up to follow through with.ART8.5/10I have to give it to them, some of these shots are gorgeous. The fighting scenes, the vibrant colors, everything in terms of art are underestimated in my opinion. Even though it\'s overshadowed by the main purpose of the anime, I can\'t write this review without mentioning how well the artists did.SOUND8/10The sound is a nice touch as well. The drastic, feeling of chaos through an enemies\' appearance, or the valiant heroic trumpets that preach to the heavens when a character finds the strength to persevere. Even the soft parts in the background of school-life make this series easier to watch and immerse yourself as a student of IS Academy.Character???/10Oh boy, now my least favorite part of the anime.There are so many unnecessary characters and parts that really tone down how well this anime could have done. I\'ll start off with the worst ones.Cecilia Alcott and Lingyin Huang (3/10 and 0/10)Wow, what a shame for these two.The signature combo deal of underused and lack of personality given to these two. Essentially, both were put in the spotlight for one or two animes before being kicked to the curb and used only in tandem with other main characters. They offer no significant purpose to the storyline and are mainly used for comedic relief or straight up frustration in the viewer. In all honesty, they didn\'t even need Ling, she was such a waste of space and only had ""2nd childhood friend"" going for her. Laura had some moments, but not enough to be taken out of this group.Houki Shinonono (4-5/10)I just don\'t like this one.I mean, you got childhood friend (boring way to bring up a character) who has this kind of off and on relationship with the main character. She\'s practically useless for the first ten episodes of the season until she gets her own IS, and even then she isn\'t up to standards against some of the other characters in the story. She is better than the two below, but honestly is just a boring character who the writers couldn\'t do much with, in my opinion.Ichika Orimura (6/10)Oh boy, the dumbest dude on the block who can\'t even take a hint to save his life.Honestly, Ichika wasn\'t as bad as I thought he was. To be fair, he is dumb and he is a typical ecchi main character. However, he did have a few redeeming qualities that put him above the others in this category.THE MAIN CHARACTER ISN\'T OP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ok, so basically, this dude is weak, right? He can\'t do much in combat against others, but that doesn\'t stop him from trying. He goes in recklessly, usually with no plan, but also has the ability to protect others in times of need. Plot armor is pretty good, eh?Ichika is just average, but his interactions with some special characters up above show the chemistry between the two and I think the writers did a good job with that.Kanzashi Sarashiki (7/10)I\'m just going to call her Kanz cause it\'s easier than typing it out.Introduced in season 2, Kanz is the younger sibling to Tatenashi. She was supposed to have her own IS unit, but didn\'t receive one because the company that makes them had switched to build Ichika\'s. Kanz is quiet, an outsider looking in. She managed to build her own IS and has a special connection with her sister. She wants to stand with her, instead of always being behind her. It becomes clear to her that Tatenashi was the person who she always admired, and we see their bond in a scene where Tate blocks an incoming attack, protecting Kanz but also wounding herself in the process. It\'s moments like these where the anime has that glimpse of the spark that some of the greatest anime\'s in history have; The ability to show vulnerability. Kanz was a good addition to this season and fits in nicely with the crew.Laura Bodewig and Chifuyu Orimura (8/10 for both)Now we\'re getting into my favorites of the whole anime. Laura is just adorable at times because of her inability to address the situation in a dignified manner. For instance, in the first season, she lost to Ichika and Charlotte in a tournament. Her response after? She kisses Ichika full-on and claims that she is now his bride. Bold, stupid, but pretty funny as well. Laura also has some moments where she doesn\'t know how to be a girl and asks for help from her crew (showing that even the strongest of characters need help from the people around them). Chifuyu in a different yet similar sense is more of a parent figure to Ichika. Her intentions are to protect and bring out the best in him, even if it means a few books slaps to the head. I enjoyed these two in the series.Finally, my top two favorite characters of the series.Tatenashi SarashikiandCharlotte DunoisBoth 10/10I know, I know, pretty controversial to say something like that. These two, in my own opinion, really brought out the best in all the characters they interacted with. Sure, there are definitely some goofy moments that taint their ideals, but that is to be expected with most if not all anime. Tatenashi was bubbly and bursting with energy, while Charlotte was actually not an airhead for most of the series. She held her own, had some nice conversations with Ichika, and, I guess, smarter than most other characters. I\'m pretty sure that without these two, this anime would be a dumpster fire sitting at a 5.00 on MMA.ENJOYMENT7/10Look, this anime has some bright spots. As someone familiar to the ecchi kingdom, this was more pleasant than some of the other unfortunate animes I have watched in the past (I\'m looking at you Kanokon). All joking aside, this was a nice nostalgia trip for me since I had already watched the first season when I was younger. It does have a lot of weird and questionable moments, but also some heartwarming ones with a touch of passion that the writers snuck into this series.OVERALL7/10I think if you are familiar with this type of anime, you\'ll find a lot of joy in watching it. It\'s funny, it has action, it\'s ecchi, and it\'s pretty short as well. I binged watched this in two days, so you know how well it was for me. Thank you for reading my review, I hope to convey people to either watch it or stay away until you get familiar to the ecchi world. Thanks :) good show.

Sure, there are definitely some goofy moments that taint their ideals, but that is to be expected with most if not all anime. Tatenashi was bubbly and bursting with energy, while Charlotte was actually not an airhead for most of the series. She held her own, had some nice conversations with Ichika, and, I guess, smarter than most other characters. I\'m pretty sure that without these two, this anime would be a dumpster fire sitting at a 5.00 on MMA.ENJOYMENT7/10Look, this anime has some bright spots. As someone familiar to the ecchi kingdom, this was more pleasant than some of the other unfortunate animes I have watched in the past (I\'m looking at you Kanokon). All joking aside, this was a nice nostalgia trip for me since I had already watched the first season when I was younger. It does have a lot of weird and questionable moments, but also some heartwarming ones with a touch of passion that the writers snuck into this series.OVERALL7/10I think if you are familiar with this type of anime, you\'ll find a lot of joy in watching it. It\'s funny, it has action, it\'s ecchi, and it\'s pretty short as well. I binged watched this in two days, so you know how well it was for me. Thank you for reading my review, I hope to convey people to either watch it or stay away until you get familiar to the ecchi world. Thanks :)', ""Ok, before anyone reads this review I just want to say this:I don't think any better of this show than anyone else who wrote a review about this anime, but I simply have a different way of rating it. The existence of the show and the things being shown actually being comprehensible make it worth a rating of 5, together with the fact that I don't really feel sorry for watching this.On to the real review. If you enjoy criticizing people, or anime, or both (like I do), I highly recommend this anime to you. Thinking of everything the protagonists could have done in a...less stupid way may actually make you feel better about yourself. Because they suck. For example, what do you do when a group of mad girls finds you while you're talking to another girl? Of course, you pick her up and run! While looking the wrong way of course, so you can bump into yet another girl.IS2 consists of 2 repetitive scenes, the ecchi scenes (AKA Ichika seems brainless scenes) and the battle scenes (AKA Ichika seems brainless scenes). In the first mentioned, Ichika is talking to a girl who ends up blushing, and he either says something stupid, or the other girls show up. The result: They're mad, he doesn't understand, not even if their reason is legit. I do think the characters have their defining features, but when they need to decide on something it's shown that the not-fighting scenes are nothing but a vessel for the fan service. There always is some dumb mistake/decision from one of the parties, which always results in some embarrassment, escaping, which leads to more of the same. Typical fan-service only scenarios.For the fighting scenes, I'll explain some basic rules of the series which will probably make my point clear. They fly around. They scream. It usually ends with Ichika pushing the enemy with the flat side of his sword, to... push them. I guess he doesn't know swords work better when swinging them. Not introduced fighters are weaker than anybody else. Ichika is shown to be very weak in training, but everyone depends on him. And by the way, if all girls need to be together around Ichika, they can teleport. Or something like that. I don't know.About the story: It does exist. There is a storyline, and one of the baddies has some vague motive for being angry. The problem is, everything is too far-fetched. When you want to kill someone, you don't shoot them once and believe they are dead. If you find out there's a bomb on a train, a timer doesn't pop up automatically at exactly 30 minutes, which is the exact remaining time until detonation. When you die, you don't dream about being strangled by your sister. Anime doesn't have to be possible, but this was too much. Too bad these are exactly the things IS2 tries to link their story together.So, my conclusion. The series do have some fun theories in them, and sometimes you might find something to laugh about. You do need to be able to find entertainment in tiny details, in comparing stupid people to yourself, or in watching things even you could do better. If you can't do these things, stay away from this show. less stupid way may actually make you feel better about yourself. Because they suck.

Like, I feel I needed a logic handbook of Infinite Stratos because obviously our common sense in earth doesn\'t apply in this and it\'s a whole new universe.If you want to enjoy this anime, you need to remove high expectations of good writing. I\'m not sure anymore. When did I have such high standards?The art\'s pretty good and that\'s the best aspect of the series. I also thought the IS battle scenes were pretty cool, sometimes awesome. But...that\'s it, to me, that\'s where the anime didn\'t much fail from.By the way, most of main characters get wind up into really serious battles that are like maybe military-level? But those kids are 15 or 16? Where are their parents? I mean, how about after a battle, and they\'re exhausted and stuff, shouldn\'t the school contact their parents? Sure, maybe they don\'t want them to worry but you know, just in case?I adored the characters very much from the first season as I found out about their stories, most notably Charlotte, she was cool and sweet. I feel bad that these characters were being muddled because they deserve better. How about, one of them sees that Ichika will never change his oblivious because he is so stupid, and they would be like, "" I\'m better off without him.""Oh, and that\'s one of the problems, Infinite Stratos treats fresh ideas in the anime as quick-rotting matter. You know, like the harem. The glasses sister, you know her, you can see she feels incredibly inferior to her sister, there was some potential for Infinite Stratos to redeem itself but NO! No no no no. It\'s like the people who made this thought that the fact that they\'re trying to flesh out the character is not gonna be good and they\'re going to ruin it. And what do they do? They make that character fall in love with Ichika. Were the things he did seriously enough to make her attached?You can\'t really distinguish much of the harem since in this season they\'re all goggle-eyed at Ichika and you don\'t know them anymore. Like Ichika unknowingly brainwashed them. Yikes!Please, no third season or a follow-up OVA series. There\'s so many freaking plot holes nooooooo.... that\'s it, to me, that\'s where the anime didn\'t much fail from.By the way, most of main characters get wind up into really serious battles that are like maybe military-level?

But if you're watching this at 2 in the morning, expect laughs, because the only thing you'll understand is how deliciously stupid this anime is. But I digress, let me explain.I usually don't hate on the ecchi anime, because they usually serve their purpose, but when they go ahead as to destroy the little plot they can serve, it becomes bad. Really bad.STORY 1/10Coming from the light novel, this arc should have brought resolution to the story. Instead, what the anime does is leave it half done, in such a way that they're hinting at a S3 that will never happen. The execution was so bad, it seemed like it was pushed off to the side, and they instead focused on ecchi and the repetitiveness of the competitiveness of the harem. This action, comedy, mecha, sci-fi anime turned into a slice of life sci-fi with a bit of mecha in it. I've never seen such a thing happen. Disgusting. This is honestly a new low; the execution/plot ratio is so low, it's lower than Guilty Crown.CG: Good. Not the best; not the worst. Pretty cool mecha designs; action scenes not bad. That's about it. 3/5Sound: Nothing too special. Only noticeable was the redone main theme from S1. 1/2Character: No Development; new characters only brought plot, so they could have something to work with.

No, it wasn\'t perfect and I can understand why people dislike the show in general, but it was still a fun, character-driven romantic comedy with a healthy dose of action. Naturally, I wanted to see how the story continues, so watching Infinite Stratos 2 was kind of a no-brainer. So, does season 2 improves on season 1\'s traits? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!PlotInfinite Stratos debuted at a time where the harem genre was on its heyday and it was one of the anime that served as torchbearers for the harem...genre, alongside A Certain Magical Index, Highschool DxD and Date A Live. Season 1 was a flawed, yet ultimately acceptable experience, so how does season 2 hold up? Short answer: badly.Long answer: the show doesn\'t really evolve in either the harem aspect or anything else really. Yes, we are finally introduced to a true antagonistic group in the form of Phantom Task, but they\'re not really proactive in the grand scheme of things but when they do act, their fights feel repetitive and don\'t affect the grand scheme of things.No, seriously, the grand scheme of things doesn\'t actually involve stopping the bad guys at all. It\'s still the girls\' competition of winning Ichika\'s heart and, like I said before, that plotline moved a glacial pace in this season. No progress is ever made during the season, even when season 1 implied that Houki had gained a lead on the others. Yes, I get that harem shows need to keep the harem aspect going somehow, but other shows have been better at handling this aspect that IS did, which is very sad because IS is one of the first modern harem shows, meaning that it\'s starting to show its age. (4/10)CharactersCharacters are the lifeblood of the story. I\'ve said that before and I\'m sure I\'ll say it again. No matter how generic or rudimentary your story can be, it can be elevated by how much you can relate to the characters and, unfortunately, Infinite Stratos 2 falls flat in this regard. All the character development the girls have experienced in season 1 (well, at least the girls that did experience character development) is magically undone for the sake of keeping the harem aspect going and that means introducing new characters.Meet the Sarashiki sisters, Tatenashi and Kanzashi. Tatenashi is, for the lack of a better term, perfect. She is the IS Academy\'s student council president, has a monster of an IS and can run circles around Ichika and the other girls. Hell, even Ichika herself feels she is unattainable; and yet, that doesn\'t stop Tatenashi from inserting herself into his harem, whether he likes it or not. She doesn\'t have any discernible flaws and if she does have flaws, they don\'t affect her character in the long run. Can you say Mary Sue?As for Kanzashi; well, she is a bit better and her character development feels more natural, but I think it feels a bit of a retread of Laura\'s own character arc. She hates Ichika for something beyond his control but then she falls in love with him and to me, that just reeks of a lack of creativity.And now, we move on to the villains: Phantom Task. They\'re a trio of women who want to obtain information on IS units. Why? Who knows? The group is mysterious and the show wants to keep it that way. This show had 12 episodes to develop this group of characters and it wasted it in worthless harem antics. Holy crap! Talk about misplaced priorities! The only remotely interesting character in this group is Madoka, Ichika\'s long-lost sister (don\'t think about it too hard), but the show doesn\'t dwell on her relationship with either Ichika or Chifuyu or why she wants them dead.The biggest victim of the show\'s lousy character writing is, you guessed it, Ichika himself. The hero and the character we are supposed to relate to gets turned into a butt monkey that can no longer beat opponent on his own unless he has an overwhelming advantage over them and that\'s obviously a big strike against the main character of anything. When he does achieve a victory, it\'s either by the skin of his teeth, through sheer dumb luck or because he has help from more experienced fighters. In season 1, this made sense because he was still a rookie but we saw him improve and move past his flaws because he didn\'t want to be a burden to anyone, but this is undone for this season and now, he\'s become a glorified punching bag or a victim so that other characters save him.Don\'t get me wrong. I like Ichika on principle and I enjoy him when he is done well, but for the most part, it didn\'t really amount to much. This season was a huge disservice to the character and his community. (5/10)ArtSay what you will about season 2, but you can\'t deny it puts its money where its mouth is; and by that, I mean that the show delivers some really good action scenes when the show remembers that it\'s supposed to feature action scenes. The choreography, the CGI, the explosions and the backgrounds all look amazing, but unfortunately, the great aesthetic values of this show are not enough to save it from its painfully bad character writing and plot progression. This is a clear example of a story choosing style over substance. (7/10)SoundsThe OP and ED songs are good, but nothing too memorable. That said, credit should go to the singers for giving it their all. As for the vocal performances, I didn\'t even bother with the Japanese version, so I\'m just gonna address the English version.It\'s always a pleasure to hear the talents of Josh Grelle (Ichika), Monica Rial (Houki), Brittney Karbowski (Cecilia) and even Tiffany Grant (Laura). Even Luci Christian did a fine job with the dual roles of both Chifuyu and Madoka and you\'d have a hard time distinguishing them. Voicing the Sarashiki sisters are Jessica Calvello (Tatenashi) and Kira Vincent-Davis (Kanzashi) and I have to say they did a pretty good job with what they were given. Look, when I dislike a character, I don\'t hold it against the actor, I hold it against the writer because the actors are just reading lines from a script. The writer is the one in control of the story and it\'s not the actor\'s fault his/her character was conceptually bad or had bad development. (7/10)ConclusionInfinite Stratos 2 isn\'t bad, but rather, mediocre. Unfortunately, it\'s one of those cases where mediocrity is worse than outright badness. Why? It\'s simple, really. Badness inspires action, while mediocrity inspires comformity. If this was a bad show, the people behind it would move mountains to make season 3 as exciting and memorable as possible; but since this show is mediocre, the show settles into a comfortable formula and feels no need to change.At the end of the day, I see Infinite Stratos 2 as the embodiment of wasted potential: a show that could have been great but ended up being just tolerable. It wasn\'t offensively bad, but it left a lot to be desired, which makes me wonder: ""where do we go from here?"" It\'s 2021 and there haven\'t been any news about season 3. This is the saddest part of it all because Infinite Stratos, as a whole, isn\'t conceptually bad and has a lot of room for improvement and I\'m sure a lot of people want the story to continue, but from the looks of it, Infinite Stratos has been kept in some sort of holding pattern and we have no idea what will happen to it. Infinite Stratos isn\'t dead but it isn\'t alive either and in the end, only time will tell if this story even has a future at all.

I have seen people with mental disorders that are more aware of things than this character.  No one can be that stupid in regards to the opposite sex and also be completely useless in the development of the story than Ichika. So they have these suits of battel armor, that they treat as toys, there is no development on why we have them or what they are used for outside of playing around at school. So...he is the only male that can work one, but he is pathetic at it and sucks in battle.  Why does this genre always have to have stupid males that accomplish nothing and don't even know that they are the only piece of meat in the whole story line. he is the only male that can work one, but he is pathetic at it and sucks in battle.

The anime is a deluxe bundle for fan-service anime, truly a hidden treasure but of course it is also very poorly produced with many plot-holes and moments throughout the season leaving you dumbfounded and confused.Surprisingly, I enjoyed watching IS series because of the fan service content and not exactly for the plot or the quality of the anime itself. I think we all watch anime so we can...be obviously entertain and enjoy it and that\'s what exactly this anime has done for me in return.Story (6): I couldn\'t seem to enjoy enough as much as I trying to, multiple times the anime was filled with ecchi moments and mostly the male protagonist getting absolutely beaten up by the other female MCs. Most of it is useless garbage and generally fillers but I seemed to like it and probably you too as well.Art (7): The art in IS is nothing memorable or special, it was fairly decent and basic as well, it carried the story and characters together otherwise I would never even considered watching this anime.Sound (6): Some of the audio soundtracks are very nostalgic and as well as similar to a classic superhero ""saving the day"" or kids show, it is questionable at most but for the most part it was okay in building the mood.Characters (6): Like I said before, the characters in the anime are nothing really special and most of it throughout the anime are just pure ecchi and fan service all throughout.  Ichika is like any determined, heroic, and stupid MC\'s male protagonist you would find in some animes.Enjoyment (7): I did for the most part enjoyed watching Infinite Stratos purely just for the fan service because it was entertaining as well as the ecchi stuff.Overall (7): Overall IS is not unique or genuinely a good anime, it\'s simply just entertaining to watch as the male MC\'s get pulled apart by his own harem as well as mech fighting.

Ichika is like any determined, heroic, and stupid MC\'s male protagonist you would find in some animes.Enjoyment (7): I did for the most part enjoyed watching Infinite Stratos purely just for the fan service because it was entertaining as well as the ecchi stuff.Overall (7): Overall IS is not unique or genuinely a good anime, it\'s simply just entertaining to watch as the male MC\'s get pulled apart by his own harem as well as mech fighting. You should consider watching this!', ""infinite stratos which is second season of anime wasn't that good but still there one good character which is new character being introduced in second season who she is mainly best girls out of others in this throughout of this series that will help main handsome protagonist. The one of the worst moment where this one of Kanzashi  who she big fan of being otaku but one of ruining is that she slapped main handsome protagonist face it was kind of sucks and one of cringe moment I have seen where kanzashi think there is no hero which is one of main handsome protagionst...saved her alive there is one of dumb filler episodes focused on Charlotte losing her panties it was one of worst fanseverice ever but I wish that a villain that was introduced tries to kill tsundere teacher that it might happen in cliff-hanger of season 2 there is no unexplained reasons could be backstory or something? overall thought this second season it was just awful and cringe moment that I was binging on last year. saved her alive there is one of dumb filler episodes focused on Charlotte losing her panties it was one of worst fanseverice ever but I wish that a villain that was introduced tries to kill tsundere teacher that it might happen in cliff-hanger of season 2 there is no unexplained reasons could be backstory or something? overall thought this second season it was just awful and cringe moment that I was binging on last year."", ""This season is rather disappointing. To be specific, it disappoints in certain aspects but not everything.This story continues from season one but feels extremely dumbed down. The entire season feels like filler for season one, which isn't entirely a bad thing but also is. This season focuses on the harem aspect of this anime, with the occasional fight thrown in the mix from time to time. I'm a guy who enjoys the harem and ecchi genres, but there is always a time and place for everything, and this anime doesn't understand that. This anime was supposed to be serious than sexy, but this season just...reverses that. Things pick up near the end however but end up feeling like a setup for a third season.The characters remain the same as in the first season, but there is no development for these characters. The only ones who get actual developments are the ones who are introduced in this season, which is unfortunate. A bit disappointing, but that's just what this season is.The animation is of good quality. with some smooth and fluent animation here and there, but this unfortunately isn't enough to save this season. At least the ecchi scenes look good though.Overall, a very disappointing second season to what could have been. I did enjoy some parts of this season, mainly the harem ecchi parts (guilty as charged), but the entire season was a letdown.

Battle Athletess Daiundoukai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1185/Battle_Athletess_Daiundoukai,"[""Battle Athletes is an interesting little anime. Part &quot;let's see how extreme we can make track and field&quot; with dashes of comedy, drama, and some yuri subtext for good flavor. The result, while not entirely satisfying, is still worth the short watchConsidering this is the 90s, the animation is actually quite stunning and demonstrates anime's increasing ability at the time to push the limit and illustrate things that modern live-action could not accomplish. The lighting of the competition torch on the university satellite via unmanned rocket, for example, really just took me away. Though character movement is staticky, you really have to hand it to...the animators for delivering some great ideas for future sporting events.The sound I can't comment much on. It was there, it mixed well, but overall it was just plain. I won't rate it badly but it's nothing to talk any more about.The story is jagged, but involved. Each episode seems to focus on a different sporting event as a result of training for the big competition at the end, which takes up the last two episodes. Certain elements, such as Mylandah's extreme interpretation of competition, as well as Akari and Kris's growing friendship carry over, and the story isn't afraid to throw a twist out of nowhere either. However, because of the limited run, it really doesn't carry out as successfully as it could have. Instead it comes off as a summary, with sporting events in-between.The characters range from bland to incredible. The most incredible character, I thought, was Kris. She was well-developed and unique enough to stand out of the crowd. Unfortunately, she's really the only who stands out. There are other characters like Tanya and Lahrri, who run on one aspect of their personality the entire run. Other characters, like Mylandah and Anna, also run on one aspect, but are saved by that aspect of their personality's influence on the plot.Overall, I really enjoyed Battle Athletes. It's a good watch if you're looking for something that's involving enough that it doesn't put you to sleep but short enough that you only have to dedicate a day or two to watching. Though it's not the best, it is good.One last note; From what I've heard, to really enjoy this OVA, you need to watch it before you watch the TV series, Battle Athletes Victory, which I hear is much better. However if the OVA is just a taste of what the series has to offer, I can't wait to get into Victory.Adding up the totals, Battle Athletes comes out to an overall 7. The art and a good portion of the characters make it stand out enough that you can overlook the majority of its faults.

I think one of the things I struggled with the most was how our main characters rival - probably better labeled as a nemesis - got away with pulling stuff which would get her expelled or eliminated from competing instantly, yet the narrative let her slide in these regards despite the fact she should have been found out way before our main entered school. Her attitude stunk that much.The series was also preachy with an unnecessary religious vibe regarding sports, but the set up for the given situation - as interesting...as it was - was done poorly. I was also left thinking separate doesn't mean equal - the boy's school isn't mentioned until plot relevant and quickly leaves, yet I was left feeling as if this was content pandering to a male audience. Well, it it is shounen after all. I couldn't help but feel the work was a bit fanservacy.It's also worth noting there is LGBT content, yet I feel this was meant to pander towards the male audience rather than really have representation. Personally, I wished for a little more development regarding these elements.This said, character, art and sound were top notch, not to mention the fact I could follow through with the movements even if some of the things didn't make sense, like a certain student not getting punished despite the fact a computer system would be able to detect she was messing with such things. as it was - was done poorly.

Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu Happy Kiss!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37036/Binan_Koukou_Chikyuu_Bouei-bu_Happy_Kiss,"[""As a watcher of the original series, I initially had very high hopes for this spin-off. Seeing as the first two seasons and the special were very fun and creative, I was under the impression that this season would match, but I was disappointed in that aspect. However, stick around-- it doesn't mean it was entirely bad!Honestly, I'm surprised by the lack of reviews. The story is by no means bad. After all, it is a parody, and it does a pretty solid job on it's own, bordering on ridiculous and funny. It's nowhere near as good of a parody as LOVE was, but...it's not terrible. A lot of the plot elements are reused from the first series (which I didn't like too much myself) but it introduces some new elements that keep it from being totally boring.The art is beautiful as always-- honestly, it was better than it was in the first few seasons. It's a lot more colorful and prettier to look at, in my opinion. I wasn't a big fan of the skewed contrast during some of the transformation sequences (was that just me? the screen went half-darkish?). The 'magic' was also done very well and was just beautiful to look at. I really enjoyed that aspect.The OP was alright, but the closing was really fun. I didn't really care for the other in-show songs, especially the massive group number in the last episode. I was expecting something Vepper brothers level, but I didn't really get it.As for the characters, I felt like they were kinda cheap copies of our original boys from the first series. It was as if the main character traits and appearance traits were just set at random mix to make five 'new' characters. I still enjoyed them, but it lacked originality and made it predictable and boring at times.Like I elaborated on earlier, this show disappoints in a lot of aspects COMPARED TO THE FIRST SERIES. If it was viewed separately (though many references might not make sense) it is still a good watch. It was fun to watch and made me laugh, though not as much as the original.I would recommend this if you: liked the original series but are open to somewhat of a 'remix' of it, like parodies, like 'stupid' magical girl series, want something light-heartedI would NOT recommend this if you: really really liked the original series and don't like the idea of a 'ripoff', like serious anime, want a legitimate plotlineHave a great day everyone! it's not terrible.

Boys\' LoveFan), I  enjoyed watching it because of the ships and this hasmore fan service than the previous ones which is a good thingfor me of course.Second ,the music. The opening and ending theme is good. Iespecially liked the ""Are you happy?"" transformation song...because it is so catchy. I never skipped it even once. :)Third, the animation. It is greater than the first 2 seasons. It\'smore colorful and the art style is amazing. I like their costumesnow and for me it\'s less cringy than the 1st one.Fourth, the characters are still so likable cause they are havedifferent personalities and of course they are all bishounen sothat\'s a plus.Fifth. The story is fine for me since it\'s a parody anime, I didn\'texpect much. I just wished that they changed the plot a littlelike maybe they should\'ve added strong rivals?What I don\'t like about it is they always end up in the bath. I\'mthinking, don\'t they have any other thing to do? But besidesthat fact, I highly recommend others to watch it because it\'ssuper enjoyable to watch.

So ENJOY!!!', 'This review will be heavily referential to the original series of Binan (I\'ll call it \'LOVE!\' from here to differentiate it between this newer series), since it, you know, has the same name and is basically just the same story with a different cast and some new effects and designs. That original series, despite being some criminally obvious fan service pandering, is in my opinion absolutely fantastic, and not just because the cast directly caters to my tastes. I genuinely do think the writing was solid in every episode - it managed to comically deal with pertinent social issues in a mature but light...hearted way, and Yumoto\'s little monologues at the end of each are great. I would love to have watched it as a high school student, I think I would have gotten something out of it (beyond the fudanshi pandering, I mean). The surprising competency of its writing is probably why the original series was a bit of a surprise hit, and in turn that fanbase is probably why Happy Kiss! exists. The staff could have been content to just phone the entire show in, but the effort resulted in a rare combination of a show entirely catering to one specific demographic via excessive fan service while also being entertaining and well paced.Turns out you can\'t bottle lightning! While the 2nd series of the original LOVE! suffered from a marked dip in quality writing wise, to mend this hole in the hull the writers turned to even more fan service (and an over reliance on Yumoto, probably incontestably the star of that show - notice he\'s the only one with a cameo proper?) and a reliance on your attachment to the cast it worked With Happy Kiss that isn\'t possible, because this is a whole new cast!I think it\'s reasonable to focus heavily on the characters. As I mentioned in the introduction, this anime is just a retreated of LOVE!\'s story - not literally but enough that you won\'t be watching it for its plot. That being said, the new cast is...a mixed bag. I have to respect the writers for refusing to take the easy route and try to just remake Yumoto, but the boy to fill the colossal gap he leaves, Kyotaro...Well, I think he might have ignited a hatred for the \'constantly yawning, oh-so-sleepy\' archetype in me forever. I think I can see his intended role. His apathy and indifference is supposed to be cute, and perhaps he is meant to be a parody of some kind of zen master. But in practice, replacing the pure hearted and irresistible sincerity of Yumoto is an incredibly bored and indifferent guy who doesn\'t seem to care in the slightest for the people/monsters he is fighting with is very jarring. Maybe if his visual design appeals to you his mannerisms are less offputing - but I found myself at times pretty frustrated with the way he acted. It just did not seem in the spirit of the franchise I\'ve grown so attached to.On the other hand, Kyotaro\'s weakness as the male lead allows the rest of the cast to shine a bit more than they could in LOVE!. But...not really enough. Taishi and Ichiro\'s sparring seems more natural than Io and Ryuu\'s - mostly. Sometimes it feels as if they weren\'t sure whether the two were supposed to be shipped or at odds with one another. Further complicating this is Ichiro\'s relationship with Nanao, another character who I appreciate for his deviation from the standard (a weird, demure sadist who is also very kind, an interesting combination), and who is clearly intended to be bait for shipping with the infatuated Ichiro. But, as confused as these relationships are, they are at least that: relationships, The rest of the cast, it seems, do not have much of any! Kyotaro talks to to his incredibly bland, and I hate to say it, but completely pointless ginger friend Ryouma, and that\'s about it. I cannot remember a single time Ryouma spoke to anyone but Kyotaro - he may as well be his stand for all his relevancy to characters beyond Kyotaro. While not quite to the same degree as Yumoto, the incredibly cute and cheeky student council member Martha steals the show. It feels as if this was something the staff too were aware of - he is the only character, outside of Kyotaro and Ibusuki, whose rift forms a great deal of the plot, that gets any kind of episode devoted to his backstory, oddly.Other strokes of consciousness in the writing staff seem to be in the Wom-san replacement\'s writing - Karl, the cute yellow otter, is really great. He adds quite a bit of energy to the show, and were he written to be more lethargic or cynical I feel like I would hate this anime. His design (as a human) is also very cute - if a little pointless, given that it only exists in transformations and in very brief scenes. I also enjoy the novelty of his backstory - I feel it melds better than LOVE!\'s strange (albeit amusing) focus on aliens and the galaxy and television. It is just a shame that the writing was not brave enough to try and focus more on that setting, and instead chose to retread the same structure of season 1 (I am not exaggerating, it is ludicrously similar).Hyonyanaland, Karl\'s homeland, appears in the finale and its scenes are a highlight. It provides a welcome diversion in visuals and is greatly helped by some great music, an area I have as of yet neglected to mention, but one that I feel is a clear improvement over LOVE!. The transformation music is exciting and fun, but even better is the attack music - the poppier and more upbeat melody and style are well suited to the less earnest and sincere tone established. The ""attack"" sequence is only really hurt by Kyotaro\'s voice acting. While I think the seiyuu does a fine job regularly, here...well...It is quite laughable. The voice he uses is not suited to the bellowing. ""Rab is oba!!!"" it is not, that\'s for sure.Speaking of the transformations...They are fine. I like the kissing theme and the use of water (makes sense - Karl is an otter remember). Not so much the visual designs. While they are not terrible, the lack of deviation from the previous series is a bit disappointing, especially given that this isn\'t even supposed to be the \'battle lovers\' anymore - so why do they look so alike? What\'s more disappointing is the student council costumes, the Furanui knights, which - well they ARE terrible, especially when compared to the original student council costumes, which were fantastic and better even than the main cast\'s\'. That being said, visually Happy Kiss isn\'t a huge decline. There is still the eternal sidemouth which is a pet peeve, but it looks a little better than season 2 of LOVE! (although not quite as good as 1, in my opinion). It\'s a sugary sweet, colourful anime with a cast entirely made up of bishies: the visuals reflect it more than adequately.The impression given by this review is probably that I hated this anime, but that\'s absolutely not true. I am critical of it but I still watched the whole thing and had a fun time doing so. It is only because I so enjoyed the original that the flaws in it become jarring.

You don't have to watch the original to watch this one.Story- it's a parody at the end of the day, doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite funny. I personally really enjoy the backstories boueibu does for the characters as well, I think it gives its story some depthArt- It's fine not amazing but not bad at allSound- I enjoyed both the OP and ED, both are catchy. It's nice that the characters sing both as well.Character- At first glance, the characters seem...to be just different versions of the Love! characters; however, while watching they all come alive and seem to be quite different from their counter parts, in the main cast of the Earth Defense Club. I wouldn't really say any of the Defense club is even like their original series counterparts except for Kyoutarou with En. Though I definitely think Kyoutarou was more fleshed out and therefore different from En. The Student Council though is fairly similar to Love's. There are definitely differences but they could have been more fleshed out.Relationships- I think the relationships of this series were pretty different from Love's.Who the boys individually are crushing on and the pairings the show gives fodder for are definitely distinguishable from Love'sEnjoyment- Really liked it by the end! Was wary at first being a Love! fan but by the end I came to really appreciate this series' story and it's characters as their ownOverall- Gave it a 10 which would be a 9 but it's votes are so low! Just because there's fanservice doesn't mean it's not enjoyable to non-fujoshis or non-bishie fangirls.

Though I definitely think Kyoutarou was more fleshed out and therefore different from En. The Student Council though is fairly similar to Love's. There are definitely differences but they could have been more fleshed out.Relationships- I think the relationships of this series were pretty different from Love's.Who the boys individually are crushing on and the pairings the show gives fodder for are definitely distinguishable from Love'sEnjoyment- Really liked it by the end! Was wary at first being a Love! fan but by the end I came to really appreciate this series' story and it's characters as their ownOverall- Gave it a 10 which would be a 9 but it's votes are so low! Just because there's fanservice doesn't mean it's not enjoyable to non-fujoshis or non-bishie fangirls. (Speaking as a lesbian!)"", ""I liked and enjoyed this season of magical boys! It's the usual story but with a new cast and the mascots can transform. Hearing the random conversations and advices they gave was a delight. The art and design is sparkly. I'll admit I like it better than last season's, not too frilly.The songs are great, the seiyuus harmonize. The characters have their own ways of making me laugh, although some of them don't leave a big enough impact to be remembered. Again, I enjoyed this anime. Being past my teens and watching this, I didn't feel alienated. Expected magical boys and a catchy theme song...and got it. The fan service isn't as strong in this season, I didn't mind at all.I probably missed a lot of jokes in this anime but I know honyarara means that censorship circle in Japanese text, so yeah, Honyala land. xD and got it.

Boku no Chikyuu wo Mamotte: Kiniro no Toki Nagarete,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10036/Boku_no_Chikyuu_wo_Mamotte__Kiniro_no_Toki_Nagarete,"[""A set of image videos was exactly what this series needed, released in 2001 (long after the manga ended), this half hour special is a fanservice treat for all Boku no Chikyuu wo Mamotte fans. Made by the same studio.This episode has a simple structure: 8 parts, each one with a specific theme or central character, a nice atmospheric song that will make the viewer get into it. It is not a recap of the OVAs (we already have one), just some cool scenes mashed together to form a music video, the characters don't even talk. It's kinda incomprehensible if you didn't pay attention to...the OVA or if you didn't read the whole manga.To be frank, this special has a handful of good points:- Great music (typical of PSME, some new songs too)- Few scenes from the manga about Mokuren's past and Enju's past- The important scene from the manga happening on Tokyo TowerThe rest is like an AMVNo conclusive ending, no secrets revealed, anime only people won't understand the plot or Rin's overall plan. I guess it was made to sell its cool music and the producers added some extra scenes to catch the attention of the manga fans. What really captured me was the music, it is outstanding, even if you don't know anything about this show, watch it for the music, it can soothe an aching heart.All in all, it was enjoyable for me because I adore PSME music and the art style, I also read the manga and I am always down for some new material. the OVA or if you didn't read the whole manga.To be frank, this special has a handful of good points:- Great music (typical of PSME, some new songs too)- Few scenes from the manga about Mokuren's past and Enju's past- The important scene from the manga happening on Tokyo TowerThe rest is like an AMVNo conclusive ending, no secrets revealed, anime only people won't understand the plot or Rin's overall plan.

Some may initially see the show as some generic Saturday morning cartoon, which is understandable, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean you should automatically ignore the show itself.The story gets a 7,I\'ll start by saying that this show does not the most complex story in the world. Brave Beats is about...a small group group of kids (very small), who combine powers with dancing aliens to form a sentai-type group of dancing superheroes whose goals are to collect a bunch ofplot-important stones that give them additional dance moves and powers. I won\'t fault anybody for saying that this type of story is very generic in other shows of its genre, because frankly that\'s pretty much what the show is for the most part. After a good chunk of episodes (Around a third of the show,) the story does take a relatively more complex turn to degree, enough so that would convince most viewers that the show could potentially have been directed to a wider demographic than just kids.Each episode plays out as an ""Adventure-of-the-day-"" type format, where the characters encounter an issue within the first half of the episode, to which they usually resolve said issue by the end. If you\'re expecting romance or drama from this show you\'ll be disappointed to know that the show does not revolve around those two concepts, but rather the show has three or four episodes, excluding the ending episodes, dedicated to those types of situations.Art gets a 9 from me,This is essentially what makes or breaks the anime for most people. If you\'re expecting a detailed and intricate art-style to accompany this show, then this may or may not be the one for you, depending on your interpretation of the art. The show features a relatively simple art-style, however it isn\'t so simple that every character looks generally the same. Each character in the show is designed uniquely, down to the least apparent background character.Although the majority of the episodes\' feature average effort into art, the show shines its brightest when the characters in the show are dancing. During the dedicated dancing segments of the show, the show\'s artstyle switches from traditional 2D to 3D CG models dancing. Although some would consider the CG animation to be sub-par, I personally enjoyed the dance sequences shown through this artstyle.Sound gets a 7,Now this section is unfair, mainly due to the fact that I am comparing the soundtrack of this show to that of Bandai Namco\'s Previous ""Dancing Show"" \'Tribe Cool Crew.\' The soundtrack for Brave Beats is very limited, making use of a handful of original tracks; none of which I found to be quite memorable. That being said, the soundtrack that was present during the show did accompany the dancing themes well and, making the experience of watching a unique dancing 3D CG segment that much more enjoyable.The characters and character development in this show gets a 8 from me,The cast of the show isn\'t exactly generic, however it\'s not as though these characters haven\'t been the centre of another show\'s cast before. There isn\'t much to say about character development because the show doesn\'t focus on character development too much.

But the comedy of the story makes up for it. The special only works if one has finished both Code Geass series. The special right away shows that it is not a serious and intelligent story that the series is famous for, by having Lelouch break the fourth wall right away.  The story creatively blends the major characters of Code Geass with Alice in Wonderland and other stories. Much of the comedy is based on jokes on major plot elements of both series and making extreme of characteristics that...made the characters famous(or infamous). There is also some fanservice for heterosexual males. After nearly 30 minutes of comedy, as the story wraps up, a quick but hilarious twist ends the special on a grand note.The comedy is well thought out and very funny. With so much references to the plot, fans of Code Geass are rewarded with not only comedy. By using nearly all the major characters, in roles that fit their personalities, one can tell the writers care for their fans. The very last scene is heartwarming and funny, ending the special in a fulfilling manner. made the characters famous(or infamous). There is also some fanservice for heterosexual males.

Nunnally in Wonderland references many events from the series, so it\'s good to be familiar with them.Now, onto the review.The main premise of the special is that Lelouch tries to tell an interesting story to Nunnally, like he used to when he was younger. He envisions his sister in his own version of Wonderland, with most of the other characters from the original series make brief appearances. Crazy things ensue, and many people will find this...method of storytelling off-putting. After all, Nunnally in Wonderland is essentially Lelouch\'s (rather siscon) twisted fantasy. Everything that happens in his Wonderland parallels the ""real world"" of Code Geass in some way, and this special cleverly lampoons many elements of the series. Although many people found this to be insipid and devoid of the intelligence that was in the main series, I found the gags to be quite entertaining. It definitely lacks the drama and coherent plot lines of the original though, so if that\'s what you\'re looking for then you are sure to be disappointed.This special was clearly low-budget, as the artwork was mediocre at best and the animation was virtually non-existent. As this was meant to be more of a picture drama than an actual anime episode, the lack of art quality isn\'t much I can complain about. CLAMP\'s noodle-arm character design is still there, and overall the art was pretty consistent--as in a consistent level of bad.From what I know, all of the original voice actors from the series with roles in this special were able to reprise their respective roles. Thus, I have no complaints in the voice acting department. Lelouch sounds as he always does, and Norio Wakamoto, a fan favorite, really had a chance to ham it up in this. The king\'s booming, regal voice is always entertaining to hear, and his silly scenes in this special were no different. Much of the music from the original series was used here as well, though much of it featured that light-hearted school setting/student council tune. Overall, the sound was fine, though nothing special, unless you were a big fan of the original OST. If you\'re also a big fan of any of these seiyuu, then at least check this out for their roles.Surprisingly, despite all the crazy gags and antics in this special, the characters actually stayed...well...in-character. Though the situations were changed, Lelouch was still Lelouch, Suzaku was still Suzaku, etc. If you liked their original characterizations, then you should not be too disappointed by how they are portrayed in this. Though, if you\'re looking for any character development or major backstories, you won\'t find it here. In this special, the purpose of the characters was to create humorous situations, and in that it succeeded reasonably well.Overall, I personally enjoyed Nunnally in Wonderland. It might turn some viewers off because it lacks the drama, intelligence, and seriousness of the main series, but as a cheeky, ironic little piece of comedy that pokes fun at its parent series, it really is quite enjoyable to watch.

Man this was quite an interesting thirty minutes indeed!Soooo, first and foremost, if you haven\'t heard by now, this ""OVA"" is hardly that. It feels much more like a visual novel if anything. There\'s hardly any actual animation; the entire thing is mostly just a bunch of still images being shown in a slideshow. That doesn\'t automatically make it bad though. They actually gathered quite a few of the original voice actors to perform for this OVA, but not all of them. (I\'d like to note that I found it really funny whenever Nunnally came across a character who never says anything, probably...because the voice actor didn\'t want to have anything to do with this OVA). The production costs look so very poor, it makes me wonder just how little money they spent to make this. Especially later in the OVA one can tell as it shows one of the most hilarious fight scenes I\'ve ever seen.

Each...Code Geass character gets a different role in this Wonderland picture book, such as Humpty Dumpty, bunny, Cheshire cat or Mad Hatter and so on.Animation:10Despite  being mostly stills with minimal animation, the art looks great. The drawings look fluid and it feels just like a picture book or like a visual novel if you\'re familiar with the VN genre. The idea is original, and saves money for the production studio. Kudos to you Sunrise!Sound:10All our favorite voice actors from Code Geass return to breath life into the characters.The music feels just like from a fantasy movie, and fits to the Wonderland story and atmosphere in this OVA.Character:10Each one of the well developed characters of Code Geass come back and have some part in the story, and they fit perfectly to their new roles as Wonderland characters based on their personalities and roles in the main Code Geass seasons.Enjoyment:10Extremely enjoyable. The length of the OVA feels like 10 minutes and not 30 minutes, as it flies by really fast.Overall:10Overall, I recommend it to all Code Geass fans, new or old. If you can get by the fact that it\'s not really animated and mostly stills, you will be immersed by the fantastical fantasy story.Enjoy!_____________________________________________________________John Smith -Sunrise, what have you done?! This is clearly an evil attempt to milk the Code Geass wide array of fans with zero budget and no substance. I really hope the new Code Geass Akito OVA will have a better quality than this OVA, and the quality of this OVA is extremely poor.Story : 2Story? What story?Instead of the regular great Code Geass story we get a cheap spin off about Nunnally, the least most useful character in the show that all her role was being blind and being useless. Lelouch was obsessive with her because she was the only good close family he had. In this OVA he still shows deep concern for her, but in this spinoff, not only Nunally is useless, Lelouch becomes useless too! The main character with 20k user favorites, the most likable character on this site by the fans, useless!All he does is reading stupid picture books!What the hell.Animation:2Sunrise, you lazy motherfuckers!You thought this idea of minimal animation is fitting to the story? No! It\'s simply shows how lazy is this neckbeard fatass studio!Most of the time, the animation is composed of still pictures, and when there is actual animation, it lasts for 2 or 3 seconds.This is an anime for Christ sake, it should be animated to it\'s full, just like the main Code Geass anime seasons.Sound:2The music is extremely repetitive and the voice actors sound they had to suffer because of the shittyness of this OVA. Why waste good talents on this crap?!Character:2All the well written characters of Code Geass come back, and are given retarded roles of Wonderland characters. Why did sunrise thought of making this? I have no idea. Even if you ask a grade school student if making such an OVA is a good idea, he\'ll tell you: "" NO! DON\'T RUIN MY FUCKING SWEET CHILDHOOD HAPPINESS WITH BUTCHERING MY FAVORITE SHOW!""Enjoyment:2Enjoyment?!?!?! From this?!?! HAH! Not in a million years! If you think this is enjoyable, you should get your head checked for suffering from some kind of mental illness.Overall:2Avoid. Just watch the main amazing 2 Code Geass seasons, and forget about this OVA alltogether. Your time will be better spent watching Mars of Destruction. At least it has animation.

Kudos to you Sunrise!Sound:10All our favorite voice actors from Code Geass return to breath life into the characters.The music feels just like from a fantasy movie, and fits to the Wonderland story and atmosphere in this OVA.Character:10Each one of the well developed characters of Code Geass come back and have some part in the story, and they fit perfectly to their new roles as Wonderland characters based on their personalities and roles in the main Code Geass seasons.Enjoyment:10Extremely enjoyable. The length of the OVA feels like 10 minutes and not 30 minutes, as it flies by really fast.Overall:10Overall, I recommend it to all Code Geass fans, new or old. If you can get by the fact that it\'s not really animated and mostly stills, you will be immersed by the fantastical fantasy story.Enjoy!_____________________________________________________________John Smith -Sunrise, what have you done?! This is clearly an evil attempt to milk the Code Geass wide array of fans with zero budget and no substance. I really hope the new Code Geass Akito OVA will have a better quality than this OVA, and the quality of this OVA is extremely poor.Story : 2Story? What story?Instead of the regular great Code Geass story we get a cheap spin off about Nunnally, the least most useful character in the show that all her role was being blind and being useless. Lelouch was obsessive with her because she was the only good close family he had. In this OVA he still shows deep concern for her, but in this spinoff, not only Nunally is useless, Lelouch becomes useless too! The main character with 20k user favorites, the most likable character on this site by the fans, useless!All he does is reading stupid picture books!What the hell.Animation:2Sunrise, you lazy motherfuckers!You thought this idea of minimal animation is fitting to the story? No! It\'s simply shows how lazy is this neckbeard fatass studio!Most of the time, the animation is composed of still pictures, and when there is actual animation, it lasts for 2 or 3 seconds.This is an anime for Christ sake, it should be animated to it\'s full, just like the main Code Geass anime seasons.Sound:2The music is extremely repetitive and the voice actors sound they had to suffer because of the shittyness of this OVA. Why waste good talents on this crap?!Character:2All the well written characters of Code Geass come back, and are given retarded roles of Wonderland characters. Why did sunrise thought of making this? I have no idea. Even if you ask a grade school student if making such an OVA is a good idea, he\'ll tell you: "" NO! DON\'T RUIN MY FUCKING SWEET CHILDHOOD HAPPINESS WITH BUTCHERING MY FAVORITE SHOW!""Enjoyment:2Enjoyment?!?!?! From this?!?! HAH! Not in a million years! If you think this is enjoyable, you should get your head checked for suffering from some kind of mental illness.Overall:2Avoid. Just watch the main amazing 2 Code Geass seasons, and forget about this OVA alltogether. Your time will be better spent watching Mars of Destruction. At least it has animation.', ""First and foremost I will say that this is a picture animation so if you're looking for an animated OVA you are at the wrong place. That said this is a great episode for anyone who has enjoyed code geass R1 and R2. Now onto the specifics....Story- [8] The story is your typical take on Alice and wonderland, except with all the characters from code geass. It is nothing to deep and intricate but it does make for an amusing time.Art-  [4] The art is like all other Code Geass OVA's excluding a few short animated bits. In my opinion this does subtract from...the overall special. However I do recommend that you give it a chance. While I personally dislike the art style everything else is so good it makes up for the art.Sound- [7] Pretty much lighthearted music. The sounds fit the scenes well but there is nothing extraordinary.Characters- [9] This is definitely the best part of this special. It brings back all the Code Geass characters and plays on the most outrageous parts of their personality. Everyone is also in Alice and wonderland attire (which of course means lots of fan service). Ultimately it brought the characters back to life in my mind.Enjoyment- [9] This was probably the most I've laughed in my time watching Code Geass. It it lighthearted and refreshing while throwing in some seriously dry lines. All in all it was incredibly enjoyable.Overall- [8] This was a great special and it definitely worth watching for any code geass fan. The only thing that is preventing me from giving this a higher score is the picture art though. All in all this was a great reminder of all the Code Geass characters and was fun to think back to the series.

I loved the two seasons of Code Geass and I thought that I would love it. I have never been so disappointed with an anime/OVA.Although the story is a bit funny at some points (it has references to the TV series), is quite boring most of the time. There is no animation: 28 minutes of frames or drawings without even moving the lips when talking.I mark it with a 4 (despite the fact that it maybe deserves less) just because I like the characters and it reminded me of the anime, that...was one of the first ones I saw. was one of the first ones I saw.', ""As the title implies, just the classic of Alice in Wonderland, Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch - Nunnally in Wonderland took the basic idea and altered it to convey the jokes and the references of the parent series in a humorous way, full of fourth-wall breaking and circle jerking.In a summery quite day, under a tree, Lelouch and Nannually were bonding together as they usually do until she asked him to tell her a story, and so he delivered. The OVA drew a lot of specifics from Alice in Wonderland but really added a lot and made it its own parody with the wide character...cast.- Art (8/10):It was really good, mainly still images with a few containing basic animations, but the quality was just as consistent and felt of a higher class. The clothing especially was a greatly portrayed, although was a bit too sexually expressive, with a lot of subjective revealing clothes and over the top breast juggling, some people would appreciate that, but some others think it's just a distracting pointless jerk move.- Sound (7.5/10):It started at first with only Lelouch and Nanually exchanging conversations with having other characters remain silent until they all burst to talk.The good performance can be easily picked up, the soundtracks of the original series were reused here, and we all know those are some of the greatest.- Enjoyment: (7.5/10):It was better than I was ready for at least. Seeing a Code Geass parody on a classic is one of the things you'd never ask for but would still be glad to have experienced. I had some giggles, was really pleased to see the old characters, it really felt like it delivers on so much more.- Overall (7.6/10):For sure, one of the greatest OVAs out there, I avoided it so much until I set myself to watch it, and was slapped in the face for why I hadn't gotten into it any earlier. cast.- Art (8/10):It was really good, mainly still images with a few containing basic animations, but the quality was just as consistent and felt of a higher class.

I reviewed both series about Lelouch's rebellion and was generally pretty positive. This time we're looking at a special that was bundled with the home release, Nunnally in Wonderland. Which obviously has to do with Lewis Carroll's most famous work, Sylvie & Bruno.Story:The narrative is simple enough. Nunnally and Lelouch are sitting together when Nunnally mentions missing hearing him tell stories. So, Lelouch summons the cast of the anime to tell her a variation of Alice in Wonderland with her as the protagonist.Honestly, the biggest problem with the narrative is that it comes across...as very low effort. Take a famous, public domain story, abridge the hell out of it, put in some nods to your series and boom. It doesn't help that the story they're using is as over-used as Romeo and Juliet or A Christmas Carol. If they actually had used a lesser known Carroll story, it would have at least felt a bit more unique.For positives, its basically a passable version of the story. And it is hard to get too critical with something that's wholly bonus content. Not that that would stop me if they'd done a really bad job.Characters:What this special gives us in terms of characterisation is brief snippets of each character's personality. A lot of them only show up for around thirty seconds. Which means that their personalities don't really shine nor does it do anything particularly new with anyone. It relies on you already knowing what they're like. Which is a reasonable expectation given that it's bundled with the home release.Art:The art does generally look good. I'm not the biggest fan of the character designs. I still think they're overly thin and stretched but the backgrounds do look good and the Wonderland inspiration does shine through. My issue is that there's virtually no animation to speak of. Most of the special uses still images like it's trying to be a visual novel. This also has, quite possibly, the worst action sequence of all time when Suzaku fights Gino. I know we're not supposed to be taking this seriously but it's not even a funny sequence.Sound:You can't fault the actors. They deliver good performances. The music is nicely composed as well.Ho-yay:This special makes the odd decision of putting Cornelia & Euphemia in married roles. Out of all the possible people, you decided to present sisters as married? I know there's a portion of the fanbase that's into that, but it still seems odd.Areas of Improvement:Put more personality into it. I get that it's a bonus but you could have some effort.Actually animate it.Have fewer characters and longer scenes. I get that you wanted as many Code Geass characters as possible, but you really don't need them all.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, this just feels a bit pointless and lazy. If you really want to see the cast of this series in an abridged version of Wonderland, I guess this is for you. But I've honestly seen so many variations of this story done so much better. For bonus content, it's better than nothing but not very exciting. I'll give it a 5/10. as very low effort.

For those of you who have not watched Code Geass in a while, refresh your memory really quickly before watching this, that way you can get the most out of it. It uses a mixture of animation, pictures, almost like a visual novel. Do not be deterred by this off setting appearance. Every single character plays some animal from Alice and Wonderland, with Lelouch as its narrator. CC is the Cheshire cat, Kallen is the Hare, Suzaku is the White night. It is filled with comedy, and the animation makes it even funnier. Its...comedy is spectacular yet sophisticated. It makes fun of characters by over playing their personalities, even tragic stories become funny. Now for the summary.Lelouch and Nunally are enjoying a quiet day on a hill top and Nunally asks for a story. Now, I know it is obvious Lelouch has a major Siscon ( after all he pratically started WWIII for her) but this anime helps put into perspective how much when he immediately breaks the 4th wall. Lelouch uses his Geass to put all of the characters from the anime into his version of Alice in Wonderland, now called Nunally in Wonderland. It follows a similar plot to actual Alice and Wonderland as Nunally explores the world, meeting new people and trying to make it back home. Follow her through her comical adventure as she deals with every single character in hope of reaching home again. comedy is spectacular yet sophisticated.

It is very fun and overall pleasant experience.Nunnally is basically Alice here and various Code Geass characters fill the roles of various Wonderland denizens. I would not spoil who is who in this one, however all of them seem fit their roles rather well.Overall it is funny and creative story. Characters manage to both act very in character for themselves and be somewhat unpredictable at the same time. Even if you are familiar with Alice in Wonderland and other Lewis Carroll characters...this show will still manage to surprise you. You will keep guessing when this or that character will appear and who will it be.Overall I can recommend it as a simple relaxed break of pace story. this show will still manage to surprise you.

Clockwork Planet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32407/Clockwork_Planet,"['Anime is like a well-oiled machine.  When all of its parts work harmoniously together (i.e. the story, characters, aesthetics, and the like), you end up with a piece of work that functions well as a piece of entertainment that has a larger majority of its audience responding well to it.  But when there\'re sections that don\'t really work all that well, then you\'ve got a problem.Story: With the world dying to the point that it could no longer sustain life, a man known only as \'Y\' rebuilt it from gears and clockwork, thus creating the \'Clockwork Planet\' that the characters live in....(Don\'t ask me how he did it, the characters themselves don\'t even fucking know)  It is here where our dual protagonists come across many wrenches in this world of gears as they try and work out the kinks in the machine.Based entirely on only a few of the story\'s beginning arcs, Clockwork Planet is a typical arc-heavy story that relies on different problems arising for our protagonists to deal with, each creating a similar problem in a different way.  These outlandish scenarios act as a double-edged sword for the series as while the plots create a semi-engaging scenario for the audience and provide us a reason to continue watching, the actual logistics for each antagonist\'s reason for doing their evil deeds usually don\'t really make any sense whatsoever.  Especially with the last arc, a lot of the show\'s cogs fall apart because a lot of plot aspects don\'t fully mesh well with each other.It\'s also important to note that very often the show wastes time with less action-packed scenes and focuses more on comedic or slice-of-life moments that while do help provide a better aspect of life on the clockwork planet, don\'t really add much to the story.  Especially since most of the time they shove these parts in the middle of the action, so it creates a jarring shift in tone.All in all, Clockwork Planet was a series that had a rocky start, picked up a little bit in the middle, and then ended with the cogs falling apart again.  Mixed with plot holes (some of which can be ignored to an extent), unclear antagonist motivation, and a surprising amount of choppiness with the story, Clockwork Planet\'s story ends up being a clunky mess that has some good aspects, but ultimately falls apart because things don\'t mesh well enough to create good synchronization.Overview:+ Interesting world (Gotta give \'em for an interesting setting)-  Clunky pacing-  Jarring tone shifts-  Unclear antagonist motivationCharacters: Inversely, the characters of Clockwork Planet share a different opinion when compared to its story.  Sadly, if you\'re not a main character, than the show really doesn\'t care about you.First are the duality of protagonists, Naota Miura, the boy whose sexual preference is robot and Marie Bell Breguet, the short fused clocksmith gone rogue.  Obsessed with clocks and wanting to be a clocksmith, Naota represents the \'Natural Genius\', as his uncanny, natural ability to hear minute problems within the rhythm of gears and figure out the problem from that actually makes him quite interesting.  As a character, Naota is a boy who adores automata to the point that he makes one his waifu and gets very upset when they\'re mistreated.  Marie on the other hand is an experienced clocksmith representing the \'Learned Genius\' as comparatively, she knows how to fix stuff, but has to work to find the answer when her counterpart does the reverse.  Because of their contraries, the characters work well together as opposites, and the majority of the runtime is dedicated to their opposing ideas meshing together to fix the problem.  While they don\'t do well on their own, their teamwork brings up a good positive for the show since their bickering is actually really fun and interesting to watch.Then there\'s RyuZu, the one who follows.  As the main automaton of the series, RyuZu is a sharp-tongued robot gal who hates people but loves/respects Naota because he fixed what 200 years of clocksmiths couldn\'t repair.  Generally acting as a supplement to Naota\'s character, RyuZu acts as a bit of a gag due to how rude to everyone she is, thus creating some actually charming scenarios between the characters.  She mostly stays stagnant in terms of development like the rest of the cast, but the qualities involving her offensive nature make her very entertaining if nothing else.  Other automaton like AnchoR and Halter act a similar role in that they add more to the series to make the cast more colorful, but don\'t have much in the way of development and are really only necessary to the plot when needed.Aside from them, the supporting characters are shoddy examples of what not to do when creating a supporting cast.  The antagonists have very loose motivations that don\'t really make sense or amount to anything, and the supporting cast either have a very tiny role and/or don\'t really make much sense.Overview:+ Interesting (and entertaining) main characters+ Entertaining supplementary characters to the main duo-  Supporting cast doesn\'t really matter all that muchArt:  Produced by Xebec, Clockwork Planet\'s art leaves a lot to be desired.  The animation and art itself is standard fare, and the show uses actually really nice CGI in order to create the numerous amounts of gears, cogs, and machines that we see throughout the series.  Despite its background appearance, the character designs leave a lot to be desired.While the original art for clockwork planet does leave some things to be desired, the anime\'s adaptation of said art has a lot of inconsistencies with it.  Character proportions (like AnchoR\'s head compared to her body) look off, as the heads of the characters are stretched length-wise and create some really peculiar looking people.  On top of that, the show\'s inconsistencies with character design make it so that one shot doesn\'t look the same as another, thus creating weird shots altogether.Overview:+ Good use of CGI-  Inconsistent character designsSound: Appropriately (or lazily) named \'Clockwork Planet\', the show\'s OP made by Fripside is...quite samey to what the group makes.  A lot of their songs sound very similar, and this one is no different.  That isn\'t to say it\'s a bad thing, as the inclusion of windup noises and the overall tone of the song is still quite nice despite how similar it sounds to a multitude of their other tracks.The show\'s ED on the other hand (also appropriately named), ""Anti-clockwise"", is a louder, slightly more screechy song with dissonant piano chords and an all around messier structure comparatively to its OP counterpart.  It\'s not that pleasant to listen to, and is one of those things that\'s worth skipping not because it\'s forgettable, but because it does grate on the ears a little bit.Overview:+/- Tracks vary with your mileagePersonal Enjoyment: I was anticipating the release of Clockwork Planet for quite a while.  It was one of those show that I really wanted to watch and I had to wait for its release because it was stuck in development hell for a little while.  Unfortunately, the end result I wouldn\'t say is worth the wait, but despite that, I still enjoyed it regardless of the fact that I can just as easily chalk up a lot of the shows problems and ultimately say that it is indeed a \'bad adaptation\'.Did I enjoy this series?Critically, the show has many flaws.  Despite that, Clockwork Planet still managed to be a guilty pleasure of mine.  The bickering between the main cast really made the show enjoyable for me to the point that I really didn\'t care much for the story or any other aspect of the show.  Fripside\'s OP\'s always interest me, so I would be remised if I said that I didn\'t enjoy that too.  Sure it\'s not a great show, but a show doesn\'t have to be \'great\' in order for one to enjoy it.What didn\'t I like about this show?The last arc felt really weak.  Especially since it took about a third of the runtime, having a huge portion of the story stumble towards the end was a big letdown, especially since very few things at the moment clicked in place.Would I recommend this series?If you just really want to see some interesting characters talk to each other, than Clockwork Planet fits the bill.  Again, the show struggles with having a cohesive story and the visuals leave some things to be desired.  Despite that, its characters make the show good enough for those with low standards to still find something enjoyable to watch, so if anything, I\'d say this show is for those willing to devote some time to enjoy something that\'s kinda stupid, if anything.

Unfortunately, the end result I wouldn\'t say is worth the wait, but despite that, I still enjoyed it regardless of the fact that I can just as easily chalk up a lot of the shows problems and ultimately say that it is indeed a \'bad adaptation\'.Did I enjoy this series?Critically, the show has many flaws.  Despite that, Clockwork Planet still managed to be a guilty pleasure of mine.  The bickering between the main cast really made the show enjoyable for me to the point that I really didn\'t care much for the story or any other aspect of the show.  Fripside\'s OP\'s always interest me, so I would be remised if I said that I didn\'t enjoy that too.  Sure it\'s not a great show, but a show doesn\'t have to be \'great\' in order for one to enjoy it.What didn\'t I like about this show?The last arc felt really weak.  Especially since it took about a third of the runtime, having a huge portion of the story stumble towards the end was a big letdown, especially since very few things at the moment clicked in place.Would I recommend this series?If you just really want to see some interesting characters talk to each other, than Clockwork Planet fits the bill.  Again, the show struggles with having a cohesive story and the visuals leave some things to be desired.  Despite that, its characters make the show good enough for those with low standards to still find something enjoyable to watch, so if anything, I\'d say this show is for those willing to devote some time to enjoy something that\'s kinda stupid, if anything.', ""I will note that I am not the best at writing reviews, and that this is only my second or third time writing one. It may not be objective and fair, but these are my honest thoughts on this anime.I decide to give this a fair try, and I'll be watching it till the end, my friend suggested it to me and that is why I am continuing to watch it otherwise I would have dropped it the first episode. He claims it picks up but I have yet to see that.The story is one of the weakest aspect of this show, careful because I...might spoil a few things within the episodes I have already watched. The story goes as follow; random robot or android made of gears falls on some random kids home--the kid is noted to be unable to fix anything that has to do with gears, yet he can hear gears and is able to fix the android which hasn't been fixable in 200 years.That's just the first episode but no need to go further, over all it doesn't pick up and is unable to keep what tension there is by including poorly placed jokes to lighten things up.We move to the characters, the main character which I described in the second paragraph doesn't have any redeeming quality's other then liking gears and there is so much that could come from a series all about gears, but it doesn't seem like the gears are the main focus, just an after thought. Honestly the characters are non existent in their form in the anime, just generic personality you would expect. Naoto Miura is the happy go lucky one track mind pervert who loves his gears and won't do anything that doesn't involve gears. And Marie Bell Bregute is constantly looking to be the best that she can be and fix everything. There really is no personality here.Am I enjoying this series, no, I am watching because I'm expecting it to get better but I am not seeing that. So in conclusion it's not a series I would suggest but others seem to enjoy it, and if you enjoy it, good for you, it's just something I would have dropped long ago if not for my friend. I gave it a 4 and if it does pick up I am open to changing that number but for now, it remains. might spoil a few things within the episodes I have already watched.

Which is a shame as there is so much to like about the world, I liked the idea of the earth essentially being a clock work planet now.Problem is this is a example of a great idea hindered by poor villains and lack of feeling of gravitas.   I never understood the villians goals, or their reasons and what their final plan was supposed to do.   which made the final moments confusing.I would say watch a few episodes to...get the feel for the anime and the world, but if you watch more, be prepared to possibly feel unfullfilled. get the feel for the anime and the world, but if you watch more, be prepared to possibly feel unfullfilled."", 'Clockwork planet reviewBeautiful android girls saving the world from government corruption with the help of an eccentric ability user and a genius engineer.There are slight spoilers mainly in character analysis so please be aware as you read the reviewBased off the light novel of the same name Clockwork planet is an action based anime that has a pretty interesting premise in that it combines an action based anime with something that we usually see inside a sci fi anime which in this case are the automatons which is a type of advanced android that populate the world that this anime is set...in. Combine this with the unique setting that Clockwork planet is set in and you get clockwork planet. I always been a fan of sci fi and action anime but what I really like more is one that combines the excellent combat scenes that most action anime has with the futuristic settings that sci fi anime are renowned for. Clockwork planet combines the best elements of both into one and is one anime that’s been in my watch list ever since I saw the pv.Story and settingThe story for clockwork planet takes place in the future where the planet after a series of destructive wars has left it barren and close to destruction has been transformed into a new planet that is composed entirely of gears by a renowned but mysterious clocksmith called Y. The setting for this story is centered on a futuristic version of japan which like the planet has undergone a radical change in its environments and in society.The overall plot for the series is largely revolved around the theme for this series which is justice and the fighting of government corruption and follows the lives of a young teenage Boy called Nauto who possesses a unique talent that is seen by society as a threat and Mari a young teenage girl that also has a unique talent that allows her to excel in her duties as a meister which is an advanced engineer that is trained to repair the tech that is used in this futuristic world. Along the way they are assisted by Ryu zu and anchoR two advanced androids that were made in the early years of the transformation and are more advanced than any automaton that exists in the world. They are further assisted by a host of support characters that come from all walks in life. The overall plot of the series based off the concept of justice and pits Naoto, Mari and their allies against the corruption that has taken root in governments around Japan and can be described as a fight against social injustice.AnchoRAnchoR voiced by veteran seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi of girlish number and unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Nauto and Mari’s main allies in the series. An advanced Y series android and a sister to Ryu anchoR resembles a young girl both in terms of in terms of physical appearance and in terms of personality. Personality wise anchoR is a cute, kind and innocent girl that behaves very much like someone of that age group. As a result of being ordered to guard a powerful weapon deep underground however in the beginning of the series anchoR was bound to a strict set of rules that mandated the actions that she can take as part of her duties. These unfortunately had the effect of causing her a great deal of trauma as her duties meant that any intruders that she detects will be terminated by her. As a result, at this point anchoR hid her true personality behind a wall wishing with all her heart for someone to hear her voice and save her. later on, and after she meets Nauto and Mari properly anchoR is finally awakened from her nightmare and her personality reverts back to her true self. As a result of waking up and seeing Mari and Nauto anchoR has the impression that Mari and Nauto are her parents and as a result see’s them as her mother and father respectively an aspect that I found to be cute and suitable for her character. Though somewhat slow to trust due to her past traumatic experience once anchoR’s has fully trusted someone she can be surprisingly loyal to that person. Though still bounded by the contracts that she forms with her master she can on occasion disobey an order if it means it will help her master. As a Y series, android anchoR like Ryu is also a capable combatant and in her case, can transform into a combat automata that takes the form of a red colored assassin that is lethal in close combat. Despite being smaller than Ryu anchoR is surprisingly capable in combat and her fight scenes with Ryu in the series was really impressive.As a character, I felt that anchoR was pretty well designed and fitted well with the theme of justice and corruption in that she was forced to carry out her duties of protecting something terrible that was located underground on the orders of corrupt adults despite the fact that she was nothing but a child. Seeing anchoR wake up from her nightmare that was forced on to her by her creators and awaken her true personality was a joy to see. It was nice to see her discover new things in life that she likes something that her past life can never do and in the process learning how to be more human. I felt that Sayaka Senbongi really did a great job voicing the character of anchoR.MarieMarie voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Denpa Kyoushi and Food wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Naoto’s main allies in the series. A teenage girl that despite her young age is actually a member of the meister order which in this universe are engineers that are tasked with keeping the complicated gears that power this new world in working condition. As the youngest person to be inducted into that prestigious order Marie is a genius level mechanic and has an innate understanding of how gears work and how they can be repaired. Marie is also a bit of a free spirit and isn’t scared of any pressure and indeed when sufficiently motivated won’t let enemies stand in the way of her repairs. Personality wise as a result of her former position as the head of a large tech company Marie is a feisty and confidant person that because of her skills can be arrogant at times and be dismissive of other people.  Marie’s most prominent trait is no doubt her determination which comes from her pride both as a meister and as someone that worked so hard to learn all the required skills that she has. As a result, even when confronted with a problem that is impossible to fix or modify Marie when sufficiently motivated can become really determined to finish that task and will not let anything that gets in her way. Despite her confident nature Marie can become depressed and go into despair especially when confronted with situations that seem to be impossible to decipher even for someone of her skills. This is however where her bond with Nauto comes into play however.Marie’s relationship with Nauto is an interesting one and one that forms part of the overall plot for this series. Though their initial meeting was anything but friendly and more along the lines of mutual antagonization over the series their relationship starts to improve as they both learn about each other and overcome challenges together. In the beginning of the series Marie’s relationship with Nauto was rather icy that stems from both her pride as a meister that caused her to look down at Nauto who she felt didn’t deserve such an ability. However, as the series goes on this relationship soon turns to one of respect as she become impressed by how useful and ground-breaking his ability is though this is far from the only reason as she also appreciated that fact that Nauto can always come up with a plan of action that while always sounding crazy never less has a good chance of working. By the end of the series it’s apparent that between Nauto and Marie is a relationship that is built on trust and respect for each other’s respective skills.  Another aspect of the relationship that is unique to Marie’s relationship with Nauto is way that Nauto supports Marie. Despite her positive and determined nature even Marie will sometimes find herself in the throes of despair and in this state Nauto is one of the few that can help Marie get out of that state. Just as Marie can appeal to Nauto’s skills at listening to gears in order to cheer him up Nauto when trying to cheer up Marie often makes use of jabs at Marie’s vaunted determination and pride that she has that usually has the effect of making her angry but at the same time open her eyes to new ideas that she is able to deduce thanks to her intelligence.The character of Marie I felt was pretty well designed and served as a great contrast to the other main characters of Nauto, Ryu and anchoR. Seeing two people of differing backgrounds be able to put aside their differences and develop a respect for each other and work together was a concept that I particularly liked. I felt that Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job in voicing the character of Marie.VainneyHalter Vainney voiced by veteran voice actor Kenichirou Matsuda is one of the main characters of the series and one of Marie and Nauto’s main allies in the series. A combat automaton that takes the form of a mid-aged man Halter serves as Marie’s bodyguard and main adviser in the series. A loyal, calm and stoic person Halter has a long past with Marie as he’s been serving her family and protecting her since she was a child. As a result, the bond that exists between the two is exceptionally strong. Although a bodyguard by definition should have as their main task be concerned with the protection of their charge Halter also serves as an adviser and confidant to Marie and often provides sound advice to her that is especially useful when she’s lost or does not know how to proceed with her plans. Because of their long association the relationship that Marie has with Halter is pretty close that is exemplified by the fact that Marie often plays pranks on him. Despite this Marie’s trust in Halter is very strong and Halter in turn is very determined to protect Marie as well. Though skilled in combat as expected of a bodyguard Halter is also rational enough to realize when a situation has turned against them and when the time to retreat is at hand. As a result, Halter can often make snap decisions that are contrary to Marie’s wishes but serve to protect her.The character of Halter I felt was an interesting contrast to Marie that was different to what Nauto brought to the table in that he serves to tamper Marie’s brash nature which by my count almost cost Marie her life quite a few times in the series. Halter’s dry wit and sound advice was also a welcome addition to the cast and often had the effect of keeping tension between Marie and Nauto down a notch as the series progresses.NaotoNaoto voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yoshino Nanjo is one of the main characters of the series. A teenage boy and a high school student that in the beginning of the series lived in the Kyoto ward in Japan. A quiet but kind and caring person Nauto though not lacking in social skills can also be described as an otaku but not a normal one. In the case of Nauto the subject that Nauto is most interested in is in gears and machines and can as a result be described as a machine otaku. Though loving to fix and assemble machines in the beginning of the series Nauto had great trouble in fixing any. In the beginning of the series Nauto as a love for fixing machines actually aspires to become a clocksmith which would allow him to fix all kinds of machines that exist in this world of his. As a result, Nauto is somewhat jealous of those that have managed to attain that dream of his. Because of his kind and caring personality Nauto tries to treat everyone with respect and kindness but on some occasions, he can be overly brash sometimes. A prominent trait of Nauto’s personality that can be considered strange by people living in this world of his is that Nauto treats automatons with the same amount of respect and kindness that he treats regular humans with which often surprises the people that he meets along the way. Indeed, this was a surprise for even the automatons that he encounters along the way such as Ryu and anchoR. As one of the main characters of the series and one half of the Marie Nauto pair Nauto has an interesting ability in that as a result of having rather sensitive hearing Nauto is able to hear and locate any imperfections in a mechanical component and as such is able to help immensely in determining why a machine isn’t working as intended.As the series goes Nauto encounters a number of different characters that he’s able to establish friendships and bonds with the most significant ones being his relationship and bonds with RyuZu, anchoR and Marie.Nauto’s relationship with RyuZu serves as one of the main points of the series and I felt was a rather interesting one. In the beginning of the series Nauto encounters RyuZu in the most dramatic way possible and though the meeting was shocking to him was also what ultimately started his relationship with her. At first Nauto was a bit wary of Ryu as he had never seen an automaton that was as advanced as she was. But as a result of Nauto able to fix a problem within her that has compounded man men that were brighter than him Nauto was able to fix her and make her operational. Although In the beginning of the series Nauto was fascinated by Ryu as an automaton Nauto’s personality trait of treating automatons the same as he treats humans causes him to start to view Ryu as a human being as well and as the series progresses and they fight alongside one another countless times this causes develop a romantic interest in Ryu. Indeed, by the end of the series Nauto has indeed fallen in love with Ryu that culminates in a rather well put together scene where he presents a ring to her. However, Ryu zu is not the only special relationship that Nauto manages to establish as his relationship with anchoR was also another highlight of Nauto. An effect of Nauto’s relationship and close bonds that he forges with Ryu zu and anchoR is that he sees them as part of his family which has the effect of manifesting a sense of determination that causes Nauto to fight even harder to protect his family from harm. All in all, I felt that as a character Nauto was a pretty well-designed character whose main points was his kindness, honesty and his treatment of both automatons and humans equally and fairly that matched the theme of this anime pretty well. His relationship with Ryu zu was really sweet and their relationship was pretty well designed. I felt that Yoshino Nanjo actually did a great job in voicing the character of Nauto.Ryu zuRyu Zu voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and the main heroine of the series. Ryu like anchoR is a member of the Y series an advanced series of androids that was created by the legendary clocksmith Y and despite being an old series is far more advanced than the automatons that replaced it in the world. RyuZu takes the form of a young teenage girl that can be best described as breathtakingly elegant as she really is beautiful. Personality wise Ryu zu adapts two different personas that she makes use of depending on the situation that she’s in. Her normal persona is one that is polite and respectful to all but usually quiet and focused. This is countered by her other persona that can be condescending to others but in a funny way that seems that she’s only making these comments and actions just for the fun of it. Unlike anchoR however Ryu has great pride in both herself and her specs as a member of the Y series and as a result tends to have a low opinion of humanity that despite all these years of having her in their possession have not managed to find a way to fix her. This opinion of humans however is done in a way that’s funny and contrasts with her normal composed and respectful persona. In the anime Ryu is noted to have an interesting personality trait in that she seems to prefer her actions to be dramatic in nature. Whether this is due to her wanting to display her superiority over current automatons and humans is something that we can only wonder.Ryu zu’s relationship with Nauto forms an important part of the series main plot and is a relationship that I thought was cute and well designed. Ryu Zu and Nauto met in a rather dramatic fashion early on the series and their relationship as a result started slow. In the beginning of the series Ryu was wary of Nauto but at the same time curious about him as he despite being a mere human could repair him. After seeing Nauto’s bravery and the way that he treats automatons as well as his attempts to protect those that are dear to him Ryu zu’s opinion of Nauto improved to the point where she requested that Nauto take up the mantle of being her master much to his surprise. As the series progresses and Ryu Zu gets to know Nauto more and understand his personality as well as his ability Ryu starts to gradually fall for Nauto much to the surprise of not just herself but Nauto as well. Despite being an android, this fact was surprising to me and at first, I thought it was simply because she was loyal to Nauto but this was not so as she likes him on her own free will and not out of a sense of loyalty to him. A unique trait of Ryu that only manifests when she’s dealing with her master or with Marie is that despite her beautiful appearance Ryu actually has a sharp tongue though while sounding hurtful also does a great job of keeping Nauto and Mari on track with their tasks in the series. Despite being an android Ryu can be surprisingly human at times when she’s with Nauto as he treats her more like a fellow human than an automaton which in the beginning baffled her. These actions which are an important part of his relationship with her was interesting as it showed that Ryu can also have human emotions that she shouldn’t have such as likes, dislikes, embarrassment and of course jealously. The teasing out of emotions from Ryu by Nauto I felt was a central part of their relationship in that it allowed both to have a better understanding of each other and in the course of it establish a much better relationship. Seeing Ryu exhibit a sense of jealousy when Naoto is admiring other machines was both an interesting and funny thing to see.All in all, I felt that the character of Ryu zu was a pretty well-designed character that showed that while automatons were created by humans they too can have their own free will and emotions and that their relationship with humans can be one of trust rather than one based on control. I felt that Ai Kakuma really did an excellent job in voicing the character of Ryu.Arts and animationIn terms of art I felt that the character designs for the characters that were featured in this series was actually pretty good. The designs for the two Y series androids Ryu and anchoR I felt were pretty detailed and both despite looking really pretty and cute were also lethal in combat which I felt contrasted greatly with their looks. The clothing designs for Nauto and Marie I felt also did a good job in reflecting not just the time period but in the jobs that both did. The environmental design for the series is another thing that I liked and it was interesting seeing the future versions of Tokyo and Kyoto and see the subtle differences between the two. In terms of animation I felt that was pretty sharp and clear and each character whether they are main or support had a great deal of detail on them. The combat scenes for the series I felt were pretty good and were pretty well designed and executed with each fight being pretty unique. In particular the combat scenes that showed Ryu Zu and anchoR use their abilities in battle were pretty nicely detailed. The transformation scenes for both of the girls as well as the designs for their transformed self’s I felt was excellently done.MusicThe music for the series in general were pretty good but I felt that the opening theme was perhaps the one that stood out the most. The ending theme though good felt somewhat flat when compared to the strong opening theme. The scene music for the series was generally good.Voice actingVoice acting in this series I felt was one of the series strong points and was consistently strong throughout the series. Of the characters that were featured in this show the main cast I felt had the best in terms of voice acting ability with the seiyuu’s for Ryu zu and Marie and Nauto who are Ai Kakuma, Saori Oonishi and Yoshino Nanjo respectively deserving particular praise for their performances as I felt that they did a great job in portraying their respective characters and bring them to live. Of the support cast the voice actors for the main villain in this series and the one that voices the gender bender cyborg soldier also deserves some praise for their performances.Overall conclusionOverall, I felt that Clockwork planet was an interesting anime that among its strengths included an interesting premise, interesting characters, interesting story, strong voice acting and great combat scenes. This is however offset by the fact that the series did not really have what can be considered to be a strong villain role and indeed the one that can be considered to be that role only appeared much later in the series and as a result didn’t have time to make his presence felt. Despite that I do commend his effort in that although he had only a few episodes to establish himself he certainly did a good job in making himself a threat to not just the main cast but to the country as well.The premise of the show which emphasizes on justice and transparency as well as the beliefs in equality and trust between humans and automatons I felt was interesting and combined with the story was one of the main strengths of this show. In line with the theme of justice and transparency the main villains that are faced by the main characters were the government which while certainly serviceable as the villain could have been replaced by a better villain instead as their attempts to stop the cast while certainly over the top and destructive were more comical than dangerous. Despite this it was actually pretty satisfying in seeing the cast stop them and expose their crimes to the people though. On the other hand, the plans that the main cast hatch in their attempt to stop the government though was much better and far more creative in their plans than anything. Though the plans suggested as it is by Nauto always sound crazy and impossible seeing them actually work really tells you that unorthodox thinking can sometimes triumph over impossible odds especially if you have more brains than they do.The characters for the show whether they were main or support ones I felt were all well designed and had a clearly defined role in the narrative. The struggles that they all experienced and the way that they actually overcome them was I felt pretty well done with my favourite here being anchoR’s as her past trauma was as such that it was the trickiest to solve and overcome. Watching the main cast start to learn to trust each other and respect each other as they try to stop the government’s plans was certainly entertaining and seeing them eventually put aside their differences and work together as a team to deal with the common threat was worth it.The abilities that the two main characters have in this series I felt was pretty interesting and matched well with their personalities. With regards to character development for each of the characters I felt that they were done pretty well with each character becoming not just stronger but also improving upon their existing personalities. Although each of the characters are developed as the series progresses I feel that characters of Ryu and Nauto were developed more than the others especially with regards to Nauto’s bond with Ryu and her becoming more human as the series progresses. The romance between Nauto and Ryu while certainly strange I felt was interesting and also rather sweet because it felt natural as Ryu like a human fell in love because she saw Nauto’s true personality and came to admire it and the person behind it.  Though she may be icy on the surface beneath that is still someone that can still feel human emotion. In this I really liked seeing Ryu Zu act jealous when Nauto is with other girls as it shows how much has developed as a character. The combat scenes for the series Is another of the shows strong points and I felt that the combat scenes in this series was pretty well done. Seeing two Y series androids lay waste to an enemy force twice their number in a matter of seconds is immensely satisfying though that’s for sure. in. Combine this with the unique setting that Clockwork planet is set in and you get clockwork planet. I always been a fan of sci fi and action anime but what I really like more is one that combines the excellent combat scenes that most action anime has with the futuristic settings that sci fi anime are renowned for. Clockwork planet combines the best elements of both into one and is one anime that’s been in my watch list ever since I saw the pv.Story and settingThe story for clockwork planet takes place in the future where the planet after a series of destructive wars has left it barren and close to destruction has been transformed into a new planet that is composed entirely of gears by a renowned but mysterious clocksmith called Y.

Along the way they are assisted by Ryu zu and anchoR two advanced androids that were made in the early years of the transformation and are more advanced than any automaton that exists in the world. They are further assisted by a host of support characters that come from all walks in life. The overall plot of the series based off the concept of justice and pits Naoto, Mari and their allies against the corruption that has taken root in governments around Japan and can be described as a fight against social injustice.AnchoRAnchoR voiced by veteran seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi of girlish number and unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Nauto and Mari’s main allies in the series.

Seeing anchoR wake up from her nightmare that was forced on to her by her creators and awaken her true personality was a joy to see. It was nice to see her discover new things in life that she likes something that her past life can never do and in the process learning how to be more human. I felt that Sayaka Senbongi really did a great job voicing the character of anchoR.MarieMarie voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Denpa Kyoushi and Food wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Naoto’s main allies in the series. A teenage girl that despite her young age is actually a member of the meister order which in this universe are engineers that are tasked with keeping the complicated gears that power this new world in working condition. As the youngest person to be inducted into that prestigious order Marie is a genius level mechanic and has an innate understanding of how gears work and how they can be repaired. Marie is also a bit of a free spirit and isn’t scared of any pressure and indeed when sufficiently motivated won’t let enemies stand in the way of her repairs.

Despite her confident nature Marie can become depressed and go into despair especially when confronted with situations that seem to be impossible to decipher even for someone of her skills.

By the end of the series it’s apparent that between Nauto and Marie is a relationship that is built on trust and respect for each other’s respective skills.  Another aspect of the relationship that is unique to Marie’s relationship with Nauto is way that Nauto supports Marie. Despite her positive and determined nature even Marie will sometimes find herself in the throes of despair and in this state Nauto is one of the few that can help Marie get out of that state. Just as Marie can appeal to Nauto’s skills at listening to gears in order to cheer him up Nauto when trying to cheer up Marie often makes use of jabs at Marie’s vaunted determination and pride that she has that usually has the effect of making her angry but at the same time open her eyes to new ideas that she is able to deduce thanks to her intelligence.The character of Marie I felt was pretty well designed and served as a great contrast to the other main characters of Nauto, Ryu and anchoR. Seeing two people of differing backgrounds be able to put aside their differences and develop a respect for each other and work together was a concept that I particularly liked. I felt that Saori Oonishi really did an excellent job in voicing the character of Marie.VainneyHalter Vainney voiced by veteran voice actor Kenichirou Matsuda is one of the main characters of the series and one of Marie and Nauto’s main allies in the series. A combat automaton that takes the form of a mid-aged man Halter serves as Marie’s bodyguard and main adviser in the series. A loyal, calm and stoic person Halter has a long past with Marie as he’s been serving her family and protecting her since she was a child. As a result, the bond that exists between the two is exceptionally strong. Although a bodyguard by definition should have as their main task be concerned with the protection of their charge Halter also serves as an adviser and confidant to Marie and often provides sound advice to her that is especially useful when she’s lost or does not know how to proceed with her plans. Because of their long association the relationship that Marie has with Halter is pretty close that is exemplified by the fact that Marie often plays pranks on him. Despite this Marie’s trust in Halter is very strong and Halter in turn is very determined to protect Marie as well. Though skilled in combat as expected of a bodyguard Halter is also rational enough to realize when a situation has turned against them and when the time to retreat is at hand. As a result, Halter can often make snap decisions that are contrary to Marie’s wishes but serve to protect her.The character of Halter I felt was an interesting contrast to Marie that was different to what Nauto brought to the table in that he serves to tamper Marie’s brash nature which by my count almost cost Marie her life quite a few times in the series. Halter’s dry wit and sound advice was also a welcome addition to the cast and often had the effect of keeping tension between Marie and Nauto down a notch as the series progresses.NaotoNaoto voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yoshino Nanjo is one of the main characters of the series. A teenage boy and a high school student that in the beginning of the series lived in the Kyoto ward in Japan. A quiet but kind and caring person Nauto though not lacking in social skills can also be described as an otaku but not a normal one. In the case of Nauto the subject that Nauto is most interested in is in gears and machines and can as a result be described as a machine otaku. Though loving to fix and assemble machines in the beginning of the series Nauto had great trouble in fixing any. In the beginning of the series Nauto as a love for fixing machines actually aspires to become a clocksmith which would allow him to fix all kinds of machines that exist in this world of his. As a result, Nauto is somewhat jealous of those that have managed to attain that dream of his. Because of his kind and caring personality Nauto tries to treat everyone with respect and kindness but on some occasions, he can be overly brash sometimes. A prominent trait of Nauto’s personality that can be considered strange by people living in this world of his is that Nauto treats automatons with the same amount of respect and kindness that he treats regular humans with which often surprises the people that he meets along the way. Indeed, this was a surprise for even the automatons that he encounters along the way such as Ryu and anchoR. As one of the main characters of the series and one half of the Marie Nauto pair Nauto has an interesting ability in that as a result of having rather sensitive hearing Nauto is able to hear and locate any imperfections in a mechanical component and as such is able to help immensely in determining why a machine isn’t working as intended.As the series goes Nauto encounters a number of different characters that he’s able to establish friendships and bonds with the most significant ones being his relationship and bonds with RyuZu, anchoR and Marie.Nauto’s relationship with RyuZu serves as one of the main points of the series and I felt was a rather interesting one. In the beginning of the series Nauto encounters RyuZu in the most dramatic way possible and though the meeting was shocking to him was also what ultimately started his relationship with her. At first Nauto was a bit wary of Ryu as he had never seen an automaton that was as advanced as she was. But as a result of Nauto able to fix a problem within her that has compounded man men that were brighter than him Nauto was able to fix her and make her operational. Although In the beginning of the series Nauto was fascinated by Ryu as an automaton Nauto’s personality trait of treating automatons the same as he treats humans causes him to start to view Ryu as a human being as well and as the series progresses and they fight alongside one another countless times this causes develop a romantic interest in Ryu. Indeed, by the end of the series Nauto has indeed fallen in love with Ryu that culminates in a rather well put together scene where he presents a ring to her. However, Ryu zu is not the only special relationship that Nauto manages to establish as his relationship with anchoR was also another highlight of Nauto. An effect of Nauto’s relationship and close bonds that he forges with Ryu zu and anchoR is that he sees them as part of his family which has the effect of manifesting a sense of determination that causes Nauto to fight even harder to protect his family from harm. All in all, I felt that as a character Nauto was a pretty well-designed character whose main points was his kindness, honesty and his treatment of both automatons and humans equally and fairly that matched the theme of this anime pretty well. His relationship with Ryu zu was really sweet and their relationship was pretty well designed. I felt that Yoshino Nanjo actually did a great job in voicing the character of Nauto.Ryu zuRyu Zu voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and the main heroine of the series. Ryu like anchoR is a member of the Y series an advanced series of androids that was created by the legendary clocksmith Y and despite being an old series is far more advanced than the automatons that replaced it in the world. RyuZu takes the form of a young teenage girl that can be best described as breathtakingly elegant as she really is beautiful. Personality wise Ryu zu adapts two different personas that she makes use of depending on the situation that she’s in. Her normal persona is one that is polite and respectful to all but usually quiet and focused. This is countered by her other persona that can be condescending to others but in a funny way that seems that she’s only making these comments and actions just for the fun of it. Unlike anchoR however Ryu has great pride in both herself and her specs as a member of the Y series and as a result tends to have a low opinion of humanity that despite all these years of having her in their possession have not managed to find a way to fix her. This opinion of humans however is done in a way that’s funny and contrasts with her normal composed and respectful persona. In the anime Ryu is noted to have an interesting personality trait in that she seems to prefer her actions to be dramatic in nature. Whether this is due to her wanting to display her superiority over current automatons and humans is something that we can only wonder.Ryu zu’s relationship with Nauto forms an important part of the series main plot and is a relationship that I thought was cute and well designed. Ryu Zu and Nauto met in a rather dramatic fashion early on the series and their relationship as a result started slow. In the beginning of the series Ryu was wary of Nauto but at the same time curious about him as he despite being a mere human could repair him. After seeing Nauto’s bravery and the way that he treats automatons as well as his attempts to protect those that are dear to him Ryu zu’s opinion of Nauto improved to the point where she requested that Nauto take up the mantle of being her master much to his surprise. As the series progresses and Ryu Zu gets to know Nauto more and understand his personality as well as his ability Ryu starts to gradually fall for Nauto much to the surprise of not just herself but Nauto as well. Despite being an android, this fact was surprising to me and at first, I thought it was simply because she was loyal to Nauto but this was not so as she likes him on her own free will and not out of a sense of loyalty to him. A unique trait of Ryu that only manifests when she’s dealing with her master or with Marie is that despite her beautiful appearance Ryu actually has a sharp tongue though while sounding hurtful also does a great job of keeping Nauto and Mari on track with their tasks in the series. Despite being an android Ryu can be surprisingly human at times when she’s with Nauto as he treats her more like a fellow human than an automaton which in the beginning baffled her. These actions which are an important part of his relationship with her was interesting as it showed that Ryu can also have human emotions that she shouldn’t have such as likes, dislikes, embarrassment and of course jealously. The teasing out of emotions from Ryu by Nauto I felt was a central part of their relationship in that it allowed both to have a better understanding of each other and in the course of it establish a much better relationship. Seeing Ryu exhibit a sense of jealousy when Naoto is admiring other machines was both an interesting and funny thing to see.All in all, I felt that the character of Ryu zu was a pretty well-designed character that showed that while automatons were created by humans they too can have their own free will and emotions and that their relationship with humans can be one of trust rather than one based on control. I felt that Ai Kakuma really did an excellent job in voicing the character of Ryu.Arts and animationIn terms of art I felt that the character designs for the characters that were featured in this series was actually pretty good. The designs for the two Y series androids Ryu and anchoR I felt were pretty detailed and both despite looking really pretty and cute were also lethal in combat which I felt contrasted greatly with their looks. The clothing designs for Nauto and Marie I felt also did a good job in reflecting not just the time period but in the jobs that both did. The environmental design for the series is another thing that I liked and it was interesting seeing the future versions of Tokyo and Kyoto and see the subtle differences between the two. In terms of animation I felt that was pretty sharp and clear and each character whether they are main or support had a great deal of detail on them. The combat scenes for the series I felt were pretty good and were pretty well designed and executed with each fight being pretty unique. In particular the combat scenes that showed Ryu Zu and anchoR use their abilities in battle were pretty nicely detailed. The transformation scenes for both of the girls as well as the designs for their transformed self’s I felt was excellently done.MusicThe music for the series in general were pretty good but I felt that the opening theme was perhaps the one that stood out the most. The ending theme though good felt somewhat flat when compared to the strong opening theme. The scene music for the series was generally good.Voice actingVoice acting in this series I felt was one of the series strong points and was consistently strong throughout the series. Of the characters that were featured in this show the main cast I felt had the best in terms of voice acting ability with the seiyuu’s for Ryu zu and Marie and Nauto who are Ai Kakuma, Saori Oonishi and Yoshino Nanjo respectively deserving particular praise for their performances as I felt that they did a great job in portraying their respective characters and bring them to live. Of the support cast the voice actors for the main villain in this series and the one that voices the gender bender cyborg soldier also deserves some praise for their performances.Overall conclusionOverall, I felt that Clockwork planet was an interesting anime that among its strengths included an interesting premise, interesting characters, interesting story, strong voice acting and great combat scenes. This is however offset by the fact that the series did not really have what can be considered to be a strong villain role and indeed the one that can be considered to be that role only appeared much later in the series and as a result didn’t have time to make his presence felt. Despite that I do commend his effort in that although he had only a few episodes to establish himself he certainly did a good job in making himself a threat to not just the main cast but to the country as well.The premise of the show which emphasizes on justice and transparency as well as the beliefs in equality and trust between humans and automatons I felt was interesting and combined with the story was one of the main strengths of this show. In line with the theme of justice and transparency the main villains that are faced by the main characters were the government which while certainly serviceable as the villain could have been replaced by a better villain instead as their attempts to stop the cast while certainly over the top and destructive were more comical than dangerous. Despite this it was actually pretty satisfying in seeing the cast stop them and expose their crimes to the people though. On the other hand, the plans that the main cast hatch in their attempt to stop the government though was much better and far more creative in their plans than anything. Though the plans suggested as it is by Nauto always sound crazy and impossible seeing them actually work really tells you that unorthodox thinking can sometimes triumph over impossible odds especially if you have more brains than they do.The characters for the show whether they were main or support ones I felt were all well designed and had a clearly defined role in the narrative. The struggles that they all experienced and the way that they actually overcome them was I felt pretty well done with my favourite here being anchoR’s as her past trauma was as such that it was the trickiest to solve and overcome. Watching the main cast start to learn to trust each other and respect each other as they try to stop the government’s plans was certainly entertaining and seeing them eventually put aside their differences and work together as a team to deal with the common threat was worth it.The abilities that the two main characters have in this series I felt was pretty interesting and matched well with their personalities. With regards to character development for each of the characters I felt that they were done pretty well with each character becoming not just stronger but also improving upon their existing personalities. Although each of the characters are developed as the series progresses I feel that characters of Ryu and Nauto were developed more than the others especially with regards to Nauto’s bond with Ryu and her becoming more human as the series progresses. The romance between Nauto and Ryu while certainly strange I felt was interesting and also rather sweet because it felt natural as Ryu like a human fell in love because she saw Nauto’s true personality and came to admire it and the person behind it.  Though she may be icy on the surface beneath that is still someone that can still feel human emotion. In this I really liked seeing Ryu Zu act jealous when Nauto is with other girls as it shows how much has developed as a character. The combat scenes for the series Is another of the shows strong points and I felt that the combat scenes in this series was pretty well done. Seeing two Y series androids lay waste to an enemy force twice their number in a matter of seconds is immensely satisfying though that’s for sure.', ""Warning possible SpoilersWhen I found out that Clockwork Planet was created by the same person who made No Game No Life I was definitely interested with what it would offer me, although despite not being as good as NGNL Clockwork Planet was still alright.When Earth was destroyed it was rebuilt by some God or being and made entirely out of Gears, Our MC Naoto Miura has a special gift that is needed by people to help fix certain gears, luckily he has a ragtag group to help him on his journey.The story of Clockwork Planet is pretty confusing and I'll admit it was hard...to follow, but what I got from it is that gears are used for literally everything and that includes the cities people live in so if a gear goes wrong and can't be fixed then everyone is in big trouble so a group of special scientists are used to sort out these problems, but it runs much deeper than that as our group of characters discover which is more about the existence of the planet itself, It is a difficult story to take note of and even more difficult to make into words so I'd watch the show if you want a detailed or better detailed explanation because the story though interesting isn't the best part of this show.Honestly the characters are the most interesting part of it mainly because each of them seem so different that they work very well together and it brings out a surprising amount of comedy for a show that I wasn't expecting to make me laugh a good number of times.However there is definitely one thing I understood from the story is that the word impossible is used a lot as a story development device because there are a lot of times where things go wrong for our hero's and they break down quite a lot of times because they think the situation they are trying to solve is impossible when really it isn't because they haven't used every option available, some people might think this is a stupid way to drive the plot forward, but honestly I think this just made the characters better because it showed how determined they are to save everyone even though some characters might not look like their trying to do that.The characters like I said before are the most interesting aspect of the show and it had a nicely mixed bunch who seemed very different to each other.Naoto is the male MC and he was very mixed for me as a character because he is someone that is fascinated with clockwork and wants to fix things yet he can never actually fix anything though he has a special hearing ability that allows him to locate any faults in the gears mechanism which really helps out the others a lot of the time, his character goes through some pretty weird stages as he starts out like a weird, but selfish asshole only caring for himself or the automatons, but after the halfway point he does start to become a better character as he starts thinking more about the people than himself.RyuZU is the female MC and is an Automaton that was made at the same time the planet was made making her a 1000 years old, she doesn't really show her emotions though she is very loyal to Naoto even to the point of threatening people when they are thinking of harming Naoto and there is one thing she definitely is and that's comedic gold because RyuZU will always make a pretty savage joke against anyone and not even realise it making her a good source of comedy in the show although despite being the female MC she really didn't do a whole lot other than kicking ass and being a savage she actually doesn't do a lot to solve a situation especially during the second half.Marie Bell Berguet to me is the true female MC of the show because she is pretty much Naoto's total opposite yet equal at the same time because she is incredibly good at fixing things and kicking ass too, you really notice the more you watch the show because both of them have something that the other needs making them a really interesting duo, Marie is actually a princess and can be a pretty stubborn girl yet very determined which is one of her strong points and even though she does take her anger out on Naoto and RyuZU it's actually understandable since they keep picking on her, but seeing her and Naoto's relationship develop was actually interesting and I thought she was actually a well rounded and useful character.AnchoR is another Automaton who is RyuZU's sister although she doesn't do a whole lot since she joined the group pretty late there was enough time to see she was a pretty adorable character though conflicted too since she didn't enjoy being a weapon and was glad that Naoto and Marie were able to give her free will with her decisions which in turn she references them as Father and Mother which seemed pretty odd at first, but made much more sense later, she has a very strong will and will even go as far as sacrificing herself just so she can bid time for Naoto and the others to complete their tasks.Halter Vainney is Marie's cybernetic bodyguard and a pretty funny one too, despite looking like a serious guy which he is Halter does like to make funny jokes with Marie from time to time even in combat though he does have a strong protective nature for Marie since he has been her bodyguard and close friend since she was a little girl so Marie is special to Halter and is willing to follow any order to make sure she's safe.The artstyle looked very interesting since clock gears aren't usually something that gets a lot of concentration so seeing an entire world made out of it looked architecturally amazing even if it is CGI and it looked even more amazing how almost everything is made out of it even the automatons who had a good looking technical interior, the characters design's themselves was interesting too, but the fact that both Naoto and Marie are 16 just doesn't match the way they look then again this is something that has happened plenty of times.Surprisingly enough there is actually a good amount of comedy in this anime which was something I wasn't expecting and it was actually pretty funny comedy with some moments making me laugh for a good bit like when Marie got that secret message that was a bit sexual and then RyuZU made a joke out of it which was really funny, most of the time it's usually RyuZU or Marie that make the funniest moments and they are mostly unexpected.With a good amount of comedy this show can be very serious as there are lots of times as I said before where the characters hit a wall and then have a big breakdown  until they get picked back up again and honestly I felt really bad for our hero's because they actually get screwed over probably every episode or almost every episode and it made me feel sorry that they had this many setbacks to deal with.There was also a decent amount of action although not the best and it was pretty short sometimes it was still entertaining especially when RyuZU or AnchoR went into their Imaginary forms which looked pretty cool and was definitely destructive.Overall this is probably the most interesting spring anime so far (well that isn't AoT S2) and I did like the chemistry between the characters so I'd probably recommend this to anyone who is a fan of No Game No Life to see if they get the same interesting feeling. to follow, but what I got from it is that gears are used for literally everything and that includes the cities people live in so if a gear goes wrong and can't be fixed then everyone is in

airing yet, but I felt something needed to be said so people don't turn away from this masterpiece based on the ratings and negative reviews.First of all, the art is incredible! This clockwork world is simply beautiful. The characters are interesting and creative. I love that the lead doesn't struggle with the kind of self esteem issues that drag on character development in many shows. I don't know about you, but I watch anime to see something more than ordinary. Anime has the power...to richly develop exotic worlds in vibrant color in ways that mediums simply can't do right now. (not cost effectively anyway!). Clockwork Planet is a world unlike our own.This show does force the watcher to accept that the physics of this world (this universe is obviously not ours), differs from our own. The way these gears work looks like magic to me, and thus, this show is closer to the magic genre than to mech. But they say that any technology, sufficiently advanced, would look like magic to undeveloped peoples. If you cannot accept that in this world gears have power in a way in ours it does not, I can see how you would find the show too unbelievable. If you can watch an anime and judge it based on the ideas within it and it's ability to help you imagine a new reality far different than your own, you too will see this as a masterpiece. to richly develop exotic worlds in vibrant color in ways that mediums simply can't do right now.

Our little FrozenRoy quite enjoys steampunk and clockpunk stuff and so was interested in a show called Clockwork Planet, because it had a really interesting premise. That\'s how we get here.Clockwork Planet\'s premise is, indeed, pretty cool: The planet Earth was fucked up so hard that it looked like humanity was going to become extinct, long ago. A supergenius only known by Y proposed and performed a massive operation to replace...the planet, piece by piece in its entirity, with a world made out of clockwork, gears floating in space. And he managed to do it. A thousand years later, we live in a world of gears where clockwork machinery is an every day part of life, and main character Naoto Miura discovers RyuZU (yes, the caps are meant that way), a clockwork automaton made by Y.This is a fairly solid start, right? We\'ve got potential mystery of the past and present, if you like cute girls its got a robot, the other main character Marie is also presented as facing a crisis with one of the city\'s main gear towers, giving us some instant suspense. So, sounds like a good start for a series, right? How does it shape up?Haha, it is TERRIBLE. First off, the plot and backstory is all but irrelevent. Very little of the show couldn\'t have just been set in a somewhat future world and been almost the same. Marie\'s plot with the military is one of the most obvious and yet blundered plots I\'ve seen in a while: The ""villain"" is utterly incompetent both in terms of in character and how they are provided, for example, and the logic of it is quite absurd, I\'m trying not to spoil it but...look, its like if you tried to cover up killing someone by going out and bombing a police station. Yeah, great, people might not investigate that murder, now you\'re on the hook for something more! They later do try to do a single thing with the Y backstory, but its so poorly communicated that it ends up as very muddy and simply doesn\'t go anywhere, creating a villain with essentially zero motivation.That\'s another thing about this series that sucks. There\'s a few villains who are even named and all of them have either cardboard cutout or non-existant motivations, never get to fight and do not perform logical plot functions. Instead, 90% of enemies are nameless mooks who are supposed to be good fighters, but get mowed down by the dozens until they are little more than speed bumps on the path of the heroes. When the game makes it out like they are actually a threat, it doesn\'t feel tense or believable, because we\'ve seen these exact enemies get simply flattened previously, eliminating the suspension of disbelief.Characters in this series tend to end up with boring or inconsistant characterization. Naota has any potentially interesting gimmick in how much he is just a huge gear fan in this world, buuuut that mostly goes nowhere and he ends up being the generic main character surrounded by waifus. RyuZU has is oveprotective but it seems very selective when she is and otherwise is kind of just...there, it is hard to say she has a very defined personality, although that to an extent has a point due to her robotic origins. She does have one good quality, especially in a show full of not very likable characters: She\'s programmed to phrase her compliments in the most biting manner, resulting in her cutting down character\'s for their deserved stupidity repeatedly.I hold a particular dislike in my heart for Marie, though, whose character was terrible and incoherent throughout the entire piece. The show really doesn\'t know how to portray her. Sometimes she comes across as incredibly hot headed and arrogant, other times she is over the top depressed about her abilities. Most commonly, she seems to take whatever extreme that Naota isn\'t taking, in order for him to take the reasonable viewpoint and come out on top of her, which also makes stuff of the finale seem rather out of place in the series. Her super speed repairing powers seem quite random and are generally poorly animated, she generally was very badly done as a character, including a worse ""hidden identity"" than Clark Kent, which also ends up being thrown out in like 3 episodes anyway so WHAT WAS THE POINT. TELL ME YOUR SECRETS, SHOW.You also get Halter, who is...generic bodyguard basically. AnchoR I can\'t talk much about for some spoiler purposes, but she too is quite bad, and in particular has some icky stuff where the show really doesn\'t seem to want to know if it wants to take a romantic rival or daughter situation with her. The results are as squicky as you might imagine.AnchoR is a good anchoring, hehe, point to talk about the shows AWFUL art and sound design and direction. The art is the far worse of the two: AnchoR\'s hair frequently looks like toothpaste on top of her head and character\'s outfits are frequenrly drawn in an odd and improper manner, making it look almost more like a paper doll with clothing that is a part of them and shifts awkwardly. Expressions do not always properly follow moods, often if animation is repeateded, such as Marie looking confidently annoyed at Naota in a scene where she is clearly in great distress. Animation of characters often is flimsy during talking or still shots, making characters look uncomfortable and blob-like, with machinery having uninspired designs and backgrounds being sparsely detailed. AnchoR frequently gets it the worst due to her dress and hair, making her stand out as being unrealistically poor in the crowd.Sound design is similiarly poor, with uninspired voice acting with the exception of Halter who has a kinda cool older guy edge to him, entirely forgettable and drab in-story soundtracking and lacking sound effects for various things, although it often more skirts to forgettable than horrible in comparison to the art. I gave it a 2 simply because the OP is decent enough, especially with the clock effects in the background, and because of a handful of good mechanical noises in the finale, putting it above the true dredges of the world in that regard.So, ultimately, the thought of this show should be rather obvious: It is dreadful. The plot is poorly paced, with filler slapped in at random and utterly drama breaking comedic moments hampering a script full of obvious stupidity and little tension. The art is some of the worst I\'ve seen in a while, unless you are a huge fan of Colgate making some hot new anime. The sound design is poor and uninspired and the characters have difficult defining their personalities or otherwise are extremely inconsistant and poorly done. Battles are extremely disappointing, with action scenes largely consisting of stomps or boring fights against mooks, with no true villain fights even, eating up runtime as little more than filler. If you consider yourself a connoisseur of bad anime, then give Clockwork Planet a look, as it has plenty of material to mock with your friends. But if you want a quality anime, avoid Clockwork Planet in its entirity: You miss nothing but terrible spins on pre-existing concepts and an infuriating inability to do anything with its core concept. the planet, piece by piece in its entirity, with a world made out of clockwork, gears floating in space. And he managed to do it. A thousand years later, we live in a world of gears where clockwork machinery is an every day part of life, and main character Naoto Miura discovers RyuZU (yes, the caps are meant that way), a clockwork automaton made by Y.This is a fairly solid start, right? We\'ve got potential mystery of the past and present, if you like cute girls its got a robot, the other main character Marie is also presented as facing a crisis with one of the city\'s main gear towers, giving us some instant suspense. So, sounds like a good start for a series, right? How does it shape up?Haha, it is TERRIBLE. First off, the plot and backstory is all but irrelevent. Very little of the show couldn\'t have just been set in a somewhat future world and been almost the same. Marie\'s plot with the military is one of the most obvious and yet blundered plots I\'ve seen in a while: The ""villain"" is utterly incompetent both in terms of in character and how they are provided, for example, and the logic of it is quite absurd, I\'m trying not to spoil it but...look, its like if you tried to cover up killing someone by going out and bombing a police station. Yeah, great, people might not investigate that murder, now you\'re on the hook for something more! They later do try to do a single thing with the Y backstory, but its so poorly communicated that it ends up as very muddy and simply doesn\'t go anywhere, creating a villain with essentially zero motivation.That\'s another thing about this series that sucks. There\'s a few villains who are even named and all of them have either cardboard cutout or non-existant motivations, never get to fight and do not perform logical plot functions. Instead, 90% of enemies are nameless mooks who are supposed to be good fighters, but get mowed down by the dozens until they are little more than speed bumps on the path of the heroes. When the game makes it out like they are actually a threat, it doesn\'t feel tense or believable, because we\'ve seen these exact enemies get simply flattened previously, eliminating the suspension of disbelief.Characters in this series tend to end up with boring or inconsistant characterization. Naota has any potentially interesting gimmick in how much he is just a huge gear fan in this world, buuuut that mostly goes nowhere and he ends up being the generic main character surrounded by waifus. RyuZU has is oveprotective but it seems very selective when she is and otherwise is kind of just...there, it is hard to say she has a very defined personality, although that to an extent has a point due to her robotic origins. She does have one good quality, especially in a show full of not very likable characters: She\'s programmed to phrase her compliments in the most biting manner, resulting in her cutting down character\'s for their deserved stupidity repeatedly.I hold a particular dislike in my heart for Marie, though, whose character was terrible and incoherent throughout the entire piece. The show really doesn\'t know how to portray her. Sometimes she comes across as incredibly hot headed and arrogant, other times she is over the top depressed about her abilities. Most commonly, she seems to take whatever extreme that Naota isn\'t taking, in order for him to take the reasonable viewpoint and come out on top of her, which also makes stuff of the finale seem rather out of place in the series. Her super speed repairing powers seem quite random and are generally poorly animated, she generally was very badly done as a character, including a worse ""hidden identity"" than Clark Kent, which also ends up being thrown out in like 3 episodes anyway so WHAT WAS THE POINT.

Earth is destroyed and a genius name Y recreate it with gears, the story may look like interesting but trust me, it's not. The first few episodes looks pretty interesting but i don't understand why they put fan service stuff in this anime. Well it's not like hardcore but it's very lame. You don't even laugh for the jokes, it's that bad. The story gets worst every new episodes come's out. I have dropped this anime at episode 8.Story - Horrible story, suddenly a female powerful robot falls from the sky and he considers it has his wife and after few...episode they fight his female robot sister and win and calls it has his daughter. To accompany this three, there is one more small girl and she has one more man has a body guard. He will be pretty much hugging this female character and other will be like, have u abandoned me !!! With all this they fight bad people.... If you are into this kind of stuff, go for it. To people who wants enjoy, learn, laugh please stop reading this review and go search for an other anime because trust me, it's not worth watching. episode they fight his female robot sister and win and calls it has his daughter.

His skill is certainly useful in this world where everything is made out of gears since he can spot problems really quickly.One day, a girl automaton - human-looking androids that are wholly made of gears - falls from the sky. She has one gear malfunction, which Naoto quickly repairs. She is revealed to be RyuZU, over 1000 years old, and was built by Y himself. Thus starts the story of a genius boy and his legendary automaton, along with another genius girl, Marie Breguet, youngest Meister in history, and her butler.As you can see, there\'s lots of geniuses in this story, which is a trademark of Kamiya\'s work. If you read the light novel, you also know that the playful tone gently complements the dense details very well. The story is paced a bit weird, but paced enjoyably, so it gets very good; it doesn\'t matter what technique they used as long as the consumer enjoys.This anime makes quite a good use of the medium; it is stunning to see a world entirely made out of clockwork. The style is also what I expected: I really liked Naoto and AnchoR\'s designs. However, I would have liked to see a bit more details and shadows here and there. It feels like the budget was lacking a little, after spending it all on animating the countess gears. The endings and openings are much better animated than the anime. If the whole anime was animated like that, I would comfortably give a ten. Therefore, I also notched it down to a 9, because the quality was inconsistent. Although the gears are absolutely stunning and beautiful, some scenes are literally a character standing there while the background pans from left to right. I believe Kamiya-sensei\'s work deserves more budget than this.As for the sound, I find it quite pleasant to listen to. The OP and ED aren\'t particularly good, but neither are they particularly bad. They sound quite generic, but the animation is something absolutely amazing to watch. The music paced well with the actions of the characters, and it flowed melodiously and didn\'t feel weird. It deserves an 8 because it isn\'t particularly touching either.The characters are getting a solid 9, almost touching 10. Naoto\'s baby-like idiot behavior is something that not many anime exploit, and RyuZU\'s arrogant but loving servant attitude is pretty unique too. Breguet and AnchoR are both quite memorable; you won\'t mistake them for anyone else in the ""Waifu or Laifu"" game. There is quite a good character development, but still somehow lacking compared to most romantic, character-centered animes. It still gets 9 because this anime is more story and action-centered, and we have to compensate for that too.Enjoyment gets full marks: any anime that\'s interesting enough to make me stay up the whole night watching (me, who isn\'t a binge watcher and got tests coming) are deserving of full marks. The fanservice isn\'t appreciated by me (not a fan) but I didn\'t feel particularly uncomfortable rewatching it at school. Some moments even made me laugh. The rewatch rating is also very high; would rewatch anytime. Enjoyment is up there with Rewrite, Working!! and Lucky Star.Overall, it gets a 9. It would have been a 10 if only the art was a bit better. It\'s a really thin line, but it\'s probably in the 9.5 range, since I did see the amazing OP and ED, meaning the studio did have the skill to animate this properly.Reccomend: Chobits, for an enjoyable trip to a cozy home in future Japan It is the story of a genius boy (Naoto) that can hear every detail inside a world made entirely out of clockwork by a man named Y 1000 years ago: Clockwork Planet.

Everything about it has been lacklustre in my opinion and I have to say, I've been watching this anime ever since it's been released in hopes but I'm still unsatisfied even up to episode 8 - they still jump around the plot, drag things on and cut out important bits.It's a kind of anime that you HAVE to watch before reading the light novel or manga, or better yet, just don't watch this and read the manga/LN.If I hadn't read the manga or the LN, then perhaps I would've...rated this whole show a solid 4-5.All I can say is that I'm just left really disliking this anime, after all, I have been waiting for this anime to be released since I quite liked the manga.Story: 4The story's decent. It definitely has some interesting premises such as a world made of gears, this mysterious god-like person called 'Y', the meaning behind the Initial-Y series, and I'm honestly curious as to where Naoto's parents are – which, really, aren’t new brought to the table. Honestly, that's the only thing that's interesting me.However, the story is not set out quite well (I have to admit it's the same in the LN or the manga) with the animators either rushing or dragging the whole plot and cutting out some important bits from the original sources that sometimes I feel like the story is going nowhere. And to be fair, it is an anime so it requires more effort but still; I think they could handle the story a little better.Additionally, the story's quite predictable turning what could’ve been something interesting as just… something ordinary and decent. There’s some good humour but too much fanservice that honestly doesn’t add to the plot.Compared to the first few episodes though, it became marginally better by episode 8, a solid 4.5/10. Not much improvement but eh.Art: 4Now the art - I expected so much of the art since I really like Kuro’s and Shino’s art, and not to mention the promotional poster by Shino makes it look amazing, but the art is… average. Honestly, I really, really don’t like how Naoto’s been drawn and sometimes, the anatomy of the characters turn very strange like their eyes are too far apart or inhuman actions.But, like I said; the art’s average, good but not spectacular. Not all of them look the same and they draw action scenes quite well (I suppose) and I really like the drawing of the buildings, the gears, the weapon animations and fighting sequences and the world. The lighting effects are quite… exaggerated but you can see that the animators are quite talented.I was also rather confused by the opening with the roses and them dramatic poses.Sound: 6I guess the sound is better. I like the songs, they’re fairly good for the soundtrack across the episodes, though I kind of don’t pay much attention to them since I get mildly distracted from the interactions of the characters, it’s fitting to the mood of each scene it plays at – it’s an aspect that I appreciate in this anime.I really like the fight scene music, too, since they make them sound cooler and the sound effects are very, very fitting.Of course, as a Soraru and Mafumafu fan, the ending song is AMAZING. I love their voices so much and the beat is just, woah. Seriously, the instrumentals along with their vocals are so pleasant to the ears! It’s an ending that I always stay to listen to.The cast was also alright though I find Naoto's voice a bit annoying, but still quite good voice acting.Character: 2To be blunt, the characters sucks in this anime. They are all so bland and just… typical…So, worst character first, must be Naoto. The genius guy who doesn’t seem like a genius, doesn’t even know it and ends up being too rash and always making stupid choices. Not to mention he is absolutely loud and obsessive, AND perverted. His character design is okay and would’ve been better if he was more to the quite side. His only redeeming feature is he’s not the kind to give up, but even then, that feature annoys me. Honestly, I find his character irritating and I really don’t find his relationship to RyuZu all that appealing – it seemed more like nerd-guy-who-can’t-get-a-girl-actually-gets-a-beautiful-girl trope and frankly, the fanservice only served to make me hate Naoto even more – and mostly in this anime.Second worst character – which a LOT of people will hate me for – is RyuZU in my opinion. She’s the typical goudere, one who wants to please her lover and speaks harshly because people apparently find them appealing – not really. Her character irks me when she frankly puts Marie as her target of insults and the like, and her relationship with Naoto is just too much fanservice for me.Marie has to be the better character compared to these two despite being the whiny brat character – she’s more real, and more to the we-need-to-plan-first person, kind of like a foil to Naoto – in a way, she’s more human than Naoto. While Naoto is irritating in the way that I can’t care for him because he doesn’t care about the millions of people dying over his waifu who can be fixed unlike humans, Marie cares and she’s self-conscious about herself to the point she wants to be the best and actually concerns more about the people rather than some automaton waifu, though she is still quite unlikeable since she’s the typical tsundere princess genius trope.Halter and AnchoR are best characters just because they aren’t as annoying as Naoto and Halter reminds me of a Dad and AnchoR is just so cute.I also feel like they missed a lot of characterisation that was included in the manga/light novel.Enjoyment: 4If I hadn’t read the LN or the manga, I would have given this show a good 5/10 for enjoyment, because while I rather watched only to be disappointed, it is rather enjoyable and quite laid-back. The sound is pleasant to the ears, the animation is rather nice to look at if you can get past the annoying characters and there are some characters that you can enjoy.Overall: 3It’s a good 3/10 because the recent episode is fairly okay. It just cuts out too much important information but drags on unneeded ones, the characters are just annoying and very dull as a show with a rather interesting premise.If you want to enjoy this anime, I highly recommend that you watch this either without reading the LN or manga, read it after or just don’t watch it and read the manga (the manga has fewer fanservice scenes than both LN or anime).I'll see if the future episodes will change any of my scores in the future *crosses fingers, hoping it would* rated this whole show a solid 4-5.All I can say is that I'm just left really disliking this anime, after all, I have been waiting for this anime to be released since I quite liked the manga.Story: 4The story's decent.

The only way i see it getting so many bad reviews is that all the people that actually bother to write these things are closed minded idiots that cant embrace the different perspectives that some anime series try to recreate like this one.Clockwork planet's plot is by all means short and very open to a second season if they can bring back the same or improved interest (hooks) as the first season.With its stupid...comedy sections thrown into random scenarios the series keeps you focused on not just the action packed fights but also at what the characters are saying.If we look into the characters a bit, we will notice that they are plainly common personalities, seen time and time again in lots of anime, manga and light novel series. But when we tae this into account along with the random idea of a world like a clock, you will realise that it makes sense to keep the simplicities in the series or it becomes too difficult for people to connect and enjoy the series.Now there are a few issues with the plot of this series, like how the problem each time ends up being too similar and the solution is almost always the same as well. Also there's the cliché that the main characters just happen to be the only people capable of fixing the problem even though the world of clockwork planet s one with many abnormalities, or you could say, dark places with who knows what lurking.So overall I personally think this series is possibly up there with one of the greatest in the last decade, and I would bet that lots of you will have similar but not so extreme opinions on this series.Nick Shadows(waiting for season 2) comedy sections thrown into random scenarios the series keeps you focused on not just the action packed fights but also at what the characters are saying.If we look into the characters a bit, we will notice that they are plainly common personalities, seen time and time again in lots of anime, manga and light novel series.

Clockwork Planet was pretty much all downhill from there.I recall noticing a comment on some website or other noting that this was the ultimate chuunibyou show, and I\'d say that\'s about right. Clockwork Planet plays out as an endless variation on weird anime-centric fetishes instead of something resembling a real story. I was initially attracted to the show because I thought it might involve some kind of steampunk aesthetic, but I was quickly disabused of that potentiality. Instead, you have...a ludicrous notion that the entirety of planet Earth was reconstructed with gears, cogs, and endless other mechanisms. Evidently this world also includes artificial intelligences that are also made entirely of clockwork parts.Now, this is not necessarily a bad premise for a series, but Clockwork Planet makes absolutely no effort to explain, justify, or even marginally expand on this initial concept. Instead, you get a lot of incredibly dull bickering between the two protagonists, and even more ridiculous interactions between them and a few clockwork-based humanoid creatures. It\'s barely worth expanding on this aspect of the show, but the male protagonist spends a ton of screen-time obsessing over two female clockwork entities to the point that it really becomes creepy. Obviously this is the intent, and it\'s acknowledged quite a few times during the 12-episode run. But why? Who cares? Not me, at any rate.I didn\'t care because, for all of its action scenes and supposedly intense narrative drive, Clockwork Planet had nowhere to go. The characters don\'t really develop, and really it\'s pretty generous to even call them characters at all. You\'re essentially given a set of archetypes and asked to care about their actions and choices when (a) they\'re really just constructs serving as mechanisms to advance the plot, and (b) they never really develop in any noticeable way. If the overall plot had been at all interesting, then I think it would be possible to forgive some lack of decent characterization, but I couldn\'t be bothered to care about that aspect of the show either. As far as I could tell, things happened, characters popped up when necessary to advance the rather meaningless story, and then it all ended. That\'s it.I was incredibly disappointed by this show and I would not recommend it to anyone. It\'s not vile, but it\'s pointless. I know that the goal was to create some really cool show with ""meaningful"" plot developments and genuine emotional depth, but I cannot possibly imagine how the mess that is Clockwork Planet could ever attain even the level of an average but uninspiring series. In a way, perhaps that\'s appropriate. Clockwork Planet, in a sense, lived up to its name. The show runs like an odd little machine ticking away, without a point or purpose. By the time its mechanism ran down at the end of episode 12, could anyone really have been bothered to wind it up again? I certainly could not be bothered. a ludicrous notion that the entirety of planet Earth was reconstructed with gears, cogs, and endless other mechanisms.

It starts off okay, but the events that go on don't generally have a particularly good connection to each other and it's very predictable. There is literally no reason to anticipate that any major character will actually die or is in any danger and it's really just a show where the major characters blow stuff up and keep succeeding. There is very little world building as well despite the potential that this show has to make that interesting.Character:One of the slightly better parts of the story. There is some growth in Marie Bell Briguette and there's some development with...AnchoR. But other than these two the rest are kind of one dimensional. Marie also surprisingly looked a lot better in her disguise than her usual outfit, so it kind of begs the question why that isn't her usual design.Art:It's one of the more distinct art styles in this day and age, albeit childish-looking. The backgrounds are nice, but the characters could have used a more sophisticated design.Sound:It has a nice-ish opening song. In general though, nothing special.Enjoyment:Not displeasing like some worse written anime out there.

Like, really over hated. Most of what I saw in this was actually positive, the characters and plot were interesting, and it was totally enjoyable and worth a watch.Clockwork Planet tells the story of 2 characters: The class wimp Naoto Miura and the daughter of the respected Breguet family, Marie, who are living in a mechanical world created by a person called ""Y"". Y created this world from Earth after it reached the time limit and continued allowing humans to live their lives, though the planet is run by gears and entire countries could collapse if something goes wrong. Marie...and Naoto both have robotic bodyguards, RyuZU and Halter. The government is immediately exposed as being corrupt and selfish, willing to kill millions of people by letting countries get destroyed, after Marie and Naoto stop one of these plots and then expose it to the world, they become labeled as wanted criminals and end up going into hiding, with Marie even faking her own death.Pretty much all of the characters were good, but there is one problem: The villain, Gennai Hirayama. Let\'s be honest, he was a good character, but so poorly implemented and executed that he was just pathetic. Seriously, who in the right mind would make their villain a grumpy old man who\'s pissed off because he wasted his life. He is what I think really holds this show back from scoring higher.The animation was pretty solid, just what you\'d expect to see in an anime. There are quite a few GCI gears shown, but I didn\'t mind them personally, though I can see people really disliking them. The OP and ED were pretty nice too (I fucking love fripSide! xD).Overall: I really enjoyed this, and I\'d say it\'s definitely worth a watch! I honestly have no idea why people hate it so much. and Naoto both have robotic bodyguards, RyuZU and Halter.

The characters are too 1-dimensional, the tensions is fleeting and the first villain doesn\'t even provide any form of pressure.take an example from the first scene we see this ""villain"", at first he\'s all chill and stuff saying things like ""I can\'t let you do that, it\'s against the ""insert powerful association"" orders"" and doesn\'t let tsundere girl go save people. But the moment she pulls a gun on him out of anger, he suddenly squeals in fright completely ruining...the moment.Not to mention it\'s really rushed. (apparently the first 4 episodes went through 2 volumes)It was really hyped up because it was created by the same person who wrote NGNL but honestly it doesn\'t live up to it\'s glamor. the moment.Not to mention it\'s really rushed.

When it first came out, I was hesitant because I wasn't sure how well they would adapt the novel. It really does a good job at squeezing out the more entertaining parts from the 3 novels it has covered into a 12 episode series. Personally, I believe that it is one of the best new anime this season. I would suggest it, but I have to warn...you, the first episode really made me and quite a few other fans nervous, as a couple scenes really didn't make the anime look promising. I would say after the first episode, it has a been a very smooth ride. you, the first episode really made me and quite a few other fans nervous, as a couple scenes really didn't make the anime look promising.

The one where you can\'t even voice a detailed opinion about it without a horribly massive spoiler, which I won\'t reveal. I was incredibly close to dropping this whole thing every moment from episode 1 to 10 but stuck with it almost entirely thanks to the beautiful artwork, even though 9 of 10 contraptions are just dumb redundant clusters of gears spinning in place without the slightest credibility to their function.I flat out hated the main guy until the spoiler, then I only disliked him intensely. I thought everything was absolute moronic garbage...beyond compare until the spoiler, then I only thought it was really dumb and poorly planned.

This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.Oh, Clockwork Planet... How I had such high hopes for you, and in a way, you didn\'t let me down at all.Clockwork Planet revolves around a world made out of... gears and clockwork parts. Go figure. The earth\'s resources had been used up to it\'s fullest, so a mysterious man known as Y made the Clockwork Planet by himself. Fast forward a hundred years or so, and we have Naoto Miura, an aspiring clocksmith. Someday, a female automaton falls through his roof, and discovers that she\'s not functioning properly....He then uses his insanely OP talent of being able to hear how the gears move and see their locations to fix RyuZU. She ends up making Naoto her master as they move on to greater and bigger things.The problem with this show is that it\'s insanely cheesy and so poorly done that I honestly believe Xebec was trying to make a joke of this show, in and of itself. The goofy animation, lines, and ideals spouted from Naoto made this a great show for just turning off your mind and watching on autopilot. Marie, on the other hand, is just about as annoying as you can get. With her constant ""I am regarded as a genius, yet I can\'t do anything!"" bullshit will frustrate just about anyone and everyone that watches this show. All the other characters are absolutely not important and are just there to wreck havoc upon the world at large. I\'d just like to mention as well, Naoto should\'ve been a female character.The art and sound direction are less than mediocre. As formerly mentioned, the art/animation is just really lackluster, and the same goes for the sound. There was several really odd scenes with the animation (see last episode with the hand clap of Marie and her friend) that just felt so out of place.TL;DR: Clockwork Planet is only enjoyable if you\'re able to turn off your brain and just watch for the awfulness. If you\'re a super serious person who watches for amazing action scenes, insanely moving dialogue, or exponential character growth, this is not the place for you. Only watch this show if you\'re okay with having a good time watching something really, really underwhelming.

RyuZu pays him back by calling him master and ordering his commands. Soon, they team up with a girl named Marie and her bodyguard Halter. The enemy = the government.

He is also the creator of RyuZu. CONTAINS: A lot of backstories and conspiracies, Action-fighting scenes, Humor, romantic-comedy moments (including Loli) & weird sexual encounters.CHARACTERS:Naoto: High...school student who has a gift of repairing robots and automaton with sound. Has a fetish for beautiful automatons. Caring, but perverted too.RyuZu: Strongest weapon created by Y. Owes her life to Naoto for saving her. Her outfit reminds me of a nun.

She is essentially your Shiro but with less tact. These two characters are essentially the win all button as they in the most slimmest of margins will win any battle they come across. Now your thinking that Sora and Shiro did the same thing what\'s the difference between them and Naoto and Marie?...Sora and Shiro\'s talents and tactics were shown to us making their journey in their Game World be investing to the audience and slight plot twists were hinted at us before finally showing to us in full force making them badass in the process allowing their journey through their games to have context and inviting to watch, Naoto and Marie\'s on the other hand...don\'t give us the context it needs and denies the sense of urgency in their plans (heck Naoto NEVER gives us even a hint that he had something in mind before showing it) and arcs just end and start up again with new villains really wanting the same thing....to destroy their world.Do you know what\'s worse?...the animation done by Xebec only makes what was supposed to be amazing and gorgeous looking to look bland and boring and it\'s character design for this anime done by Shino of Lance N\'Masques and less said about Lance N\'Masques the better only made it sooo much worse. The poor and bland animation permeates this anime all the way through from it\'s CGI gears abundant, janky character designs and movements and battles that does get better by the final arc (if only to make it look polished but not much else). The ONLY exception to this becomes RyuZU and AnchoR but even then it\'s characters designs were soo much better in it\'s manga state than what the anime gave us.LA really wanted to like this anime but ever so quickly LA just found it boring or just saw perplexing story decisions especially at the end of arcs it went through and let\'s not even get started on the blatantly awkward fanservice moments...like Marie\'s naked body in the shower during a depressing time to AnchoR calling Naoto cute when she also sees him as a father to just fanserviced costume for Marie and AnchoR easily makes the fanservice awkward most of the time and again...the animation doesn\'t helps it\'s case either.There is a good anime within the crap decisions and utterly baffling execution of most of it\'s plot and let\'s just say that even the ending left it in a dour note as it just left it as ""another arc done...next"" kind of scthick and characters just not caring they took down a villain who\'s presences even confused LA as to why he was doing or was even here.LA will say that at the very least the voice acting was decent overall with Saori Oonishi giving her all in this trainwreck, LA did kinda wished that Yoshino Nanjo as Naoto could just dial it down a bit and LA really did like Ai Kakuma as RyuZU and Sayaka Senbongi as AnchoR but nonetheless from the entire voice cast was decent albeit some annoyances.Clockwork Planet is an anime with no urgency, giving the audience nothing in return for us watching it and has god-tier protagonist who can fix anything thus even it\'s tension is gone, baffling and confusing plot decisions and even worse animation looking either ugly or janky. If Clockwork Planet was given to someone who knew what they were doing and changed some things to make more sense and was given to Madhouse or Kyoto Animation, then this anime would not be this forgettable but unfortunately in LA\'s circumstances...that\'s exactly what Clockwork Planet has turned into. well LA will be referring to Yuu Kamiya\'s other work No Game No Life for this a couple times in this review but for the main protagonist Naoto, he\'s essentially Sora without the sense of urgency at the matter of the world collapsing at hand and is your all mighty janitor, Marie Bell Breguet voiced by Saori Oonishi is the other main protagonist of the this anime and is the one wanting to find RyuZU as it was initially hers in the first place.

Thousands of years later, the protagonist Naoto, a young clocksmith with unexplained superhuman hearing, has an ancient robot girl fall on him, and is the first person to fix her after 200 years. The robot girl pledges to be his slave, and joins him and a goup of elite clocksmiths to fix the damaged parts of their world and thwart terrorists and evil military conspiracies. Another character called Marie is introduced who...gets Naoto into the organisation, and the two have a very interesting dynamic in which both are geniuses in their own ways, but their opposing ways of going about fixing problems makes it hard for them to get along.The series has three main problems:Problem 1. The protagonists: Naoto is a weirdo who is sexually attracted to clocks and clockwork robots, and only helps Marie in the hopes of finding more clock girls due to his own perversion.Marie meanwhile constantly mocks Naoto's intelligence, and even attacks him for no clear reason in the penultimate episode. She doesn't even qualify as a tsundere here, since there's no romantic implications behind their friendship, she is just an awful person.The robot girls also have nothing really unique or distinct about their personalities, and the series feels more like an attempt to sell off the writer's sexual fantasy than it does an attempt to actually deliver a quality story.There's also the robot girl Anchor who we see murder a load of soldiers in one episode, then find out in a later episode that she was programmed not to harm humans... what!?Problem 2. The villains: The first episodes set up one character as being the overarching bad guy, only to be forgotten about and replaced with an old guy who spends half of his time spouting pseudo-philosophical nonsense that makes no sense and falsely accusing the protagonist of impersonating Wye... Oh, and he murders all of his own completely loyal men for no clear reason in the penultimate episode, proving that he is the worst kind of villain: the stupid villain who does evil things just to show off how evil he is even in detriment to his own plan. In short: an idiot.Problem 3. The set-up: The series sets up so much regarding Naoto's inexplicable to calculate some things to several decimal places and determine complex mechanical solutions to damage, but bizarre lack of knowledge about equally complex manners. That and his exceptional hearing meant that for ages they seemed to be implying that Naoto was either a robot or Wye himself... but he wasn't, all the set-up had no pay-off and made no sense in the end, with none of Naoto's gifts being explained at all.Problem 4. The finale: Speaking of unexplained, it's explained that, in this otherwise completely sci-fi series without supernatural elements, the two completely normal human protagonists are somehow able to create clock pieces with the power of their minds in order to fix the planet. How they do it is never explained, nothing that happens in the finale makes any sense, it's all just stupid.Aside from that it was a fun watch with decent animation, a lot of cool ideas that could really work well in other stories, some well written comedy scenes, and a nice soundtrack. 5/10 gets Naoto into the organisation, and the two have a very interesting dynamic in which both are geniuses in their own ways, but their opposing ways of going about fixing problems makes it hard for them to get along.The series has three main problems:Problem 1.

Their emotions change so fast that I couldn't understand how the situation solved. Some of their quotes didn't even relate to the problem they were facing.They also don't explain a lot of things in the light novel makes this series hard to be understood.The sound is so interesting to hear, with gear's sound is the main. It surprised me because of complex sounds has been done so well.However, this series is...fun to watch. Even it can't be used to be a commercial for the light novel in my opinion, I still recommend this to who love the sci-fi series. fun to watch.

It has a wonderful setting, an interesting premise and a good overall design, but nothing more. The entire project falls flat and becomes generic, stale and not enjoyable at all at times. I don\'t like putting low scores, in fact i have given very few scores under 6, but all of the wasted opportunity and dull moments forced me to do itStory 4The Story, if it exists, is bad, really bad. The pacing is horrible and the 2 major story...arcs fell rushed and dull. The ""Main"" Villain of the story is your typical generic and boring villain and i\'m not joking if i say you can predict all of his lines even before he says them. The story itself has a really interesting premise, with a good world building( literally) and an amusing mistery about the shadowly figure of Y and his dools, Needless to say, this is all thrown out of the window pretty quickly, and the story starts in Medias Res, which is an automatic sin. The 2 Major story arcs are very weak from a tecnical and emotional standpoint, they start really slow and have a really fast and rushed climax, with lots of useless exposition and dumb character moments. But the 2 biggest problems lie in the tone of the Story-telling, at least that little of story telling present in the show, because the show doesn\'t even care about its story, it concentrates around frivolous moments andit goes around unnecessary turns without ever coming to the point; the tone is never explained or showed, you don\'t know if you\'re supposed to take what\'s shown seriously or to laugh, it doesn\'t even care about this. The second biggest problem is the plot itself, it\'s predictable, extended too much in certain moments, and boring:you\'re supposed to feel something during the main parts of the story, but the execution is so poor that the only thing you actually fell is indifference, which is a common emotion throughout the entire showCharacters 5I\'ll start on the positive notes: RyuZU is awesome, the best character hands down, from the witty and diabolical dialogue, to the literally verbal assaults that she does against some of the other characters, and her action scenes are the best, too bad that in the second part of the story she kind of disappears, she was my only joy. The others are dull, uninteresting and, to be honest, dumb: Naoto and Marie Bell Breguet are weak leads, they have no development whatsoever: Naoto begins as a pussy and weak character, ends the same way, while Marie Bell begins  well, she becomes a crybaby pretty quickly and actually gets worse as the series progresses, she loses her personality, has unnecessary conflicts that lead nowhere. The side characters are forgettable and clichéd, they offer nothing to the story and are just there for the useless banter and for the forced humour, which is the biggest problem here: The humour is based about Fan Service and an horribile running gag, that of the Doll ""Family"", one time i laugh, the second time too, the third , the fourth and fifth time too, maybe, but from the sixth time onwards you present me with the same exact joke and you dedicate an entire episode to some of the most forced humour i\'ve seen in a while, that tickles me and stops me from enjoying your showSound 7The music is good, thumbs up for FripSide and After the Rain for doing a really good work with the soundtrack, the opening and the ending are really good songs, and the ending has some really cool visuals. On the other hand, the opening is a good song, but the visuals are horrible, anyone who worked on this should think about it more and work harder, because this is one of the worst openings, in terms of visuals, i\'ve ever seen, it\'s even off-sync at times.

Spoilers ahead!)Clockwork Planet features and stars a couple of automata, robots who are more human than machine (on the outside at least).Last year, a video game titled Nier:Automata stayed true to its name and did the same. I quickly fell in love with the somewhat niche project: 2B, the phenomenal OST, the amazing (true) ending. Not only was it my favorite game from 2017 but also it earned a spot within my all-time-best list. Alongside the likes of Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest, Dark Souls, The Last of Us, and...many others.In comparison, Clockwork Planet will in no way be earning a similar treatment.STORY1000 years after the Earth’s demise, it finds new life within Clockwork Planet. From the tall buildings to the layered ground, the world fills itself with almost nothing else but gears upon gears. Within this world lives Naoto, an aspiring clocksmith. One day, a coffin falls from the sky. A coffin that contains RyuZU, the “One Who Follows.” He fixes her broken mechanical innards, she swears an oath of loyalty to him, and the two, alongside Marie and Halter, move as one unit to save this planet from whatever evil may roam.Rather than telling one complete tale, this season roughly splits itself up into three distinct arcs: the Kyoto Grid Arc, the AnchoR Arc, and the Yatsukahagi Arc. A relatively common approach. Perhaps not as common, though, is the brokenness of this entire product.The Kyoto Grid Arc already starts to unscrew the bolts keeping the show together. While these first four episodes serve mostly as the introduction – bringing the group together, establishing the setting, etc. – a lot of the content fails to deliver. The military-political subplot does not tie back enough to Marie and her standing since the audience hasn’t learned much about her at this point. The opposing robots do not make for interesting enemies and thus hurt the power of the action sequences. The anime doesn’t do the best job at differentiating this sci-fi world from any other run-of-the-mill city.In episode three, RyuZU’s head-nodding confession to Naoto makes for a fun little scene, demonstrating that the anime has something worthwhile to share. When the AnchoR Arc begins a couple of episodes later, however, concerning smoke and whirring noises expel from this product as it breaks down further.Breakage comes from different sources this time around. For example, in its attempts to provide a better backing to the upcoming plot, it tries to explain where the superweapon came from. It’s given as an unsightly exposition dump, though. The show also includes this crazy area called the “Deep Underground.” As Halter describes it, basically outer space if it existed, well, underground. A person cannot survive down there, and it seems like a neat place for the anime to explore if not a relevant plot point altogether.But no on both fronts. Naoto just so happens to find a safe spot down there for convenience sake, and it is never revisited, leaving it as a tangential piece of the narrative. Oh, he and RyuZU also just-so-happen to meet some random old guy who turns out to be the final villain of the season. Because why not?To the show’s half-credit, it does contain small throughputs that do tie back to earlier moments in the season, providing some semblance of writing coherency. Remember that subplot from the first arc? Marie puts those evil people within the government sphere on blast to out their corruption. A sly move for sure, but a move that unexpectedly acts as the catalyst to escalate known tensions. (Info lost within that exposition dump.)Marie also mentions very briefly an old friend of hers named Houko in this arc who later appears in the last arc. Something similar goes for the message that they tailed. They find the obliterated body of the cyborg who sent it, and he later tells them it was his doing shortly before reincarnating as a female.But these throughputs are too loose in their construction, for they are information and connections that do not matter in the grand scheme of things. Marie’s accidental actions do not lead to any thematic discussion on the political struggles and their adverse effect on the people. Houko does not play a significant role in the events that follow her arrival. It doesn’t matter who sent that radio message because it doesn’t affect the plot whatsoever.However, once again, Clockwork Planet gets at something when RyuZU brings Marie along for her duel with AnchoR as an expenditure of sorts (unbeknownst to the young girl, of course). Fun, believable writing that, for a brief moment, may fix this show.The Yatsukahagi Arc will have none of that, strolling in to demolish what’s left. The conflict at this point centers on the massive superweapon and how the group will save the country. In doing so, too many strange story beats occur. RyuZU and AnchoR don’t go all-out despite their bend-the-laws-of-physics abilities out of a misplaced fear of them overexerting themselves (which AnchoR does anyway). The whole giant space Tall Wand debacle comes and goes without much worry. The magical, poorly explained gear-making event to mend the Pillar of Heaven boggles the mind in its asinine nature.Three arcs. Three chances. Three misses. In short, this narrative is like using a feather to jam a nail into a dense piece of wood – it just doesn’t work.ART & ANIMATIONClockwork Planet tries to make things work instead with its visuals.RyuZU, Marie, and Naoto do so with their designs. Their somewhat dated looks hearken back to a now older style, acting not as an issue but rather as a source of intrigue. Furthermore, their details in general give them some clout. RyuZU especially. A nun-and-maid combo outfit. Her “impeccable and perfect body” (as Naoto puts it in episode five). Extra accessories and patterns that adorn her clothes. Each part highlight her devoutness, beauty, and intricacy (respectively), arguing for said clout.Also of note are some of the different shots within the anime. It mostly refrains from any grand detail in its background artistry, but Clockwork Planet can have flashes of neatness. Whether it’s a top-down view of the gear-filled country or a psychedelic interpretation of Naoto’s incredible hearing ability, the audience is treated sparingly to a couple of cool shots.Unfortunately, that intrigue and those flashes cannot hide the anime’s otherwise underwhelming presentation. It can look far too rough at times when designs do not maintain correct looks either through squashing or from improper details. Outright mishaps are rare (e.g., the white of Halter’s eyeball is colored incorrectly at one point in episode two), but the overreliance on speedy backgrounds, the barely serviceable cinematography, and the boring maneuvers for its action sequences continually hamper its visual integrity.Worse still, the actual animation is far too stilted for much of the show’s run. The anime gets around the poor movement with gun battles, swift blade attacks, and the occasional comedic display (e.g., Marie opening and closing her hands in episode five to mimic choking someone). But mouths during conversations, their walk cycles, turning, and the general actions they take do not amount to much. Not that the animation is choppy or unacceptable; it simply doesn’t aim to appeal.Worst of all, the opening track rips over half of its visuals from the events of the anime itself. An every-single-episode indication that the anime refused to try harder than it otherwise could have. Combined with all the other problems, the art and animation simply don’t have enough going for them in such a visual-driven medium.CHARACTERSAfter the story breaks apart and the visuals barely work as a Band-Aid, Clockwork Planet’s cast arrives to try and rectify the situation with tools of their own. They tinker and toil, but their efforts are in vain.It starts with RyuZU. Arguably the best part of the entire anime, RyuZU instantly improves the show with her progenitor status (being a creation of Y, the creator of their world) and, of course, her deadpan insults (which strike with truth and hilarity). Her ultra-time-slowing move gives her a cool edge over the enemy, too.While she makes fun of Marie and the others, part of her character focuses on not hating humanity so much. Or at least, coming to the conclusion that they have more brains than those of a common flea. She takes that minute step thanks to one person: Naoto. He proves to her with his aural capabilities that people nowadays are not just a bunch of buffoons. That they are indeed capable of some extraordinary things.However, Naoto doesn’t just give her a reason to stop the hate. He also gives her a sincere relationship. While the pairing of a teenage boy and a thousand-year-old killer robot is admittedly an odd pairing, Naoto’s joy and persistence at having a thoughtful connection with RyuZU beyond the master-servant roles they take up puts her out of her comfort zone. Thus, he elicits emotions from her that she otherwise would have never experienced.Despite RyuZU’s part in Clockwork Planet, the anime literally and figuratively puts her out of commission come the second half of the season. An electromagnetic pulse wave overheats her system, and she oddly receives less focus even when she revives, leaving her presence diminished and her impact forgettable.The trade-off is spending more time on AnchoR. Arriving at about that halfway point, she counts as RyuZU’s younger “sister” and looks at Naoto and Marie as her “father” and “mother” respectively. Having always been told what to do and only just recently gaining her freedom, she almost always asks for permission first before doing something. That is, until she “disobeys” Naoto of her own free will and chooses to wipe out the superweapon come the end of the season.Like RyuZU, though, AnchoR’s most important involvement comes from a relationship she holds with another character: Marie. Despite AnchoR’s kindhearted intentions, Marie doesn’t like AnchoR and actively distances herself from the little girl as much as possible. So, from their interactions, AnchoR eases Marie’s at-times rough personality, and Marie humanizes the “One Who Annihilates” by giving her the love and the support she has never known.Marie isn’t an automata, but she is a known genius of the Meisterguild and of the Breguet family. At least, before she destroys her guild crest and fakes her own death. She describes herself as someone who never views anything as impossible, and she stores insane amounts of knowledge in her head while simultaneously fixing mechanical issues with utmost precision.In comparison, Naoto, the main protagonist of Clockwork Planet, isn’t a genius but instead a miracle. His hearing compensates for the fact that he does not have strong tinkering skills, giving him an advantage and an out in many a situation. He also has a keen affinity for the small (perverted) pleasures in life, and he isn’t afraid to be honest with people.Both Marie and Naoto have their own moments throughout the season. Most of episode six challenges Marie’s personal mantra, and Naoto regularly lends his talent such as when he pinpoints the few gears among trillions that need a repair or determines where the next attack will manifest.Once again, though, it’s the relationship between the two that takes precedence. Marie often cannot fathom why this “idiot” makes so much sense all the time, and Naoto encourages her despite the troubles they face. Most importantly, they mirror each other about the other. She’s mad at herself for relying on Naoto the miracle; he’s mad at himself for the envy he feels towards Marie the genius. They don’t hate each other. Rather, they both simply wish that they could do and be more than what they currently are.A cool idea, but it’s only sprinkled throughout the season rather than honed in on as a major talking point between the characters. Plus, their esoteric, paradoxical exchange in episode eleven, where they seemingly teach the other (to some extent) their signature traits, isn’t the most sound writing on the (clockwork) planet.As for the other cast members involved, they either do not contribute much or lack basic characterization and writing to make them worthwhile. Take Halter. He’s no doubt a cool, chill dude to have around, balancing out the craziness of the others. Yet he unfortunately doesn’t receive a lot of attention outside of a weird aside where Marie pretends to call him “papa.”Vermouth, the man-turned-woman cyborg, adds in some comedic relief when nearly every line of her dialogue takes the form of a sexual innuendo. However, her late inclusion, her lacking relationships, and her failure to hold a meaningful role within the crew simply makes her into an unnecessary distraction.Gannai, the main villain of the Yatsukahagi Arc, is little more than a crotchety old man who has beef with Y on a philosophical basis. He barely has a handful of lines during his brief stint let alone a tangible foundation to his very character.From RyuZU to AnchoR, Naoto to Marie, and everyone in-between, the characters unfortunately cannot fix what is already broken. Some of their relationships had a chance, but, they do not instill enough torque to get the gears going.MUSIC & SOUNDClockwork Planet finds no respite from its broken state when it comes to a lot of the music played throughout the season.The titular opening track, “Clockwork Planet,” stalls the show from the get-go. The faint noise of a hand-turned device and some techno sounds can be heard in the background for a couple of fitting inclusions. However, the flat vocals, the tired beat, the odd loftiness, and the lacking instrumentation turn the OP into more of a chore to listen to all the way through rather than a welcome addition to the anime.The ending track, “Anti Clockwise,” redeems where its brethren reduced. More relevant noises appear in the form of ticking time, but the ED trades in the techno and the tired for the dynamic and the diverse. Frantic piano keys give way to varied vocals, guitar segments, a bit of autotune, and changing tempos that power up the entire piece. While not a playlist-worthy track, it at least keeps the music from having nothing to show for itself.Because, sandwiched between the detestable and the acceptable, the original soundtrack slowly fades away from the minds of the audience. Hand drums, acoustic guitar, and synthesizer accompany mystery vibes, sad moments, and fast-paced action sequences (respectively), yet their impact is low and their supportive nature only exists insofar as they give the listener something to distract them from the rest of the anime. One of the tracks does have a cool saxophone lead-in. But, when it proceeds to play alien spaceships and daintier instruments afterwards, roughness messes up that smoothness.On top of the fact that there are no noteworthy voice-acting performances, the music and sound work within Clockwork Planet is one of the weakest pieces to this malfunctioning project.ENJOYMENTOnly two people in the anime save it from being an absolute bore: RyuZU and Konrad.RyuZU for the obvious reasons. She’s a beauty, but it’s her words against Naoto and the others that got a chuckle out of me every time. Here are a few of my favorites from the show.“Is there some kind of problem? Does my perfection and overwhelming capabilities damage your mitochondrion-level pride?” “Master Naoto, your face is already dull at best.” “I suspect the brains of the army’s officers have been seriously damaged. I mean, they fell for a plan you came up with, Miss Marie.” “Even the Gods are envious of the treasure that is my lap. It is the definition of unrivaled luxury.” “Please, use every bit of your insufficient brain. Excuse me.”I also liked the romance bits between her and Naoto. Her pouts and jokes, the almost-kissed-twice scene, her engagement moment. Without RyuZU, the anime would have been nigh intolerable for sure.Now Konrad, he knows what’s up. He goes from a leading scientist to a strip-club proprietor. Taking in and building up sexy robot women who throw themselves at the casual beanie-and-t-shirt wearing gentleman every chance they get. All while doing his part to help save the world during his downtime. A man truly worthy of respect.As for everyone and everything else, I cannot say I was a big fan. I wish Halter did more throughout the season. Naoto, Marie, and AnchoR have their quirks, but I don’t find them pronounced enough. The shootouts and the occasional super abilities didn’t keep my attention. The drama didn’t do anything for me. No interesting themes pop up that I could either investigate or admire. Choosing to have AnchoR register with Naoto instead of Marie seems like a huge misstep on a character and narrative level in my eyes.This anime isn’t the worst that I’ve ever seen, but it puts itself pretty far down there.Clockwork Planet needs more repairs than a destroyed timepiece. The story is a mess. The visuals lack value. The characters come up short. The music is bland. The entertainment available amounts to maybe a couple of elements. Altogether, an automatic fall to very nier the bottom of the list.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, a weak foundation, loose plot points, and questionable writing choices keep the narrative from highlighting the extremely sparse moments that have some grain of worthArt & Animation: Bad, while the individual designs and a few shots have some intrigue to them, the stilted animation, the low input of its cinematography, and the rough artistry in general lead to an underwhelming visual presentationCharacters: Bad, RyuZU, AnchoR, Naoto, and Marie have potential in their relationships and individual traits, but their efficacy ranges all over the place, and the side cast in general do not contribute much, if anything at allMusic & Sound: Bad, the OP and the OST crash hard, and the VA performances are par for the course, but at least the ED provides a track worth listening toEnjoyment: Bad, RyuZU and Konrad do what they can to keep the boredom at bayFinal Score: 2/10 many others.In comparison, Clockwork Planet will in no way be earning a similar treatment.STORY1000 years after the Earth’s demise, it finds new life within Clockwork Planet.

The anime gets around the poor movement with gun battles, swift blade attacks, and the occasional comedic display (e.g., Marie opening and closing her hands in episode five to mimic choking someone). But mouths during conversations, their walk cycles, turning, and the general actions they take do not amount to much. Not that the animation is choppy or unacceptable; it simply doesn’t aim to appeal.Worst of all, the opening track rips over half of its visuals from the events of the anime itself. An every-single-episode indication that the anime refused to try harder than it otherwise could have. Combined with all the other problems, the art and animation simply don’t have enough going for them in such a visual-driven medium.CHARACTERSAfter the story breaks apart and the visuals barely work as a Band-Aid, Clockwork Planet’s cast arrives to try and rectify the situation with tools of their own. They tinker and toil, but their efforts are in vain.It starts with RyuZU. Arguably the best part of the entire anime, RyuZU instantly improves the show with her progenitor status (being a creation of Y, the creator of their world) and, of course, her deadpan insults (which strike with truth and hilarity). Her ultra-time-slowing move gives her a cool edge over the enemy, too.While she makes fun of Marie and the others, part of her character focuses on not hating humanity so much. Or at least, coming to the conclusion that they have more brains than those of a common flea. She takes that minute step thanks to one person: Naoto. He proves to her with his aural capabilities that people nowadays are not just a bunch of buffoons. That they are indeed capable of some extraordinary things.However, Naoto doesn’t just give her a reason to stop the hate. He also gives her a sincere relationship. While the pairing of a teenage boy and a thousand-year-old killer robot is admittedly an odd pairing, Naoto’s joy and persistence at having a thoughtful connection with RyuZU beyond the master-servant roles they take up puts her out of her comfort zone. Thus, he elicits emotions from her that she otherwise would have never experienced.Despite RyuZU’s part in Clockwork Planet, the anime literally and figuratively puts her out of commission come the second half of the season. An electromagnetic pulse wave overheats her system, and she oddly receives less focus even when she revives, leaving her presence diminished and her impact forgettable.The trade-off is spending more time on AnchoR. Arriving at about that halfway point, she counts as RyuZU’s younger “sister” and looks at Naoto and Marie as her “father” and “mother” respectively. Having always been told what to do and only just recently gaining her freedom, she almost always asks for permission first before doing something. That is, until she “disobeys” Naoto of her own free will and chooses to wipe out the superweapon come the end of the season.Like RyuZU, though, AnchoR’s most important involvement comes from a relationship she holds with another character: Marie. Despite AnchoR’s kindhearted intentions, Marie doesn’t like AnchoR and actively distances herself from the little girl as much as possible. So, from their interactions, AnchoR eases Marie’s at-times rough personality, and Marie humanizes the “One Who Annihilates” by giving her the love and the support she has never known.Marie isn’t an automata, but she is a known genius of the Meisterguild and of the Breguet family. At least, before she destroys her guild crest and fakes her own death. She describes herself as someone who never views anything as impossible, and she stores insane amounts of knowledge in her head while simultaneously fixing mechanical issues with utmost precision.In comparison, Naoto, the main protagonist of Clockwork Planet, isn’t a genius but instead a miracle. His hearing compensates for the fact that he does not have strong tinkering skills, giving him an advantage and an out in many a situation. He also has a keen affinity for the small (perverted) pleasures in life, and he isn’t afraid to be honest with people.Both Marie and Naoto have their own moments throughout the season. Most of episode six challenges Marie’s personal mantra, and Naoto regularly lends his talent such as when he pinpoints the few gears among trillions that need a repair or determines where the next attack will manifest.Once again, though, it’s the relationship between the two that takes precedence. Marie often cannot fathom why this “idiot” makes so much sense all the time, and Naoto encourages her despite the troubles they face. Most importantly, they mirror each other about the other. She’s mad at herself for relying on Naoto the miracle; he’s mad at himself for the envy he feels towards Marie the genius. They don’t hate each other. Rather, they both simply wish that they could do and be more than what they currently are.A cool idea, but it’s only sprinkled throughout the season rather than honed in on as a major talking point between the characters. Plus, their esoteric, paradoxical exchange in episode eleven, where they seemingly teach the other (to some extent) their signature traits, isn’t the most sound writing on the (clockwork) planet.As for the other cast members involved, they either do not contribute much or lack basic characterization and writing to make them worthwhile. Take Halter. He’s no doubt a cool, chill dude to have around, balancing out the craziness of the others. Yet he unfortunately doesn’t receive a lot of attention outside of a weird aside where Marie pretends to call him “papa.”Vermouth, the man-turned-woman cyborg, adds in some comedic relief when nearly every line of her dialogue takes the form of a sexual innuendo. However, her late inclusion, her lacking relationships, and her failure to hold a meaningful role within the crew simply makes her into an unnecessary distraction.Gannai, the main villain of the Yatsukahagi Arc, is little more than a crotchety old man who has beef with Y on a philosophical basis. He barely has a handful of lines during his brief stint let alone a tangible foundation to his very character.From RyuZU to AnchoR, Naoto to Marie, and everyone in-between, the characters unfortunately cannot fix what is already broken. Some of their relationships had a chance, but, they do not instill enough torque to get the gears going.MUSIC & SOUNDClockwork Planet finds no respite from its broken state when it comes to a lot of the music played throughout the season.The titular opening track, “Clockwork Planet,” stalls the show from the get-go. The faint noise of a hand-turned device and some techno sounds can be heard in the background for a couple of fitting inclusions. However, the flat vocals, the tired beat, the odd loftiness, and the lacking instrumentation turn the OP into more of a chore to listen to all the way through rather than a welcome addition to the anime.The ending track, “Anti Clockwise,” redeems where its brethren reduced. More relevant noises appear in the form of ticking time, but the ED trades in the techno and the tired for the dynamic and the diverse. Frantic piano keys give way to varied vocals, guitar segments, a bit of autotune, and changing tempos that power up the entire piece. While not a playlist-worthy track, it at least keeps the music from having nothing to show for itself.Because, sandwiched between the detestable and the acceptable, the original soundtrack slowly fades away from the minds of the audience. Hand drums, acoustic guitar, and synthesizer accompany mystery vibes, sad moments, and fast-paced action sequences (respectively), yet their impact is low and their supportive nature only exists insofar as they give the listener something to distract them from the rest of the anime. One of the tracks does have a cool saxophone lead-in. But, when it proceeds to play alien spaceships and daintier instruments afterwards, roughness messes up that smoothness.On top of the fact that there are no noteworthy voice-acting performances, the music and sound work within Clockwork Planet is one of the weakest pieces to this malfunctioning project.ENJOYMENTOnly two people in the anime save it from being an absolute bore: RyuZU and Konrad.RyuZU for the obvious reasons. She’s a beauty, but it’s her words against Naoto and the others that got a chuckle out of me every time. Here are a few of my favorites from the show.“Is there some kind of problem? Does my perfection and overwhelming capabilities damage your mitochondrion-level pride?” “Master Naoto, your face is already dull at best.” “I suspect the brains of the army’s officers have been seriously damaged. I mean, they fell for a plan you came up with, Miss Marie.” “Even the Gods are envious of the treasure that is my lap. It is the definition of unrivaled luxury.” “Please, use every bit of your insufficient brain. Excuse me.”I also liked the romance bits between her and Naoto. Her pouts and jokes, the almost-kissed-twice scene, her engagement moment. Without RyuZU, the anime would have been nigh intolerable for sure.Now Konrad, he knows what’s up. He goes from a leading scientist to a strip-club proprietor. Taking in and building up sexy robot women who throw themselves at the casual beanie-and-t-shirt wearing gentleman every chance they get. All while doing his part to help save the world during his downtime. A man truly worthy of respect.As for everyone and everything else, I cannot say I was a big fan. I wish Halter did more throughout the season. Naoto, Marie, and AnchoR have their quirks, but I don’t find them pronounced enough. The shootouts and the occasional super abilities didn’t keep my attention. The drama didn’t do anything for me. No interesting themes pop up that I could either investigate or admire. Choosing to have AnchoR register with Naoto instead of Marie seems like a huge misstep on a character and narrative level in my eyes.This anime isn’t the worst that I’ve ever seen, but it puts itself pretty far down there.Clockwork Planet needs more repairs than a destroyed timepiece. The story is a mess. The visuals lack value. The characters come up short. The music is bland. The entertainment available amounts to maybe a couple of elements. Altogether, an automatic fall to very nier the bottom of the list.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, a weak foundation, loose plot points, and questionable writing choices keep the narrative from highlighting the extremely sparse moments that have some grain of worthArt & Animation: Bad, while the individual designs and a few shots have some intrigue to them, the stilted animation, the low input of its cinematography, and the rough artistry in general lead to an underwhelming visual presentationCharacters: Bad, RyuZU, AnchoR, Naoto, and Marie have potential in their relationships and individual traits, but their efficacy ranges all over the place, and the side cast in general do not contribute much, if anything at allMusic & Sound: Bad, the OP and the OST crash hard, and the VA performances are par for the course, but at least the ED provides a track worth listening toEnjoyment: Bad, RyuZU and Konrad do what they can to keep the boredom at bayFinal Score: 2/10', 'Overall, I think this series was quite a train wreck. When I was first watching the series, I thought that the idea of a planet made of gears would be a super interesting concept, and that our MC would become super OP, much like the MCs of NGNL; however, at the end of the series, I felt like the MC was quite useless compared to his female counterpart. After finishing the series, I can say that, although it was a train wreck, it had enough momentum to keep me thoroughly entertained and I highly recommend watching the actual show.Story (7/10)The story seemed a bit...random. A bunch of nonsense stopped the MCs multiple times throughout the arcs which all seemed very... meh.  Although the plot of both of the arcs were not anything revolutionary, they had enough randomness to make the show unpredictable. In fact, some of the main details of the story and in the climax of the show left me thinking, ""Wait, WTF?"" There were many parts that were confusing, however, if you just go with the flow and watch this series with an open mind, it\'s not too hard to enjoy it.Throughout the series, there were many comedic moments. I felt that these were an excellent idea, as the MCs look like kids. The comedy breaks the heavy, harsh atmosphere and truly makes the series enjoyable to watch.Art (7/10)The art is nothing revolutionary. It isn\'t new, nor is it old. The animation is smooth but not as smooth as some of the newer shows that are coming out. It was completely ""normal"" for me. Some of the things did have interesting design concepts but overall, the art was nothing outstanding.Sound (10/10)I loved this soundtrack. It truly set the tone of the entire anime. Some parts of it, without the music, would have been a lot more gloomy. The music keeps everything up beat and hopeful. The music was truly on point.Characters (8/10)The characters in this anime are very human-like. They have different phases and act differently. The MC doesn\'t have a strict pattern that he follows, and he has a whole swing of emotions that are clearly demonstrated. All of the characters have that wide swing of emotion, and I felt that that the characters grew on me. Although they were very humanlike, some of the characters (not gonna name which ones) had certain times during the series where they completely changed into new characters. If these bursts of knowledge and these changes were explained by the series, I would have no doubt given a 10/10.Enjoyment (9/10)I binged watched this series. I am a manga/LN reader, and for any of you, like me, get into manga, it\'s very hard to get back into anime. Manga is so fast and allows you to get into it more easily, in my opinion. However, this anime kept me interested and entertained enough to binge it. Although there were some slow parts that I trudged through, it was an overall fun adventure that kept me watching it until it\'s completion.Overall (8/10)With plot holes upon plot holes, I cannot give this series anything more than an 8. Although I loved the characters and music, the story is what I look for in a series. There were wayyy (yes with three ys) too many plot holes and times where I just was like, ""wait is nobody gonna question what just happened?"" to give it a higher score. random.

I gave the LN a 10/10 instead of a 3/10. That being said, let's jump into the show.Story 6/10:The one thing that this adaptation didn't screw up that hard is the story. I mean, it's not written by the studio, so of course it won't be that bad. However, what turned an otherwise 10/10 storyline into a 6/10 storyline is the pacing and the important details that have been cut away. For example, the opening started with a dumb fight with no context at all, making me, as...someone who read the LN and the manga, lost in mere seconds. The motive of the antagonist of the first arc was also explained poorly that instead of reflecting the dark side of politics, it made me question how dumb the people are in this world to appoint him onto such a high position. If other studios (say White Fox or Mad House or Trigger) were the ones who did the adaptation, it can easily reach a 9 or 10.Art 3/10:What? Is? Wrong? With? You? The characters look nothing like the original, nor does it give the same vibe. Instead of the almost mythical designs of the automatons; or the cute, yet iconic designs of the human characters, they now all look unbearably generic. The only redeeming factor is the background art, which is the only credit I can give.Sound 4/10:Again, the same old rock japanese anime music that I have grown out of years ago. The ending is cool, but gets annoying once it gets old.Character 1/10:This is where they screw up the hardest: the characters. In the original, no characters were as annoying as they were here. The obsession with robots from Naoto was not as exaggerated, and the author has went out of its way to make us the readers understand where his obsession came from. He also has other character traits that have not been shown at all in the show. RyuZu may still be a servent type A character, but she has shown depth from time to time. Marie has childish moments, but she also has the competence that someone who hold such a high social status has. Halter was one of the coolest character in the LN. None of these were in the show. Instead, we get a bunch of noisy idiots with one exaggerated character trait that I've seen billion times in other anime done better.Enjoyment 2/10:It's impossible for me to enjoy this anime, knowing how much better it could have been. If it were adapted better, even though it may not enter my top 10, it can easily reach a spot pretty close. This, on the other hand, can easily enter the top 10 worst shows I have ever watched.Overall: 3/10This is the definition of a missed oppurtunity, one that I am not planning to let go of. I don't like to argue with people which show is better because I believe that it is ultimately subjective. But even still I do have my favourites. I wouldn't bat an eye if someone read the original source and hated it, that's just taste difference; but if someone hated the franchise because of the anime, I would sincerely hope that they could give the manga a shot.

Protagonist is stupid as fuck, in the first episode HE SAID HE COULDN\'T EVEN FIX A SIMPLE CLOCK BUT THEN HE FIXES A CYBORG AND THEN HELPED DOING OTHER THINGS. So is he smart or not? Is he a good engineer or not? Answer is HE LEARNED ALL HE NEEDED IN THE FIRST EPISODE WHILE SLEEPING. I can\'t justify in other ways...Obviously other Characters are lolis, girls with a gentle heart but cold manners or snorty ones... And this anime is full of SEXUAL REFERENCES, they don\'t make you see anything, except standard japanese stuff, but they are really explicit in the talking manners ...There is no introspection in this anime, characters doesn\'t have consistency, coherence etc... Most important they are exactly as other characters already seen in other animes, nothing more nothing less...BASICALLY THIS ANIME HASA) NO PLOTB) NO STORYC) STUPID CHARACTERSD) STUPID SKETCHESE) BORING AS HELL', 'If i were to describe this show in one word it would be ""Melodramatic"".The show had so much potential to shock and awe us with a unique universe based on the concept of an artificial planet functioning via clockwork gears. But the show doesn\'t really go anywhere with it, the gears serving more as both just a quirky aesthetic and as a plot device rather than any kind of functioning environment. Either the effort just wasn\'t put in or a sub-par narrative just fluked an interesting premise.To compound the feeling of melodrama the show doesn\'t really have any pace but absolute haste. It\'s a never...ending rush from one problem to another and this has a knock on affect in regards to the quality of the introduction of new characters because they are given next to no background when they appear since the show focuses on the plot; this, in turn, makes it practically impossible to relate to them or in some cases really fail to understand what their intentions or motivations are at all.For example there\'s a completely random ""agent"" character originally introduced as a throw away device to introduce a new threat/antagonist. The agent works for a completely absent organisation that is never mentioned and who after being destroyed and later brought back to life chooses to start working with the protagonists because [insert arbitrary reason]. The whole thing is just weak. He also seems to know and be able to contact the female lead, despite having no real connection with her. Additionally he finds himself in the predicament of being swapped genders in the (underground) process of re-initialising his cyborg consciousness inside another body and despite an initial disapproval, manages to slot right into the new role after just moments like a cheap joke despite having the potential to being one of the most complex characters in the show even though (s)he is only a supporting role. Every now and then when they appear on screen you\'re found asking yourself ""Wait a minute, who even is this person"".Yet the show still expects for us to care and relate when these flimsy characters with no origin story get stuck in dire situations.Ordinarily i would have lumped this show into a pigeon hole as a child\'s show, the complete lack of complexity, basic as hell action scenes and over dramatic acting makes it appear that way, except the show in a vain attempt to be edgy introduces some fairly frequent foul language and completely superfluous unwarranted nudity (all be it censored). It\'s really hard to judge this show because it\'s really hard to know what the goal was outside of the original Light Novel, which may have been more smooth than this adaptation.I can\'t tell whether the show tried to be too many things at once or didn\'t try to be anything at all and the result is a complete mess of a story, with ludicrously high stake gambits driving an underlying story of one 16 year old\'s seedy desire to have a harem of sentient pseudo sex dolls. Maybe that is the ultimate joke. Certainly it is a running one that each antagonists high and mighty ideals and plans are all foiled by a protagonist whose only motivation in opposing them is his interest in maintaining the status quo of being in a relationship with his automata which he cannot do if his home town is ""purged"", ""blown up"" or ""shot with a giant orbital space lance"".To summarise: The characters are all melodramatic and with no real depth making the show feel really silly overall. There isn\'t even really any fan service despite being the opening saga of a harem so it\'s hard to tell what the ultimate intent of the show was. The art is hit and miss, the use of CG has always been a cheap move, but a clear effort has been made to reduce the obviousness of ""recycling"" content that would be re-used over and over like the gears. It\'s not a difficult show to watch, but it\'s silliness wont keep you as engaged as you might have wanted to be. You\'ll probably be disappointed if you\'re a seasoned anime watcher. ending rush from one problem to another and this has a knock on affect in regards to the quality of the introduction of new characters because they are given next to no background when they appear since the show focuses on the plot; this, in turn, makes it practically impossible to relate to them or in some cases really fail to understand what their intentions or motivations are at all.For example there\'s a completely random ""agent"" character originally introduced as a throw away device to introduce a new threat/antagonist.

Realmente no te causan ninguna emoción. El protagonista no tiene nada de encanto como tal, básicamente es un idiota, no tenemos un protagonista carismático y de buen nivel como Joseph Joestar o Lelouch, el personaje mas fuerte de la serie apenas si me pareció que servia para fanservice,  su actitud tan egocéntrica en lugar de ser Divertida o algo me resultó molesta en fin RyuZU se pudo aprovechar mejor. Marie igualmente era un...personaje sin encanto, pero era el mas pasable de toda la serei. Halter era el tipo serio que carece de personalidad y presencia un personaje plano y ya.La animación esta en la media de lo correcto, lo cual es bueno. Con su ambientación creo que se podía lograr algo mejor si teníamos una animación mas a lo Kabaneri en cuanto a calidad. Pero en lineas generales está bien.No digo que la serie sea mala, la verdad es que se puede disfrutar y entretiene.Pero me parece mediocre porque está desaprovechada.La serie tiene lados muy buenos y situaciones muy interesantes. personaje sin encanto, pero era el mas pasable de toda la serei.

Some good background music, an interesting world, and some great character back and forths....However execution is key and at numerous times throughout the series events feel so rushed and characters seem to be arbitrarily stupified.The main problem.over everything else is certainly in the character designs.

Clockwork Planet is actually kinda cool, but nothing is that amazing about the plot and the characters' development to me. It just felt like I was getting to see the MCs adventuring, which was totally fine and entertaining. It's a short anime I rewatched in two nights, so if you want to see two genius kids and their robots just saving the world and stuff, I would say why not crank it out. Otherwise, I wouldnn't prioritize watching it, it's just a time-killer.Oh I guess my review was too short...to publish. I guess I'll add that I like the artstyle, the animation is nothing special though. The characters' actions and conversations aren't the most human, so the world-building and premise are probably the most interesting points. Most of the anime is unrealistic, but it's fine anyway.

In the end, the opening, ending and I guess also the music was the only legitimately good part of this anime.The art fluctuates from okay to bad. The story and characters are pretty random and dumb. The whole piece leaves me thinking that it was written by a teenager taking his favourite parts from shounen shows he's seen stuffing it into this. Most of the things happening do not make any sense whatsoever.Was about to drop this but after watching three episodes, I...somehow stuck through with it and I half don't regret it.
