Slam Dunk: Ketsui no Shouhoku Basket-bu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52159/Slam_Dunk__Ketsui_no_Shouhoku_Basket-bu,"['Just a recap episode from the first half of the show. I could only find half of it on Youtube with auto translate. You do not need to watch it. The art style is the same as the rest of the series.I gave it a 6/10 because it is okay but you will not need a refresher if you are watching the series in a timely fashion anyways. It also is extremely hard to find and not worth the quality that you may find it in. There are no new scenes, just a short scene where Kogure is writing in his diary when thinking...of Sakuragi and Rukawa. of Sakuragi and Rukawa.']"

Road to You,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36492/Road_to_You,"[""This is a short, so I wrote a short review.Very cute face expressions, and outstanding art as expected from Kenichi Tsuchiya, who was involved in the animating of Kimi no Na wa and Kotonoha No Niwa. It's only 3 mins 29 secs long, but the work put into it is much greater.The most surprising part was that this is supposed to be a promotional short for Dunlop's tires, but until 2:05 there is no indication that it is one. I was pretty happy that it didn't only show boring tires for most of the short.The use of light and reflections was really good. They...incorporated the 3 stories pretty well, considering the short amount of time.Overall a 9, don't expect too much from this like as if it's  masterpiece. It's just good in my opinion anyway. Recommend to watch for anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai's art. incorporated the 3 stories pretty well, considering the short amount of time.Overall a 9, don't expect too much from this like as if it's  masterpiece. It's just good in my opinion anyway. Recommend to watch for anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai's art."", 'Another short review, I suppose. Also, TLDR belowWell, this was pretty good.I will get into this by first saying that each of these commercials does have a story to be told within them. I won\'t explain what happens in them, because the synopsis does that for me already, rather, if they are executed well.All three stories generally use the same setup of quickly setting up the characters, so much so that it can be deciphered as to what the are doing via their lives and the current events around them with little effort. The only sad story you get out of those this however is...""The Snow that Dances in Memories"", the rest are somewhat happier. Basically, there is variety in here as opposed to the same formula being spewed out continuously, there is something for everyone I guess. I think the third story was the worst, just because of the handling of characters, and the need for it to be somewhat bombastic, but it is not bad.With visuals, for some reason, they are inconsistent, nothing is bad, but the difference between the first two and the last one is obvious. The first two feel like something out of a slightly watered down Shinkai movie, whereas the last one feels very abstract and bold. Nothing bad, I liked both, but I have no idea why the change happened, felt kinda awkward.I enjoyed this as a little story to watch I suppose, I would imagine most people do, I don\'t really ever see hate on anime-style commercials, so if you are here, you will most likely enjoy this.TLDR: Watch this. It is good as a commercial.-----But this is not the real reason we watch these, it is so that we can vroom vroom into our loved ones with super special awesome Dunlop Tyres Winter Maxx tire line edition thingy.""Drive to the one you love"", as they say.

Sacred Seven,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10156/Sacred_Seven,"['""Haste makes waste.""Entertainment is a cut throat industry, and while every studio and publisher scrabbles around in a desperate search for the next big thing, they must continue to make ends meet in some way. When it comes to anime this is usually achieved by creating a one season adaptation of an existing manga, game or light novel, and the aim of these shows isn\'t simply to generate revenue, but also to test the market for potential franchises. There are other methods though, one of which is to string together several well known base concepts, add something resembling a story, and release the finished article...as an ""original"" work.Now while the latter method can produce some very good titles, more often than not the results are ... underwhelming.Sacred Seven follows the exploits of Tandoji Alma, a seventeen year old high school student who leads a solitary life on the outskirts of a port city. One night he sees a ship on fire in the harbour, and whatever has caused the incident also triggers a reaction in him, one that he desperately fights off. The next evening Aiba Ruri, the CEO of the Aiba Foundation, pays him a visit in an attempt to recruit him, and she seems to know more about his secret than he does.One of the problems with bringing together several ""popular"" themes is that all too often something fundamental is sacrificed in the process, and that\'s pretty much what happens here. The plot may initially seem interesting, but once the story gets going it quickly becomes clear just how rushed this show actually is. In addition to this there\'s a distinct methodology to the composition of the series, almost as if director Ohashi Yoshimitsu and writer Yoshida Shin adopted a ""check-box"" approach. Unfortunately this brings the major issues to the fore, one of those being the rather obvious drive to include certain scenes and events - some of which have no bearing on the story. There\'s also an automatic limitation placed on the narrative, and while the lack of imagination and creativity is palpable, it\'s the knock-on effect on the development of both the plot and the characters that really stands out.In contrast to the lacklustre storyline Sunrise appear to have done a half-decent job with the visuals, and there\'s some interesting design work on display - especially where the monsters are concerned. The animation is a little on the utilitarian side, but there\'s a surprising fluidity and range of movement during many of the action scenes. In addition to this the characters are well realised, but this is tempered by the fact that they\'re also rather mundane and a little too reliant on certain stereotypes. This is also reflected in the banality of the settings and background imagery, and these factors attest to the speed with which this anime was completed.Sadly, these aren\'t the biggest problems with the visuals.There are several errors that any sort of basic quality control would quickly spot and rectify, one of those occurring at an auction in England where Aiba is bidding on a new gem. The auctioneer clearly states the closing price is £990,000, but the display reads £9,900,000, and while this may seem like nit-picking, it\'s the ridiculousness of the mistake that lowers the viewer\'s expectations of the show.That said, the auctioneer does have one of the best British accents in anime, but that\'s one of the few high points where the acting is concerned.No amount of preparation or talent can resolve the problems with a script that, like several other aspects of Sacred Seven, is too reliant on what has gone before. While the actors try to do the best they can, it seems to have been impressed upon them that their characters should speak or behave in certain ways. The dialogue is far too manufactured, and with little in the way of natural flow to balance conversations, this results in some severely wooden performances.The strange thing is that the music seems to have received more care and attention than any other part of this anime, with much of the background music being well suited and choreographed to the on-screen action.To many people it can seem as though Sacred Seven features two opening and three ending themes, when in truth all that happens until the end of the final episode is that the first OP and ED swap places. ""Stone Cold"" by FictionJunction is quite the upbeat techno track, and the opening animated sequence does a good job of introducing the main players whilst being stylized enough to be eye-catching. The second theme, ""Kiseki"" by Nanri Yuuka, is a more traditional blend of J-pop/rock, and its accompanying animation is well choreographed and suitably heroic. As for the third track, ""Tsunagaru Made"" by Nakajima Megumi is a much quieter song that plays out at the conclusion of the final episode..Now some of you may have noticed that there has been no mention of ending sequences. The reason for this is simply because Sunrise, like so many other studios, don\'t think it\'s worth the effort of making a decent one, and aside from some spinning jewel thingies in the first ED, both rely on still images.Strangely enough, this sentiment also appears to ring true where the characters are concerned, although admittedly part of this is due to the check-box approach taken by the director and the series writer. This is a heavily manufactured anime, and this fact becomes very clear when one considers not just the portrayal of each character, but the manner in which they develop as well. While it\'s true that Alma grows more than anyone else, the simple fact is that he starts the series as nothing more than a blank sheet with little to no personality, and given that situation it\'s very easy to make the character appear more defined by the end of the story. Sacred Seven uses age old methods to ensure this happens, including Alma\'s solitary lifestyle, hidden power and traumatic past.Throw in some alien meteorites and you\'re supposedly on to a winner.On the other hand Ruri is rather well defined from the beginning, but alongside this is the fact that she doesn\'t really change at all over the course of the anime. The only supporting character to receive any kind of back story is her personal butler Kagami Makoto, but aside from giving the viewer a reason for his dedication to the Aiba family, he remains nothing more than a stereotype (you know, the intelligent, dark haired guy with glasses who\'s always stern and serious).Everyone else is treated as narrative furniture, and given that Sacred Seven attempts to include some kind of human drama, this is nothing short of wasteful.Even with its many flaws, Sacred Seven is still  a surprisingly watchable series, and Onigawara offers some genuine moments of amusement that break up the monotony. While it falls just short of being ""no-brain entertainment"", the simple fact is that the heavily manufactured storyline and characters make it both familiar and easy to follow. Unfortunately the price of this is that far too many questions remain unanswered by the end of the anime, which is a shame as there were a few interesting ideas that really should have been given more detail. The sad part is that if more time had been given over to developing the series before it hit production, many of its issues could have been resolved - but as everyone knows, anime is a serious business.One of the most basic rules of storytelling is that it should never be rushed, but in a world where time is money, such sentiments are normally viewed as idealistic nonsense. as an ""original"" work.Now while the latter method can produce some very good titles, more often than not the results are ... underwhelming.Sacred Seven follows the exploits of Tandoji Alma, a seventeen year old high school student who leads a solitary life on the outskirts of a port city.

Writing a review about it is even worse because it makes me think about it harder than watching it.STORY: 1 (Pathetic)This show has no direction. Main character automatically has hidden powers from the get-go, of which the origins are glossed over within a few minutes and we are just expected to accept it. He fights to... Fight... And save... Something... Because the Darkstones (the enemies in this show) are... Evil? Because... They just are. Really. There\'s nothing to this at all. I\'m not expecting a deep...plot out of a show like this, but having a point to fighting is usually pretty important.ART: 5 (Mediocre)The art\'s not bad, but it\'s far from anything different than the other shows airing around this time. It\'s just the same plain-Jane stuff we\'ve seen so many times already, and even if it\'s too high an expectation to expect this show to ""break the mold"", it certainly isn\'t beautiful on it\'s own. Just okay.SOUND: 3 (Poor)I\'m being nice here. The music is repetitive, and doesn\'t change much from a slow, relaxing scene to a fast-paced action scene. It lacks real dynamics. For what little it does have, I at least acknowledged it by not rating it ""pathetic"".CHARACTER: 2 (Dreadful)The characters are cookie-cutter and bland, but more-so than your typical shounen. There\'s been literally no thought put into any of them which is evident even if you give it up to 5 episodes to establish itself like I did. After all, that\'s one episode shy of the halfway point. They could have done better than this.ENJOYMENT: 1 (Pathetic)To me, this is the most important part of watching anime: how much you enjoy it. Watching this show has been a chore. It\'s been extremely boring, but I kept giving it a chance. After last episode\'s train-wreck, I\'m finally out of second chances. It\'s actually a relief not to have to subject to myself to this garbage week after week anymore. It\'s just so boring, and considering they\'re going for an action anime here, that\'s just sad.OVERALL: 3 (Poor)There\'s worse anime out there, but only just. This is pretty bad, but I was generous in giving it a 3 rather than a 2, only because gg\'s ""White and Dirty"" OP replacement made me chuckle. That\'s not even a credit to the show itself since the original creators weren\'t even able to make me chuckle with the original content, but I\'m a nice guy, so I\'ll pretend it was them.Stay away from this show. It\'s garbage and a complete waste of time. Bandai and Sunrise should want to wash their hands of this. plot out of a show like this, but having a point to fighting is usually pretty important.ART: 5 (Mediocre)The art\'s not bad, but it\'s far from anything different than the other shows airing around this time.

Scryed came out 10 years ago, that\'s a whole damn decade. That show was a masterpiece, it took every aspect of its genre and executed them perfectly. The story was straight to the point and didn\'t have any bullshit to weigh it down. No titties, no robots, no girlymen, no school setting, no overelaborate art direction, no holes, no filler, no extraneous characters, etc; it was a super power fighting show about people who beat the shit out of things and were proud to have that privilege. It was truly Sunrise\'s greatest work of its kind.That\'s one...reason why they\'re re-releasing it for its 10th birthday.The other is to show how secretly ashamed of themselves they are for what they\'re making nowadays: Sacred Seven.>>>This is a review of my impressions from the first episode. If you have gripes akin to ""oh man, you can\'t review the merit of a whole show from one episode!"", well I say ""The hell I can\'t."" First episodes are important. They set the tone for series and generally give a good idea for what you\'re getting into. Have some great shows had bad first episodes? Yeah, but this show is not Baccano, or DRRR!!, or Gungrave. It\'s another vapid and shallow merchandising action series by Sunrise.Sacred Seven is a superpower fightan\' series for the new decade, and it\'s a piece of shit. It takes all of the genre-polish Scryed applied a decade ago and does away with it. The show\'s about a 10-foot tall, YuGiOh-haired, noodly wuss named Arma, who spends a majority of his day staring out the generic Japanese classroom window from his back-right desk and eating on the school\'s rooftop. Everyone thinks he\'s dangerous, because none of the tertiary characters in this show have the perceptive abilities to tell what a loser he is. When he gets all mad he turns into a really lame ripoff of Knight Blazer, and then some loli uses a plot device to turn him into a really lame ripoff of Megaman.Joining him is the aforementioned otaku hug pillow model Ruri, a mysterious, wealthy, secret organization-leading magical lolita who changes into a new fabulous outfit in every scene. And she\'s an exchange student who pops up in the student council too, truly a jack of all pandering. She has a generic butler guy with glasses and a clunky mecha who\'ll gratefully accept the role as the series\' jobber. And then there are the copy/pasted worthless schoolgirl characters, the wisecracking mascot thing, the rival that looks like Soul Taker and an army of French maids to increase the show\'s DVD sales.Basically the story is ""So there\'s this kid with superpowers that he doesn\'t want because he\'s a pussy, so some magic chick makes his powers heroic and then they fight monsters while dealing with school shenanigans on the side."" It\'s really sad how poorly thought out and boring this is, it\'s like something that a B-company would\'ve released in the 90\'s that everyone immediately forgot about. There\'s really no reason for a show this bland to exist today, especially when it\'s coming off the heels of Tiger&Bunny, a far more refreshing and interesting show by the same studio that\'s in the same damn genre.The animation is smooth, but not impressive. There were no particularly memorable or striking scenes, which is horrible for a big budget first episode. The characters are drawn very CLAMPy, and pretty much all of the designs are boring and forgettable. The main girls boobs vary greatly in size depending on the scene, outfit and camera angle, I guess that\'s Sunrise\'s way of appealing to all kinds of deviants without introducing more than one important female character.The OP sucks. The ED sucks. Both are generic-as-hell synthy J-pop tunes that don\'t bode well for the show ever developing a serious or masculine tone. The opening animation is basically Star Driver\'s first OP without any decent art direction. The rest of the audio is just as underwhelming, there are no catchy badass action BGMs here, and nothing uses any instruments or sounds that are out of the ordinary. The voices are lame, everyone sounds basically how you\'d expect them to, except for Arma who\'s less intimidating than Star Driver\'s ""GINGA BISHOUNEN!"".To sum it up, Sacred Seven:-Shits on everything Scryed did for the genre.-Is basically Code Geass with no hook.-Is directly competing with Tiger&Bunny, a similar show that\'s better in every way by the same studio. Not to mention the upcoming Scryed OVAs too.I don\'t have much hope for this series. If it turns out better than a unanimous 6/10, I\'ll be very surprised.Update of 2014: It should be noted that this series has a median review score of 6/10 and below.

Damn I\'m good.', 'Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman star as two detectives who investigate a series of murders relating to the seven deadly sins, like wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. They discover that these series of murders are conducted by Kevin Spacey who plays a hardcore Christian who\'s only trying to do God\'s holy work and........wait? This isn\'t Se7en? You mean, we aren\'t watching the David Fincher movie? Oh, you want me to review SACRED Seven, not Se7en. Oh, okay.Alright, let\'s talk Sacred Seven. Now, let\'s say you\'re a producer at Studio Sunrise and you are asked to produce an anime for the Summer of...2011 Schedule. What do you do?Why, remake Scryed of course! With Code Geass visuals!Now, Sacred Seven is basically that: An updated version of Scryed with the appeal of Code Geass. It\'s pretty much one of those dumb things you get while you\'re at a meeting room brainstorming for an idea. It\'s like a cupcake. It\'s sweet and might get you fat, but it looks really good.The story  revolves around Squal...i mean Alma Tandoji (voiced by Takuma Terashima), an outcast high schooler who gains the power of the ""Sacred Seven"", which is used to defeat Darkstones. Darkstones are pretty much the tamer equivalent of Angels, except they have the bodies of rocks. His power is so strong that she is summoned by a socialite named Ruri Alba(voiced by Megumi Nakajima) to help her defeat these Darkstones once and for all.And while he\'s not defeating Darkstones, he spends most of his days looking for rocks on a river with the help of The Rock Club, led by a ""rock otaku"" named Itou.As the series progresses, Alma & Ruri met with various individuals using these Darkstones like Kenbi Yuuji(voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi), a multi-millionaire and Knight Kijima(voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto), a former lab patient-turned-fugitive. It also delves deeper into Alma and Ruri\'s relationship as well.The story is really stupid, and when it has filler episodes, it goes into boring slice of life tropes. It also has the laziest writing in a Sunrise anime, and the fight scenes are filled with bad pacing and thus you are unable to care about what is happening during those scenes. It\'s weak, and proves how lazy and rushed this series is.The characters in this series varied from ""Boring"" to ""boring"". Seriously, Alma wants ""to turn into a rock"" because he is one, and he is such a bore in this series, along with almost everyone else in this series. The closest thing we have to interesting characters are SP and Ruri most of the time. And SP is nothing more than Kenbi\'s subordinate so when a suppoorting character with less than 5 minutes of screen time is more interesting than most of the main characters, then you\'ll know something is wrong with this series.And Miyu Irino plays an asshole battle butler who\'s pretty useless in the ""battle"" part of it. And he\'s only there to ramp up the fujoshi potential between him, Knight and Alma for the next Comiket.But, the good thing about this series is the visuals. They are beautiful, and it pretty much uses Yuriko Chiba\'s work to it\'s full potential. It\'s great to look at and it has elements of scenery porn here and there. Now, i heard that the budget for Tiger & Bunny got halved for the animation of this series which causes lots of controversy, but i\'m kind of neutral in this issue so i don\'t want to go further into that.The character design is really cool. Alma resembles a certain Final Fantasy character, but he is well-drawn for a character without an interesting personality. But i love how Ruri is drawn. She\'s a loli, but she is not drawn like one. Instead, she is drawn in a way that she doesn\'t resemble a loli at all. I like that kind of design, because it\'s rare since most lolis nowadays look like stock character designs taken from a JC Staff artbook.And the music in this is what kept me from dropping this show. I love listening to the music, especiallythe OP which sounds like the classy 90\'s Techno/Trance tunes i used to listen back during my rave days. And it also has amazing orchestra scores which are pretty fitting for this series. The OP is composed by Yuki Kajiura, and the full score is done by Toshihiko Sahashi, so you know that the budget also goes to it\'s amazing music.And to be fair, this series manages to be humble with itself and not make it cringeworthy for the viewer. because atleast it doesn\'t turn into another shallow vanity project like Star Driver. Even with it\'s flashy visuals, character design and music it\'s pretty good that SUnrise manages to not make it another Star Driver or Code Geass in both production and marketing aspects, because if it does then it\'d suck. It\'s already low on the character and story aspects so let\'s not go lower and turn this into another Brain Powered.Overall, Sacred Seven is a rushed project that was conceived out of Yajime Hatate\'s ass. It\'s filled with a stupid story and uninteresting characters but it does have a great score and amazing visuals. Will i recommend it? Well, it\'s okay but i\'d prefer you guys to watch the fansubbed version of this series instead of an official sub/dub release. Fansubbers have done a fun job with this series, like replacing the OP with Gangsta Rap music for example. the fansubs are trolltastic. And if troll fansubs are your thing, then this series might be for you to accompany the great visuals and musical score that comes with it. 2011 Schedule. What do you do?Why, remake Scryed of course! With Code Geass visuals!Now, Sacred Seven is basically that: An updated version of Scryed with the appeal of Code Geass. It\'s pretty much one of those dumb things you get while you\'re at a meeting room brainstorming for an idea. It\'s like a cupcake. It\'s sweet and might get you fat, but it looks really good.The story  revolves around Squal...i mean Alma Tandoji (voiced by Takuma Terashima), an outcast high schooler who gains the power of the ""Sacred Seven"", which is used to defeat Darkstones.

With its retro-vibe, Sacred Seven tries to stand out from the crowd astedically. However, it also goes to show that it takes more than aesthetics to make a show something truly special.The story is simple superhero hijinks following one Alma Tandogi, a rather intimidating looking outcast who has inhuman powers, and keeps to himself because of them. He spends most of his free time searching for a purple gemstone in a river, a keepsake of his late mother he had lost...in a bullying indecent. His life takes a turn when pretty billionaire heiress (and obvious romantic interest) Ruri Alma enters his life. She asks him to lend her his power and fight monsters called Darkstones.The premise here is pretty basic stuff. The show sets itself up to be exactly what it is, a monster-of-the-week bash 'em  up. As the show progresses and new characters are introduced, there is of course a healthy amount of plot twists and developments. Unfortunately, these are wildly predictable and cliche; enemies with less-than-villainous goals, allies with shady intentions, really nothing we haven't seen several times before. Without a doubt, the plot is the weakest aspect of the show. The only saving grace is that the show has no pretenses of being deep or complex. The creative team knew that the plot was run-of-the-mill and did the smart thing; they play plot-twists straightforward, and don't ramp up the melodrama to a ridiculous degree. They made a show that simply strives to be a good blood-pumping action, and didn't try to make it something it is not; there is something admirable about that. Still, that doesn't change the fact that the plot is as cliche and predictable as they come.The characters are unfortunately as equally unremarkable. Alma is the misunderstood loner with a good heart; Ruri is the good-natured girl who sees Alma for who he is and yearns to be closer to him, and that about sums up their personalities. They're by no means unlikable characters but there is just nothing complex or remarkable about them. The rest of the cast follows suit; a bunch of static stereotypes, from Ruri's butler Makoto Kagami, to Alma's brooding adversary Knight Kinjima. There are bits of character development like Alma opening up to others, and an emotional punch every now and then, but they're not enough to make the characters any more interesting. Oh, and then of course there is the token mascot character Hellbrick, who uses the word 'hell' in every statement he utters.The main draw here are the shows technical merits, specifically in the action sequences. The animation in the fight scenes is fluid, and exciting to watch. The music pumps up the excitement. Then, of course, there are the retro-tastic  character designs for Alma and other combatants, which recall anime action heroes of the 70's like Casshern  and Tekkaman. All in all, some very good fight scenes in the show, though outside of that, Sacred Seven isn't all that impressive on the technical-side either. Character designs and backgrounds for Alma and companies everyday lives are pretty standard, not at all bad, but ultimately won't leave a lasting impression, and the same can be said about the music.In the end, Sacred Seven isn't really a bad show, but it isn't a particularly good show either. It is a fun action show, and that is all it really tries to be. If that is all you need in a show then you might even like this. However, if you are looking for a gripping plot or compelling characters,  it is best to look elsewhere. in a bullying indecent.

I'm going to be honest: it went a little downhill from there. But then I saw the final episode. And I sat back on my chair thinking of the awesomeness I just witnessed. Seriously, if you start this anime you have got to finish it till the end. I mean that.In the opening we see Tandoji riding his tiny motorcycle in the most badass way possible and FictionJunction singing a fitting song. First impressions are important, and this show managed to give a good one.About the story;...very funny, but lacks a little more depth. However, it is still a little too early to say such a thing (who knows what will happen in the next episodes!). Everything is exaggerated to the max, with maid soldiers and a butler in the organization, and a top secret research facility in the mountains. Just to my liking!Art is the same as Code Geass, and I have absolutely no objections to that. As I said before, the opening is awesome. The music really gives off the feeling that you are watching a superhero movie. Splendid work, also I love how they switched the opening with the ending halfway through the series.Anyway, people shouldn't get so frustrated over this show. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it in my opinion. Sure, it has a lot of aspects that can be seen in Scryed and Code Geass, but I don't mind that one bit. After all, I loved those aspects in the original anime, and love to see them return in this anime.Yes, even the ridiculous butler's Knightmare frame is cool. very funny, but lacks a little more depth.

As the story progresses, we get to see some character development, specially from the hero, and there's...plenty of annoying dialog to point it out very explicitly, in case the audience misses it.The plot isn't specially complex, but the exposition is a bit jumbled, so don't be surprised if you don't quite get why some characters act the way they do, or struggle to remember one of the made-up terms they throw around. And the confusion will last for a while, because the main story advances slowly, frequently interrupted by relationship-building and plain high-school-anime filler.In spite of its flaws, the show has its good moments.

If you're intresed in watching it but not sure if you would like this, please read this review and be advised ^^STORYAs I mentioned before the story is rather unique, the name of the anime stands for the power of 7 mysterious stones that once scattered. Thanks to Ruri's sacred power, Alma is the only person that is able to use all the power of the 7 stones as 1, he fights the other Dark Stones with help of Ruri's maids and Kagami.The story is as you can see, a...lil lame and unoriginal. However it's so mysterious after a few episodes that it kept me watching till the end.ARTI honestly think the art is pretty good, however at some points the characters are drawed totally different, it makes me wonder a little bit why. The eye colours are big + in this anime thought.SOUNDThe opening/ending theme are switched after the first 6 episodes. I honestly think both songs are very good and match the anime. What I absolutely disliked was the eyecatch music thought. It was long and it made it sound like this anime was amazing, this was a big minus for me.CHARACTERWell you will either like the characters or absolutely dislike them. Alma's sometimes a bit unreasonable but at the other side he's also pretty cool. Then again he's unreasonable, repeat repeat >_>, Ruri is pretty sweet but especially at the start she seems like a pushy kid that always wants it her way. Kagami... well you like him or you don't he has a rather weird personality in my opinion. The rest of the characters I don't think is worth describing, they all don't make sense.ENJOYMENTWell this is probarly one of my only + in this review, even thought the story is weird and the characters can make you incredibely angry at times, this anime kept me watching from episode 4-12 in 1 day. Why you ask? Well it's pretty exciting and you wish at this point to know all the mysteries that are playing. I do gotta say... I was happy when I finished it.OVERALLOverall if I count everything together I come at a 6.2, I guess this might be a little to high rating for this anime. As I started my review with, this is indeed something you will either love or hate. I honestly do not recommend it to people that aren't open to try something new. lil lame and unoriginal.

Quoted sentences are what I was thinking. (I\'m a big fan of Tiger&Bunny and Kuroshitsuji, just saying)Main character transforms, ""Wth since when was there a new episode of Tiger&Bunny?"".

Sebastian michaelis poped out of no where. ""WTF IS GOING ON?""

Totally unoriginal characters, feels like they don\'t even have a personality.

I could just put in ""just watch it"" and that\'s it, but I\'d rather not.  I don\'t know if this has a manga (it should) and if it does, I haven\'t read it.... so this is based on the anime only.I\'m leaving out character and enjoyment as both, to me, refer to character development of the whole anime and enjoyment refers to how I enjoyed the anime, both which I won\'t...do as it\'s just the first episode so there are still characters who haven\'t been introduced and more episodes have a high chance of changing the level of enjoyment.Story: -I\'m not going to give this any rating as its only the first episode, but just gonna rant on a bit on what I\'ve witnessed.There\'s nothing that I haven\'t seen before. Guy gets power, monster attacks, guy fights monster and defeats it. Though generic, it was pretty cool. It\'s not as if the action was hesitated for later episodes or anything.It was pretty much this.... but covered in terminology specific to the anime. But basically.. that\'s what happened. I do think they may have put a bit too much terminology in for the first episode, and I found it a bit hard to follow. But that could just be me being slow.When Alma (main protagonist) first showed his powers, I was excited for some story where he has to deal with this insanity or something along those lines... but then it was killed quickly as that power was erased and replaced with something of a digimon/megaman ripoff.Art: 5What disappointed me was the art in this anime. I don\'t know if it was just the style or whatever, but to me it looked like something out of a 2006 anime. Which isn\'t too bad... but if you compare it to the other eye-candy anime that came out this year... this one is definitely at the bottom. That being said, I still put up with it.-Edit, this might have just been the quality I watched in, checked up on a better quality one, it does look pretty good, but I\'ve still seen better.

The 2011 batch has had it's fair share of hits and misses so far which is understandable. Each Studio has the opportunity and resources to provide the viewers with content that ranges to the appeal of any kind of Anime fan. It's no wonder Sunrise has made it where they are now looking back at previous successes (Wolf's Rain, Cowboy Bebop, Planetes, etc...).Sacred Seven however, is something Sunrise can learn from in the following...years. At first, it seemed natural to put faith in something as hyped and worked on with top quality production. Heck, the first episode had enough room to expand the show and give reason to call it above average material. Veterans will immediately acknowledge this as an average, cliche, done to death premise; looking back at every episode, there's plenty to question when it comes to plot/characters.The best way for me to describe how this turned out, is that this felt like watching James Cameron's Avatar. At least, in the sense that Sunrise's A-team were put to work on Sacred Seven while their B-team put out the more successful Tiger and Bunny. One unnecessary trope that surprisingly managed not to drag this down so much was the maid army seeing as their role under Ruri's command wasn't given focus.Tandoji fits the role as the protagonist, but doesn't deliver the drive and unique quirks to help him stand out in this moderately bland cast. Looking at him will just remind you of someone out of Code Geass. While the actual show's visuals were pleasant all-around, it doesn't excuse how this story fell short. Questions are left unanswered, characters are motivated under circumstances that aren't logical, and this fails to leave you with a resounding reason to be invested in everything that's happening. There's no over-arcing theme or message that hasn't already been done better before.Now I'm not upset at Sunrise for the result of Sacred Seven, I don't regret watching it, and from here I can only hope that we can learn that an Anime doesn't need to look pretty to be considered remarkable.

It's the guy who's afraid of his power coming to terms with it and fighting (from what I can tell in one episode).  Nothing groundbreaking, but based on what I've seen, it looks like they are going to do it well.I like the art.  It feels very much like Scryed, but hopefully the story will be better (sorry if you liked...the Scryed anime, but the story went to crap about halfway through...read the manga.  It's a hundred times better).  Personally, I'm happy with the art and style of this anime.  And the fanservice is tasteful (there are girls in maid uniforms, but it's not over the top...I can't believe I just justified a maid uniform).Can't say much for character since it's just started, but I am genuinely interested in the characters, particularly Arma (or Alma).  I like where they've started with him and I like the characters around him.Overall, I think this looks like an enjoyable series.  The style is similar to Scryed, but my fingers are crossed that the story is better. the Scryed anime, but the story went to crap about halfway through...read the manga.

It was BETTER than what I expected and if you have read the two and watched it, you will agree with me. The story was honestly good in my opinion especially since it was what I was looking for when I was trying to watch this...anime - A action focused anime with some romance. Maybe I'm influenced to like this anime by the fact that they used Jewel-like rocks and I'm a sucker for pretty looking gems :DAlso, the story is very good with how it starts out and there is a good rising action to the climax as well as a good resolution although they could've ended the anime with a kiss or something :POne thing I've noticed for myself while watching this anime is that I've never skipped over a part of felt bored at one part. If I haven't particularly skipped a part, that means there weren't any super cheesy parts, and I hate cheesy parts xDArt 8:I honestly have no idea what the art can get below a 8 because I thought it was fantastic. Take Ruri for example, she's hella cute :O The fight scenes look pretty good with nice effects and everything and it's easy to tell what's happening in every scene.Sound 7:I'm not counting the OP and ED of course but I will say that they weren't the best, and not the worst. It is true that they use a lot of the same track for the scenes but they match the scenario pretty decently.Character 9:Alright honestly, I loved the characters mainly the heroine. She was cute - both in art and the way she acted. The main character, Alma, was pretty decent too. One thing I mainly liked about him is the character development I saw in him - which given a 12 Episode anime, was very good. The butler, meh he's not bad; the maids... they're a bonus :OAlso, all the other characters were decent looking and as for the fights, they had high quality too.If I had to say something, the antagonist of the story was the worst part I should say.Enjoyment 9:I. ENJOYED. IT. PERIOD. and I matter, therefore, it is good.Overall 9:Umm It is true that I have never given any anime/manga I've read below the rating of 5~6. Mostly because if I've read it, then I've liked it and I'm quite generous in rating them. But this anime was actually quite good - surpassing my expectations.

Agreed the plot isn't all that but all in all this anime offers some great mindless entertainment. And I have a sneaking suspicion that with some parts they were taking the piss :)Does every detail really need to be explained and elaborated ? nah....Sometimes i just want something thats easy to digest and looks good. This is it.Loved the artwork especially the fight sequences and armours. The characters were cool or cute.For some light late night entertainment this  is great. "", 'I really should have seen the warning signs with this show. I had high hopes for a over-the-top Sunrise action series with faaaaabulous costumes and amazing fights. Sacred Seven delivered all of those things buried inside an insipid high school anime. It had all the theoretical ingredients for a fantastic series, but failed on the execution. For a show that revolves around gemstones and rocks, Sacred Seven has a weak foundation.The story starts off with a call-to-action for the hero, Alma Tandouj, to fight against the Darkstones that threaten the general population. Alma has the power of the Sacred Seven unlocked when he meets Ruri...Aiba, a wealthy young girl set out to destroy the Darkstones and save her sister from a state of deep sleep. For now the setup of the series forms a standard formula: hero meets girl, girl unlocks powers, and they go fighting monsters  together. There’s additional subplots thrown in about the history of the butler that serves her or how her sister is frozen in a crystal or why Alma has all these anger issues, but I never make any connection to the characters from these side stories.Bear in mind, the characters are all incredibly shallow. They’re one-dimensional stock characters who motivations and personalities can be summarized in two or three sentences. There’s the main character with the dark past, the forgotten childhood friend who likes the main character and does everything to support him, the butler who was taught to have pledge everlasting loyalty, the ditzy girl who tries to make everyone happy, the brooding antagonist with equally dark past, the ally who’s actually a villain, etc.Honestly, my favorite character was Hellbrick, and that was because he was the only one to put any emotion into his lines. He was a brick who could talk and that alone served to be more interesting than the rest of the characters. At one point, we find out that there is some suspicious research conducted by the “friendly” scientist guy, and part of the episode develops the ambiguity on whether the patient or the scientist is telling the truth. I got excited at the first possibly of character complexity before the scientist is revealed to be evil and begins doing evil things for evil’s sake. This is not how antagonists are supposed to be created. Sacred Seven isn’t trying particularly hard to come off as a children’s show, but it certainly will rely on the mechanics of one to get through the series.The pacing of the series was a serious issue as well. Initially, I had the impression that Sacred Seven would fall into the monster-of-the-week routine with a new Sacred Seven power revealed. (I’m assuming there were seven of them.) The first few episodes are packed with action, and all of a sudden, we’re slammed with another school festival or beach episode to break it up. Don’t get me wrong. The fights are gorgeously animated and very well done. The problem is that everything else that surrounds the scene is just boring. Sometimes, I just feel unsympathetic to what the characters are experiencing. Sometimes, I have no idea what they’re doing. The direction of the series just meanders around between a few monsters and encounters before pulling a super-villain card in the end to up the stakes. In the final battle, I got the impression that the writers remember that there were several powers they hadn’t gotten the chance to use yet, so they tacked on layers of scenarios for the hero to use them.The series is average overall. The story and characters aren’t terribly exciting and full of flaws while the action scenes are visually pleasing. The ingredients to make an excellent series were all here, but Sunrise somehow slipped when putting it all together. And this is baffling when looking at the animation quality of the episodes. Good money was put into animating the fight scenes especially, enough to the point where it makes me wonder how much money was pulled from the other departments to pay for it. For any other studio, I’d consider the series a wash and move on. However, this is Sunrise, as in they-make-the-Gundam-series Sunrise, as in Code-Geass Sunrise, as in Cowboy-freaking-Bebop Sunrise, as in the-studio-that-excels-at-making-excellent-mech-and-fighting-animes Sunrise.

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!]Before taking on Sacred Seven, I’ve read of many critiques about it. Though there were a minority number of people who liked/loved the anime, there was a majority of those who did not. Even on YouTube, when I took a glance at their opening song by FictionJunction, comments stated that the Stone Cold awesomeness didn’t complement the awful plot Sacred Seven had.Well, that was what I heard, but decided to take it on anyway.I must say that the anime wasn’t that bad. Certainly, it wasn’t those kind that will make one go WOW! or OMG! type of...anime. In fact, it was a pretty average type of anime. Those type that will have a new different bad-guy minion every episode sort-of thing. This was a wait-and-see-what-happens anime. Honestly, there was never anything that stood out and it didn’t leave me dying to see what happens next.What I pretty much like was the artwork, animation and the character interactions the characters had. Makoto Kagami is totally a combination of Sebastian from Kuroshitsuji (butler-like figure and hair colour) and Sugata from Star Driver (hairstyle). When they first introduced Kenmi, it was kinda obvious that he was the main antagonist, no less. I thought Knight was pretty sweet with that smexy body that the show keeps emphasizing on. Personally, I loved Alma’s and Knight’s outfit, both light and dark. I thought that was very cool.Now for the plot. It was pretty confusing for me at first, but I guess, once i’ve watched more episodes, more pieces fit the puzzle. The Sacred Seven’s cores reside within Alma, Ruri, Knight, Fei, Aoi, Hon, (assuming that it’s Sacred Seven, shouldn’t there be one more character with the core?), regardless of whether they possess the light or dark core. On their own, they can transform into cool body-mech suits that gives them some kind of power. Alma, being a dark core, loses control when transforms into his original form. This leads him to require Ruri’s assistance in merging lightstones into him whenever he needs to transform to let him fight. In the finale, my guess is that Alma’s core turned from dark to light, Knight’s core was absorbed by stupid Kenmi, and Fei turned into the almost-gonna-destroy-the-world antagonist.Actually, I thought the finale’s twist from Kenmi to Fei was a good try to make the story different, but I felt that the story lacked the proper build-up going into the finale.Overall, the anime series was rather alright. Personally, I’d give it a 6/10. I feel that if you have absolutely nothing to do, and you wanna waste your time watching some anime after you’ve watched all the awesome cool anime series in the world already, then i recommend Sacred Seven. Honestly, I feel that calling this anime ‘horrible’, ‘awful’, ‘bad’, ‘mediocre’, etc, is a bit too much. It wasn’t SOOOO bad, the show had it’s plus points too. ^^ I enjoyed the series even though it didn’t have that X-factor in the plot. :)Side-note: The series reminded me of Bones Studio’s Star Driver Kagayaki no Takuto. The main guy character, the main girl character, the other main guy character who is supposed to be with the girl before the other came along. Takuto-Wako-Sugata much? XD Star Driver was actually something like Sacred Seven, with the every-episode-new-bad-guy-minion-to-destroy. The major difference is that Star Driver was unique in many aspects of their plot that was original and outstanding. There was the X-factor, the element of intense suspense in every episode and this quote “Expect the Unexpected” certainly describes Star Driver. I feel that if Sacred Seven had continued with more episodes with a deeper breathtaking plot baseline, I feel that it will pull it off.Fav male character: Makoto KagamiFav female character: == none == but if i need to say, it’ll be WakanaBest character in Sacred Seven: Hellbrick~*【★】Chione Ice Dyrken【★】*~ anime.

Honestly this just didn't have any grab or lasting feel to it.

A laid back series, full of stereotypes that tributes various shows of the past. It supposed to be running mostly on nostalgia that anything else, and in all honesty it made a crappy job at it. Everything is completely random and uninspired, plus nothing is focused upon enough for us to care.PRODUCTION VALUESIt feels like a whole fortune was wasted on making artwork and animation...as detailed and smooth as a tv series allows. The transformation scenes, and the battle choreographies eat most action shows for breakfast. Sadly that is far from calling the presentation successful, as it is unfocused and messy. The school backgrounds and the character designs feel detrimental and become boring right away. The battles, as spectacular as they may feel, last way too little and you are never meant to feel the hero can lose if he has seven hax powers in his disposal. No matter how many maid suits and silly robot designs they threw on screen, there was simply nothing behind them to excuse the overall randomness. The soundtrack is made up of forgettable pop pieces and voice acting is ok, although there is nothing in it that would allow the actors to perform any better even if they wanted.SCRIPTThe story is as basic as it gets, and if you happen to have seen a single superhero show while growing up you will know right away how things will play out. Some meteorites drop to Earth and have crystals which create monsters and grant superpowers to humans. Some use them in human experiments, others to protect their loved ones, blah-blah, overused stuff I see no point in elaborating any further. In practice you get the good guys goofing around in their school or mansion, before some monster of the week appears, and the protagonists heads there to defeat it with minimal effort and in less than five minutes. There is absolutely no build up or emotion to all the stuff that happen in the show, and the result is complete apathy even if you stare at monsters blowing up buildings. There is a sort of escalation in the form of the heroine’s twin sister and a villain who wants the ultimate power but they happen in such a blunt way that they fail to mean anything.CASTOh boy, you can’t have a show with more generic characters than these. Some uncaring boy with a secret power, a pretty girl who loves him right away and helps him to unlock it, magical transformations, and predictable shonen battles where the hero wants to protect his friends and wins with hax power ups. There is absolutely no attempt at fleshing them out past the obvious, plus several uniforms are downright retarded. The protagonist’s berserk form is cool but instead he prefers a geek armour with a scarf. The heroine loves to dress like an elegant loli and has an army of fighting maids. She has close to no emotions, yet has the hots for the uncaring protagonist. And so does another girl in his school, for no apparent reason. Add some avenging youths who were used in human experiments and a cardboard villain who want to take over the world and you get a nice Swiss cheese of a cast to fall asleep easier at nights.LEGACYIt is a very forgettable and passable show. You’ll have more fun rewatching Tekkaman Blade or Guyver than this most uninspired tribute to them. Even minor details, such as horns popping out of foreheads or armoured warrior flying with hoverboards is far more fun to watch in other shows (FLCL and Eureka Seven respectively).And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 8/10General Artwork 2/2 (very good production values)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 1/2 (basic and uninspired)Animation 2/2 (fluent)Visual Effects 2/2 (lots of fancy light shows)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (typical)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 3/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 1/2 (almost entirely episodic)Complexity 0/2 (seems complicating at first but it is very simple)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 3/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 1/2 (cheesy)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (messy)Catharsis 0/2 (random nonsense)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to rewatch)Memorability 1/4 (forgettable)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 1/1 (pretty lights)Sound 0/2 (sounds meh)Story 0/3 (generic as heck)Characters 0/4 (generic as heck)VERDICT: 3.5/10 as detailed and smooth as a tv series allows.

The protagonist’s berserk form is cool but instead he prefers a geek armour with a scarf. The heroine loves to dress like an elegant loli and has an army of fighting maids. She has close to no emotions, yet has the hots for the uncaring protagonist. And so does another girl in his school, for no apparent reason. Add some avenging youths who were used in human experiments and a cardboard villain who want to take over the world and you get a nice Swiss cheese of a cast to fall asleep easier at nights.LEGACYIt is a very forgettable and passable show. You’ll have more fun rewatching Tekkaman Blade or Guyver than this most uninspired tribute to them.

I wasn't sure what to expect going in the anime but it one of those that i did no skip a second.StoryPerhaps not the best part of the anime but it was enjoyable. You sort of know what to expect and it was pretty predicatable but having said that the story was thoughly enjoyable that i couldn't wait to see the next episode.ArtOustanding- i think it was done by the guy who drew Code Geass but am not sure. The...art but out brought out human action that i never though was possible.SoundThe voice actors where petty good. They did thier best to make the anime sound listenable.CharactorWell the anime charactors really drew me in. For starters the male lead physique is different from most protagists we are used to seeing. He is really tall for a male lead and is not really a wimp. The female lead is really short for a female lead and the compination of the 2 was really entertaining to watch.EnjoymentI thoughoraly enjoyed this anime. Its deffinatly i my top 5 of anime that came out this year. The only thing that disappointaed me was the fight scenes as they were too short in my opinion, like one punch and thats it. art but out brought out human action that i never though was possible.SoundThe voice actors where petty good.

Drawing recalled the ""Code Giass"", especially the main character - very similar to Lelouch. Drawing and animation - cool, the plot is likely to be dull and trite, but for the militants is not so critical. Do you like the design of a red suit, but emphatically not like the second suit. Killed the servant-maids - it is beyond insanity, this can come only in the anime.

Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51837/Saikin_Yatotta_Maid_ga_Ayashii,"['When I finished watching this anime, I immediately marked it as completed here on the site as I usually do. One thing I noticed was the average score of this anime is extremely low for what this anime has to offer the viewer.I was outraged, so I went to see the reviews to understand what was the issue that people were seeing in this anime, but I soon understood what was happening after seeing some reviews.A very peculiar pattern is that most of the negative reviews had the indication of ""preliminary"" while the positive reviews were from people who actually completed the anime. I understand...the anime is not of that incredible production level and has the appearance of being made on a very cheap budget, but that simply does not justify the low average score evaluated by users, (6.58) while I am writing this review.So before I start my real review I want to make it clear that most of the people who didn\'t recommend this anime are people who probably went through 3 or 4 episodes, fiddling with their cellphone or doing something else, since this anime has a better quality.Saikin proposal is nothing extremely complicated, on the contrary, it is something extremely simple and palatable even for a person who is not used to watching anime. Despite the proposal being simple, the execution of this anime deserves a highlight since it manages to directly give the viewer the feeling he wants to convey in a subtle way, even if nothing is happening at the moment, it gives you exactly the feeling he proposes at the moment. Our protagonist is an innocent child, it\'s cool to see him develop during the episodes, it\'s not that boring thing of ""the protagonist is there simply for the development of the work to happen."" no, it was a work made with love and thought about how it would be placed in each episode, the progression of this anime is a strong point since, on the contrary of animes that are stalled just to hold the viewer for one more episode, this anime is compact, satisfactory to see how things unfold, I haven\'t watched a work so connected with the viewer for a long time.Before you start watching, I recommend grabbing a coffee or hot chocolate and making yourself comfortable. You will have a great experience watching the course of such an unpretentious story but at the same time so nice to watch.As I mentioned before, the anime has its limitations because of a simple budget, but that doesn\'t prevent you from having some experience with the anime, on the contrary, it somehow conveys the feeling of being something directly to you. Silver Link already has a precedent of making anime style comfortable for the viewer. Just like Non Non Biyori, they got it right again. They managed to balance the ""Slice of Life"" with a progression in the story. It\'s very difficult to balance these two things since if you don\'t get the measure right, it can either become a boring anime where nothing happens, or it can turn into a chaos of information or things that don\'t give the viewer time to digest what\'s happening. Saikin manages to maintain this balance, which is another great success of the Anime, I haven\'t read the manga yet but I believe that the adaptation was exactly what the screenwriter intended when writing this story.It\'s hard to make ends meet in this anime industry, where there are big companies spending millions on production, and you\'re someone who has a great story to watch but can\'t afford the production costs. I really like it when these smaller production companies manage to do such good work even without so many opportunities.The direction is nothing extremely outstanding in the anime industry, but even so Minato Mirai managed to do something good for the viewer to watch, just like he already did with Otome Game, he brought this experience to the ""future"" and made another good work. So you can say it\'s a well-directed anime.If you asked me if this anime is worth watching, I would say yes without thinking twice. This anime is a great way to pass the time, I\'m sure you\'ll like the characters, the way they are introduced in the story and how they are carried through the eleven episodes. The story sustains itself so as not to be boring at all, on the contrary, it encourages you to continue watching. The drama is not that ""I\'m running out of ideas so we need to put on some drama"" stuff. No, the drama makes sense with the story and only adds more to the anime.Give this anime a chance! the anime is not of that incredible production level and has the appearance of being made on a very cheap budget, but that simply does not justify the low average score evaluated by users, (6.58) while I am writing this review.So before I start my real review I want to make it clear that most of the people who didn\'t recommend this anime are people who probably went through 3 or 4 episodes, fiddling with their cellphone or doing something else, since this anime has a better quality.Saikin proposal is nothing extremely complicated, on the contrary, it is something extremely simple and palatable even for a person who is not used to watching anime.

This show is not exactly the most original, though it is somewhat unique in what it does. It is also supremely enjoyable to watch and very wholesome at that, so I am not going to dunk on it too hard. It's a very SoL feeling show and if there was ever a sliver of doubt whether I want to hear Rie Takahashi in a maid role, that sliver has now been thoroughly obliterated. This show is pretty much the peak of unadultered, degenrate fan service and I love it for it. "", 'I\'ve watched only the 4 first episodes at moment. However I\'ve enjoyed it very much so far, and here is why:At first some might think that it is your typical unfunny romance comedy with bad taste. But I don\'t think so, for me this anime depicts the everyday life of a maid and her master in a very ""moe"" cute way. This is a slice of life which some might find boring, but other, like myself, find it very entertaining.The story begins with the master losing his parents and due to financial difficulties, his servants as well. He, thus chooses to take care of...the mansion by himself. Until a suspicious maid makes her appearance. This maid is very beautiful and competent which makes her even more suspicious.The whole plot of this anime is that the master, even though he finds her very suspicious, he is fond of her but because of his age, he doesn\'t get what love is. This makes him very honest and upfront towards the maid, who becomes thus easily embarrassed.This is the most interesting point to me, both characters are just enjoying themselves with very pure interactions, and are not overly embarrassed or ashamed at each interactions. But similar to real life, they have very genuine reactions. This doesn\'t create dramatic pressure but curiosity, leading to a very enjoyable entertainment.The viewer will wonder of the background of the maid which is kept secret for the moment, and the future interactions with the both characters. How they will develop their relationship, is one of the main drive of this anime.The atmosphere rendered by the plot is coupled with very fine drawing of the characters, which although not exceptional fit very well the universe. And as for the background soundtrack it is calm and relaxing, for this is the way you should enjoy the anime.I hope you who will read this review will attempt watching at least one episode of the anime, for it might very well suit your taste. the mansion by himself.

It has mild comedy in it if you like the entertaining reactions to comments the MC makes which he isn't fully aware of when he makes them because he's a pre teen kind of sheltered kid with the sub genre being romance which you know there'll never be full on romance because that would just...be plain paedophilia.With the story it doesn't really progress anywhere as it's a slice of life with no end goal but to just be a nice feel good show.The art style is nice that's used and does it's job well when it comes to characters design in the show although it doesn't do that when it comes to objects(not that the objects in the show matter too much).So I'd advise watching this is you're looking for something with mild comedy and a nice feel good feeling it gives you along with the comedy it can give. Although if you're looking for a show that shows progress and development in the storyline and characters then I'd advise to watch something else due to it not being that kind of show. be plain paedophilia.With the story it doesn't really progress anywhere as it's a slice of life with no end goal but to just be a nice feel good show.The art style is nice that's used and does it's job well when it comes to characters design in the show although it doesn't do that when it comes to objects(not that the objects in the show matter too much).So I'd advise watching this is you're looking for something with mild comedy and a nice feel good feeling it gives you along with the comedy it can give.

And in case you didn\'t know, this Summer\'s Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii a.k.a The Maid I Hired Recently Is Mysterious is the 2nd anime adaptation of mangaka Wakame Konbu\'s works, the 1st of which was last Summer\'s 2-cour, 20-episode long Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! a.k.a The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!, which was enjoyable to a certain degree with its comedy and whatnot. Sadly though, what this show offers...to us is nothing more than just endless, pandering bait of the tropes done before, but un-""sus""-piciously worse in every aspect.The ""teasing"" sub-genre has seen its many fair share of really good ones, the likes of Souichirou Yamamoto with the Takagi-san franchise and the same season\'s Soredemo Ayumu (which is just a character swap), and the one that this show will be most compared to: mangaka Koharu Inoue\'s Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid a.k.a The Duke of Death and His Maid. But there is a fine line to draw where the teasing goes way above and beyond to the point of being extreme, and unfortunately for Wakame Konbu, he did what the formula has been long orchestrated before for years, only for the audience to be more pissed off at it.So, let\'s be real: Yuuri, the young boy that survived a horrific car accident that left both of his parents dead and him being home alone, he is a tough nut to crack being one that is bullied and left to his own devices to sort out his own feelings. It\'s hard having to micro-manage both the servant and the mansion that he can only call home, that\'s his safe haven...that is until this mysteriously beautiful, dark-skinned maid called Lilith enters his life, seemingly having a connection with his parents and taking it upon herself to take care of the young master. And the running gag is that the young master finds the maid incredibly ""sus"" (because that\'s a thing) due to her behavioural actions and intimidations of the rom-com between a child and an adult. Like, I get it when this is done in Shinigami Bocchan where both Bocchan and Alice are of the same age, and are acquainted well enough to make their teasing game more entertaining and comical. But in the case of Saikin Maid, all I see are just subpar cringefest gags of Lilith having to constantly run her mouth towards Yuuri and tease him romantically to no end, engaging the ""will they, won\'t they"" rhetoric. Like, would you believe it if this was done in real life? That would be called blasphemy, and a cardinal sin, even if this is all ""make believe"" fashion. Also, Yuuri is just plain dense, that\'s all. Nuff said, unless the point needs to be emphasized that he really doesn\'t know what\'s going on, and always plays second fiddle to Lilith until he understands the point, only to follow up on her gag.The other supporting characters are nothing like what I remember from Jahy-sama when it comes to the traits, they seemed like two exact complete polar opposites from one another. You have Yuuri\'s classmate and close contact Tsukasa Gojouin with her butler Fujisaki, and believe it or not, their role in this show is just meant to belittle the fact that this show has neither style nor substance, and are only created to show the affiliations to both Yuuri and Lilith in the most ""bearable"" of terms possible. Take Gojouin for example: she is an ""advocate"" for the forbidden relationship between the two leads that stems from her being a fan of romance manga and novels, she\'s the ""thirsty sister"" that just wants to imagine where the wild things are with the master-maid relationship. Thank God there\'s Fujisaki to stop her, and out of everyone, she\'s the most calm and collected character of the bunch keeping Gojouin in constant check. Fujisaki\'s the ""gatekeeper"" of anything and everything, so I\'m glad that her character exists to bond the rest of the cast together in some form and function as the only sane person in the lot.Unsurprisingly, it\'s Silver Link back at it again with subpar in-house director Mirai Minato on his 2nd rondo with this show after Jahy-sama. At least I would admit that Jahy-sama is supposed to be paid more attention to detail given its 20-episode runtime, and since recently there has been more of the studio\'s collab work with another minor studio Blade, I can\'t really tell if they ever improved the line work to begin with, or could it be that Silver Link has consistently produced good and bad shows in a never-ending cycle. At the very least, it seems that this show is used to train a relatively new director (Misuzu Hoshino) under Mirai Minato\'s tutelage, but as we all know that quantity does not equal to quality, and this one is just a pure bad pass wth the bare minimums of actually getting the job done. It\'s the same story with the OST, it\'s very forgettable and there\'s nothing noteworthy to be talked about.Just like Shinigami Bocchan, Saikin Maid has its wholesome moments, but to the extent of getting towards its objective is one that cannot be displaced, for where the destination lies is how the journey to get there is done, and this has already brought in mixed comments when it comes to author Wakame Konbu\'s way of expression in this show. It\'s definitely way different from what I was expecting to be: a Shinigami Bocchan version of Jahy-sama, only except that the charm wears off faster than it could remain, with the majority finding this to be pure bad and the minority enjoying for what it truly is.I can only draw the line in the middle like Humpty Dumpty, not knowing where the egg will fall in this one, though the reckoning that it\'ll lean more towards the bad side. It\'s just mediocre, that\'s all. to us is nothing more than just endless, pandering bait of the tropes done before, but un-""sus""-piciously worse in every aspect.The ""teasing"" sub-genre has seen its many fair share of really good ones, the likes of Souichirou Yamamoto with the Takagi-san franchise and the same season\'s Soredemo Ayumu (which is just a character swap), and the one that this show will be most compared to: mangaka Koharu Inoue\'s Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid a.k.a The Duke of Death and His Maid.

This show turns this concept on its head by having...the young man reciprocate the maid's intimidatingly sensual advances by dealing out compliments and sweet-nothings to her until she herself blushes. Were it a game of poker, the maid could hold pocket aces and still fold them in the face of the young master's unflinching resolutions. He is effectively better at talking to women than 99.9% of all main characters in anime. He has a fine future ahead of him.Now then, what else? The animation is unremarkable but does its job - this show is not a spectacle kind. Little happens and what does is so often a cutesy subversion or developments that deliver what was promised. The writing is fine, serviceable for the target demographic for a show with a premise such as this. Overall, it was unbelievable in every sense of the word that a child would be left as the sole heir and owner of an estate, left unattended to his own devices without some distant relative or the state itself acting to install a guardian post-mortem of parents. But then one so often has a generous suspension of disbelief when watching anime.For those seeking a low-key slice-of-life absent of great strife with redundant gimmicks, replete with maids and the mysterious things they do, and a young boy who has more game than the rest of the genre combined at the center of it all, then I recommend this show to you. There are certainly worse ways to kill a few hours. the young man reciprocate the maid's intimidatingly sensual advances by dealing out compliments and sweet-nothings to her until she herself blushes.

Called broad development it feels too narrow and vice versa. The plot presented was rushed to completion at the end of the episode. I don't know, since what episode does the development of the story in this anime start to be unclear. In terms of characterization,...even I am confused that our main character is at the elementary or high school level. For a stature that is still chibi like an elementary school child and given a romantic plot, this is certainly not the right combination. However, in terms of design, to be honest, the depiction of the character and the nuances of the master & maid are really well executed in this anime.From a visual perspective, to be honest, this anime isn't too bad. Having above average visual quality and consistent execution are added values \u200b\u200bfor this anime. But unfortunately in terms of audio, this anime is only helped by the 2 voice actors of the main character of this anime. For the theme song and sound effects, it just doesn't suit my ears because the execution doesn't seem to match the theme of the anime.In the end, maybe I would say that I don't really recommend this anime. To be honest, in my personal opinion, I only enjoyed the first few episodes of this anime, but I don't know when I started watching this anime, it was very boring and cringy, even though in the end I still finished this anime hahahahahaaa. But at least with that I can give my testimony. even I am confused that our main character is at the elementary or high school level.

I rated it 10 stars because it is pert for its genre.The background music is on another level, the graphics is on another level. The story line is so simple, it's completely for fun and relaxation.I always enjoy watching this and I would recommend it to anyone who just needs something to cool his head down. "", ""When you were 10, did you ever have a super hot maid that seemed like she was a witch and you wanted to sleep with her?No?Well here is your chance to live vicariously through a young kid who hires a maid who is made to compete as a top anime waifu with her charm, wit, and large assets.Maybe if I was a kid and wanted some cheap fan service this would be amazing. The problem with this anime is to me, they are trying two genres that do not seem to go well together, ecchi and slice of life. It's like peanut...butter and steak...I watched it because there was some hype and I try my best to come in unbiased.however, this one is not for me. I am sure there will be plenty of kids out there that will love this anime and boost the rating or others who just love the maid, I mean her character is not terrible. personally, if it was an adult who hired her, it might have been something I could follow better.Anyway, If this is to your taste I hope you love it!

I just saw it and thought ""guess I\'ll try it, won\'t expect much"" but this is probably one of the most unfunniest shows I\'ve ever seen.You may think ""Why though? What could\'ve made Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii so unfunny?"" Well, that\'s because the show repeats the same jokes over and over again. On episode one, Yuuri (the master of the maid) says to Lilith (the maid) ""So that\'s why my heart beats fast when I see you!"" and the joke keeps on getting repeated on and on,...expecting the same reaction.Well, that isn\'t the only problem. Yuuri is a literal child, and Lilith (the maid) is a literal adult. Why are jokes like that being made? Either way, even if I don\'t take the weird jokes into consideration, the jokes are hilariously unfunny and repeated.The story is boringly average. I found no redeeming qualities from the set up, it\'s just the same as usual. Nothing seemed really fun about the story.Now, there are redeeming qualities of Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii. The animation is actually bright and consistent. VAs work pretty well for their character, sound effects are smooth, and nothing looks particularly rushed. Songs are fine, I guess. They aren\'t as memorable and banging.Characters are boringly average. Yuuri is the same old two-dimensional kid that has the same qualities as a normal kid.Lilith is a maid that had a reason to visit Yuuri... and that hasn\'t been explained yet. It probably will in later episodes but other than that, Lilith is a fine maid, I guess.I didn\'t really enjoy Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii.

I want to preface by saying that I am by no means a fan of slice of life series - I find most of them to be either very boring or way too sugar coated. This one though, I don't even know what it is specifically, but it just does it for me. If I'm ever in a bad mood, a few episodes of this will always cheer me up.The greatest strength here is obviously the titular maid Lilith. She is very cute and lovable and her design is awesome, her brilliant purple eyes...popping amazingly in the manga. She is also very mysterious though. When you don't know what's going to happen next, you can actually step into the shoes of protagonist Yuuri and be very suspicious of the maid.Nonetheless, this is a light hearted show, so there isn't some dark hidden motive, it's just two characters struggling to show how they feel for each other. There is just enough drama and tension to keep things interesting, but not too much to sour the mood. Both protagonists are very cute together and their interactions are kept believable, that I believe greatly contributes to the enjoyment factor here. All the side characters are very engaging too and greatly enhanced the overarching story. By the end, when all is revealed, the conclusion is exceptionally satisfying.Beyond that, this anime is also absolutely gorgeous. It's bright, vibrant, colourful, lively and very well paced. Every moment is a joy to look at. All the designs and outfits for the characters are very nice too, with Lilith obviously stealing the show. The music and sound design elevate the experience too.In short, this is a very nice and cute little series that is just a joy from beginning to end. Yes, it's not some ultra deep narrative and it's not some revolutionary premise, but it doesn't need to be. It's a simple story about an orphaned boy and his mysterious maid, executed to perfection. Lilith herself is an amazing character that is incredibly lovable, caring and charming and she manages to be sexy without over-the-top fanservice. I can never get enough of her and I think you will feel the same way too. popping amazingly in the manga. She is also very mysterious though.

Such is the case with Lilith, which according to the suspicion of the young Yuri, is too much of a perfect maid who stayed with him after so such suffering, he doesn’t understand why she’s doing that, or even why she’s so perfect according to him. The most mystifying thing is that this anime has been negatively received and not well appreciate it, because of its basic structure, nothing otherworldly. Since I’ll serve you some spoilers, I...suggest you proceed with caution.Story (8/10):The premise of this story is that a young Lord inherited his domains because some tragic circumstances called Yuri has a seemingly innocuous, but allegedly perfect maid called Lilith. She has proven to be loyal to the juvenile Yuri, helping him to overcome his parent’s death in a very graceful and perfect manner; Yuri, in order to counter her perfect behaviour and learn about her real intentions, starts to tease Lilith with even more overt romantic comments.Despite his slow opening indoors, he’s still closed to the outdoors; Tsukasa, a classmate of him, starts suspecting about an alleged secret relationship between Yuri and Lilith, and whose maid, Fujisaki is a former friend of Lilith. Yuri starts feeling more and more attached to her when she’s not with him or when he has to go to an open school day, thankfully to him, Lilith proved yet again her witchcraft to console and help her Lord in most of the situations arisen.Small growths of confidence between both start to develop in a crypto romantic relationship, such as Yuri starting to talk about Lilith in a more partner-like way, and she begins to worry too much when she doesn’t feel she’s up to the level of Yuri. She later discarded a strange letter directed to her in order to calm Yuri’s worries.Now Yuri cannot stop thinking about Lilith, so he asks to help to Tsukasa, who calmly told him that he’s in love with her and tries to help him with light novels, with no avail due to Fujisaki’s interference. He starts to act in a perfectionist mood when trying to draw his beloved Lilith, and despite his final negative interpretation of the drawing, she feels satisfied by the efforts of her Master. And with now Fujisaki helping Lilith to understand Yuri’s and her own feelings, begins to feel even more close to him, then him proceeding to openly confess to her.A new maid appears by the name of Natsume, who demands that Lilith must go “back home with her” and openly criticizes her for serving a not worthy Master, unbeknown to Natsume, she’s in love with Yuri’s maid, too, and doesn’t know how to be a proper maid. Tsukasa, happy to hear Natsume’s love to Lilith, starts fantasizing and plans a Christmas party for all five, but Yuri has another plan to make Lilith happy alone by giving woolen mittens knit with the help of the very same Lilith.A Master appears to allegedly bring back Lilith and Natsume, but after remembering all the suffering that happened to Lilith before she ended as Yuri’s maid, and Yuri’s intervention, the Master confesses that he’s only there to take back Natsume. Finally, Yuri and Lilith have a date and end up going to the cemetery to pay respect to Yuri’s parents and former Masters of Lilith.Art and animation (7/10):Silver Link, as in many other anime before, opted to a very colourful palette in the design of the characters, with a notably well-designed Lilith, highlighting her tanned skin in a way that made her even more attractive to the viewer with an ample wardrobe; Yuri’s, Tsukasa’s and Natsume’s designs were mostly spot on, but with an incredibly low clothing variety for the rest of the characters.The animation is very simple with the occasional weird face here and there; it wasn’t required to have very complex movements due to the more static moments. The backgrounds have a very rustic design, despite their modern outlook, and in contrast to the characters, it’s got a dark colour palette that takes too much of the background and sometimes highlights way too much the characters.Sound (9/10):The line-up for Saikin Yatotta is strong and mostly carry the show for some moments. The great Saori Hayami giving the voice of the young Lord Yuri, while Rie Takahashi puts a seductive performance with Lilith. The legendary Yui Horie as Tsukasa who hasn’t lost her very high-pitched voice at all, Mikako Komatsu calming the ambiance with Fujisaki and impatient talent Miyu Tomita voices the also impatient Natsume.Background sounds are barely noticeable, but are well used in the most critical moments, such as remembering Yuri’s past. The opening Su, Suki Janai by not equal ME is a very upbeat song, meanwhile, Himitsu no Niwa no Futari sang by the great Yui Horie closes elegantly the anime.Characters (8/10):The characters are serviceable, and each has their purpose defined within the show, so I’ll only talk about Yuri, Lilith, Tsukasa, Fujisaki, and Natsume.Yuri is a very young master who has lost his parents at a very young age and is surprised that his maid Lilith is perfect at everything and thinks she’s a witch ready to bewitch him, luckily for both, he slowly opened his heart to her and starts loving her.Lilith is the seemingly perfect maid that serves Yuri, who apparently cannot do wrong and tries to tease her master with flirtatious comments, only to fall victim of even more flirtatious comments, and then falling in love with her Master. She had a sad past and is always loyal to the Yuri Domain.Tsukasa is a schoolmate of Yuri who is by some reason obsessed with Yuri’s and Lilith’s relationship, she is a little wild in some things, but never malicious at all. She always gets reprimanded by her maid Fujisaki.Fujisaki is the very correct maid of Tsukasa who doesn’t like too much chaos in live, only serves the purpose of correcting her young Lady and helping her continue in the good life path.Natsume is the annoying jealous maid that feels betrayed by Lilith because she left her, she tried to out-maid Lilith by challenging her to do chores, only to fail miserably. Later is discovered that she is in love with Lilith, and begrudgingly accepts the love that her and her master have for each other.Enjoyment (8/10):For a long time, relationships between a Lord and a maid had been critically evaluated as the enforcement of dominion of the man over the woman, but how can you consider this anime where the maid is the one who’s actively trying to impress her Master. And even worse for the critical people, is that Yuri, despite his initial difficulties and suspicion on Lilith, managed to open his heart to her, and develop a nice relationship.Other morally rigid people will point out that there’s a marked age difference between Yuri and Lilith; but oh yeah, there’s a marked age difference between Yuri and Lilith, but in no moment at all, neither his nor her get over the board on suggesting even a single kiss. So, the only one that suggest having a forbidden relationship is a third person (Tsukasa), incredible.So why should I enjoy this quite simple and sometimes “questionable” anime? Simple, because its only purpose is to give me a comfortable relationship with the occasional teasing from each side to the other, a-la-Takagi. Saikin Yatotta doesn’t pretend to be a Shinigami Bocchan nor a Takagi-san, it only wants to be a Saikin Yatotta, and that’s enough for me.Final Score: 8/10. suggest you proceed with caution.Story (8/10):The premise of this story is that a young Lord inherited his domains because some tragic circumstances called Yuri has a seemingly innocuous, but allegedly perfect maid called Lilith.

The butler diligently works as a butler in the house in the following days, however, all the time he will throw winks and intrigued looks at the girl, often making allusions (albeit very veiled), of a romantic nature... done? Well, how did you find the idea of this story? Horrible? Inappropriate? Vulgar? I understand, now reverse the genders and imagine that the girl is instead a boy while the butler is a maid...dressed in a uniform that exposes much of her chest and you have this anime.This anime simply does not work, it tries to combine two genres (Ecchi and Slice of life), failing to work in either case. It’s not an ecchi because the allusions are too veiled and there are no accompanying visuals that can suggest more explicit themes; It’s not even a slice of life because... well yes maybe it’s a slice of life, but slice of life usually must have at least one of these characteristics:- Have interesting characters- Have a certain dose of comedy elements- Have a very nice style and/or settingUnfortunately, the anime has none of these elements; The comic elements are rare and weak, there was not a single scene that made me smile, let alone laugh; The setting is not nice especially for the generic graphics and for the design of the Maid more focused on a sexy vibe than a cutesy one... and as for interesting characters the maid could be the only vaguely interesting character since she holds a minimum of mystery about her relationship with the main character and why she offered to work for free at his house... however you can guess most of her motivations(if not all), well before the final episode which simply confirms all suspicions already widely provided up to then and therefore... adds nothing relevant in the end.In the last episodes, a second maid is also added who however adds nothing new to the story and is present for too few episodes to build any relevance within the story that I forgot to say that it is practically almost non-existent or rather... has almost no development (which is however consistent with a slice of life).The thing I don’t like is that despite everything, the basic idea could have actually work: A young woman who to show her gratitude goes to do housework for the son of her adoptive parents (deceased), and establishes an almost maternal relationship with said pre-adolescent son... this premise could work! ...if it weren’t for the fact that said maid throws continuous winks and double entendres with romantic vibes towards said boy and it’s simply... how to say... remember at the beginning what I said?, try to imagine that the boy was a girl receiving attention from a guy at least 8-10 years older than her and tell me if it seems appropriate... no, it just doesn’t work; The formula of this anime could work by completely removing the useless ecchi elements which are too weak to have any weight anyway, dress up the Maid with less provocative clothes and focus on a story of a master - maid relationship that slowly turns into something more akin of a parent-child relationship and... it could have been a nice story... instead no, instead there is this monstrosity that at its best is boringly passable but overall is simply plain and lukewarm.Thinking about it, there is a secondary character who almost made me smile, a classmate of the protagonist who is completely taken in her head by the romantic stories she reads and who imagines who knows what crazy scenarios between the protagonist and his maid and... and it’s a character so absurd that it’s almost funny... this character, unlike the story of this anime, does not seek a compromise that can never work, but embraces the madness of an almost crazy character who imagines things so ridiculous that they almost make you laugh...Oh, by the way, the title of this anime is practically the plot of 3/4 of the show: The maid I recently hired is suspicious... in fact, practically 80% of the jokes and situations are based on this premise, while the rest are based on the fact that the young protagonist practically doesn’t know what embarrassment is and therefore when he speaks he says things as he thinks them, making the maid feel embarrassed every time, who despite after 10 episodes, is still surprised by what comes out of the boy's mouth, as if by now she should know him more than well!.. moreover, the fact that she gets embarrassed by the words of a boy who is a little more than half of her age is quite pathetic... any vaguely adult person would not give too much weight to the words of a boy of the age and maturity of the character of this anime....for the rest there is no particular positive aspect in this anime, my advice is, if you are looking for a slice of life look elsewhere, if you are looking for an ecchi, look elsewhere, this is neither one nor the other, it’s simply a failed story that should have remained in some drawer somewhere. dressed in a uniform that exposes much of her chest and you have this anime.This anime simply does not work, it tries to combine two genres (Ecchi and Slice of life), failing to work in either case.

Get ready to have that joke repeated over and over and over again until the season ends. Well I don’t know if that will be the case, but I do know that it’s the case for the past 7 episodes I’ve watched, and quite honestly the joke got old real fast.Maybe it’s because I enjoyed “The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated” and knowing that this was written by Konbu, the same mangka I expected this to be good, but I’ve got to admit that the charm that hooks...you into her other stories is hard to find in this one, if not there at all when adapted to anime.That said, Konbu’s very based taste in waifu designs is on point with Lilith who is undeniably the reason I (and everyone else, lets face it) started watching the show in the first place. There are some good scenes that I enjoyed. Whilst the jokes are still fresh it can be funny, and the scene of Yuuri panicking over being alone again after the traumatic lose of his parents coupled with Lilith not getting home on time was genuinely gripping. I also really enjoyed Yuuri’s school friend Tsukasa as her wild and innocently perverted fantasies of Yuuri and Lilith having a love affair was very funny to the dismay of her butler. However, some good scenes and a tanned maid with big booba isn’t really enough to keep someone interested when the jokes loop so much they practically become a line.I don’t know, maybe it’s just me. After the pure brilliance of “My Dress-Up Darling” a lot of these slice-of-life, rom-coms on this level just don’t really do it for me anymore.

The animation itself is pretty good, at first I couldn’t help but think throughout the few first minutes “oh inspired by Kuroshitsuji” but then as it kept going on I was like “please not another sick anime that try to normalize underage/adults relationship im BEGGING you!” and turns out it ended being this, a grown ass adult being all shy, double meaning and crushing hard on a child, another adult being jealous of a child like it’s all the Japanese anime stereotypes. Like sure I get it the main thing is “oh we know...each others, a weird type of brother/sister relationship” but in the end Japanese failed one more time to let all their sick fantasies for shota away from something that could had actually be pretty decent and interesting to watch when you don’t want to watch something too serious.

What I thought would be trashy coomer bait seems to be more targeted towards girls.It became quickly apparent to me that it was written by a woman during my viewing. This is because the show follows a general pattern of ""thing happens"" -> ""MC compliments the maid as a result of the thing"". The male MC basically just exists to compliment and make the female lead feel desired, which is what tipped me off to it being written by a woman. It\'s unapologetic whish fulfillment and...romance.That\'s not a critique perce, but I would have enjoyed the show more if I was into that kind of stuff.I do have my criticizms however, mainly that it\'s too repetitive and lacks stakes. The aforemention pattern isn\'t varied enough and comes of as vacuous. The show is generally devoid of any interesting conflict, which can be a good thing if you are looking for something light-hearted, but it makes the show samey as well.I was relieved when I finally finnished it, but that might just be because I don\'t enjoy those kinds of stories. This anime is equivilant to one of those romance novels that your aunt/grandma reads voraciously and has enormous collection of. Its no coincidence that one of the characters is infatuated with the relationship between the two MCs, loves gossip and reads lots of romance novels.If you are the type that enjoys those kinds of stories, you have probably already seen it.6/10 romance.That\'s not a critique perce, but I would have enjoyed the show more if I was into that kind of stuff.I do have my criticizms however, mainly that it\'s too repetitive and lacks stakes.

The more I watched, the more I melted.Story and Caracters :Yes, Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii\'s not the perfect cute romance. Yuri\'s saying always the sames things realizing, it gets repetitive. But I can forgive that, Yuri stops declaring his love like that, the story will become weird and will be less cute. I love the reactions of Yuri, he always say his maid is strange, even if in love with she, that\'s repetitive, but not disturbing. I love his innocence too, he\'s not realizing...what he say, and belive that\'s magic, that\'s remember me Chunnibyo. I love Lilith too, she\'s understand all like us, she\'s the perfect seme caracter for a Straight Shotacon, all the story, I tought she\'s a maid at the manor just for love, because with these thoughts, Like trying to get his attention, I always tought, ""Just say ""I love you"" please, you are one of the best lovers with Yuri !"" That\'s so cute I didn\'t pay attention to the age.Music and Animation :There\'re two studios for this anime, and that\'s shows. I love the colors and the lights, there\'s no things dark, and that\'s enjoy we more this cute romance. That\'s not colored too, just perfect. I love the opening, ""Su-Suki janai !"" the words of the song are just perfect for the story, just the title : ""I don\'t lo-love you !"". For me this is Lilith who is singing. Others musics are typical of Slice of Life or School Life anime.Overall, I think the story can\'t satisfied everybody, that\'s a Straight Shotacon, but I recommend this anime who love cute romance or even just Slice of Life, even you don\'t like Schotacon. what he say, and belive that\'s magic, that\'s remember me Chunnibyo.

Yet make a huge mistake by just doing that. True, the first few episodes can seem a bit repetitive, but there is actually growth in both main characters, Lilith and Yuuri.Story:--------The story starts with Yuuri all alone in his mansion, his parents died in a accident leaving him all alone (No explanation where other family are or what they do or why he's left all alone). Lilith soon arrives and doesn't tell who she is really, her name isn't even given...until later episodes which does add to the mystery of who she is. Her secrets are not really given until the last few episodes which actually are well worth to see. Even can shed a tear in the very last episode near the ending, why I won't mention to keep it spoiler free as much as I can.The story is well written and really worth finishing, you will not really get much if you give up with just a few episodes. It's a real shame that this does seem to happen.Characters:--------------The characters are quite interesting, although a few are typical copy/paste type characters in how they behave mostly. Natsume for example being one of these, a typical 'I love [insert person name] so I wish to be selfish and do [insert action]'. Yet realizes the error of her ways quite quickly. Tsukasa being another, a typical girl that's overly invested in her love theories and tries to get the first row seat if it comes to the relation between Yuuri and Lilith. Fujisaki playing a female butler in service of Tsukasa that doesn't want to dress up feminine nor wishes any photo's taken of her.Character progression for Yuuri and Lilith are visible the further in you go, both on a individual level as relation wise towards each other. Also some progression between these two and Tsukasa and Fujisaki happens but on a minor level.Graphics & sound:----------------------Graphics look decent and the sound over all is well suited. I do however need to add that Lilith's voice is a bit on the soft side as she doesn't speak on the same volume level as the other characters (character trait) However this does seem to change a bit the further you get which shows character progression.I do think this anime is seriously underrated and deserves a lot better ratings. Well worth to watch this one! I can highly recommend it! until later episodes which does add to the mystery of who she is. Her secrets are not really given until the last few episodes which actually are well worth to see. Even can shed a tear in the very last episode near the ending, why I won't mention to keep it spoiler free as much as I can.The story is well written and really worth finishing, you will not really get much if you give up with just a few episodes.

While description doesn\'t really describe this show as such, main character has all the tell tale signs. All the love interests are servants and they have to do what he orders, and orders are absolute. He frequently states they are his and his alone. If they displease him it\'s their fault and they constantly apologize and bloom on any sort of acknowledgement and/or forgiveness from main character. He gets angry when they leave the house and...on those occasions he follows them jealously. All while not providing any sort of compensation to any of the servants.Writers try to disguise this as some pure and innocent love interest. Since it\'s a Japanese drama we have to have harem of sorts with at least few busty and even more thirsty female characters. Of course there\'s the ever-present ""comedy"" of main character constantly overreacting and screaming on top of his lungs. Classic signs of an average show.All that said, it\'s not an unwatchable show. It does leave you fuzzy feeling as well as dirty knowing that main character is surely developing into an asshole if not worse and for enjoying development of relationship between old enough girl to be working as maid and clearly elementary school kid.Overall, mixed bag due to weird themes and clearly demented main character. Story doesn\'t really go anywhere, just eleven episodes of them blushing at each other.

I expected some things from it, but it just didn't live up to my hopes.Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii is about this annoying brat whose parents died and left him some mansion, and then this maid girl comes in, and starts acting very weird and trying to get very close to him and that just felt very uncomfortable to watch. One reason why I hated this show was because of the main character, 'Yuri', that spoiled brat I was talking about. Whenever he sees that maid do literally anything at all, he shouts 'Ayashii' for no reason. THIS...BOY IS AN IDIOT, AND SO AM I.Believe me, I tried my hardest to stick with this show but I couldn't. The plot had some potential and seemed interesting, but the execution was appalling. Yuri is always acting like he doesn't want the maid girl around and then starts getting depressed when she goes away to buy some fish for a meal and leaves him alone. He has basically confessed his love to her multiple time, and somehow, this fucking stupid idiot hasn't realised. Lilith deserves better.Basically, you shouldn't watch this show unless you enjoy cringe stuff and want to be frustrated easily. Sorry for this trash review, and for my horrendous taste.

Even with the casts and shows that the studios have produced, this show just isn\'t the one. As a viewer, I literally have 0 emotional investment in the show\'s main casts, and I don\'t think I ever will given how unfunny and unamusing the characters are. To be honest, as someone who enjoys SoLs and even pure SoLs, the way the story is going, this show isn\'t even worth watching. Oh, and it\'d be funny and amusing if someone actually...makes an Ayashi Counter for whenever any of the casts says that word. AYASHI!!!To me, this show is just a cheap Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid knockoff. Why is this the case, you may wonder? Yuuri is basically Bocchan since both of them were left behind in the mansion, and both of them have a maid to come in and support them, which for this show is Lilith. Bocchan from Shinigami Bocchan is clearly the superior version of the two, as he is more charismatic, whereas Yuuri is more obstinate and direct, to the point where he\'d blurt out his feelings to Lilith all the time and would say everything Lilith has done for him is suspicious (""Ayashi""), which is annoying when you constantly hear the same word being blurted out. Lilith, on the other hand, would always blush despite having a teasing personality, which seems odd and doesn\'t fit her character, so the show should go for one or the other rather than both. We don\'t even know who Lilith is or what her background is because she appeared out of nowhere and wanted to work for Yuuri, which puzzled me since a simple background introduction would have been far better than leaving viewers in the dark as to why she suddenly appeared and wanted to work for Yuuri without any form of compensation. So far there hasn\'t been much of a plot to speak of, as all that can be seen is the constant back and forth teasing and blushing, with little else going on. Even Yuuri and Lilith\'s wholesome relationship on the show can\'t save the show from its bad chemistry since the chemistry between the characters doesn\'t even seem natural and in a sense seems forced, which really hinders the emotional investment part of its viewers.Again, as someone who enjoys SoLs, I don\'t recommend Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii as there are far better shows airing this season, both in the SoL category and not, and this show should not be your top priority. I don\'t even know how this show can improve from the state it is now. makes an Ayashi Counter for whenever any of the casts says that word.

Star Ocean EX,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1005/Star_Ocean_EX,"['The story of Star Ocean EX is completely based on the first disc of the PSX game, Star Ocean: The Second Story.In the game, you can pick to play from either the point of view of Rena, or Claude. The anime chooses to follow Claude.StoryClaude C. Kenni is a young ensign on a mission with his father. When they arrive on a strange planet, Claude decides to prove his worth, and inspect a mysterious object on his own, against his fathers protests. When Claude comes into contact with this object, he is transported to the underdeveloped planet, Expel, where he mets Rena Lanford. Rena believes...Claude is the Hero of the Light, here to save Expel from destruction. So our story begins with Claude and Rena embarking on a mission to destroy the Sorcery Globe.AnimationThere is nothing particularily special about this anime\'s animation. While it is full of battles, it falls back to the ""single shot, shakey screen"" method for attacks. However, the characters have great expressions, and it is a very colourful anime, with nice backgrounds.SoundThe music is based off the soundtrack from the game. The game\'s music is (in my opinion) superior, but the nice remix of the music does fit well in the show. They use it to set moods, and it\'s not placed into a scene awkardly, so it keeps the story flowing.There is some original scores, that are also very nicely done, and were also made by the same man who created the music for the game, Motoi Sakuraba.CharactersThough I personally dislike Claude, this anime definitly benefits from a wide variety of characters. There is notably, 10 of the 12 main characters from the game, as well as atleast 3 original characters, and 3 NPC\'s from the game, brought to life with more personality (ie Yuki, Jam Shop Girl in Salva). The characters that they do focus on generally all follow the usual character personalities, but when hit with a character like Ashton (ie Possesed by Dragons Guy), you suddenly find yourself with some entirely unique characters.EnjoymentEnjoyment varies. If you played the game originally, you may be a bit disappoint with how the characters seemed to have developed, the plot holes, how they cut out some of the best aspects of the game (such as the game had it so that you could make ANYONE be with anyone. While Rena and Claude are the title lovers in the show, in the game, you can virtually make them with anyone), and the way they messed up some of the storyline. However, it\'s still enjoyable for the big fans, who love the game no-matter-what (such as I).If you never played the game, or you are just an SO3 fan, this could be a totally new experience, that you may or may not enjoy. With the anime being recently translated into English, you can gain access to this anime anyway possible.Overall / My Comments / My FeelingsTo begin with, I honestly think picking Claude as the main-main character over Rena was an entirely stupid idea. I\'m not saying this because I am a well known Claude-hater, Rena-fan, it\'s just Claude\'s story is weak in comparison to Rena\'s.To begin with, even playing Claude\'s story, it all goes back into focus about Rena\'s mysterious past, and how it\'s her world they are saving. Even then, it might be a bit boring, because we can\'t really relate with Rena (since they made her act 5, instead of 17 like she is..) they could still do a flip-main character theme, where it\'s going between the two, and their point of views.I also have an incredible dislike for all the pairings. I have always had my strong belief in Rena/Ashton. Though not a popular pair, I can\'t see him with Precis (which they make him adore), nor Celine (though she\'s better than Precis). I always imagined it as Precis/Leon, and Celine would be with practically anyone (I usually pick Noel though, who isn\'t even in the anime). They balant favouritism towards Claude/Rena really bugs me. I wouldn\'t mind so much if they made it develop, instead of ""Omg Claude, it\'s episode 1, but I love you already!!"" That just really gets to me.A final bit is, this series ends in a HUGE cliffhanger. As in, it\'s in desperate need of a second season, but we\'ll never see it.By this, I mean, the second disc is suppose to be season 2, but the creators cancelled finishing the series, and went on to better things (whatever the hell that might be).Anyways, if you are a SO fan of any sort (be it 1, 2 or 3) you will probably like to see this. So1 fans, this is what happens after, So2 fans, this is what you all dreamed about, and So3 fans, this is why your game sucks. Claude is the Hero of the Light, here to save Expel from destruction.

It's based off of a video game [which I've never seen or played since I'm not a gamer]. The maturity level is a little greater than Pokemon...not by much, though I must say I still liked it and I think older people would like this show as well. So long as you don't compare it to the video game or expect it to be this wonderfully sophisticated piece of work.~ ArtThe art is kinda amateurish looking though it's not totally bad. Use of lines, shape and proportion are all OK, however the actual shading is pretty...weak. The color palette is very simple and has a “paint-by-numbers” look to it. The hero is of course blonde with blue eyes *rolls eyes* with matching the colors for his boots, gloves and jacket., The heroine is blue-haired with blue eyes and the sorceress woman is violet-haired with violet eyes.CGI is used in small doses but all for the wrong reasons like monsters melting away and cheesy-cheap looking ocean/water distortion but it's not really used for the fight scenes or special F/X. At the end, they use more CGI but again it's very cheesy and cheap-looking. Another clue that this show is for a younger audience is that scenes are reused constantly, especially the heroes' attack moves.~ SoundI watched this show in the English dub and it was pretty good. Each of the actors properly conveyed the right mix of emotion and humor into their characters. Also the guy who did Kira Yamato's English voice stars in this show as Claude Kenni, he is a very good actor.The music is on the generic side, the OP sounds like typical shonen anime electro-pop synthesizer music. The ED is a somewhat peppy sounding feminine rock song which was still on the generic side.~ StoryAs with most children's stories, the plot is pretty basic. A guy gets thrown into a strange world and goes on an adventurous quest to return home incidentally saving the world while he's at it. But what really makes Star Ocean work [for me at least] are the individual episodes, the situational humor and the connection between the characters. The story is told in a very childish and straightforward fashion with all the requisite of humor as can be expected from shows of this nature. Therefore don't look for any deeper meaning or any sophisticated narrative elements like irony, metaphors, or complex plot twists.~ CharactersThe characters are pretty much what make the show what it is. At times they seem pretty stereotypical with the typical anime/RPG line up: the hero, the healer, the wizard, the rogue knight, the thief/bandit[s], the comic relief....and so on, but then they did some unique things like throwing in some modern elements like doctors and scientists [also electricity].The unity and overall good-naturedness between the characters is what I found most admirable and enjoyable in the show, I really like when a band of characters go off on an adventure and really stick together and help each other. Star Ocean is really good at portraying unity....and because of that I don't think I found any one character annoying.At the very beginning I didn't like Claude because he just seemed so brash and heedless of caution, even though I know it was because he had a point to prove that he was not just some kid living under his father's shadow, Commodore Kenni. Thank goodness he changes during the anime and quickly learned when to turn on the bravado and when to switch it off. Once that character flaw was removed, Claude became my favorite.I also liked Ashton very much, he carried his share of the show very well and despite what everyone else in the show was saying about him, he's actually a pretty skilled swordsman and a very likable character. It's easy to see why the two-headed dragon got attached to him.I also liked Celine and Rena, the two girls of the group. They are basically two sides of the same coin except Celine plays the sexpot card and Rena plays the short, cute and helpless card.~ VerdictOverall I'd say it was a pretty cool show. Maybe it's not the “OMG!!! this is effin' EPIC!!! Lemme tell all my friends about it!!!” kinda show, but it kept things light and I was entertained. So if some one was interested and asked me about it....then I'd tell them to check it out, it's pretty good and funny. weak. The color palette is very simple and has a “paint-by-numbers” look to it.

I expected it to at least be on par with the game that it's based on but it just didn't work for me.First, let's talk about its story. Originally I would have given Star Ocean EX a 10 since I expected it to be like its game counterpart. I ended giving it a six because some episodes had so many gaps inbetween them, I just got confused. The series also ended halfway through the plotline and it also had the most horrible ending I have ever seen.Wait I almost forgot. The story WAS continued through...vocal dramas.....in Japanese. Though I know some Nihongo, I still couldn't understand much of what they were saying. The fact that the dramas are only in Nihongo make it almost impossible for foreign fans of the series to continue with the story.The art was average......Not much to say here.....The songs were fair enough. They were fun to listen to for a while but they eventually got really annoying and they're also not that memorable.In the beginning the characters were very well-developed. The four main characters, Claud, Rena, Ashton and Celine were presented well enough. Problems started arising when the other characters entered the script. For instance, the relationship between Rena and Dias could have been better presented. Leon should also have gotten more air time.Star Ocean EX also introduces some utterly useless characters into the story such as the three random idiots, whose names I still can't remember and the jam girl, whose name i also forgot. They were so useless to the plotline that the story could go on even if they weren't there. I mean come on! The jam girl can't even fight! What's she gonna do make sandwiches in the battlefield? Oh! Maybe she can sing the monsters to death!In the end, Star Ocean EX was a flop. Although it has so many faults, I can't stop you from watching it. You can watch it if you like. In fact, you may even like it. But for me, the game was better. You're better off enjoying Claud and Rena's adventure playing the game instead. vocal dramas.....in Japanese.

Involved in an operation to explore uncharted territory Claude unknowingly touches an artefact that transports him on the underdeveloped planet of Expel. While he tries to figure out just where he is and how he got there, he rescues Rena Langford from a monster and is thought to be the 'Legendary Warrior of Light' by the residents of the local village. Just what is Claude's destiny in this strange new world?My thoughts:Star Ocean Ex is a great series. Claude encounters strange and new...friends in Celine Jules, a treasure hunter and a powerful wielder of Heraldic Magic; Ashton Anchors, a swordsman possessed by a two-headed dragon Gyoro and Ururun. Gyoro, the red head, and Ururun, the blue, are the names of the heads of the two-headed dragon that are fused with the body of Ashton Anchors. Rena Langford, a native of the planet of Expel, she often ventures into the Shingo Forest. I do love Ashton, he brings the humor to the story and you just have to love Celine with her thunderbolts; she really likes to use them on the 3 criminal idiots they seem to always encounter. Then there's Dias Flac, he lives in the same town as Rena and thinks of her as a little sister. He travels and trains to be come stronger and fights only those he feels is worthy of his skills.What I wish is that the ending had a finished end and not an opening for a possible second season. Why you might ask? Well, because it's been years and as far as I know, a second season has not been announced yet in anime. I think Manga has a second season. If I'm wrong about a second season in anime, forgive me, I've just not seen it yet. If you have, please put a link to it so I check it out. We can only hope there is one, because I would love to see the battle between everyone and the master of the Sorcery Globe. friends in Celine Jules, a treasure hunter and a powerful wielder of Heraldic Magic; Ashton Anchors, a swordsman possessed by a two-headed dragon Gyoro and Ururun.

The only downfall was towards the end. The show started moving in a different direction away from the plotline of the game and ended at a climax that made you wanna rip your hair out (but hey that's Japan for you).I first played the game for the PSP before watching it so I expected it to follow that plot line pretty close, and it did for about half of the series. I think the reason they did change...the series half way through was because they knew they couldn't fit the original plotline into 26 episodes and they didn't want to make a second season.If I remember correctly, the point at which the show started moving away from the game was when the boat holding the lacuer hope was attacked and sank, washing the people on a different continent (don't remember name). At that point they went straight to the sorcery globe, totally removing the transport to energy nede. Along with that the ten wise men were never mentioned or showed up in the series. The only thing that may have been the first showing of the ten wise men was when Rena and Claude were inside the Sorcery globe and they were stopped by a screen that showed up showing what looked like 10 people i think, one being a Nedian. He told Rena she was one of them and ofcourse, she started crying (figures). But I won't ruin the show for you if you haven't watched it. Just know the ending will leave you pissed off, atleast it did me. the series half way through was because they knew they couldn't fit the original plotline into 26 episodes and they didn't want to make a second season.If I remember correctly, the point at which the show started moving away from the game was when the boat holding the lacuer hope was attacked and sank, washing the people on a different continent (don't remember name).

And since fans of the games (especially The Second Story, specifically) will probably be the main audience, choices made by the creators of the anime will drastically reduce the enjoyment of this series.What exactly are these choices? First of all, the anime follows only the story of Claude, rather than Rena. Though most people do choose to play Claude's scenario in the game itself, people who preferred Rena's perspective are alienated - besides, changing the media from video game to anime could have allowed them to show BOTH aspects of the story,...giving people who have already played the game an extra reason to watch the series.Even more seriously, though, is the decision to portray only part of the story; the anime only covers pretty much only the first disc of the game. This leaves loads of unanswered questions and loose ends, and with virtually no hope of a second season (since the game is over a decade old), the cliffhanger ending is truly frustrating. This fact becomes especially annoying since the story doesn't really get good until the second disc. The makers of the anime did add in lots to the story, which sounds like a good idea since, in the game, the first disc really only amounted to somewhat tedious traveling; however, the new scenarios in the anime are equally as pointless and not all that interesting. The worst part comes near the end of the anime, where the story from the game is completely thrown out the window and replaced by a new (and, in my opinion, lesser) version of events.Another problem is that the anime arbitrarily chooses a main party of Claude, Rena, Celine, and Ashton, leaving the other characters in the dust. With the exception of Noel and Chisato (who aren't even mentioned), all the other characters don't have too much airtime and barely fight with the group. With a game with so many characters and so many group combinations, it seems silly to choose a particular four-person group and go with that for the whole anime, rather than featuring the entire cast. There are, however, new characters added for the anime, but they are all generic and uninteresting, adding nothing to the enjoyment of the series. Luckily, Ashton is one of the main characters chosen for the anime, and he is portrayed hilariously - in fact, Ashton is basically the only reason I stayed with this anime to the end. giving people who have already played the game an extra reason to watch the series.Even more seriously, though, is the decision to portray only part of the story; the anime only covers pretty much only the first disc of the game.

So, when I found out, in 2005 or 2006, that an anime adaptation had been made, I was excited to watch it. So, yeah, here\'s a confession: my judgment will probably be biased by sheer nostalgia, as I feel towards those characters, this world and this story, an affection that probably goes deeper than it should – if I were to watch it for the first time today.Still, I...will try to be fair.When the original game had us choose between two slightly different points of views, of the two main protagonists, Rena or Claude, the anime clearly opts for the latter. As a young ensign of the space Federation fleet, assigned to the Calnus spaceship, whose admiral is none other than his dad, Claude C. Kenny, while exploring a devastated planet, finds himself shot off by a mysterious device to the faraway world of Expel. There, he\'ll meet Rena Lanford, a local girl, and save her from a dire monster with a single bursting shot of his laser-gun. But such technology exceeds what\'s known on those underdeveloped lands; and the prodigious laser-beam will quickly be seen as the ""sword of light"" of a hero whose coming was foretold by the church...I find such premise to be rather interesting, although it’s not really original. A lost boy tries to make his way through an unknown world, with the help of a young girl he met; it’s basically that. The main purpose of such narrative doesn’t lie into complex connections between religious beliefs and advanced technology – for example. It’s an adventure; a pretty standard one, where a bunch of characters unite to fight evil monsters and save the world from its demise, with sword techniques, constant traveling, slight romance and comic relief – really, basic stuff. Still, it’s not so bad; pace feels overall pretty decent, some characters are funny, like Ashton and his barrel fetish, and the story remains faithful to the original…Well, at least, for the most part. Despite all the affection I still get for this anime series, the six/seven last episodes still are a slight source of disappointment. Not because it drifts apart from the initial game story, but because the pace slows down quite a bit, because characters are really just too many, but most of all, because it ends on a cliffhanger, which is even more frustrating that no sequel was ever produced – all 26 episodes of this show only cover the events taking place during the first segment of the game, its first disk out of two. There’s still a way to get next part by playing the original game, sure, but still… that’s a bummer.In this regard, it would be hard recommending this to people who’d want to engage in a full, finished story. But if you enjoyed the original product, or if you like anime adaptations of videogames, or even the adventure genre in its whole, you may have a fairly good time watching Star Ocean EX, as I still think it’s good enough of its own to deserve some attention.Also, it’s old, but, you know, nostalgia… will try to be fair.When the original game had us choose between two slightly different points of views, of the two main protagonists, Rena or Claude, the anime clearly opts for the latter.

Sonic X,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1816/Sonic_X,"[""It's the best because the characters and story are the greatest ever written. If you hate this show you are probably lying. The plot is simple yet is the most enjoyable thing I've ever experienced. The conflicts feel very real and are not forced. This show is the pinnacle of entertainment and can never be topped. This show is easily the reason I am still alive to this day and continues to give me joy with each rewatch. Some people may be turned off by the fact that it's based on a video game, but trust me, this show will not disappoint you. "", 'I don\'t really wanna review Sonic X. What about you, Tails? Do you want to? (Tails staring at me bored and pissed) Well...... Sorry Tails, I have to do this anyway. We all know Sonic. He\'s the badass mascot of SEGA that spawned in the Genesis in the 90\'s and became a pop culture phenomenon. When news began of a Sonic anime in the works, fans were thrilled with excitement and maybe Sonic can translate well into anime. But then came 4Kids! and...... The results were not pretty. Hated by both Sonic and anime fans, Sonic X was a huge failure among fans of Sonic,...due to ridiculous plot, ripping off other animes and terrible new characters.Sonic X begins with, who else, Sonic and his friends going to Dr. Eggman\'s base to rescue Cream and her Chao, when a nuclear reaction on the Chaos Emerald exploded and sending Sonic and his pals to Earth. That makes sense right guys?..... Moving on. After the weird explosion, Sonic gets chased by cops and ends up falling into the pool of a kid\'s house named Chris Thorndyke, a 10-year-old boy who lives with his grandfather Chuck and her maid Ella. So in the first season, it begins with a bang and then it goes a little bit strange for me. First, why the hell did Sonic and his friends end on Earth? DIdn\'t the place that they live is basically Earth? If not, then what\'s the name of their world then?! (although they did explain this in the second season of Sonic X, but the way they explain it is messed up). Second, how can a Chaos Emerald send you trough time? Cause that was never even in the games and things get even crazier in the second season of Sonic X, when they introduced another new character Cosmo and boy, they crammed up a lot of story into Season 2, cause the amount of backstory that they give to the plot in Sonic X just screams epic bullshit all the way in my opinion. Also, i found out that Sonic X in Japan was more violent and bloody than the US version, they even show Sonic bleeding while in a fight with Shadow in the Japanese version and hearing both Sonic and Tails swear a lot in the Japanese version, as well as Amy saying ""Fuck"". It was so controversial that 4Kids! edited the living crap out of Sonic X, so that it may receive a TV-Y7 rating in the US.There are some things that I really like about Sonic X. First the animation. While it\'s not really perfect and there are a few incredibly bland backgrounds at times, the art and character models do look really good and fluid. Character models really bring the Sonic feel to life and they really work on each of the characters personalities from the game into the anime. the sense of speed really goes perfectly with the art and it really looks damn good on screen. Also, i like how the creators are, at least, giving some of this characters some depth to it, where many other Sonic games failed. There\'s one part where Sonic comes to see Amy, but Amy gets angry at him cause he always left her without telling her and then Sonic actually gives a Rose, apologizes to her and telling Amy that he would actually stay with her by the end of the world in the Jap version! Holy shit, Sonic, that\'s pretty damn deep. Also in the Jap version, the character development in Shadow was really great and I really can\'t believe i care for the guy, but really I just did. To be fair as well, while this anime does sometimes rips off some cliches from animes, it does deliver some very funny moments that make Sonic X worth the time to enjoy.Now the main reason I think Sonic X fails is because of the shitty English dub and dialogue script that 4Kids! wrote for the US version of Sonic X (in which I do agree on). Voice-acting can be a hit or miss and it does fit the voices for each character, but sometimes the English voices can be extremely corny and cheesy and hell and the terrible script for the 4Kids! version ruins the show. It often feels rushed and really ruining some of the character development by making it too damn simple, i mean, really, couldn\'t they write something better than the script that these voice-actors were given to do?. Also, characters like Chris, Cosmo and etc. are really bland and useless. Chris looks like Sora from Kingdom Hearts and basically, he\'s just there to be a buddy with Sonic, nothing more and Cosmo is just for Tails to have a love interest, just like Sonic and Amy.If you wanna see Sonic X, see the Japanese version instead. It has better English subtitles dialouge and some nice character development to it. I don\'t recommend the English dub, cause 4Kids! really ruined it by cutting too much plot from the Japanese version and just rushing the series for a quick-buck. If Sonic X was dubbed by Funimation instead of 4Kids!, it would have been so much better for Sonic X, cause Funimation only does little editing on animes all the damn time. It\'s not the greatest thing ever, but it\'s definitely not the worst thing ever made, it\'s actually pretty enjoyable and it worth the interest if you like, but please, see the Japanese version, not the 4Kids! one....

Thank you.', 'There\'s something to be said when a Sonic fan hates a Sonic show so much that they have to write a review on a public website so that other people can see it and (most likely) disagree. But let me say this clearly: I am a huge Sonic the Hedgehog fan and I hate this show.Why do I hate this show so much? Well, let\'s compare it to the best Sonic TV Show ever, Sonic SatAM.Story:Sonic X: well... maybe like, 5 out of 10.Sonic SatAM: 9/10Any of you who remember Sonic SatAM know that the storyline was  pretty intense while still at the same...time being humorous. It could balance seriousness and comedy and that was something that made the show so good. I mean, the show was about pollution for the most part, but Sonic and the others DID talk about other things AND created comedy out of the situation. You might not have realized you were learning about the environment, and you probably weren\'t really. But I\'m sure that you saw Robotnik\'s home and thought \'Ew gross, jeez, I hope this doesn\'t happen where I\'m from\' or something like that.Sonic X, I have to say starts off with a decent plot but only if you know the characters already. If you just come in, they show you all the characters, but you don\'t really know them. I think that the original two arcs for this series is chronicled in the two games Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 (SADX and SA2B for Gamecube players). Well, the games are better than the series itself, but for the most part, the stories are the same. But the characters do play a part in the plot, so I can\'t say that I can put the plot up high, like I would if we were just talking about the game.Art:Sonic SatAM: For me 8/10Sonic X: For me, 6/10This really depends on which Sonic you like better, honestly. They\'re drawn in two different styles and I prefer the older Sonic to the newer one. The art is pretty clean in Sonic X. It\'s also pretty good in Sonic SatAM. I think the backdrops in both are really good, and the character design again, really depends on which Sonic you like. Same with all the other characters. The only character that would make any real difference is probably Robotnik, as known as Eggman (Why?). I think his design was the most radical change ever (since he went from pointy headed with small, red eyes to... well, Eggman). Honestly, I like the newer Robotnik (Eggman) better. The Older one just was creepy. Although hilarious.Sound:Sonic SatAM: 10/10Sonic X: skklfjklsadjfkjdakkkkkkOpening themes:Sonic SatAM has THE BEST OPENING EVER. Like seriously, how could you not get pumped for the show when you heard it? If you weren\'t thrilled by the theme itself, you could get excited watching the opening animation itself. So there you go.While Sonic X\'s animation is pretty intense for reasons I can\'t explain other than running everywhere all the time, I can also say that the theme song is pretty meh. It reminds me of the Yu-Gi-Oh one or the Digimon one, only not executed well. The premise behind these themes is just to repeat the name of the show over and over again in the hopes that you\'ll remember the show with only a few other words that aren\'t like ""Digimon\' or whatever. Sonic X tries to do that, but it\'s not really well executed. I moreso got annoyed. There\'s only so many times I can here ""gotta go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster"" before I want to skip to the commercials for relief. But sometimes I\'m really stoked when I hear it, like, ""AW MAN I LOVE THIS"" and sometimes I\'m just like ""Eh."" And I really can\'t say that it\'s because the song is bad. I can\'t say that it\'s because it\'s good. So I don\'t know how to rate this. I just know that I\'m a fan of the opening theme for the most part.Voice Acting:Both series have their pitfalls, but I will give them both a pretty high score for voice acting, even if I don\'t think some characters matched their voices. As always, Knuckles is a favorite character and most people AGREE with his voice actor. Big sucks, but his voice did match his absolute suckiness. Amy\'s voice actor was good too. Rouge also. Only one voice would grate at my nerves for hours on end, CHRIS. And since he was in PRETTY MUCH EVERY EPISODE, everyone sounded okay in comparison, as long as he shut up.Character:Sonic SatAM: 7/10Sonic X: 2/10This is where Sonic SatAm can dull a little bit. Sonic SatAM consists of a wide range of characters, in what I call Sonic Syndrome. SEGA shows that they can\'t leave Sonic well enough alone by constantly adding new characters to the games without any real reason and then dropping them forever afterwards. Granted, all the characters in Sonic SatAM are in the comic series... but it\'s still sort of like ""Do any of these guys do anything but wait around for Sonic?"" And everyone always hates on Tails, but he\'s one of the only characters who is CONSISTENT in the series. Props, Tails. Props.Sonic X has the biggest case of  Pretentious Sonic Syndrome-- adding characters to the series and then acting like those characters are so totally canon. Prime Example: CHRIS AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. If you played the games, when you watch the show, you\'re like, ""What the fuck is this? Who thought this was a good idea? Why? Why?"" Yes, we get that Sonic enters \'our world\', but he never befriends a human to the point of living with him. I guess you could say that a hole in the plot of the games is that everything seems to take place in just about one or two days... but that\'s the entire point. Sonic is fast. When he saves the world, he does it quickly. He doesn\'t need Chris or Chuck or any of that stuff. And Chris isn\'t even well written, in my opinion. I don\'t know, I would just play the game at that point.Overall:Sonic SatAM: 10/10Sonic x: 1/10No, I\'m not going to be nice. I hate Sonic X. HATE. I went in thinking it would be good and, like any good Sonic fan, I defended the hell out of this show. But I blame 4Kids for the lack of creative process put into the show, and I honestly hope no one watches this  because holy crap, it is terrible. It\'s not even that the premise is bad, it\'s that it was executed terribly despite 4Kids having the thing set up in front of them. Seriously. The series was RIGHT THERE, already written out in all of it\'s fantastic gaming glory but no one thought to themselves, ""Hey, the people who watch this because they like Sonic are gonna get really pissed off."" On the other hand, if you like Sonic and old cartoons, you\'ll probably like Sonic SatAM (and probably think Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is hilarious/deplorable and that Sonic Underground shouldn\'t even exist). In other words, play the game or watch something else Sonic related. Like the straight-to-VHS movie, Sonic the Hedgehog. DEFINITELY WATCH THAT. Not this. This should be placed in the bowels of hell and forgotten about. time being humorous. It could balance seriousness and comedy and that was something that made the show so good. I mean, the show was about pollution for the most part, but Sonic and the others DID talk about other things AND created comedy out of the situation. You might not have realized you were learning about the environment, and you probably weren\'t really.

I think the backdrops in both are really good, and the character design again, really depends on which Sonic you like. Same with all the other characters. The only character that would make any real difference is probably Robotnik, as known as Eggman (Why?). I think his design was the most radical change ever (since he went from pointy headed with small, red eyes to... well, Eggman). Honestly, I like the newer Robotnik (Eggman) better. The Older one just was creepy. Although hilarious.Sound:Sonic SatAM: 10/10Sonic X: skklfjklsadjfkjdakkkkkkOpening themes:Sonic SatAM has THE BEST OPENING EVER. Like seriously, how could you not get pumped for the show when you heard it? If you weren\'t thrilled by the theme itself, you could get excited watching the opening animation itself. So there you go.While Sonic X\'s animation is pretty intense for reasons I can\'t explain other than running everywhere all the time, I can also say that the theme song is pretty meh. It reminds me of the Yu-Gi-Oh one or the Digimon one, only not executed well. The premise behind these themes is just to repeat the name of the show over and over again in the hopes that you\'ll remember the show with only a few other words that aren\'t like ""Digimon\' or whatever. Sonic X tries to do that, but it\'s not really well executed. I moreso got annoyed. There\'s only so many times I can here ""gotta go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster"" before I want to skip to the commercials for relief. But sometimes I\'m really stoked when I hear it, like, ""AW MAN I LOVE THIS"" and sometimes I\'m just like ""Eh."" And I really can\'t say that it\'s because the song is bad. I can\'t say that it\'s because it\'s good. So I don\'t know how to rate this. I just know that I\'m a fan of the opening theme for the most part.Voice Acting:Both series have their pitfalls, but I will give them both a pretty high score for voice acting, even if I don\'t think some characters matched their voices. As always, Knuckles is a favorite character and most people AGREE with his voice actor. Big sucks, but his voice did match his absolute suckiness. Amy\'s voice actor was good too. Rouge also. Only one voice would grate at my nerves for hours on end, CHRIS. And since he was in PRETTY MUCH EVERY EPISODE, everyone sounded okay in comparison, as long as he shut up.Character:Sonic SatAM: 7/10Sonic X: 2/10This is where Sonic SatAm can dull a little bit. Sonic SatAM consists of a wide range of characters, in what I call Sonic Syndrome. SEGA shows that they can\'t leave Sonic well enough alone by constantly adding new characters to the games without any real reason and then dropping them forever afterwards. Granted, all the characters in Sonic SatAM are in the comic series... but it\'s still sort of like ""Do any of these guys do anything but wait around for Sonic?"" And everyone always hates on Tails, but he\'s one of the only characters who is CONSISTENT in the series. Props, Tails. Props.Sonic X has the biggest case of  Pretentious Sonic Syndrome-- adding characters to the series and then acting like those characters are so totally canon. Prime Example: CHRIS AND HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. If you played the games, when you watch the show, you\'re like, ""What the fuck is this? Who thought this was a good idea? Why? Why?"" Yes, we get that Sonic enters \'our world\', but he never befriends a human to the point of living with him. I guess you could say that a hole in the plot of the games is that everything seems to take place in just about one or two days... but that\'s the entire point. Sonic is fast. When he saves the world, he does it quickly. He doesn\'t need Chris or Chuck or any of that stuff. And Chris isn\'t even well written, in my opinion. I don\'t know, I would just play the game at that point.Overall:Sonic SatAM: 10/10Sonic x: 1/10No, I\'m not going to be nice. I hate Sonic X. HATE. I went in thinking it would be good and, like any good Sonic fan, I defended the hell out of this show. But I blame 4Kids for the lack of creative process put into the show, and I honestly hope no one watches this  because holy crap, it is terrible. It\'s not even that the premise is bad, it\'s that it was executed terribly despite 4Kids having the thing set up in front of them. Seriously. The series was RIGHT THERE, already written out in all of it\'s fantastic gaming glory but no one thought to themselves, ""Hey, the people who watch this because they like Sonic are gonna get really pissed off."" On the other hand, if you like Sonic and old cartoons, you\'ll probably like Sonic SatAM (and probably think Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is hilarious/deplorable and that Sonic Underground shouldn\'t even exist). In other words, play the game or watch something else Sonic related. Like the straight-to-VHS movie, Sonic the Hedgehog. DEFINITELY WATCH THAT. Not this. This should be placed in the bowels of hell and forgotten about.', ""When I was a kid, I love sonic x to death and praise the dub back when I was watching it every Saturday morning of the 4kids block . But as I got older and starting to use the internet, I come a across many people ranting about 4kids who are the one who dub sonic x. As I start to know more of what they do to anime they got, I realize how much of my childhood I wasted. Now that I got that out of the way, lets me say that sonic x is a decent anime but didn't reach its potential when...it was announce. So here is my review of the show.Story:6/10The plot starts as sonic and his friends attacks Dr.eggman's base to rescue Cream and cheese. Sonic face him head on but an accident occurs that suddenly sends sonic and his friends to a different place in time I guess since the anime did a bad job of explaining that part. Later he meets up with Chris who lets him stay. The others are found and they start to look for the emeralds before Eggman can. Now my first issue is this. It gets very confusing as what I said before, did not explain much of how they got sent back in time. This has been later explain in season 2 but I'm still confuse!? Another problem is that it very cliche and I notice this a lot threw out the entire anime. This show had 3 seasons and to me the good ones are season 2 and 3 as season 2 follow mostly from the games with few changes and it works and season 3 having a decent plot arc. But in the U.S version you won't get the full story as their a lot of edits done in order to fit to children standards. I watch every episode dub and sub and I notice a lot of scenes cut  out and stuff they edit out in order to get a Y7 rating in america. Ya they pretty much rape it to death as far as everybody says. So for plot I give it a 6 for the japanese.Art:7/10The art is really decent for the most part. While not at the wow factor, it gets the job done. The bland background are really detailed and the character look well enough like their video game counter parts. The action scenes are really the best moment as the sense of speed looks so well. So art it did its job.Music:8/10Now music is pretty decent. The opening is good but I like the ending songs the most. My favorite has to be ending 3 because I just freaking love those beats. And the background music did good to fits its scene but we don't get that in the in the U.S oh no we get very bland music 4kids made which is epic crap! The only piece of music I like is the opening and thats it! So music I give it a 8 in japanese while I give the 4kids a 1 and thats because of the opening.English dubs vs english subs:4kids this has to be one of your worst dubs ever! Well not as bad as one piece but still its bad! Now the voices are actually pretty natural for the U.S but the main problem is the script! 4kids hired script writers who don't know what sonic is. This is fail fail fail as its so simple it just makes me sick! Now the japanese is a lot better with better voice acting and dialoge so watch it but please avoid the english dub at all cost!Winner: English subsCharacters:6/10The character are just like their video game counterparts. In the japanese, I praise it for trying to add more depth to the characters. I actually care more about them. You wont get that in the dub as they try to simplify it so kids can understand it. As for the new characters, they are hit or miss. Some I do like while others are pretty much useless like Chris who is just there to be friends with sonic and the anime mostly focus on him which really waste time. There is also Cosmo and she just there to be a love interest to tail with some few exceptions. So character I give a six.Enjoyment:6/10Well the japanese version is where I get the most enjoyment out of. The dub pretty much knock it all down with its edits and bad writing! While not great, it is what its worth a watch so I watch it if you have some time to waste but only subtitles. Parents don't let your kids watch this in dub because if you do, once they become anime fans, They'll realize they have wasted part of their childhood like I did.Overall:6/10 Fair at best it was announce.

SA2 ark,when sonic and shadow fought finnal hazzard,and live and learn played...i loved it!!!season 3 was ok,chris was useful for once(holy crap)and was less annoying,and tails finnaly got some love!', 'Sonic X was a favorite of mine back in the day. When the show aired on Saturday mornings, courtesy of the CW4kids, the Sonic fan in me tuned in every Saturday to watch the adventures of Chris Thorndyke and his stranded alien, animal, anthropomorphic friends. What Sega hoped to do what this series was popularize the brand by conveying Sonic\'s video game adventures in a television format.Does it work? Sort of . . . It gets some things right but some things wrong.Story (7/10): Season 1 is a mostly episodic set-up that details the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (I mean, Sonic and Chris)....The first episode details how Chaos Control (teleportation, a power granted by the Chaos Emeralds) mis-used by Eggman whisks Sonic and his friends away from their planet, Mobius, to the real world. There, Sonic and his friends take shelter at the home of a lonely, 12-year-old rich kid name Chris\'s mansion. In fear of what would happen if their identities were revealed, Chris tries to help Sonic and co. stay below the public eye (though these attempts ultimately prove futile). As you can tell by this premise, there are little to no overarching plot details, so I\'ll have to judge the episodic story lines by what merits do have. They\'re a blend of action and slice-of-life sitcom antics that worked okay for me at the time but thinking back on it now, come off as rather bland. The central reason behind this is how oddly slow-paced this show is.Most modern cartoon series know that kids tend to prefer a faster pace. It lends itself to more intense action, snappier comedy, and compelling events. These things help keep aforementioned target audience interested. Unfortunately, Sonic X doesn\'t really do this. Even as a kid, I recall yawning during most of these season 1 episodes because the writers spent way too much time on conversational scenes that have no weight. Because of the archetypal nature of these characters, conversations in the boring mansion backdrop aren\'t going to entertain, especially when they\'re sparse on humor. Oddly enough, the human characters are used for humor more often than Sonic\'s group, who seem to take their conflicts a bit too seriously. This results in an uneven tone that only kept me hooked because I cared about the Sonic characters.Season two picks things up a bit, adapting plots from Sonic Adventures 1 and 2, only using the human characters established in the series. Now, this was a bit more compelling. From Sonic and Shadow\'s duels, to the climatic battles between titanic foes, season 2 was action-packed and filled with thrills that entertained me at the time. There\'s a surprising bit of pathos behind the stories, and even the slower-paced conversational scenes worked better because it felt there was actually something to talk about. Sure, 12-year-old wish fulfillment was at play here, but it was still a LOT more enjoyable than season 1.Season three is . . . weird. This time around, Eggman\'s not even an antagonist, but an occasional ally. The foe this time around is a space-fearing race known as the Meterax who are in pursuit of an OC for reasons established during the plot. It\'s the series attempt at an overarching story, and it does a decent job. The Meterax are pretty bland as far as overlords go, but to its credit, the arc is fairly well-executed Ensemble darkhorses like Shadow and Rogue only get bit parts (unfortunately), but otherwise, it\'s a decently executed (if not terribly distinct) storyline.Art (5/10): Ugh. TMS does not bring their best here at all. Very little here is well-done. The colors are bland, the backgrounds are forgettable, and the animation is limited during conversations and cuts corners during fight scenes. This is egregious because a series like Sonic should be more fast-paced (pun totally intended), not a weird mix of camera pans, looped animation, and dragged frames. The human character designs are bland, with little to distinguish them from the anime grain.To its credit, though, the Sonic characters are rendered accurately. Sure, Snic has less quills than he normally does, but TMS brings their designs to traditional animation form about as accurately as one could do so. If only they moved a little more . . .Sound (8/10): Whether America\'s ""Gotta Go Fast"" or Japan\'s ""Sonic Drive"", I remember Sonic X for its iconic themes. They were catchy, upbeat, and opening themes that really capture the tone of the video game series. The 4kids score, however, was pretty weak and didn\'t have any memorable tones. The anime\'s, however, was well-done and matched the on-screen action well.The future ending themes for Sonic X in Japan were strong as well. T.O.P was my personal favorite. Combined with cool on-screen visuals, it conveyed the smooth, cool side of Sonic exceptionally well.While the English dub of this series is well-cast, it\'s not terribly well-acted. Besides its script inconsistencies, the voice acting is stiff and awkward at times (it would take time for this cast to come into their own). Conversely, the Japanese voice isn\'t terribly well-cast, but its much better acted. I wouldn\'t blame most people if they watched the sub on Hulu because of this.Character (6/10): I mentioned earlier that Sonic and his friends are archetypal, but that doesn\'t mean they have to be boring. These video game characters have enough personality that they should be able to drive a series like this. Unfortunately, they don\'t get enough screen time and what little they do get is marred by underwhelming comedy, and poorly-executed build up to episodic conflicts. Sonic, in particular, feels like an enigmatic drifter who we only cut to when we need him. He\'s got his cocky, classical anti-hero style traits like he does in the video games, but they don\'t shine through here because the main character spot is taken by Chris Throndyke, an utterly forgettable progtagonist. Ash Ketchum and the lead from the Beyblade series look compelling compared to this guy\'s generic niceness, really looks up to Sonic as role model stuff. His one distinctive trait (his lonely rich kid side) doesn\'t get enough screen time or development to be interesting. To his credit, though, his emotion in some particularly tear-jerking scenes does ring true.The other human characters are pretty boring. The butler has his moments but isn\'t strong enough to be memorable, the scientist is bland in much the same Chris is, and the maid is a boring stereotype. Chris\'s uncle, Sam, is a weak Human Torch expy, and the President is about as memorable as an unnamed president would be.One of the only strong characters in the human cast is Topaz, an original character who is a member of GUN. Her vitriolic relationship with Rogue is well-executed, and she\'s played refreshing straight as a normal person swept into these events without her consent. A couple one-shot humans, like a traumatized GUN soldier in seasons 2, and Helen in season 3,  are also portrayed effectively and show more distinctiveness than their supporting/main character peers.As for Sonic\'s friends, they have their canon traits. Amy loves Sonic, yet is kinda violent to everyone else, Cream is the enthusiastic younger sister type character, Knuckles is, well, a knucklehead who is kinda slow at times, and Tails is the upbeat, ready to help sidekick. These personalities don\'t get a lot of limelight in season 1, but get some tests in seasons 2 and 3. These moments are refreshing, but they certainly don\'t take them out of one-note character. Dr. Eggman is admittedly entertaining, and he gets really cool a couple times late in the series but is mostly a bright spot because the rest of the cast is that bland. It\'s bit post-morteum to say this now, but his robot buddies, Decoe and Boccoe, are only good for a couple gags.Enjoyment (6/10): I LOVED this series when I was younger. For all its flaws, it was my favorite characters on the TV screen, battling evil, going through drama, and having fun together. Does it really stack up for me now?Honestly, there are so many other series that fill the quotient for this series better. It has a really yawn-inducing first season, and the next two seasons, while decently-executed, don\'t stand out much from its contemporaries. The main reason I\'ll remember this series is because of how nostalgic it was, and that despite its slow pace, I still tuned in every week I could.So, props for that.Overall (6/10): Don\'t watch this series if you\'re not a fan of the franchise, casual or otherwise. But, if you are, this series might be diverting. If you can make it past season 1, there are legitimately enjoyable plots, scenes, and character dramas. It\'s just not gonna appeal much to those who don\'t care about the franchise already. The first episode details how Chaos Control (teleportation, a power granted by the Chaos Emeralds) mis-used by Eggman whisks Sonic and his friends away from their planet, Mobius, to the real world.

Sonic, the blue, funny and fast hedgehog, is the main protagonist of this show. He is the hero, the knight in shining armor, the... okay lets just skip his intro. We all know who Sonic is so there's no need to explain his background. He appears in a lot of videogames and is the mascot character of Sega. In this show he is portrayed as a cool, cocky and fast character. He is headstrong and always runs before he thinks. His goal is to stop Dr. Eggman from obtaining the Chaos Emeralds.Dr....Eggman, Sonic's power hungry arch-enemy, is a mad scientist who wants all of the 7 Chaos Emeralds in order to gain absolute power (...for some reason).Supporting cast: essentially, anyone who is not Sonic or Dr. Eggman is a supporting cast member. Even the human protagonist, Christopher Thorndyke had been converted to being a simple damsel in distress. In fact most of the main cast was there just to help Sonic. Other than that they were pretty much useless.Honorable mention goes to Shadow and Rouge, who are by far the coolest characters with the best backstories aside from Sonic himself.The story seems very generic with the hero finding things in order to defeat the main villain. In Sonic X's case, he bursts into Dr. Eggman's base right when he was about to achieve absolute power. Sonic interferes with his plan which causes an explosion that transports everyone to Earth. After that, Sonic and his friends team up with Chris to collect all the Chaos Emeralds in order for them to get home and defeat Dr. Eggman.Art/Animation (6/10): The art/animation was watchable but nothing stood out as interesting.Sound/Music (6/10): Generic. Nothing stood out as interesting except for the theme song. I found that to be very catchy.Dub or Sub?: Sub. If you plan on watching this, go with the sub/Japanese version. They edited a lot of violent stuff out of the Japanese version when they created the American version. The American version was very kid friendly. The english dub voice acting was acceptable but the dialogue wasn't very good.Enjoyment (6/10): The show entertained me when I was young but now, I mainly see it as a waste of time. The only thing that was worthwhile was any interactions/battles that took place between Sonic and Dr. Eggman.Summary/Overall (6/10): Overall, this is a kid's show so all of the things that I listed above are not important. The story is generic. The characters are uninteresting (aside from the four I mentioned above). The art and sound aren't that impressive. And, the show does absolutely no justice to any of the Sonic videogames that I played as a child.Review #5 Eggman, Sonic's power hungry arch-enemy, is a mad scientist who wants all of the 7 Chaos Emeralds in order to gain absolute power (...for some reason).Supporting cast: essentially, anyone who is not Sonic or Dr. Eggman is a supporting cast member. Even the human protagonist, Christopher Thorndyke had been converted to being a simple damsel in distress. In fact most of the main cast was there just to help Sonic. Other than that they were pretty much useless.Honorable mention goes to Shadow and Rouge, who are by far the coolest characters with the best backstories aside from Sonic himself.The story seems very generic with the hero finding things in order to defeat the main villain. In Sonic X's case, he bursts into Dr. Eggman's base right when he was about to achieve absolute power. Sonic interferes with his plan which causes an explosion that transports everyone to Earth. After that, Sonic and his friends team up with Chris to collect all the Chaos Emeralds in order for them to get home and defeat Dr. Eggman.Art/Animation (6/10): The art/animation was watchable but nothing stood out as interesting.Sound/Music (6/10): Generic.

But to me, that brings up the question, why does this thing exist in the first place?Story - 3/10In terms of the series plot, well... it does not really have a plot until later in the series, the first 26 episodes of this is just basicly Sonic and freinds going on an adventure to find the Chaos emeralds to get back hime after being transported to earth. After the first...26 episodes is the first time where the plot has any significance. To bad they were lazy and just took the plots from the two Sonic Adventure games and made a terrible adaption of it. Really, the only arc with some ounce of effort put it was the last one, Even that was not very orignal.Animation - 1/10Then there\'s the art, which is some of the worst I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Only a very small percentage of the shows 78 episodes have well drawn, on model animation. And I will admit, those few episodes looked fantastic. But then theres everything else. God. The Sonic Stadium fourms has a thread dedicated to the many different animation styles in the show. And trust me, there are many disgusting ones in there.Music - 7/10The music for the show is actually pretty good. The music that plays in the episodes fits it well enough, but I am more focusing on the shows opening and three ending themes, all of which are fantastic and well worth listening to.Characters - 2/10Then theres the characters, and I may as well talk about the shows true main character, Chris Thorndyke. I\'m serious, he is the only character in the show to get any backstory, or development... To bad he is a unlikable brat. Moving on, we have the ""main"" character, Sonic, who really only appears at the end of the episode to defeat the Eggmans schemes at the end of most episodes, most of the time he\'s just lying around doing nothing. No one in the rest of the cast is important at all to be honest, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, Cream, just for the most part stand in the background and watch Chris whine and Sonic do all the work. The only character in the show who\'s worth a damn is Dr. Eggman, and without him, this would be even more painful than the show already is, he is the only source of relief in the whole show, he\'s a funny and fun to watch.Overall - 1/10Don\'t watch this show. There is almost nothing in it that\'s worth watching it for. If you want to listen to the opening and endings, you can just listen to them on youtube. Stay away, it\'s not worth you\'re time. And if you just have to watch this trainwreck, avoid the 4kids dub like the plauge. 26 episodes is the first time where the plot has any significance.

As a fan of Sonic, this show is less enjoyable than the games. the characters are bad, and the voice acting is not great. especially the English dub. The story is also nothing special the only thing i like about the show is its  English theme song which became a meme. Sonic X turns out to be a good anime but with bad parts if you want a great Sonic cartoon, there's the sonic the hedgehog cartoon from 1991 (Not AOSTH). "", 'Hey, do you know Sonic?

All in all a comfy procedure.The comedy might not be for everyone, but it isn\'t bad.Then, when the second half began, a lot changed. The show was given a whole new setting and...the plot was primarily focused. This made the whole Anime way more interesting and kept the viewer hooked, who was looking for more action, more storytelling and most importantly a certain meaning.I don\'t want to say that the first half was bad or anything, it\'s just that the second was a lot more interesting and fun to watch. It is the reason why this show is considered to be good.The first half was pretty slow paced, while the second was the exact opposite.The ending of the show is something very significant. It is really sad. Not a happy ending, just the bland reality.

It teaches you to beware a healthy mind and do the right thing.You learn for your life while watching this. Something you can\'t say for every show.That means, yes.

This review might also contain some spoilers which I apologize for.----------I will admit right here and right now that I dislike video games and find no use for them; as a result, I have never played any of the Sonic the Hedgehog video games. I have only started watching this anime was because my friends are addicted to Sonic, they have played all the games, watched all the series, and more. This anime is obviously recommended for younger viewers; however I do believe some people forget that. I believe the other...people who usually rate this anime a low rating of 1-4 usually compare it to the video games produced. The only thing I recommend is that people should start thinking to themselves that Sonic X is a Japanese animation made solely for the enjoyment of others, and is not a sequel or an adaption of its video games.The anime Sonic X explains the adventures of Sonic and his friends as they travel to the human world, and communicate with the people around them. I will admit that when I watched the first episode that it really gave quite a show, it didn’t make mistakes like the past Sonic animation adaption.  However, as the series goes on it gets quite repetitive with Dr. Egg man trying to rule over the world and defeat Sonic, but in the end Sonic always defeats his crazed inventions. Which takes me to another point; the crazed inventions manufactured by Dr. Egg man are in no doubt extremely different from your average robot. The robots produced by Dr. Egg man are usually robots that are used for different things like a teaching, sporting, and more. The robots are also strange looking robots with a multitude of colors on them which are great for younger viewers. Near the end of season 1, things finally start to get suspenseful and emotional which creates a perfect reaction where the viewers may start to tear up due to the overall greatness of what is happening.Characters shown in the anime are excellently showing character development, however one problem this anime makes is that Sonic himself does not get that much view time because he is usually running, in fact Sonic is mostly seen running when he is usually not defeating Dr. Egg man. Usually Chris is sucking most of the air time in the anime. The main human protagonist of Sonic X, is a young boy named Chris Thorndyke who is your average 12 year old rich boy. Chris’s mother is a well known movie star, his father an owner of a large company, his uncle a famous race car driver, and his grandpa a scientist. Chris is what I would to describe to be very different from average kids his own age, unlike your normal 12 year olds, Chris does not beg or cry or even bug his parents about anything, and he is what I call too mature. Chris being to mature for his age can create problems for younger audiences because they can’t really relate to him in anyway; consequently he is usually seen to people as an unneeded character to the anime.The drawing style of Sonic X is not something to die for; it is your usual mix of anime and Western cartoon. The characters are fairly well drawn, not the best, but it’s something that anyone can bare with. What bothers me the most when it comes to the art is that way animals are drawn, they need to look a little more realistic too me. The background drawings are usually well drawn with distinct features added into them. One thing I mostly enjoy about the anime is its use of colors, the colors are usually bold and bright which help show some mood in the anime.The Japanese music in the anime is what I enjoy the most. Opening 1 of Sonic X called “Sonic Drive” is very upbeat which I enjoy to listen too. The only problem is, is that there is only one opening for the anime which some people may fine boring to listen to after a while. The ending songs of the anime are very calm and peaceful which I like to listen too. The voice actors do an excellent job at portraying the character’s attitudes in the anime. The sound effects are also used perfectly in the correct situation which helps add the needed feel to the anime.What I enjoyed most about Sonic X is its hilarious moments in the anime. At time to time while watching Sonic X I would always end up laughing out loud which, as a result causes my parents to yell at me to shut up. However, when I don’t fine any of the moment’s funny, I would usually snuffle a yawn or a mere “eh.” During the fighting moments I would usually just get pretty bored with them because they happen in pretty much every episode, even in a mere baseball game its still considered fighting there. Overall I would rate my enjoyment level at a 7. I recommend this anime for people who enjoy the usual mix of Action and Comedy, however the anime does get repetitive which I understand can get greatly annoying. If you are a huge fan of the Sonic franchise, and you have played all its video games than I don't know if I could recommend it to you or not because some people may be angered for the fact that humans are involved in the anime, while some people may find it intriguing to see the Sonic characters interacting with humans. So it just greatly depends on what are your likes and dislikes. people who usually rate this anime a low rating of 1-4 usually compare it to the video games produced.

Then end up going to space towards the end. The Story really boring. If You aren't a hard core sonic fan you won't enjoy this anime. However this anime is not complex at all so even your average joe can enjoy it.Art: The art work is decent you can still have some amusement by looking at the characters. The art work on tails and amy are great they have really improved.Sound: I can say the anime does have good english dub the jp...dub everyone sounds like women the opening to the jp version of the anime alot better.characters: the personalitys are pretty dull compare to the sonic 1993 seriesevery character seems like a girl, there emo and  when they  try to be funny itit's either funny or fail. dub everyone sounds like women the opening to the jp version of the anime alot better.characters: the personalitys are pretty dull compare to the sonic 1993 seriesevery character seems like a girl, there emo and  when they  try to be funny itit's either funny or fail."", 'Okay, this is my first ever review on here, so this may really suck... But here we go.First let me say that I\'m not even going to bother with the 4Kids dub. The dub was so terrible that it\'s one of the biggest reasons why I regret ever watching this. I\'m going to focus on the original Japanese version as much as I can and just pretend that the 4Kids dub never existed. Everyone knows how much 4Kids ruins anime. But with that out of the way, let\'s get started with the actual review.This was one of the very first anime series I remember loving...when I was a kid. I remember even rewatching some of the episodes over and over and constantly talking about it with my friends and always drawing the characters. But now that I\'ve grown up and matured a bit more, I think to myself: Was it really that good? Unfortunately, no, it wasn\'t as good as I remember it being. However, I didn\'t think it was TERRIBLE exactly. It\'s a typical anime based off of a video game. You can\'t expect it to be spectacular.Story: 6/10.The story, if I can remember, is about Dr. Eggman collecting all seven of the Chaos Emeralds and also captures Cream the Rabbit, so Sonic comes to try and save Cream and take the Emeralds out of Eggman\'s hands. All this leads to an accident where a very large explosion occurs and Sonic and all his friends are then transported to Earth, not knowing how they can return to their home planet, Mobius. All seven of the Chaos Emeralds have been scattered around Earth and now Sonic and his friends must collect them all before Eggman does.The story itself wasn\'t horrible. It wasn\'t breathtaking and thrilling, but it wasn\'t horrible. It\'s really no worse than any other typical kid\'s anime plot. The characters are separated from their home planet, they do what they can do to help the planet that they\'ve landed on, and they eventually make their way home. Plus it\'s also got some cliche mech-like fighting with all the air force pilots and robots and the transformations for getting super powers, so again, it\'s like your typical cliche, anime plot. It\'s nothing too special. Pretty cheesy, but nothing horrible.Art: 7/10.The art was actually pretty decent. The environments were very colorful and vivid and the lighting was average. They would sometimes overdo the lighting effects and make things too bright and I thought they overdid that a bit. However, the scenery itself, again, was very vivid and pretty. The city scenes were nothing special, but when they\'d focus more on Sonic\'s world, the scenery was just very enjoyable to look at. The character designs were decent as well. It had the same, unique style that Sonic has had for years. The characters just really stick out and I still enjoy their designs. Unlike your typical chibi cat with dot eyes and a 3-shaped mouth, they just have their own, unique style which to me seemed like an American cartoon style mixed with the anime style, and that again, is what I thought was so unique about the style. So the art was, in my honest opinion, very well done, but they could have used less light effects.Sound: 6/10.To be honest, a lot of the tracks sounded the same to me... Then again, I usually don\'t pay too much attention to the soundtracks in anime. They all had a good, jumpy, actiony feel to them while others had just a sort of ""sit back and relax"" feel... If that made any sense. The opening theme, in my opinion, was pretty terrible. I liked how the clips were all put together, but the song was just kind of awful. Again, just my opinion. However, the ending theme for the last season was very charming to me. It was a sweet, little love song and just in general had a cute scene going on. I enjoyed some tracks in this anime, but most of them just sounded the same to me.Character: 5/10. They were quirky enough. A lot of the characters just had a pretty sarcastic personality. Some were hostile and impatient, others were sweet and social. Most of the human characters were pretty irritating and were generally useless and so were a few of the animal characters. Some of the characters were pretty much just there to get in the way and others just showed up for some filler episodes, so the characters weren\'t really that special. They had some silly dialog here and there, but they weren\'t anything that made my jaw drop in awe.Enjoyment: 5/10.It wasn\'t horrible, but it isn\'t the sort of thing that I\'d sit down and watch again. It had it\'s silly, quirky moments, but nothing that would make me go ""Hey, let\'s go watch some Sonic X! YEAH!!"". That\'s probably one of the last things I\'d say.Overall: 4/10.I enjoyed the fighting scenes and some of the silly, arguing scenes. The art, again, was nice to look at and the story wasn\'t horrible. I thought it was more cliche than anything. The soundtrack was okay and the characters were fine. Personally, I thought a lot of the episodes were just boring, filler episodes, but they didn\'t make me wanna throw up. They just weren\'t that entertaining. So again, the anime is rather cliche and just had a lot of filler episodes, but it wasn\'t outrageously horrible. Not something I\'d sit down and watch again, but still not as horrible as people say it is. Just avoid watching the 4Kids dub and it should be an okay anime. when I was a kid. I remember even rewatching some of the episodes over and over and constantly talking about it with my friends and always drawing the characters.

Personally, I thought a lot of the episodes were just boring, filler episodes, but they didn\'t make me wanna throw up. They just weren\'t that entertaining. So again, the anime is rather cliche and just had a lot of filler episodes, but it wasn\'t outrageously horrible. Not something I\'d sit down and watch again, but still not as horrible as people say it is. Just avoid watching the 4Kids dub and it should be an okay anime.', ""Utterly a masterpiece, I'm an epic gamer so of course I understand the greatness of an epic gamer anime.The story was really empowering, watching as a cast of outsiders try to blend in and become accepting with the society they've been thrusted into due to an unfortunate incident. They go from becoming outsiders to becoming heroes, and just thinking about it makes me shed a tear at how masterfully the story and structure was handled, I never felt like I wasted a single minute.The animation rivals that of the greatest shows, with a musical number that makes me cry with how wonderful the instrumentation and...proper toning blends together to create the greatest soundtrack.Oh, and the characters! The characters are also stunning, I never seen an anime with such a wide cast of characters, each and every character getting the screentime they deserve.I greated enjoyed this anime and would truly recommend it to my fellow gamers. Sonic X is a must watch piece of history, along with Kirby Right Back at Ya and Mew Mew Power.i like the 4kids dub and sometimes my mom watches it with me and i saw 13 episodes but i missed one because i woke up late. i dont know how to understand japanese proper toning blends together to create the greatest soundtrack.Oh, and the characters!

They were not only fun, but something that simply drew me in was the link you'd create with some of the characters. Sonic X is not exactly that kind of anime. For hardcore fans of the series like myself, it is without any doubts something you have to watch, but if you aren't, then you might be disappointed.The plot of the story, or should I say storieS since Sonic X is splitted in 3 segments, each covering different arcs. The first arc was a bit painful, a slice-of-life style that just...didn't feel right. The second and third arcs were really enjoyable for me though. The references to Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle were well placed. The games obviously did it better, but it is still nice to see such spinoff.The ending, or the 3rd arc, is what the first should've been. They picked up an actual story they've and made it progress through the last few episodes. It was... weird, yet fun to watch. This anime is definitively not the best spinoff that could have been made, but I would recommend it to any hardcore fans of the Sonic saga. didn't feel right.

The anime is about Sonic and friends trying to stop Doctor Ivo Robotnik (Or just simply Eggman). While fighting him, Chaos Control happens, sending Sonic & Co. from the planet of Mobius to Earth. While running across Station Square, Sonic lands in a pool, and a young boy named Christopher Thorndyke goes to rescue him.As the plot goes on, Sonic meets some of his friends, such as Cream the Rabbit and Miles ""Tails"" Prower, also meeting a long-time rival, Knuckles the Echidna. It\'s from there that the...Adventure Arc. starts up and characters from Sonic Adventure show up. If you\'ve played Sonic Adventure, you already know the plot, but otherwise, you\'ll enjoy it.Art style:For me, I loved all the visuals from this show. Everything looked amazing and the visuals for the anime were down-right stunning. The characters in it are similar to their regular video game models, but with more detail than their Dreamcast models.Sound:The voice acting can be either good or bad for some people. In the English Dub, I loved Mike Pollock as Dr. Eggman, he plays the role perfectly and is the current voice actor to this day. Jason Griffith and others also do a fairly good job on their characters, aside from a certain future character. Sonic\'s Japanese Voice Actor also does a good job as Sonic, but I will admit that I haven\'t seen much of the Japanese version. For the most part, these voices fit their characters.Characters:Sonic has his personality like he does in current games: Cocky, cheesy, cool, but can be serious when the time comes. Christopher Thorndyke is annoying a lot of the time, but gets a lot better in Season 3. I\'ll only talk about three more, and these three are Team Chaotix. Vector is a clumsy goof who has it in for Cream\'s mother, Vanilla. *Ba dum tss.* Espio is a ninja, so he\'s much more calm and cool than the other two. Charmy is what a Six-Year-Old should be: Hyperactive, full of energy, moving around a lot, and talking a lot. I love all three of these characters, especially Vector. Sonic can be dumb at times, but Sonic always has been like this. Tails is the smart one, but admires Sonic like an older brother. Knuckles is very, very stupid. Amy is your typical fangirl, obsessing over Sonic. Eggman\'s robot assistants, Decoe and Bocoe are your Scratch and Grounder of this show. They can be dumb. Bokkun is like a child, whining over simple things. I won\'t talk about every character, cause I\'d spoil some of the future characters, but they\'re similar to their video game counterparts.Enjoyment:Growing up with Sonic the Hedgehog, I can say that this show was great. If you\'re watching the English dub, even with all the edits compared to the Japanese version, you\'ll enjoy at least some of the roles, especially Mike Pollock as Dr. Eggman. That\'s easily one of the best roles in the show. If you liked Sonic Adventure and Sonic Battle, you\'ll enjoy it a lot!Overall:I love the art-style of all these characters. I love most of these characters. I love the story. I love most of the voice acting. I like the soundtrack to this show. Either way, yes, I do recommend this show. If you like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, and Sonic Battle, you\'re going to, at the very least, love Seasons 1 and 2. This anime gets an 8/10. It was a great show, and if you\'re a fan of the blue blur like myself, you\'re going to love this show. Adventure Arc. starts up and characters from Sonic Adventure show up.

This is not that show. This turned into a sad little piece that 4 kids decided to dumb down and destroy. I wish this was redubbed like they did for One Piece where it was redubbed with better voices and actually whole, not cut up into strange looking segments.Now the story line is kind of well done, in the idea that it is pretty consistent though it became full of fillers and monster a day type of story. The characters personalities...seem to have changed from when I was younger and most of the other characters, I don’t remember being in any other show and so sadly, I have no base to them. Knuckles sounds more like a jackass and Tails seems a bit more of a wimp. Tails feels like hes almost a Mary Sue character. Almost anything bad that happens, he seems to have a gaget that will get them out of the pinch. For instance, in the third episode (American Dub) When Tails’ prapellers break, he just presses a couple buttons and he turns it into a jet plane. I guess Sonic would be considered a Mary Sue character as well in a sence. Not as bad as Tails but still bad in that he is pretty much gets out of a jam when he needs to.I do have to say that I really hate Amy. Not only is her voice bad but her personality is just a bitch. She is so infatuated with Sonic that she pretty much only becomes a bad ass if someone is badmouthing Sonic and when they aren’t (and even when they are sometimes) she really can’t do much. Where does she keep pulling the hammer out of anyway? At least the others seem to have a viable looking weapon that you can understand them using. The only real personality that stayed the same was Sonic and Eggman, even if they changed Eggman’s name.Another little name thing is that the Grandpa’s name is Chuck, just like the Uncle in Sonic the Hedgehog Satam.I do have a question though; I don’t remember Sonic having trouble swimming. Has it just been really long since I have seen it or am I right in saying he didn’t have that much problem before? I also don’t really remember him going super saiyan as well. And how does Tails transform his pain into a bunch of different forms? Why wouldn’t he just have the jet one on its own?Now, 4 kids have destroyed this whole show. I wouldn’t touch the dub they created because it’s just really stupid. They cut out a ton of scenes and did a photoshop to a lot of parts they did leave in. It was ok for those that didn’t know better, but if you have to do this edit, DON’T LICENSE IT!The artwork is rather well done, as crisp as you could probably get when trying to imitate an old art style from America. At least, that’s what it feels like. It was designed with children in mind so the characters mostly look like chibi creatures and the style feels interesting.The music is alright, and is pretty much is similar to the video games. The voices, surprisingly, might be the best that 4 kids used and that’s saying a lot. I do like the snarky voice of Sonic, and its better then what has happened sometimes but most of the others are rather bad. Amy’s voice is really really terrible and Cream’s voice is odd and squeaky. seem to have changed from when I was younger and most of the other characters, I don’t remember being in any other show and so sadly, I have no base to them.

just want to say,I don\'t hate Sonic X completely and it is not the worst anime ever.It\'s just a bad anime.I just went out there.Story 7/10To be honest,Sonic X started out...Horrible when it came to story but as soon as Season 2,Japanese version,came out,I was interested in the anime.It was good but if there was no Sonic games already,I would have enjoyed the story but it wasn\'t very good compared to the games.Season 3 was very interesting,though.I really liked Cosmo and Chris became a TAD...less annoying and actually DID SOMETHING USEFUL!But I\'ll save that for later.Although,I didn\'t like the SA series adaptions and I would like to see what they could do for a Sonic heroes adaption.They could have done that,too.They have every character and they had a perfect chance to bring in Omega.Even though,they would probobly replace him with Chris Thorndyke.Art 4/10I know what you\'ll say ""The art is wonderful!How dare you!?""And all I have to say about that is the art was alright for 2003 work but no art stood out.I,really didn\'t like what they made Rouge and Shadow look like compared to the games.Chris Thorndyke looks alot like Sora which insults all Kingdom hearts fans out there.So sorry if you like the artwork and graphics but in my opinion,I wasn\'t interested.Sound 3/10I didn\'t hear much sound affects.Characters 2/10I\'m only going to review the main characters so don\'t expect Team Chaotix,Big or Helen to be here.SonicOkay,all I have to say is,I forgot to mention inArt that they made his design perfect for an anime!Infact,there are several things they got right about our blue blur.Such as...I will get alot of hate for this but I LIKED JASON GRIFFITH!There,I said it!I think he\'s better than Roger Craig Smith and people have to live with it!But,despite the things I like about him,such as SonAmy moments,I found him obnoxious throughout the whole thing!He was a spoilt little brat who kept running away,even though,he was told that he had to stay in the house or he would cause trouble!I did like his obsession with flowers,though.But the worst thing about him was the fact that he wasn\'t even the main character of the show!Chris ThorndykeThis guy is!Oh my goodness!What do I have to say?Whenever I need to describe this character,all I think of is Ash from pokemon except,he isn\'t likeable and he is much worse than Ash!If you watch Sonic X and then play some Sonic games,all you think of is WTF!?He takes Amy\'s role on convincing Shadow to be a good guy,Rouge\'s role on reminding Shadow of Maria and a few other roles.He is also an overpowered character!At one point of Sonic X,he was kidnapped by Doctor Eggman and strapped to METAL BARS BOLTED TO THE WALL!And guess what happened:He broke through them and grabbed a chaos emerald while falling off the ship or something like that(That\'s what I remembered from that episode).Not to mention,he is a furry!He is either,in love with Sonic,in love with Shadow or he\'s in love with both of them!If you thought SonElise was bad,this is worse!No offence to people who are homosexual,but this kid to 12 years old and he goes around chasing hedgehogs at the age of 15 and older than 50!This kid has issues!I\'m not going to explain anymore because this is a mile long when it comes to Chris Thorndyke!Expect to see this kid in alot of worst Sonic characters list as a really high number!Thank Jesus,he\'s not in the games!Oh,and did I mention he\'s voiced by a female?Miles""Tails""ProwerI like Tails!In the games AND Sonic X.Too bad,Chris took all his screen time and best friend.Tailsmo for the win!Tails\'s voice in Sonic X is very annoying,though.No offence to Amy Palant but I\'m just wondering where on earth,this Tails voice comes from.It\'s better than Tails\'s heroes voice,though.My only actual characterization flaw compared to his games counterpart is he isn\'t as intelligent as the Tails in the game.But I did like how he got much more attention in season 3,particularly the last 2 episodes but I won\'t give any spoilers(I\'m pretty sure alot of you know it,though)and I loved how they gave Tails a sweetheart who I really liked.Amy RoseOh,I hate what they did to her!The creators of Sonic X didn\'t like Amy and Knuckles so they did their best to make them sucky characters!To that,I say DEAL WITH IT!They made Amy an extremly agressive character who is nowhere near an excellent love intrest for Sonic and now she one of the most hated Sonic characters.This agressive behavior actually made it to the games!If you Sonic fans had never noticed,Amy wasn\'t agressive in the SA series or Sonic heroes.I know,she was agressive in Sonic Shuffle but that game was forgotten for a Dreamcast game.To be honest,I actually LIKE Amy Rose!She is meant to be annoying,it\'s part of her character so I respect her as a character.They did do one thing right with Amy and that was:THEY GAVE HER THE PERFECT VOICE!Liza Ortiz is one of my favorite actors!Her job as Lina Universe was spectacular!But she went so far,she voiced Amy!I loved this voice the moment I heard Amy in the first episode!In the Olympic games,I\'m playing as Blaze or Amy. Blaze,because she is awesome and Amy,just so I can hear Liza Ortiz\'s Amy voice.But all good things come to an end when Cindy Robinson took over.Knuckles the EchidnaOkay,Knuckles was a good character in the SA series and okay in Sonic heroes but...The creators of Sonic X didn\'t like him either so they made a WHOLE NEW CHARACTER!They gave him Dan Green who,I don\'t hate but,his voice wasn\'t right for Knuckles,made him yell in every sentence and gave him a stupid Knucklehead personality!Okay,at first,I liked Knuckles because he was funny and when he was yelling at someone,you could tell he didn\'t mean it but in Sonic X,he is stupid,even easier to trick than the games,hotheaded,easy to pick a fight with and just plain annoying.I also question myself on,if he was an antihero or a hero.But this trait followed into following games and ruined this character for me!Good thing,he was OKAY,in Sonic Generations.Cream the RabbitAll I have to say is,I like Cream.She isn\'t useless for all you Cream haters! Cream is a perfect child in the games and respects all of her friends.BUT in Sonic X,she\'s a six year old brat that never learns to shut up.All the time,she makes misconceptions and yells at someone who accidentally hurt themselves.Not to mention,she\'s stupid!When the T.V. didn\'t turn on somewhere in Season 1 she says ""You mean Mister.Telivsion died?""and started crying!Not to mention,throughout the episodes she seemed like the only sane character along with Espio.Cream\'s voice actor,Rebecca Honig,was okay.It was louder than Sarah but I still like Sarah\'s performance better.I just couldn\'t hear Cream in games like Sonic Heroes and sometimes have to replay the cutscene and raise the volume level. I only had one flaw with this voice:It sounded like a mouse!I like Michelle Ruff better,anyway.Enough about voice actors,though,let\'s continue with Cream.The spoilt little brat characteristic,luckily,didn\'t make it into the games.That\'s the only thing that didn\'t reach the games!But I still like Cream as a character and respect her in Sonic X.But,unlike the games,her chao is useless,which,unfortunatly,DID reach the games!Urgh!Shadow the HedgehogOkay,I like Shadow.But not in Sonic X!English version,that is!He\'s awesome in the Japanese version.In the English version,he is just some emo who has serious issues when it comes to Chris and Maria.And the fact on how he treats Rouge isn\'t honarable!Although,I did like that funny moment in Season 3 where asked a Meterex where Dark Oak was.It\'s better than how I just explained it.I also enjoyed Shadow\'s close friendship with Molly in the Japanese version.I also kept mentioning that I wanted his Japanese voice if I was ever a male who lived in  Japan.Jason Griffith,I liked,but he made Shadow an emo!Oh well,he\'s better than Kirk Thorton.But overall,I like Shadow in the Japanese version better than the English version.First,a fun fact,Shadow might have green blood,due to the events of the obominatio-I MEAN SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG(GAME)!But in the Japanese version,it\'s red blood.creepy!Rouge the Bat................(7 years later)........Okay!Rouge\'s character in Sonic X is...Sad! Her voice actor sounds like a man and her personality has changed BIG TIME!Just play Sonic Adventure 2 and then watch Episode 11?12?whatever!Of Sonic X and I can see a comparison there!She\'s an S.L.U.T.! Rouge may have been selfish in games like Sonic heroes but it gets RIDICULOUS in Sonic X!I like Rouge as a character in the games but in Sonic X,she\'s the biggest femme fatale and she\'s got a horrible voice which went on for FIVE FREAKING YEARS!In Shadow the Hedgehog(Game)She was...okay!But when my misery-I MEAN SONIC 06 came out I heard this voice,EVERYWHERE!And the worst part was,she was a major role in that game so wherever you went,you heard this man going up to you saying ""Long time no see!""I thought ""But hey,Sonic X won\'t keep Rouge this way as a character in the games,right?""and I was wrong!This character INVADED the games as a femme fatale that was pretty much USELESS!Oh well,she\'s better than her Archie counterpart and she has gotten a new voice actor that ROCKS THE HOUSE!Doctor Eggman.......Next!CosmoI like her!She\'s got a nice kind voice and is an excellent love intrest for Tails.Sure,she steals Sonic\'s credit in episode 77?78?76?Whatever!But she had a perfect Story Ark and,I would give my opinions on the last episodes,only the Japanese version,but I would give a spoiler!So overall,Cosmo is a wonderful character and I don\'t see why so many Sonic fans hate her.Dark OakThere isn\'t much to talk about this guy except,he is a bad villain,he never fights and worst of all:HOW DARE YOU KILL MOLLY IN THE JAPANESE VERSION!Enjoyment 3/10I was going to give this a higher score but only because it was interesting.This wasn\'t enjoyable,just very interesting to watch.I hope you know what I mean.Not to mention,only Season 2 and 3 were interesting,or even a LITTLE enjoyable!Season 1 was the most boring thing I have ever seen in anime.So Overall,I didn\'t like Sonic X compared to the games but it wasn\'t the worst anime ever.My overall score,is 6/10.I hoped you liked my first review and if you did,please wait for more reviews and I\'ll see you then,I guess. less annoying and actually DID SOMETHING USEFUL!But I\'ll save that for later.Although,I didn\'t like the SA series adaptions and I would like to see what they could do for a Sonic heroes adaption.They could have done that,too.They have every character and they had a perfect chance to bring in Omega.Even though,they would probobly replace him with Chris Thorndyke.Art 4/10I know what you\'ll say ""The art is wonderful!How dare you!?""And all I have to say about

Cream is a perfect child in the games and respects all of her friends.BUT in Sonic X,she\'s a six year old brat that never learns to shut up.All the time,she makes misconceptions and yells at someone who accidentally hurt themselves.Not to mention,she\'s stupid!When the T.V. didn\'t turn on somewhere in Season 1 she says ""You mean Mister.Telivsion died?""and started crying!Not to mention,throughout the episodes she seemed like the only sane character along with Espio.Cream\'s voice actor,Rebecca Honig,was okay.It was louder than Sarah but I still like Sarah\'s performance better.I just couldn\'t hear Cream in games like Sonic Heroes and sometimes have to replay the cutscene and raise the volume level. I only had one flaw with this voice:It sounded like a mouse!I like Michelle Ruff better,anyway.Enough about voice actors,though,let\'s continue with Cream.The spoilt little brat characteristic,luckily,didn\'t make it into the games.That\'s the only thing that didn\'t reach the games!But I still like Cream as a character and respect her in Sonic X.But,unlike the games,her chao is useless,which,unfortunatly,DID reach the games!Urgh!Shadow the HedgehogOkay,I like Shadow.But not in Sonic X!English version,that is!He\'s awesome in the Japanese version.In the English version,he is just some emo who has serious issues when it comes to Chris and Maria.And the fact on how he treats Rouge isn\'t honarable!Although,I did like that funny moment in Season 3 where asked a Meterex where Dark Oak was.It\'s better than how I just explained it.I also enjoyed Shadow\'s close friendship with Molly in the Japanese version.I also kept mentioning that I wanted his Japanese voice if I was ever a male who lived in  Japan.Jason Griffith,I liked,but he made Shadow an emo!Oh well,he\'s better than Kirk Thorton.But overall,I like Shadow in the Japanese version better than the English version.First,a fun fact,Shadow might have green blood,due to the events of the obominatio-I MEAN SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG(GAME)!But in the Japanese version,it\'s red blood.creepy!Rouge the Bat................(7 years later)........Okay!Rouge\'s character in Sonic X is...Sad! Her voice actor sounds like a man and her personality has changed BIG TIME!Just play Sonic Adventure 2 and then watch Episode 11?12?whatever!Of Sonic X and I can see a comparison there!She\'s an S.L.U.T.! Rouge may have been selfish in games like Sonic heroes but it gets RIDICULOUS in Sonic X!I like Rouge as a character in the games but in Sonic X,she\'s the biggest femme fatale and she\'s got a horrible voice which went on for FIVE FREAKING YEARS!In Shadow the Hedgehog(Game)She was...okay!But when my misery-I MEAN SONIC 06 came out I heard this voice,EVERYWHERE!And the worst part was,she was a major role in that game so wherever you went,you heard this man going up to you saying ""Long time no see!""I thought ""But hey,Sonic X won\'t keep Rouge this way as a character in the games,right?""and I was wrong!This character INVADED the games as a femme fatale that was pretty much USELESS!Oh well,she\'s better than her Archie counterpart and she has gotten a new voice actor that ROCKS THE HOUSE!Doctor Eggman.......Next!CosmoI like her!She\'s got a nice kind voice and is an excellent love intrest for Tails.Sure,she steals Sonic\'s credit in episode 77?78?76?Whatever!But she had a perfect Story Ark and,I would give my opinions on the last episodes,only the Japanese version,but I would give a spoiler!So overall,Cosmo is a wonderful character and I don\'t see why so many Sonic fans hate her.Dark OakThere isn\'t much to talk about this guy except,he is a bad villain,he never fights and worst of all:HOW DARE YOU KILL MOLLY IN THE JAPANESE VERSION!Enjoyment 3/10I was going to give this a higher score but only because it was interesting.This wasn\'t enjoyable,just very interesting to watch.I hope you know what I mean.Not to mention,only Season 2 and 3 were interesting,or even a LITTLE enjoyable!Season 1 was the most boring thing I have ever seen in anime.So Overall,I didn\'t like Sonic X compared to the games but it wasn\'t the worst anime ever.My overall score,is 6/10.I hoped you liked my first review and if you did,please wait for more reviews and I\'ll see you then,I guess.', 'Gah!  So terrible.  The only reason why I watched the show was because I liked the games.This show kills the psychology of the characters and any form of plot from the games.There are some parts to the series where the character could have done something right off the bat to avoid the whole situation but instead, decideds to do nothing or do the stupidest thing possible.  It was just a terrible anime. ', ""This was the very first anime I've ever seen and at the time, I liked it at the time but that was really only because it was a saturday morning cartoon with the story of the Sonic Adventure games which I religiously played as a kid. Nowadays tho, this show is very boring to watch.Story:There really nothing going for it. Sonic and friends get transported to another world and do pretty much fuck all there aside from their usual gig in most games and eventually get transported back and then Meterex attack and... (sigh) this is just painful. Not much of anything interesting happens.Art:Meh! It's...ok! Not bad but nothing too special!Sound:GOTTA GO FAST!!! The Opening theme in the english dub is ironically enjoyable although the voice acting fucking sucks.Characters:If you liked all the Sonic characters, you'll feel right at home here however Chris Thorndike can go fuck himself!Overall: This show is boring to watch and to talk about. I may have liked it back then but now it's just so uninteresting.Your better off watching the SATAM show, Boom or hell even Adventures of Sonic cuz at least Adventures of Sonic is wacky and nonsensical. ok!

It\'s not as bad as I expected, but some things really suck. For example, Sonic himself was a boring character - he doesn\'t talk much, but when he does, it wasn\'t nothing important. Besides, how he does thumbs up and blinks with his eye, that was really annoying. Overall he felt shallow and with no personality. Fortunately, the other characters weren\'t that boring...What can I say? I think the Sonic deserves better anime with better story, smarter characters and less artificial reasons for them to do something. Not only ""We are evil,...so we must to do something very fuc*ing evil..."" so we must to do something very fuc*ing evil...""', 'I\'m a Sonic fan so watching this felt like an obligation, especially considering how it pretty much shaped the Fandom as we know it today. I have zero nostalgia for this and I watched the Japanese subbed version because 4Kids heavily butchered it like most kids anime from the 2000\'s.The show follows who else but Sonic who was Isekai\'d to the human world where he meets Chris Thorndyke, a mostly boring kid  who\'s only personality trait is simping for him. After he reunites with his friends they must collect the 7 Chaos Emeralds before Eggman does, or atleast that\'s what the show implies because...in most episodes absolutely nothing happens, the story has incredibly low stakes because everyone ends up accepting Sonic into society less than a third in, the main characters besides Knuckles don\'t care about returning to their planet, there\'s not even a reason for them to return until 50 episodes in, and said reason is a confusing one. Eggman and his goons are as incompetent as Team Rocket, except that doesn\'t work here because Team Rocket is just a bump on Ash\'s road to become a Pokemon Master, not the main concern.This leads into a bigger problem I have with this show and is that almost every established character has been flanderized and all the new ones (With exceptions) are one-note, for starters, this is were ""Fangirl Amy"" and ""Idiot Knuckles"" pretty much came from, Sonic himself does absolutely nothing a lot of the time besides sleeping, and he himself acts like an Idiot a lot of the time and then there\'s Chris Thorndyke, he\'s supposed to be relatable but lives in a huge ass mansion with two famous parents, a scientist grandfather and two racial stereotype butlers. His conflict comes from being alone and supposedly having no friends, except he already does, and one of them is far more sympathetic and interesting than him yet has a single episode of development, but none of this would be so bad if he didn\'t do something so selfish you instantly grow to hate him at the very end of Season 2Seasons 1 & 2: 4/10 - The only redeeming factor is that it genuinely made me laugh sometimes.The show however is redeemed in it\'s third season originally made as filler comissioned by 4Kids, as it tells the story of how an alien race called ""The Metarex"" Invades Mobius (I\'m refusing to call it ""Sonic\'s World"") and how Sonic and friends must travel trough space to gather the 7 Chaos Emeralds that Sonic scattered. The genre shifts into a space opera heavily influenced by Leiji Matsumoto\'s works and it\'s full of moments that wouldn\'t be too out of place in one of the Sonic Adventure games. This part carries the show and is a must watch for any Sonic fan, I just recommend skipping 2 seasons of lame stuff to enjoy it.Season 3: 7/10 - Tbh I haven\'t seen Yamato yet but this kinda makes me want to. in most episodes absolutely nothing happens, the story has incredibly low stakes because everyone ends up accepting Sonic into society less than a third in, the main characters besides Knuckles don\'t care about returning to their planet, there\'s not even a reason for them to return until 50 episodes in, and said reason is a confusing one.

The opening is so catchy, I've been listening to it non-stop ever since. Space Colony Ark episodes were incredible, I would go berserk every time sonic went super sonic. There are a few episodes where it doesn't contribute to the main story so skip em. And also, dub is far more superior, I don't care if 4kids did this and this and blah blah blah. Dub. is. better. Some of the episodes were pretty predictable but either way it was fun watching Eggman get kicked in the ass...several times. There are also so many cute and cry worthy moments in the show I just love it. I will recommend this beautiful and heartwarming show to anyone. I will force my future kids to watch this right when they come out of my womb. You will love it.GOTTA GO FAST! several times.

To really get full enjoyment out of this anime you will either need to be an avid Sonic fan (enjoying the story and characters from the Dreamcast era games) or a kid who enjoy harmless action sequences.I am writing this review on Sonic X as a life long Sonic fan. I've played all the games, I still speedrun Sonic Adventure 1 to this day. I love everything about the series (and try to overlook some of the bad things xD). Coming from this background I can easily enjoy the anime, enjoying seeing knuckles, shadow, tikal, eggman, and others...all interact in new scenarios. If you are not coming from this perspective, I feel as if this show will fall very flat for you. Its not that its bad, just average.Now for people who do enjoy the Sonic universe, and played the Adventure games, Sonic X will be a fun watch for you for the most part. The show recreates some of sequences and arcs directly from the Games (Chaos, Shadow, Space Colony Ark, Maria). While I do like seeing these events animated in a new fashion, I do also feel as if the show rushed and condensed these stories in to bite sized pieces for mainstream purposes. In this respect, the show effectively takes away the best plot elements and character development by instead focusing the plot on the newly introduced human companions (Chris and his family), I feel as if this really hurts the shows quality for sonic fans and casual viewers alike.Now regardless of these ills, the show still provides cool action, new stories, voice acted characters that now speak much more than a couple lines like in the games (Big, Chaotix team, etc). If you like Sonic in general, this show should be watched. I think if I wasn't such a big fan of Sonic I think I would most likely give the show a 6-5, but coming from my background I got more enjoyment out of it. all interact in new scenarios.

series to me.It is not perfect, it has a few flaws (especially the 4Kids version) but it manages to be a really enjoyable work, both for children, as well as for teenagers and adults.To be clear, it\'s true that the series doesn\'t measure up to better works, but it is not as bad as many say.Let\'s see, we must bear in mind that this is supposed to be based on the modern Sonic universe, but with certain alterations, such as the background of certain characters or their personalities, which seem quite decent to me.There are seasons that...are mostly self-concluding chapters, but there are others with longer arcs, which are either adaptations of games or are their own stories, and again, although they have their setbacks, they manage to be enjoyable.The characters that we meet throughout the video game franchise are very well worked, both in their personalities, as backgrounds and reactions to certain situations.The problem is with the new characters, like the human protagonist, who many people hate, but personally I don\'t hate him, and he doesn\'t seem completely useless to me either.Many people have imagined what it would be like if a fictional character existed in real life and you could interact with him.Well, that\'s exactly what they thought when creating the character of Chris, with the aim that the viewer self-insert, believing himself the protagonist, and thus making that dream of many fans real.Returning to the new characters, they aren\'t very in-depth like the already known ones, they are just correct.The Japanese version is very good.It has a correct balance between humor and drama, and even gives rise to tragedy and chilling moments, both in scenes and in dialogues.The problem was what 4Kids did to westernize the work, making it much more cheesy, censoring many things, altering the dialogues, and eliminating tragic, emotional, deep and very interesting scenes.And although I like the dubbing a lot and it makes me nostalgic, unfortunately it\'s very inferior in terms of its altered script, which is a thousand times better in the original version.The soundtrack (in the Japanese version) was composed by Yoshihiro Ike, who worked on ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" and the latest CGI ""Saint Seiya"" movie, and it\'s decent.It is not his best work, since the sound tracks that are heard aren\'t very memorable: most are just correct, although there are a few that feel out of place.Except for a few that are insanely cool, plus there are also a few songs from the games, which are a phenomenal plus.However, the 4Kids version did a more generic job, with a very cartoonish soundtrack, but there are certain points where it surpasses the Japanese version.Personally, I found it to be a very funny and entertaining series, and it has several very emotional moments that reach their highest level in the Japanese version, which in the Western version was omitted to make it more innocent and inoffensive.It is not a series for everyone, and it is not a masterpiece, but it is not bad either.Clearly it\'s a lighter story than many others out there, but if you are a follower of the adventures of the blue hedgehog,

simply being the most average of the Sonic TV Shows. It\'s not overwhelmingly bad, but it doesn\'t really excel at anything either. The storylines in the first two seasons aren\'t interesting enough to be a good adventure story like Sonic SaTaM, the comedy isn\'t funny enough to be as entertaining as AoSTH or Sonic Boom, and it\'s not even absurd enough to be so-bad-it\'s-good like Sonic Underground. Season 2 is a bit better, but the Sonic Adventure adaptations rush through things a bit and lose some of the impact from the game\'s telling. Season 3 is actually a decent...and interesting story with some great character development, but I have a hard time recommending a show strictly on the merit of it\'s third season since you have to slog through so much to get there. Granted it\'s fairly detached from the first two seasons and a bit more in-line with the game universe, but this one\'s a ""maybe"" overall. The Sonic Adventure era was the most interesting time to be into the series story-wise and it does capture a bit of that feeling of a larger living world that those games did well compared to the newer stuff, and there are a number of weird meme-worthy scenes if you watch the uncensored version on Hulu but nothing the show does eclipses how other versions of Sonic do it. and interesting story with some great character development, but I have a hard time recommending a show strictly on the merit of it\'s third season since you have to slog through so much to get there.

I watched random episodes, but I eventually figured out the main story: Sonic gets stuck on Earth and meets Neku Sakuraba—I mean Chris Thorndyke. Together these...two go on HiLAriOuS misadventures and meet more Sonic characters like Tails and Amy and Rouge the Bat. Eventually, they meet the Thanos of the Sonic universe: evil plant warlords.

(Ironically, neither can the Sonic games.) It\'s an anime that banks off the successes of others, from Dragon Ball to Gundam. Ironically, it tries to bank off the success of Sonic the Hedgehog itself, by creating a story about a boy named Chris Thorndyke and mindlessly shoehorning Sonic and his pals in a more recently modern style into the anime.There\'s so little to say here—it\'s so insipid and repetitive that by the time it gets even remotely acceptable, the game of charades are...over.The story revolves a cast of pointless human characters, attempting to throw in a ""relatable"" perspective for its young viewers.

I thought the other ones were dry, wait until you see this one."", ""Sword art Offline - Extra Edition is very similar to the Sword art Offline from the first season and if you didn't like that one you won't enjoy this one either.The story is still presented in the format of a news show. The elements this time are: News headline, trivia, playback corner, swimsuit silhouette and slot talk. This means that life counseling has been replaced by swimsuit silhouette. Of all these sections, trivia is the shortest but also the only interesting one. The other sections are not interesting and the humor in them is based on the harem part and not funny at all....The characters this time are Asuna, Leafa and Kirito with Yui as a guest. Asuna and Leafa are wearing swimsuits which the special believes to be a noteworthy talking point.The voice acting is fine but the music isn't impressive and the animation is chibi characters and poor overall.Overall this is only worth watching if you liked the previous season of sword art offline since it doesn't better in this extra episode. The humor is still bad and nothing is interesting aside from the trivia segment which is only 30 seconds or so. The characters this time are Asuna, Leafa and Kirito with Yui as a guest.

I dropped it after a couple chapters as it was following your very typical toxic, abusive, manipulative, diabolik lovers-esque tropes that I\'m not fond of. The animation didn\'t look terrible so I decided to give it a try. With the <10 minute episodes it was super easy to binge and I was bored.I did not go in with any sort of high expectations as I could tell exactly what type of story it was going to be in...the couple chapters I read. I will say it\'s not as bad as diabolik lovers (IMO) but has a similar feel, minus the reverse harem. The male lead is very cringe and abusive towards the FL but warms up a bit as the story goes on /shrug.*Minor and obvious spoiler: FL has like Stockholm syndrome after being essentially kidnapped and held against her will by male lead. She does try and fight him the best she can (meanwhile being bullied by everyone at school because of him...and they only began to lay off when HE decided she didn\'t deserve it anymore) but eventually gives in to his demands and lives life by his word. He does lay off a bit near the end but still says and does some very toxic and awful things.CHARACTERSNo characters have received any fleshing out or depth thus far. Some semi interesting character designs but that\'s as far as it gets. We know virtually nothing about the leads by the end of this season.ART/MUSICThe animation was fine, I had no issues with it. The characters were pleasing to look at. The music was annoying or too loud/distracting at parts, tons of repetitive piano but I will say the ending song is enjoyable.This is a story for those who are interested in vampire romances with a huge splash of sadism, blackmail, manipulation, toxic energy, and abuse. I put ""mixed feelings"" because I do believe there are people out there that would genuinely enjoy this type of show. I can\'t say I would watch a second season if it comes out, but it did cure my boredom for the time being. I\'m a huge fan of the vamp genre but I wouldn\'t consider this story to be good by any means. It would be really great to see some more titles in this genre with less of these tropes that make it very difficult for people (women in particular) to enjoy. the couple chapters I read.

Like most manhua/manhwa stories they are very fast paced, with not many filler moment.As for the anime, I loved it and I want to see more of it. At the beginning it felt like there needs to be more filler scenes, because the flow of the story is too fast, but I would say it got better in the later episodes. Maybe they should alter it from the manhua just the tiniest of bit.The subtitles are fast and I barely have time to read them, I almost cannot look away from...them at all. That\'s why I think there should be a bit space between scenes and dialogs.The animation is pretty well done, characters are polished versions of those from the manhua, it\'s good.I love the music track that they have going on, it fits to the story perfectly! You can see that it clearly emphasizes the situation and the status of the characters from the story.The story itself is, like I said before, not the one with the best of qualities. I read a lot of webtoons and most of them have reputative arcs and bad translations, some of them feel like a 5 year old wrote them. Although this one isn\'t anywhere near those, the ones that are the best I have ever read are ""The goddess of Healing"" and ""Pharaoh\'s concubine"" which I highly recommend to read.""Sweet bite mark"", this story, is about a world where both humans and vampire coexist. Humans are treated as slaves to vampires and the main characters are Roy, a boy vampire from a famous blood clan, and Du Xiaoxin, a human girl.She has a younger brother that she has to protect and pay hospital bills for and that\'s why she enrolled a school full of vampires. One day she gets on Roy\'s bad side and he tells everyone in the school that she is his enemy. As time goes on, he gets attached to her and takes her to be his blood servant. The whole time Xiaoxin refuses because she is supposed to hate vampires, as they were the ones who killed her parents. Roy forces on her as he demands for her to indulge him, and she does. Even though some might say she gets a Stockholm syndrome I would disagree. For yes, he does keep her in his house but he lets her leave and doesn\'t control her completely. Later in the story we can see where all his behavior comes from, from his troubled past and upbringing. With his acts of affection and support of Xiaoxin when she needs it the most, he makes her fall for a being, a race, she is supposed to hate. With taking note of the smallest of things and trying to uphold her image, to him acting as if he doesn\'t care. Seeing the forming of a bond of trust between Roy and Xiaoxin is a wholesome sight to see.Throughout the whole story both protagonists fight for peace between the two races...against vampire hunters, other vampires from high status blood clans, drug dealer vampires and brothers who work behind your back...none of those are strong enough to ruin the love that the two of them have.We need more vampire stories and this is a great start I\'d say. them at all.

I loved the vampire-human concept and all the plot twists...😼 😼', ""Great storyline, the character development is definitely there especially for the ML,the art style is good too. Just wish the episodes were longer and there were more.Overall, it is a very sweet watch. I love that the FL has priorities outside of the romance plot and that the ML caters to it. Not to say that the romance isn't the main portion of the content.Cliffhanger at the end im definitely going to have to read to see what happens next but im hopeful for a season two. The episodes are only 10 minutes but there is no filler so it's fine but more content would...be nice. be nice."", ""This story had a lot of potential for a nice vampire story. Unfortunately, this weird Chinese imitation of Japanese anime is a huge disappointment. It's silly dialogue, silly main characters, just violence and harassment. I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this. I like mystery, fantasy and romance themes in anime, but this had neither. Choppy and unfinished stories, all flowery and artificial. Nothing makes sense, nothing is explained. The two main characters are unsympathetic and don't have a single redeeming feature.It was the first time I've seen such an incredibly spastic TV series in a very long time.Good thing it didn't have a sequel....I always finish an anime, but this one hurt a lot..

Instead, in the first scene I am met with physical and verbal abuse, the male lead (who I am somehow expected to like) sexually assaulting the female lead. He has no empathy towards her, and only shows her any sort of kindness after she reminds him of someone he once cared for. It's a toxic, abusive relationship, and made me feel sick. How are we accepting writing where it's shown that it's okay to assault someone? How on earth is that romantic?I wouldn't recommend anyone watch this unless you're interested...in seeing people suffer. This is likely very triggering, fortunately, it wasn't for me. But I also especially do not recommend anyone under 18 watch this. It is not healthy or romantic. It only gets a point for pretty animation. in seeing people suffer.

To Heart,https://myanimelist.net/anime/472/To_Heart,"['Nice. That\'s what this show is. Not thrilling or dramatic or bad, just.... nice.I first found out about To Heart when I watched Comic Party, and I thought I\'d give it a whirl. Unfortunately I watched To Heart 2 first so I wasn\'t expecting much when I eventually got around to watching this.That said, I was pleasantly surprised at how different the atmosphere between the two shows actually is. Where the sequel feels quite forced, To Heart is far more natural in the way it progresses. The stories aren\'t that different between the two, and indeed the theme (harem highschool romance), is generally quite common...amongst many shows (Clannad, Kanon, Lamune, etc). However when you look a little closer you find that To Heart is actually quite unique in it\'s approach to the romance side of things.The story doesn\'t follow any straighforward plot, but adopts a more episodic approach. This detracts from the various possible romantic developments (of which there are few), but it gives the show a very different feel from the norm. To Heart isn\'t a harem highschool romance by a long way. It get\'s misnomered as such because people assume that, because it\'s based on a dating sim, and has a male lead who meets multiple females, it has to be a harem highschool romance.To Heart (unlike it\'s sequel), is slice of life. Nothing more, nothing less.The episodic nature of the show actually works when you look at it from a slice of life perspective, and the fact that there is no ""real"" romantic development becomes irrelevant at that point. The true qualities of the show can only be admired when you watch it as a slice of life show, and in this way it reminded me of Aria far more than Clannad et al.At times the artwork in the show is exceedingly good. The show makes use of watercolour stillframes to good effect, and although the animation is a little dated compared to most you see these days, it still retains a certain ""realistic"" quality about it.The music in the show is generally quite mellow, again, reflective of the show\'s slice of life perspective. The OP and ED aren\'t really anything special though, and the sound effects, although quite well used, are sparse at best.To Heart doesn\'t really have any truly memorable characters (except maybe Multi). Fujita Hiroyuki is generally a nice, caring guy, and Kamigishi Akari is a well rounded, kind-hearted girl. The two have been best friends and neighbours since kindergarten, and the show highlights the strong ties between the two of them. The many female ""love interests"" in the show are mainly just friends. One or two may have a crush on him at one time or another, but for the most part the ""romance"" is mainly between Hiroyuki and Akari.The supporting characters are generally okay, but nothing special really. I found some of them amusing in some ways, but I didn\'t find any of them annoying (I\'ll explain why in a bit).I think if you approach this show with the assumption that it is a stereotypical harem romance then you probably won\'t enjoy it as much as something like Clannad or Kanon. However, if you approach the show from a Slice of Life perspective then it becomes a nice, relaxing way to spend half an hour.The main appeal of the show is the ""nice"", relaxed feel it has. It won\'t appeal to anyone who wants a good romantic story with continuous plot development (watch Love-Com or Bokura Ga Ita for that). It may appeal to fans of Aria though, as To Heart has a similar feel (and both female leads are called Akari). The reason why I didn\'t find any of the characters annoying was because of the relaxed feel of the show - the characters didn\'t bother me in the slightest - which is very much the same feeling I had when I watched Aria.To Heart is a show that is worth watching if you\'re in the mood for something nice.

This school life anime is probably one of the more layed back and relaxing ones out there!The main chunk of the story will be Hiro (main male lead) interacting with the female students. Now I know this may sound like a &quot;harem&quot; plot, it isn&rsquo;t at all though. Whenever he meets one of them that needs help, instead of having a romantic view of them (you know, the whole damsel in distress thing?) he simply helps...them out with their problems like a good friend would. Which in turn really does describe &quot;To Heart&quot; the best...friendship! Many people (like me) would probably go into this anime thinking about romance, after all the title does have the word heart in it, which would be a logical assumption. Not at all though, this titles name is based on simply helping out a friend in need. Which I have to say was a nice change of pace from all the romance and love triangles you would otherwise see in an anime like this. Now that&rsquo;s not to say there is no love interest at all here. Because in episode 1, Akari (main female) does imply that she likes Hiro to the audience, but it never goes past that. Even many of the situation that would implement jealousy is handled in a peaceful manner. In fact some may be surprised to see that not one character ever really raises their voice against another. This probably could be seen as a negative as well though, because most school life isn&rsquo;t that way at all. Since there is no real romance that takes place (though there will be a small amount in the last two episodes), the story may tend to be a bit bland depending on your tastes. I also didn&rsquo;t really like the ending, but I won&rsquo;t spoil it for you.The character design is what stuck out for me in the art department, they have a certain noticeably to them...this is especially true when you take a close look at their facial features. The clothing and detail that went into each is really great, and all characters are drawn well balanced as people and not exaggerated. The backgrounds can best be described as &quot;stiff&quot; though, most of them are displayed rather nicely, while others tend to look more like still water color paintings. Because of this you will most likely keep your attention to the actual characters than the backgrounds.Well since over 70% of the time there is no real music playing in the foregrounds, means that To Heart gives off a much more calmer feel to it like I mentioned earlier. Most of the time I felt that this series could be a nice stress re-leaser when you&rsquo;re not having the best of days. Now it&rsquo;s nice to have that kind of feel when watching it, but it still would have been nice to have some kind of memorable background track, since the main one that does play is simply a non-vocal version of the opening theme. Now with that in mind the opening and closing theme&rsquo;s are nice, they fit the mood of the title pretty good. Even if the ending feels more along the lines of a re-mixed version of the opening.The characters I felt were the weakest link in the anime, now don&rsquo;t get me wrong they are indeed a friendly bunch. Its just that they are not well varied in their approaches. It seems like you can pretty much describe them all in these three simple words: &quot;quiet, outgoing, middle ground.&quot; The only real noticeable one for me was a girl named &quot;Shiho, &quot; as she tended to have the most spunk of the group, and was probably the only real comical character in the bunch. At the beginning song you see quite a large cast of females, however most only appear for one episode and are never really seen again. Still, they all compliment one another great in the friendship department, and are truly there for one another to pick each other up when they are down.To Heart is not funny, deep, or very romantic in any of its aspects. And I have to admit that not having an actual romance plot going on in the overall scheme of things was a bit of a bummer, and romance fans may want to steer clear of this because of that. However, what this title lacks in those aspects, it makes up for quite nicely with its &quot;friendship&quot; approach!

""To Heart"" was amazing in both its story and its atmposphere. The story revolves around 2 high seniors, Akari and Hiroyuki, as they get ready for their final year of high school. Akari and Hiroyuki have been friends for years; ever since kindergarten, and Akari may have grown some certain feelings about her best friend after all these years....both the sound quality and the art are above par; the animation may look very old, but the anime\'s from the 1990\'s (...just the way I like \'em). The show has this...very polished look that shows that it has aged very well. The sound quality, I thought, was rather well done, too. The number of charact very polished look that shows that it has aged very well. The sound quality, I thought, was rather well done, too. The number of charact', 'Ah, the harem genre.One lovable loser who through some bizarre circumstances ends up surrounded by a group of gorgeous women who all proceed to fall in love with him somehow; and then our protagonist must make the difficult choice of picking the one female cast member to call his own.While it was always a stupid and sexist premise, it proved to be a very popular format (for an almost entirely male audience). And so, many titles made use of the formula with little to no variation. While these titles lacked creativity, they were still profitable and that allowed the same basic story to be...reproduced many, many times. A ‘tried and tested’ formula simply became a tired one. Eventually, it got to the point that even making a few minor changes would create a stir.Like all other harems, ‘To Heart’ is the story of one man and the many women that surround him. Hiroyuki Fujita is like every other male harem protagonist in this respect. BUT...(You may want to sit yourselves for this one, guys)(Deep breaths)(Ready?)He’s not a total loser!In fact, Hiroyuki is actually quite a nice guy. He helps people out, gives them advice when they need it, is pretty popular and athletic; even if he is a little lazy and forgetful at times. Really, it’s not a big surprise he is so popular with women!And with that one swipe, Hiroyuki manages to slay the ancient dragon of the harem genre -the completely unbelievable wish fulfilment fantasy of loser male anime fans everywhere-  and rescue one of several girls desperate to be carried off into the sunset by their handsome knight (who won’t be too wimpy to actually carry them for once).However, while Hiroyuki being a hit with the ladies may not be completely unbelievable, Whether or not Hiroyuki is a believable character or not, is another story altogether.Is he a Gary Stu? No, of course he’s not: He sleeps in classes and he’s forgetful, too. He’s far less a writer’s (or audiences) pet than most other harem protagonists, even if he is a ‘better’ person than they are. The problem with Hiroyuki is not that he is too idealistic; the problem is that his actions do not entirely click with his personality, and sometimes come across as erratic or illogical.One moment he’s dozing off while his classmates argue with each other; the next he gets up out of his chair and helps the class representative draw lots for the seating plan. He shrugs it off, claiming that he simply ‘wants to go home’; but when was the last time you saw someone who has half asleep be the first to jump up and help someone out?Another issue is his prioritising of relationships; Hiroyuki usually hangs around with his close friends, but will readily abandon them to jump to the needs of complete strangers. While it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that someone would help out a stranger and perhaps neglect a friend, it is hard to believe someone who goes to great lengths to help others could ignore their friends  with such consistency.But perhaps I’m being too hard on old Hiroyuki-chan. While his behaviour feels contradictory at times, he isn’t an easy character to dislike. He’s someone that we can identify with, not as some sort of self-insertion fantasy, but as a nice, friendly guy who we want to be happy.If nothing else, he manages not to be the typical harem fare which unfortunately, cannot be said for the rest of the cast, which consists of every Ken Akamatsu harem cliché there is: the childhood best friend, the arrogant tsundere, the underdog athlete, the weird rich girl, the psychic rich girl and even the robot girl; they’re all here. All archetypical, all uninteresting!That being said, even if they are unoriginal, they do manage to make for plenty of enjoyable episodes, albeit quite silly at times. Some episodes, such as those featuring robotic girl Multi, and the occult obsessed ojou-samas will no doubt prove to be too ridiculous for some to enjoy.The storyline is fairly episodic, with the rule of thumb for the series being ‘one girl; one episode’.  While the characters do make some brief cameos in other episodes, these are always only a few lines of dialogue and are spread very thinly across the series, and they are never developed further with only one or two exceptions other than the main cast.But even the main cast feel underdeveloped at times. Most of childhood friend Akira’s appearances in the first two thirds of the series seem to be for the sole purpose of reminding us that she still exists; tsundere Shiho seems to change very little through most of the series only to have a sudden growth spurt as things are winding down, one of the hallmarks of a bad tsundere. Best friend Masahi doesn’t change even slightly and the only thing Hiroyuki seems to develop over the course of the show is a better memory.Despite the problems with character development, To Heart does manage to be an entertaining show. The pacing is somewhat slow, largely due to its episodic format, but this suits it well. It gives the show a calm, laid back feel which reflects the personality of the protagonist quite well, and leaves To Heart feeling more like a Slice of Life than a harem; whether or not that is a good thing, depends on personal preference.On the artistic front, To Heart is somewhat mixed. Released in ’99, like most anime released at that time it uses cell animation. Thankfully, while clearly not a new release, the art style is pretty good and it doesn’t feel outdated. On the other hand, there seems to have been a fair number of sacrifices on the animation front, and it feels cheaply made at times. In some scenes we have background characters drawn with the same level of detail and quality as the main characters, but left unanimated. These scenes can be reasonably lengthy and the background characters often have expressions that suggest they are talking, laughing or smiling, which aside from looking very low budget, is quite distracting.A cynical person might think that such practices would make static shots of the artwork, such as those featured in magazine advertisements look better. Perhaps with the intention of falsely portraying the art to be of a higher standard than it really is.Additionally, lots of scrolling shots of still images are used, and placement shots are used a bit more than necessary. While these aren’t quite as big an issue as the aforementioned background characters, they can feel overused at times.The soundtrack can be summarised in a single word: ‘barren’.There wasn’t very much background music used in To Heart at all; aside from occasional touches of violins and pianos; usually limited to the emotional scenes. Unfortunately when the lack of background music is combined with the blatant attempts to cut corners in the animation, it casts serious doubt on the possibility that it was intentionally minimalistic. This leaves ’To Heart’ feeling altogether very cheap indeed.At least the voice acting work is competent.  While there are no particularly shiny stars among the cast, each one suits their respective role. It has to be said though that there are not any particularly taxing scenes to test the seiyuu’s skills either; ultimately, it shouldn’t get on anyone’s nerves, which in a show like To Heart, is all you really need.Because in the end, ‘To Heart’ is an anime that is only slightly above average. The protagonist aside, it’s a cast full of under developed, stereotypical characters put together in an anime that looks alright but feels cheaply produced. It was enjoyable, but it did nothing really special. Hiroyuki may have been interesting as a harem protagonist, but as an anime character, he’s average at best.And it’s the same with To Heart. When you compare it with other harem, it’s a good, perhaps even great title. But when you start looking at it beyond the boundaries of the harem genre line, it just can’t cut it. Not because of any flaws inherit in the harem genre; but because overall, it is a mediocre anime.It’s not so much that ‘To Heart’ is in a school of its own; it’s just a top student in a class full of under-achievers. reproduced many, many times.

called To Heart.Word of warning,this review contains excitement and swearing and some really really graphic sadistic descriptions.With that onto the review of this...I dare not call it s@it cause that would be an insult to good s@it or even bad s@it..This has taken the idea of endless boredom and went all the way to 11 or 789 by the looks of things.Stupid name,stupid anime,stupid stupid me for watching this shit...without having a spoon around so i can slowly and painfully take my eyes out of their damn sockets.Honestly i\'m not being captain dramatic,i wish i had the strength to cut my wrists and watch my blood dripping on the floor instead.It would be better to take a chainsaw,cut my leg and beat my self to death with it.THIS IS HOW BAD THIS FREAKING ABOMINATION IS.And looking at the tags i have to wonder...Who in the name of all that\'s holyl thought this was a comedy?Who?A carcass perhaps?Someone with the aesthetics of one?Drama?I wish there was cause at least there would be something to indicate a sign of life.Romance?Seriously?That was Japan\'s idea of romance?Based on a game?????AHA now we\'re talking...Now it all begins to make sense..BASED ON A GAME...I should point out that i haven\'t played the game and i\'m not going to either but i cannot begin to imagine what the game was like for this anime to be so freaking boring.Story?No story whatsoever.Absolutely none at all.It\'s just the girl of the week thing where some girl has some trouble and our cast solves it.And it may sound somewhat interesting but trust me it\'s not.Cause the way the ""drama"" is delivered lacks in everything.And it has to do with the characters mostly.The way they\'re acting is like they force fed them sleeping pills and told them to go out there and do it.Every single movement every single word they utter is in slow motion.Get this for conversations..Someone says something,the other part hears it,then processes it in his brain,then he breathes,then he makes his head move,then his eyes,then one lip starts moving then the other then some breathing takes place and after one decade has passed he finally utters:""Huh.......""....Kinda like watching an old man with arthritis getting up from his chair.It\'s slow and painful....And come to think of it they can\'t even be described as characters but to hell with it i\'m feeling generous today.Mins into the first ep,that is the very first,the intro,the one to sing the blues...And what do we get?A male MC who is sleepy..And stays that way for the rest of the series.A sleepy character who wonders what the hell he\'s doing there in the first place.The female MC has no characteristics so to speak.It\'s just the girl with her red hair following around the male MC for some reason science hasn\'t STILL found an explanation for.And if you think this cannot possibly get any worse.....Oh wait for it..They have a scene where for,i think,10 mins they show a scene of 2 characters ripping a piece of paper..Yup just that and only that.And that was just for seating arrangements..10 mins of the same thing over and over and ov......Zzzzzzzz.Yes you might say,but this is Slice of Life...Yeah but if the slice of that life is as boring as watching footage of flowers growing in slow motion then what\'s the freaking point?I can watch my nails grow for that matter.But that was the 1st ep right?What about the next..Oh they stepped things up by showing Akari the female MC brushing her teeth for what felt like an eternity.Oh and get this...We come to learn that her dream was to sit next to the male MC whose name i can\'t be bothered to remember..Her dream....To sit next to.....Him........Her dream...Not going to space or save 3rd world countries...How much do you want to see that?You\'re probably on the floor squealing like a pig in heat..Animation and music where...Well rubish.What did you expect from late 90\'s anime?It\'s dreadful.All in all there were 1 or 2 things good with it.Well there had to be really.Nobody can make an anime where absolutely everything is shit from top to bottom.That said even these 1 or 2 things couldn\'t keep me awake.I started watching this 11 years ago and midway through i was fast asleep for 2 years.11 years later i finally managed to finish it.And was it worth?Yeah i finally slept like a baby bear but also lost my youth.Is that a price worth paying for?Abso-fuckin-lutely not.Just watch something else.Watch Boku no Pico.Be disgusted not brain dead. without having a spoon around so i can slowly and painfully take my eyes out of their

""I recommend this anime for several reasons.1. to experience how this is a pinnacle example of 90s school drama anime that can be very experimental by dabbing with elements of slice-of-life and iyashikei2. to understand what emotions are, how complicated can they be3. to show that harem anime doesn't always need to have fanservices4. to feel that one isn't alone even in dire (or feeling-wise uncertain) situations as the whole storyline feels like an Aesop lesson...5. the composer of the OSTs in the anime, Wada Kaoru, created some of the best music that melts the tender heartsI must say that a person with a very slow-paced set of emotions could appreciate this anime.From the bottom of my heart when I first watched this as a teen who just turned 14, I simply wish there were filler OVAs at least 2 possible episodes would finish the whole storyline with a nice conclusion. It seems that it is incomplete. 5. the composer of the OSTs in the anime, Wada Kaoru, created some of the best music that melts the tender heartsI must say that a person with a very slow-paced set of emotions could appreciate this anime.From the bottom of my heart when I first watched this as a teen who just turned 14, I simply wish there were filler OVAs at least 2 possible episodes would finish the whole storyline with a nice conclusion. It seems that it is incomplete."", ""To Heart is easily one of the blandest things I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.  It's complete lack of substance or anything interesting was very frustrating, especially considering that deep down it definitely had some potential that it just never bothered fostering.  It was fundamentally boring and had very little to offer over all.That isn't to say, though, that it did everything wrong.  I am willing to give it some credit, as there were some things that I did like about it.  The general ascetic of the series was rather nice, having a interesting art style that looked...very pretty and a really good musical score that would have done a great job of emphasizing the emotion of scenes if there were any emotion to be found there.  It definitely tried to create situations where one would feel emotion and have a warm and fuzzy feeling, but although I give it an A for effort in that category, it gets a very predominant F in execution.  This failure is caused by two things, first the complete blandness of the characters, especially the main character, and second the complete lack of any sort of story, focus or point.The main character Hiroyuki is easily one of the least interesting characters I have ever encountered.  To make matters worse on top of having no personality what so ever he still manages to be a dick, which just adds an additional level of annoyance to his pointless existence.  He has absolutely no chemistry between any of the girls who he arbitrarily hangs out with, demonstrating that he had about the chemical potential of helium.  He truly has no character and this is demonstrated in the sad excuse for what could be called a story this series has.To Heart has no plot.  It has no story.  It has no focus.  It has no point.  If I were pressed I would have to say it's about some guy with no personality hanging out with girls with no personality, for no reason.  Truthfully I can't explain why Hiroyuki spends time with most of these characters.  He generally seems distant and uninterested in almost everything that is going on, but will still get involved with random people.  His time with these girls feels forced and arbitrary, and the only reason  they wouldn't be called plot contrivances is because the isn't a plot.The girls themselves are also completely bland, and seems to have no rhyme or reason to their inclusion in the series.  The first is a practitioner of black magic, in that she stands around in a dark room, wearing a witch's hat and lights candles.  Apparently she did cast some sort of “spell” during the episode she was “relevant” in, but it had no clear effect.  Her most predominant “personality trait” is that she talks really quietly.  Then there is the martial arts girl.  Her “story” is that she is the sole member of a martial arts club, that broke off from normal martial arts clubs because she want to practice some sort of “extreme” martial arts.  Personally I have no idea how her style was different from a normal style, it wasn't explained or shown as being different, but since she went through the trouble of starting a completely superfluous club, it must have been completely impossible to do it in a normal club.  This ends up reminding me of Hitohira, and anything that remind me of that terrible show automatically adds another level of annoyance to the giant pile.  Oddly enough she was one of the more interesting side characters of the series, but was still largely pointless.  Also there was the girl who was described as having “nothing interesting about her.”  Normally I would complain about her being bland, but it seems the series is at least being honest and already doing that for me.At this point we start getting into characters that really just don't belong in the series, even though it's hard to properly say what does belong in the series.  The next monster of the week girl is a psychic.  I was willing to buy to occult girl because it was clear that she was just pretending to be magical, but no she apparently really is psychic.  In normal To Heart fashion someone takes interest in her for absolutely no reason, and she gets an episode devoted to her in all her bland splendor.  She is easily the most boring character of the series, but at least she seems to have a love interest other than Hiroyuki, so I'm willing to give her credit there.  The fact that she has an interest in something not completely inert at least shows the potential for chemistry, I guess that would make her more along the lines of Xenon.The next character who has absolutely no right to be in the series, also coincides with To Heart pretending it might have a plot.  This character is Multi, one of the more famous of the series, and she is an android.  In a series with no scifi elements, and no indications that this is a futuristic setting, they suddenly throw in an android.  Her sudden introduction completely baffled me and I'm still trying to justify her addition to the “story.”  With her comes the closest thing to a plot the series has.  Multi is a maid robot sent to the school to be tested on her functionality.  Why they would send her to a school makes no sense.  In order to create a false sense of drama, another robot is also introduced, and the robot that performs better of a two week period will be used as the model for future robots.  At the end of the two week period the series attempts to pull at the audience's heart strings by having her leave, and the main characters throw her something like a going away party.  This of course failed to make me care because a character who was introduced an episode ago having to leave a bunch of people I don't give a shit about isn't exactly going to move me.  Also during this “arc” the series tries to get all philosophical, discussing what defines a person with consideration to artificial intelligence.  You know, what almost every other anime ever make has done... better.  And, spoiler alert, Multi comes back for “more testing” not that that really matters since this happens near the end of the series and she has about three lines after this.The last “plot arc” has to do with the other main characters who I haven't talked about yet, mostly because I was too busy complaining.  In addition to the bland douche that is Hiroyuki, there are three other main characters, who were to my surprise not bad.  They are Shiho, the energetic one who actually seems to have a personality, Akari, who is still bland but fleshed out and nice enough for me to at least care about her, and Masashi, the token male friend who whenever he shows up, I cry a little on the inside that he isn't the main character.  It's these characters that make the show almost watchable, and truthfully if the show were about Masashi and Shiho and Hiroyuki never existed I would probably like this series.  But no, Hiroyuki has to be the main character, and thus has to be everyone's love interest.  The last two episodes are devoted to a Christmas part, or more accurately the planning there of.  During this it is made clear that Shiho does in fact like Hiroyuki, but Akari has first dibs being childhood friends and all.  Shiho is indecisive and steps aside for Akari to to starting dating Hiroyuki.  Yeah if you were expecting and romantic end, stop, it ends with nothing happening.In the end To Heart is just far, far too bland.  Nothing happens and the characters are boring and unlikable.  During each episode you end up bored out of your mind, and then you realize that you're only about seven minutes in, and when they episode is three fourths of the way through you realize that nothing has happened yet.  Although there were signs of a potential for something that might have been okay, that seed never got planted.  Its good art style, music, voice acting and the handful of decent characters prevent it from being one of the worst things I've seen, but blandness and lack of anything positive prevent it from being decent.  The only reason to watch this is for it's historical relevance. very pretty and a really good musical score that would have done a great job of emphasizing the emotion of scenes if there were any emotion to be found there.  It definitely tried to create situations where one would feel emotion and have a warm and fuzzy feeling, but although I give it an A for effort in that category, it gets a very predominant F in execution.

Truthfully I can't explain why Hiroyuki spends time with most of these characters.  He generally seems distant and uninterested in almost everything that is going on, but will still get involved with random people.  His time with these girls feels forced and arbitrary, and the only reason  they wouldn't be called plot contrivances is because the isn't a plot.The girls themselves are also completely bland, and seems to have no rhyme or reason to their inclusion in the series.  The first is a practitioner of black magic, in that she stands around in a dark room, wearing a witch's hat and lights candles.  Apparently she did cast some sort of “spell” during the episode she was “relevant” in, but it had no clear effect.  Her most predominant “personality trait” is that she talks really quietly.  Then there is the martial arts girl.  Her “story” is that she is the sole member of a martial arts club, that broke off from normal martial arts clubs because she want to practice some sort of “extreme” martial arts.  Personally I have no idea how her style was different from a normal style, it wasn't explained or shown as being different, but since she went through the trouble of starting a completely superfluous club, it must have been completely impossible to do it in a normal club.  This ends up reminding me of Hitohira, and anything that remind me of that terrible show automatically adds another level of annoyance to the giant pile.  Oddly enough she was one of the more interesting side characters of the series, but was still largely pointless.  Also there was the girl who was described as having “nothing interesting about her.”  Normally I would complain about her being bland, but it seems the series is at least being honest and already doing that for me.At this point we start getting into characters that really just don't belong in the series, even though it's hard to properly say what does belong in the series.  The next monster of the week girl is a psychic.  I was willing to buy to occult girl because it was clear that she was just pretending to be magical, but no she apparently really is psychic.  In normal To Heart fashion someone takes interest in her for absolutely no reason, and she gets an episode devoted to her in all her bland splendor.  She is easily the most boring character of the series, but at least she seems to have a love interest other than Hiroyuki, so I'm willing to give her credit there.  The fact that she has an interest in something not completely inert at least shows the potential for chemistry, I guess that would make her more along the lines of Xenon.The next character who has absolutely no right to be in the series, also coincides with To Heart pretending it might have a plot.  This character is Multi, one of the more famous of the series, and she is an android.  In a series with no scifi elements, and no indications that this is a futuristic setting, they suddenly throw in an android.  Her sudden introduction completely baffled me and I'm still trying to justify her addition to the “story.”  With her comes the closest thing to a plot the series has.  Multi is a maid robot sent to the school to be tested on her functionality.  Why they would send her to a school makes no sense.  In order to create a false sense of drama, another robot is also introduced, and the robot that performs better of a two week period will be used as the model for future robots.  At the end of the two week period the series attempts to pull at the audience's heart strings by having her leave, and the main characters throw her something like a going away party.  This of course failed to make me care because a character who was introduced an episode ago having to leave a bunch of people I don't give a shit about isn't exactly going to move me.  Also during this “arc” the series tries to get all philosophical, discussing what defines a person with consideration to artificial intelligence.  You know, what almost every other anime ever make has done... better.  And, spoiler alert, Multi comes back for “more testing” not that that really matters since this happens near the end of the series and she has about three lines after this.The last “plot arc” has to do with the other main characters who I haven't talked about yet, mostly because I was too busy complaining.  In addition to the bland douche that is Hiroyuki, there are three other main characters, who were to my surprise not bad.  They are Shiho, the energetic one who actually seems to have a personality, Akari, who is still bland but fleshed out and nice enough for me to at least care about her, and Masashi, the token male friend who whenever he shows up, I cry a little on the inside that he isn't the main character.  It's these characters that make the show almost watchable, and truthfully if the show were about Masashi and Shiho and Hiroyuki never existed I would probably like this series.  But no, Hiroyuki has to be the main character, and thus has to be everyone's love interest.  The last two episodes are devoted to a Christmas part, or more accurately the planning there of.  During this it is made clear that Shiho does in fact like Hiroyuki, but Akari has first dibs being childhood friends and all.  Shiho is indecisive and steps aside for Akari to to starting dating Hiroyuki.  Yeah if you were expecting and romantic end, stop, it ends with nothing happening.In the end To Heart is just far, far too bland.  Nothing happens and the characters are boring and unlikable.  During each episode you end up bored out of your mind, and then you realize that you're only about seven minutes in, and when they episode is three fourths of the way through you realize that nothing has happened yet.  Although there were signs of a potential for something that might have been okay, that seed never got planted.  Its good art style, music, voice acting and the handful of decent characters prevent it from being one of the worst things I've seen, but blandness and lack of anything positive prevent it from being decent.  The only reason to watch this is for it's historical relevance."", 'To Heart is the forgotten predecessor to Clannad and the early formula to archetypal dating simulations. There’s a guy surrounded by a bunch of cute girls, with a boring personality, but every few episodes leads to an arc that makes the girls exceedingly interesting or just plain Janes that ONLY have their moe points going for them and nothing further.• The pacing is probably the most terrible part of the first season of To Heart. Everything moves at a colossally languid speed, to the point that I preferred watching the English dub to the sub to avoid falling asleep at some points.• It was similar...to a boring school visual novel, where the girls make you go help with the student counsel committee and go on errands with them and then you’re just snapping your fingers behind the screen being like, “Just get to the romance already! I don’t want to see these characters doing menial tasks!” In my opinion, the best visual novels are not the ones that take place in high school, but I’ll save that for a later time.• This comfort-watch molasses became a trend for stories in the mid-2000’s and was a very influential series for the school drama. It made the genre explore otherworldly happenings. The android girl, HMX-12 Multi, was an influential character in the school genre because she made other writers realize that they can put surreal things in a school setting and they don’t have to explain it, just branch it out into it’s own arc, much to the modern anime fan’s dismay who want an ACTUAL explanation and world-building behind an android’s conception.• You can see the echoes of this effect in Key’s work: Kanon with its demon hunter, Clannad with its random ghost girl, each used to create an angle of intrigue in the school setting. To Heart even inspired an anime called Comic Party, which is an anime about making To Heart doujins.• To Heart is influential to the romance genre in anime like Urusei Yatsura was a big science fiction influence. But, looking past the noticeable iconicism behind To Heart, I need to criticize the series on what it is rather than what it has produced. The main female character, Akari Kamigishi (for those of you who have seen or played Shuffle, she’s exactly like Kaede, but not yandere) is really cute, but so boring and predictable that at times, it’s hard to root for her.• WARNING, spoilers ahead: The only point of intrigue that the story had that was truly different from any other, especially at the time, is when there’s a really dark scene between Akari and her best friend, Shiho because Shiho is in love with the protagonist/Akari’s platonic love/boyfriend (it’s practically a harem series, so why wouldn’t she be?) and she lies to Akari about her feelings for Hiroyuki and invites Hiroyuki to her party when Akari’s sick.• But this moment is undone when the last episode decides to not take a risk, even though the art and directing in the unnerving confrontation scene is very similar to a scene from one of the last episodes of Serial Experiments Lain with it’s surreality (when Arisu learns the truth about Lain), because when Akari says that she’s coming to the party with a cold, Shiho admits defeat and tells Hiroyuki… completely undermining the build-up from earlier in the arc.

The show starts out with Akari remembering something precious from her past, but that story was only continued within the last couple episodes of the show.

Again, this was solid.Enjoyment/OverallStory wise, this has been the best of the .Hack anime I've seen so far, probably for the &quot;summation&quot; nature of this ova. It didn't feel too short or too long, there was no &quot;filler&quot; type material. The plot was tightly woven, pacing was great and thus I enjoyed this much more than the other .Hack series I've seen. Very very solid and good. I would have rated this higher if I were more familiar with the manga or played the game."", 'This OVA is the (very much superior) follow up to the ""Hack Sign"" series. The production is in the typical style of Bee Train, with the ever present, haunting melodies of Yuki Kajiura (a staple aspect in Bee Train productions) succeeding to be even better than in ""Noir"" or ""Hack sign"". And since those were earlier works, it does seem like the studio is getting the hang of the music production more and more.Unlike ""Hack Sign"", significant events actually start happening from the word go, resulting in a captivating opening episode. Unfortunately, having set the bar rather high, the remaining three episodes are a...little disappointing. In episode 2, the anime descends back to the usual faffing around that was so common in the ""Hack Sign"" series. The third and fourth episodes are better, but never really reach the standards set by the first.""Hack Liminality"" does go some way towards explaining the events in ""Hack Sign"", but not very much. Either the translators are at fault, or Bee Train need better explanations. There are a lot of vague statements thrown around, but they don\'t make much sense, and by the end, I was still fairly clueless about what\'s going on. Basically, the conclusion is something like ""Aha! I\'ve got it!!"" I had no idea what exactly what they were doing or how did they did it. All I know is that there were some hacking involved. How can you make a proper sci-fi without explanations?!Anyways, despite not really ""getting it"", I quite enjoyed the ride, I just wish they\'d put in a more detailed explanation.

Although it\'s quite fairly simple and almost identical to the other .hack stories, it focuses on the mysterious comas that\'s been happening to the players all over the world, and how they\'re trying to solve it and yadda yadda yadda it goes on. One thing that really surprised me about this is the fact that the settings is completely in the real world, I expected it to be placed in the video game because it\'s .hack and all but that caught me off guard when the whole thing was set in the real world. Overall, it\'s getting old hearing almost the same thing over and over again from other series, but the upside is there\'s always new information that they present about the whole .hack series as a whole which kind of answers a lot of questions from the other series.ArtThe fact that it\'s an OVA, the art is already given as better than worse. I do have to point out that the style of art is quite different from all the other ones though, maybe because it\'s an OVA or maybe because it\'s actually placed in the real world rather than the colourful places of ""The World"", either way I really have no complaints about the art.CharacterI never really saw any character growth mainly because the time spent in the whole OVA weren\'t really that long, it didn\'t take them years or months to get to the end but I would say just days, so the amount of character growth from the beginning to the end I would say was ""just right"" not too much but not to the point where you wouldn\'t notice anything. They give you a good variety of characters, but the protagonists weren\'t very persuasive about their beliefs or goals, they never really showed that much passion about the whole ordeal. I found them too laid back with the situations that were happening and wished they\'d react in a more believable manner. There was that guy that always had a cigarette in his mouth, I\'ve always liked characters that are like that, shows them that they too can relieve stress the deathly way.OverallHonestly though, with my full opinion on this, the .hack series were probably the ones that I dreaded through watching the most, but then again I think back they were probably one of the first animes I\'ve ever really watched seriously, so it was hard form to get into it and try to analyze as much crap as I can to make a good review.Liminality was different because they weren\'t in the video game for once, and that already, gives this anime a point of uniqueness compared to the rest of the .hacks!cheers there\'s still so much to explain.

Usually in .hacks I am bored to tears but this was really good! I was very involved and focused 90% of the time. The first episode did drag on a bit but the final 3 weren\'t as long which was a good thing.Story:The story is outstanding! Unlike most .hack animes the story does not take place inside of ""The World"". This takes place in the real world and I like that. It does get somewhat confusing but if you pay attention you will understand it. The ending was a little confusing to me but I still really liked it.Art:The color was...magnificent and the animation quality was very good! The only thing taht bugged me was the wair the bangs were done, particularly Mai\'s bangs. They looked amateurish and not good. :\\Sound:The sound was outstanding! Although the opening themes changed for each episode, the ending stayed the same and I really liked that. Also, featuring some of the other .hack themes was a nice touch. The background music fit well with the scene. It was a little staticcy at times (it might just be my headphones though).

They find out the company that created and managed the game was trying to cover the situation up while trying to solve the problem. It's a more realistic scenario than the fantasy one in .HackSign, however, this one, rather than being a psychological...character study, is more of an investigation thriller.

There won't be as much detail in the pros and cons of each category, but it'll be enough for you to decide if you're interested in this anime. Let's begin, my friend.-----Story - 9/10+ While .hack//Sign takes place in the game world, .hack//Liminality focuses on the real world. The story reveals more details about the problems the game world has on the real world, which I enjoyed. I also loved knowing more of the mystery behind it.- The story can be a bit slow at times, but it's a very minor issue....-----Characters - 2/10- I found the characters to be quite bland and none of them really stood out, probably because there wasn't a lot of character development to work with in the first place. None of them were dumb or annoying, they were just... bland, no personality. I really wanted to say something positive about the characters since I enjoyed the story. I accept any forms of hate, just don't blow up my house.-----Art - 7/10+ Here's the good news. The art in this anime was overall good, just not as great as the art in .hack//Sign. I love the smoothness of the animation.- Now for the bad news. I didn't like how some of the characters were drawn, especially when it comes to the hair because it looked... I don't know, clumpy and cut-out? I also didn't like the main female's eyes, I just don't enjoy that art style I guess.-----Sound - 8/10+ I really enjoyed the music in this OVA, such as the separate main themes of all four episodes. I also recognized some of the awesome music found in .hack//Sign. Win!+ The characters may be bland, but I liked the dialogue of the English dub.- Just like .hack//Sign, some of the music can be overwhelming at times.-----Enjoyment - 6/10+ I may have some disappointments but I enjoyed watching this OVA, it was nice knowing more of the backstory of the .hack series in a different perspective.- This OVA would have been more enjoyable if the characters looked better and had some colorful personalities. I'm just glad this wasn't a full-length anime or I would dropped it before reaching the halfway mark.-----Final Score - 32/50 (64%)-----Would I watch this anime again? No, once is enough for me.Do I recommend this anime? Yeah, but only if you're a fan of the .hack series. This can be watched if you don't know anything about .hack, but I'd say you're wasting your time. -----Characters - 2/10- I found the characters to be quite bland and none of them really stood out, probably because there wasn't a lot of character development to work with in the first place.

Part of my lackluster impression of the series is it seems to start and stop in the middle of a story, rather than itself being a self-contained story, so I may simply be missing out on details from other media that tie Liminality into a timeline better.All that said, Liminality was a bit too disjointed and inconsequential for me. The first three episodes mainly serve to introduce each of the three main female cast members, followed by a finale where the crew undertakes a mission against the main...threat. Unlike most .hack series', Liminality takes place almost entirely in the real world, as opposed to the game, 'The World.' This is normally a talking point for those who praise Liminality as it is novel, though it removes a bit of context and makes Liminality more of a standard investigative series.There is a number of things Liminality does quite well, starting with the title. The concept of Liminality can be summarized as the dissonant space that lies between those uninitiated into a ritual and true believers of a ritual's powers. This is actually a really interesting topic, one I wouldn't expect from an anime (much less an OVA of 4 episodes), and gets a decent amount of dialog to explain how it pertains to the story's events. Sound design has always been something I've considered Bee Train quite good at, to which Liminality is not an exception. The cast are all pretty interesting and likeable considering how little time you share with them and visual design benefits from things like Bee Train's eclectic shot pacing and angles as well as attention to detail. I spent at least a minute or two marveling that a phone's antenna poked through a character's hair while she was on the phone, for example.That said, the flaws in the show are still pretty glaring. Side characters are exceptionally important for an episode only to be never mentioned again, one of the main characters really doesn't provide any usefulness in the final episode to the point one wonders why she even was necessary, very vague romance implications feel more like filler than characterization, and the whole investigative aspect feels lacking, perhaps due to the series' abruptness or because it is not strong enough to stand on its own without supporting lore from other media in the series.If you're a fan of Bee Train or the .hack series, you might enjoy the ride, though otherwise I can't say I recommend it. threat.

Or at least, it\'s not that simple.What this anime accomplishes is taking the same premise, one kid narrowly escaping it, trying to help another kid who got into...a coma. She does this by investigating, but doing so more in the real world than the actual game. This is similar to the second half of S1 of SAO (even though this came before it (but the SAO novel was the year before....there\'s a lot to argue)) where Aincrad was cleared but Asuna was still in a coma. I can thankfully say that this anime is better than that arc because as you might know, it was quite disgusting with its villain and treatment of Leifa.They say that stories begin with the groundwork and others build on it over time but it seems like Hack, as a whole, had a lot more in mind than just a base. It\'s pretty fleshed out, no less than Sword Art, perhaps even more. Being one of the firsts of its kind (that I know of anyway), it does a pretty good job of covering a lot of different scenarios and then actually aging well enough to still be relevant even if it isn\'t as well remembered. Sure they use dinosaur computers and flip phones and text emoticons but I feel like the culture is still there, it\'s still charming and gets the story across the same.This also takes the approach of having different protagonists for the episodes. Same story, Mai Minase is still there, but different scenarios that build up what she started then they meet up at the end.For newcomers, are the games required? Or should you watch .Hack Sign first?Well I haven\'t saw Sign yet, this came bundled in with the games so I started there but I hear Sign is a semi-prequel so it\'s really up to you on that front. As far as how much of Liminality is related to the games. It takes its time to explain what\'s going on, just in case you decided to start here, it\'s not ""connected"" to the story of those games in the sense that its using the same characters, for the first two episodes you\'ll be fine just watching them on their own if you wanted. There\'s a few nods here and there that you\'ll understand if you played the games though (as it takes place during the same time) and I think even some things that happen in the show that are referenced in the games. But it\'s starting with episode 3 that you\'re going to need the games.How its presented to the players of the game is (as I mentioned) bundled in with the game, with one episode per entry as if it\'s an unraveling mystery between both mediums, following two stories at the same time. The way the story is conveyed is sort of like a real life reddit ARG, connecting dots and finding things in weird places from a vast variety of sources. Some people will like that, some people won\'t. You can get the sparknotes version by just following along but its so much more if you read into it.In fact, each intro to the episodes is different, recapturing a lot of the moments from the game parallel so Episode 2 will have Mutation graphics for example and those can be spoilery. Because of that, you should play said game before viewing the disc. You will more than likely be unable to understand what Episode 3 and beyond has to offer unless you play (or watch) the game before it. It makes blatant references to the lore and certain characters from the game, even if they don\'t make a proper appearance, it\'s integral to the plot. In fact, I\'d even argue that this anime is supplementary to the games. It helps you understand the games just as the games help you understand the anime and it has a might higher payoff if you experience both the way they were intended.They also mention ""Fragment"" which is a debunked MMO (unless you go through emulation) but as far as I know, the story isn\'t that connected (so it\'s not mandatory), it\'s just the game that they play is the same as the one that you can play.But I\'m not here to review the games, I\'m here to review the anime as an anime and only an anime.It\'s interesting but I can\'t help but feel it\'s lesser. It\'s cool to find little details here and there and it\'s entertaining enough, that\'s really all I would ask of it, I mean it\'s 4 episodes. This is no hidden gem, this is no piece of crap either. Overall, I\'ll give it a 6 out of 10 but my enjoyment a 7. As far as sound and music go, it does what it\'s supposed to but it\'s not winning any awards. Art is fine enough for an OVA (despite some of the haircuts looking like Higarashi) but look at the studio (Bee Train) and what they\'ve done, it\'s about that same level of quality, late night early 2000s anime type. a coma.

Toward the end it gets essentially messy and is quickly marred by the incompetence of the writing to convey the explanations being provided by the show, if there even are any that aren't extremely vague and convenient solutions.Nonetheless, the cast, story and interactions in .hack//Liminality far outshine those in .hack//SIGN and for those who can tolerate a slower paced story with a satisfying outcome and an aesthetic similar to .hack//SIGN's, then this is the OVA for you. episodes feel like afterthoughts rather than a continuation of the first episode, and while that's not bad in and of itself, it is strange in how it decides to tackle the issues and resolve the storyline it sets off on the first seconds of the first episode.

I like the attention to detail in the animation, though (throw a frying pan down a hatch, and it\'s still there when you get down there).SoundVoice acting is solid but nothing special. Background music is a bit repetative and there are few different songs considering this being a rather short OVA.The ending theme...gave me a real deja vu.

If your looking for a complex story instead of a action shoot em up then move along because you won't enjoy this show."", 'Zillion is a show which takes the simplistic alien invasion story… and makes it even more simplistic. In all the shows I know where aliens invade humanity, this is the only one that has the last line of defence being… three hand pistols. I mean, really, no giant robots or spaceships or super bio-suits. Just three lasers that look and shoot as normal pistols. The premise alone is quite lame as the aliens have a million huge spaceships, a billion tanks and a trillion foot soldiers, their armours are impregnable to all other weapons, yet they are unable to beat three teenagers with some lasers....Because their firepower is as powerful as a zillion warriors. Get it? Zillion? The name? And I must point out that these super weapons are not levelling mountains with a shot, don’t cause earthquakes or tsunamis or don’t even beat two simple foot soldiers with one shot. They are pea shooters and the aliens are dumb idiots that constantly attack in small groups.Anyways, the story is more childish than the Power Rangers, as the plot is even more stupid (beating an intergalactic empire with a few pea shooters), and the villains hardly have personality. Hell man, they don’t even have a face! They all look identical with those stupid expressionless masks they wear. They don’t even sound alien with those typical voices they have. And the heroes who DO have a face and excused typical voices are the archetypical trio you can find everywhere, with zero development. Furthermore, there is not much plot going around; 95% is stand-alone missions and the rest are simplistic plot twists you can figure out from miles away.The show barely tries to have anything exciting in it. The idea about the lasers being the ultimate weapon looks like a poor attempt at promoting some amusement park, where you got to shoot monsters with pistols (it was a trend in the 80’s) but it otherwise looks terrible in anime form. Not only they don’t look special or imposing, but also they fire in a typical way. As for the damage they cause? Anything they hit is fizzling away without even exploding. Can you imagine how lame it looks for the human army to have more standard weaponry that blows up entire mountains and it’s completely ineffective against the aliens, but then some snotty kid fires a simple shot and the huge spaceship disappears without even exploding? It is simply anti-climactic and you need to endure it for 31 episodes without plot or interesting characters to keep you awake.The production values are not helping either, as there is very little actual animation during the battles and characters stand frozen most of the time. And no explosions either! Just stupid poofs and aliens disappearing. Even more conventional explosions are nothing but round spheres that don’t even leave debris behind. Voice acting is relaxed and music themes are silly pop-songs you will listen once and forget 3 minutes later.Furthermore, the finale is terrible as well, as out of nowhere we get this stupid moral message about appreciating life and some deus ex machina thingy pops out from the lasers and is giving the aliens a way to live peacefully. What a crock; the heroes didn’t even do anything about that. And if it was so easy to do it, why didn’t the lasers do it sooner? What, the show would end too fast this way? Well thanks for the nonsense we had to endure because of that.Zillion is less interesting than the Power Rangers. At least there you had huge robots and big explosions.

I can live with that, not everything has to be perfectly realistic and not everything has to make sense all the time. It\'s ""harem"" again? Obviously if I didn\'t like those, I wouldn\'t even be on B-Pro\'s page here now.  I\'m no expert on art or sound, so all I can say is a personal opinion: I really liked the styling, the colours, the characters, the music. A solid 8/10 for those as far as I\'m concerned, they all really appealed to me. Again, I don\'t expect everything to make sense or be realistic or perfect all...the time.Having said all that, why the overall score of 6 then?

I have absolutely no idea what on earth went down there, or why, or how (well, some of it is explained, but it\'s spotty and inadequate).

It could be argued that the signs were scattered over the previous episodes, but one just does not expect something like this, not from this kind of anime. Not only does it not fit into the general upbeat and fun mood, but because it was all left for the last episode too, it just ended up being a sloppy mess, leaving the distinct feeling that it could\'ve done with at least one more episode so that all this is properly unfolded, explained, and then tied up. That way it might have felt a little less out of place.

Plot was all over the place. With the main heroine looking more like a background character. The villain looking like it was thrown in at the end to fill in time. And the rest of the time just focusing on the male idols looking like eye-candy though...2. The animation at times went in and out from looking really nice/well-portioned to times were there eyes almost lined up with there mouths. IT WAS NOT CONSTANT...NOR PRETTY. Only when the characters were still and not talking did they look okay.3. Music was okay nothing that catchy or relevant to the plot.I really thought this would be good enough to make you cringe or at least laugh at those cheesy moments but honestly the plot was not exciting enough nor understandable. So don't bother. NOR PRETTY. Only when the characters were still and not talking did they look okay.3. Music was okay nothing that catchy or relevant to the plot.I really thought this would be good enough to make you cringe or at least laugh at those cheesy moments but honestly the plot was not exciting enough nor understandable. So don't bother."", 'Lemme just start off by saying this is the overall best male ""Idol"" anime I have seen. That being said, male ""Idol"" animes tend to be bland reserve-harem stories spiced up with beautiful boys, songs, and a dull heroine. B-Pro is no exception, however it makes a great effort to not make the heroine not so annoying dull or Mary-Sue like which inturn makes the story much more fun and the anime an overall a great way to pass the time.Story - 6The story itself starts without you and there is not much that is introduced about what happens before the heroine comes along...even though the story seems to pleading for an explanation about the boys\' success before B-Pro [in their respective groups] and how B-Pro ""really"" came to be.Still, the plot is nicely paced and the boys get entire episodes dedicated to them, however their are obvious favorites in the way that there is less focus on certain guys. Considering there is 10 guys and only 12 episodes this is a fair sacrifice so that story is able to progress and we\'re not stuck with a repetitive reverse-harem gimmick.[Spoiler-ish] However the ending conjured up in the last two to three episodes is surprising and somewhat uncalled for which is why I brought score down a little bit. The theme of this anime is overall light-hearted and gives little to no clues to the darker future which leaves you very confused as as it all happens too quickly and makes no sense. If they expanded this a bit further and the anime was longer this could have played out more smoothly but they compacted it too much at the end there and left the me with more questions.Art- 8I personally very much liked the design of the boys. A lot of colours and effects were used throughout the anime to bring life to the beautiful and handsome idols and their life. It was a little more crisp than I expected considering the move to make anime much smoother and softer recently--but the budget may have been used more on the amazing choice of voice actors instead.Sound- 8Going into what I said above--the voice actors ""made"" this anime. It was very enjoyable hearing them speak, talk coquettishly, act, and sing. Most of the songs were very addictive and you very quickly may find yourself knowing how the song goes as parts are played strategically and almost incessantly.Character- 7Half of them were unique, interesting and the series focused on them. They had backstories and problems and our Heroine, of course, helps move them forward in their world of fame. However the way they divided the boys was very bad. KitaKore and THRIVE were full of bright characters and the series seems to focus on them and give them extra shine, while the MooNs boys seem to come up short despite making up half of B-Pro. Considering the anime seems to be about bringing these three groups together both in relationships and for fame there should have been some brighter individuals in MooNs. Considering the sacrifice for the plot in this short anime, they should have brought down a member from THRIVE or something to help give MooNs equal opportunity.Enjoyment- 9As mentioned, this is my favorite male idol anime show thus far. Plenty of fanservice, pretty boys, entertaining episodes, and songs to keep me intrigued throughout the anime.Overall- 7/8My score is a little higher than expected, especially for this type of anime, but there wasn\'t much I could nitpick at so the score is what B-Pro is deserving of. Whether you like idol animes or reverse-harems, B-Pro is well put-together and an enjoyable 12 episode anime. even though the story seems to pleading for an explanation about the boys\' success before B-Pro [in their respective groups] and how B-Pro ""really"" came to be.Still, the plot is nicely paced and the boys get entire episodes dedicated to them, however their are obvious favorites in the way that there is less focus on certain guys.

I decided to watch the anime because I wasn't too interested in anything that was currently airing and I wanted to learn about the b-project lore.

What I got was a bad idol anime with crappy, almost unwatchable, animation and a weird plot that makes no sense in the end....Story: 4/10While it has some good moments, most of the plot is held together with threads that ignores its past episodes and leaves the viewers with barley any idea of what is going on. For example, one episode will show an emotional moment between two characters or a character finding themselves, and then it'll all be ignored in the next episode, leaving said character or characters back to the one dimensional stereotypes we learned in the beginning.

The ending was rushed and incredibly confusing, with enough plot twists wrapped into the final five minutes that--even as I write this--I still have no idea what happened.The art of B Project was passable in the scenes where a single character\'s face took up the entire frame. Otherwise, the animation was choppy and atrocious. To give the best example I...could think of, every character was drawn with a background character\'s face if the background character was 10 feet from the camera. I didn\'t think it was possible, and yet every scene was so visually unappealing that I had a need to show other anime fans how horrible it was.The characters that I can remember were okay I suppose. I can remember Hikaru and...Toma? Tomo?? Yuta??? I honestly can\'t remember. I just remembered them by hair color/features. No characters were given any real back story even though they were shown in flashbacks. I am really trying to remember anything about any characters at all and I\'m only recalling that one of them had a coughing condition which was never fully explained.This show wasn\'t even charmingly bad. I am someone who will watch anime that I KNOW is awful just to get a good laugh out of it, but I found myself falling asleep from boredom as the episodes went on for what felt like an eternity. This was a forgettable waste of money by the company in what I can only assume was meant to be a low-budget clone of UtaPriTL;DR: This show was far more painful and somehow less visually pleasing than shoving a rusted nail through my eye.

And, in fact, the greatest change can be seen at the plot level, where the presence of stereotypical situations typical of the genre is refreshed by a female character who is by no means taken for granted, with a natural progression of the sentimental affair, devoid of those hateful strokes of lightning , kabe-don and moine (sometimes unbearably aggressive) on a poor wretch under the thumb of the handsome guy.Tsubasa is a simple girl who worked in a record store and who...is recruited by the Gandala record company, specifically by Yashamaru-san, as R & amp; A to take care of a group of ten bold and wonderful young men who together form the B-projects. Separately we distinguish three groups: the MooNs, the THRIVE and the Kitakore.THRIVES are Yuuta Ashuu, the most cheerful of the group that makes me almost tender for how insecure it is, but little or nothing has been said about him (frankly I shipp Yuuta with Ryuugi, but nothing was done); Goushi Kaneshiro, my favorite because he is the most sane of the B-pro and also makes more logical and sensible statements than the others, is the most irascible (even if the episode in which he had to do \'miao\' was ridiculous even for me!) but he also has a big heart; and last, but not least, Kento Aizome, the super-courted playboy (rightly so cool!) with a troubled past. In episode nine, there is an important approach to Tsubasa that made me think for a moment that someone was finally calculating it and then love was about to be born as Tsubasa herself told him to accept it as it is, by doing hopelessly starting the ship! Unfortunately, as it started this way it is also over, given that no in-depth analysis has been made about it.Finally we find the MooNs of which Kazuna Masunaga is part, the leader (""Leadaa"" as Hikaru says) of which very little is known except that he slightly envies Kitakado and personally I do not agree; Mikado Sekimura, the worst of the group with an almost morbid obsession with a character from an anime series with zero importance (so much so that there is no deepening of this character); Tatsuhiro Nome, a somewhat introverted boy but very close to Hikaru whom he has known for a long time; the latter, my favorite of the group, is a great friend of Tatsu, very self-confident, energetic and really cute. In the course of the episodes it turns out to have an incurable disease (of which nothing is known) and which needs special care. He became my favorite character when Tsubasa goes to visit the MooNs, and Hikaru comes out of the shower with only a towel to cover the low areas (and the girl is already embarrassed there), but then suddenly the towel falls showing Hikaru\'s family trinkets and there SHOCKED! I thought for a moment that Tsubasa could faint and in fact we lacked little! And to top it off, Hikaru tells her ""Merry Christmas"", as if that was her personal ""Christmas"" ""gift""! Too much fun that scene, yes that is a beautiful fanservice and b (u) ono. Last of the group, is Momotarou Onzai, the slightly insipid one who in an episode finds himself having the power of perception, that is, he perceives spirits and similar things. To say that it is ridiculous to include such a thing in a reverse harem is really an understatement. So in this episode he sees the evil spirit that takes possession of a guy taken at random and must defeat him ... mah (a ""mah"" as big as a house!).Kitakores are part of Kitakado Tomohisa, overflowing with several clinics and which is slightly unpleasant to me; and Korekuni Ryuugi, a boy who looks like a female and who in the past was forced to wear women\'s clothes and was clearly traumatized. To this last character an episode was dedicated in which he falls from the stairs, he also loses a lot of blood and in addition loses his memory. Amnesia is a trite and hackneyed cliché, quite abused and hate as never before.I like all the groups in this anime but my favorite character is Kazuna Masunaga is recruited by the Gandala record company, specifically by Yashamaru-san, as R & amp; A to take care of a group of ten bold and wonderful young men who together form the B-projects. Separately we distinguish three groups: the MooNs, the THRIVE and the Kitakore.THRIVES are Yuuta Ashuu, the most cheerful of the group that makes me almost tender for how insecure it is, but little or nothing has been said about him (frankly I shipp Yuuta with Ryuugi, but nothing was done); Goushi Kaneshiro, my favorite because he is the most sane of the B-pro and also makes more logical and sensible statements than the others, is the most irascible (even if the episode in which he had to do \'miao\' was ridiculous even for me!) but he also has a big heart; and last, but not least, Kento Aizome, the super-courted playboy (rightly so cool!) with a troubled past. In episode nine, there is an important approach to Tsubasa that made me think for a moment that someone was finally calculating it and then love was about to be born as Tsubasa herself told him to accept it as it is, by doing hopelessly starting the ship! Unfortunately, as it started this way it is also over, given that no in-depth analysis has been made about it.Finally we find the MooNs of which Kazuna Masunaga is part, the leader (""Leadaa"" as Hikaru says) of which very little is known except that he slightly envies Kitakado and personally I do not agree; Mikado Sekimura, the worst of the group with an almost morbid obsession with a character from an anime series with zero importance (so much so that there is no deepening of this character); Tatsuhiro Nome, a somewhat introverted boy but very close to Hikaru whom he has known for a long time; the latter, my favorite of the group, is a great friend of Tatsu, very self-confident, energetic and really cute. In the course of the episodes it turns out to have an incurable disease (of which nothing is known) and which needs special care. He became my favorite character when Tsubasa goes to visit the MooNs, and Hikaru comes out of the shower with only a towel to cover the low areas (and the girl is already embarrassed there), but then suddenly the towel falls showing Hikaru\'s family trinkets and there SHOCKED! I thought for a moment that Tsubasa could faint and in fact we lacked little! And to top it off, Hikaru tells her ""Merry Christmas"", as if that was her personal ""Christmas"" ""gift""!

I don\'t know if they didn\'t have this well planned out for 12 episodes.I think the best thing that\'s coming out of this franchise is the music because of the seiyuu talent. It\'s fantastic.I am rating this low simply due to the ending and poor character development. ', 'Summary Review:This is your typical reverse harem with idols (except there is 0 romance). Its more like a harem of friendship with the main character. While it is refreshing to have a idol harem where the idols arent all falling all over the plain boring girl, keep in mind it is still your typical ""idol anime"". Sound 8, Art 9,  Characters 7, Story 5. Overall 6 - decent anime that is ruined by a rushed ending.Full Review:Firstly, the art and sound are good. The music doesnt vary much as its all the same songs pretty much but the music as a whole isnt too...bad. Its probably just my personal preference but the art was good, it suited the anime genre. Sound:8. Art: 9.The characters arent too bad. Sure there are your typical ""idol"" types but you see them everywhere and you should know what your getting into if your watching this to begin with. They try to give everyone an individuality to them and even tell you a little bit of backstory to a few of the characters while almost none to others. Not too bad in terms of character developement considering this was only 12 episodes, i have seen a lot worse. While there are a character or 2 that are way too much for me to come to like, not too bad. Character:7.But its all downhill from there..... The story started off not too bad, it doesnt have much of a ""story"" as such but thats to be expected from most idol anime and the people watching will generally understand that. For the first 9 episodes it felt as if everything was going almost too well at times but in general it wasnt too bad, and if the last 3 were just as good i would have given the story a 7. However, the 10th episode throws a spanner in the mix. I wont say what happens because spoilers but its a big plot twist (a semi forseeable one at least). Now thats fine, i dont mind a plot twist but by leaving the plot twist until 2 episodes before the end they had to rush it and explained NOTHING. They throw a million questions at you and answer 1. A huge disapointment that has probably ruined the minor chance for a season 2 so we will probably never learn the answer to those 999 999 questions we have. Story:5. bad.

Story:5.', ""This anime wasn't too bad but the only thing I can really complain about was the ending was so so.. But everything else was pretty great and the music in this series is great and the characters are nice. And I enjoyed it a lot except for the last episode. But Overall the score is an 8/10 for me. Also this is another anime that fits into a niche of (bishies, fan service, and idols) so if you don't like that stuff then I don't recommend this to you. Each to there own. But if you do I think you will enjoy this series. Also...there is a mobile game for this anime and its great. And here is why I rated this a 8/10 .....Story  7/10Okay so I almost gave this section a 6/10 because the ending for me was just like wtf where did that come from and the last episode felt a bit rushed towards the end. But The rest of the series was cute and the story was nice. Also the plot twist did get me but the could've executed it better and the series left a lot of unanswered questions. But the shows core story was pretty good.Art 7/10Nothing amazing, and I didn't expect anything amazing for the art. But each character design was done well and everything was colorful.Sound 10/10Love the BGMS and the unit songs for this anime are great, the music was just great!Characters 9/10The show did a good job portraying each character, however at there are 4 characters who were extremely similar in appearance at first glance, but the show did a good job fixing that an adding well needed and well executed development for those 4 as well with all the characters. Also the protag wasn't as bad as I thought she was going to be and had some cute quirkiness to her personality.Enjoyment 9/10I loved this show a lot! I would've gave it a 10/10 for enjoyment if the ending was better and didn't feel so forced or out of place. But Overall I had a great time watching it and it made me get some of the unit albums and play the mobile game.Overall 8/10... almost 7/10 because of the weird ending, but if I did that I would be doing a disservice to the 11 episodes before the last one. But I had a great time with those 11 episodes so it deserves that 8/10! there is a mobile game for this anime and its great.

Yes? Then you saw B-project. The anime shows the growing of the group and a little of each characters and their schedules. But you\'re a little to busy looking at the bishonen to pay attention to it.Art: Is not awesome but I like the fact they didn\'t used CG  for the dancing scenes and still did a nice job animating it, that\'s it, nothing else to say.Sound: I starded seeing b-project because I...LOVE the songs so yeah why not see the anime?

AND B Project also has a bad guy that doesn\'t make any sense, ANY SENSE. Watch and see who is for yourself if you think you need to.Enjoyement: I liked the anime for about 10 episodes, but the last two were a big NO because nothing makes sense  and this made me think ""Why I wasted 6 hours of my life seeing this?"" so yeah, the enjoyement took a downfall.Overall: 4! Why? Because as I said above, Why did I watch this?

It has a large cast so I don\'t expect much in terms of character depth.

The build up to that ending though I believe was steady enough for it to make some sense. Idol anime generally tend to be character based, as in, each episode is focussed on a different character and their backgrounds. B-Pro did an OK job at this, but they focussed too...much on certain characters and neglected others.Art: 3/10I had high hopes for the art, especially when I saw the CGs from their game, but when I say I cringed, I mean I CRINGED. The animation was very choppy, especially when animating the choreographies and character movements in general. Characters would often look like their face was run over by a truck. The stills and the character's eyes were probably the only admirable aspect of the art, otherwise, pretty bad.Sound: 9/10I really loved the music that B-Pro had to offer, I watched the anime partially because some of my favorite voice actors played characters in the anime, and I was pretty happy with the music work. The lyrics of the songs really touched me, and I found the songs to be very catchy as well (I downloaded their music on my phone recently), it's a shame that their game is not in service anymore. The only problems I have is that after a few episodes, it gets very repetitive, they keep playing the opening and ending songs throughout random parts of the episodes, and I think they would have done better if they added more variety in their sounds.Character: 8/10The characters were built very well. They had backstories that actually made me emotional and went through conflicts that were very realistic, and you can clearly see how they effected the characters. The one problem I have is again, focussing only on a few characters and forgetting the others existed. The rest really deserve some justice in screen time.Enjoyment: 8/10I did actually enjoy watching the anime, but I wouldn't say I looked forward to watching more after each episode. It was only towards the end that I was truly hooked. Things that interfered with my enjoyment were mainly the prominence of too much fan service that would really ruin the mood because of their bad timing and the fact that they did not wrap up the anime very well. This still bothers me.Overall: 7/10If it weren't for the music, I would have probably given this anime a much lower rating. The story was meh, the characters were well built, and the art totally destroyed the experience. I would only recommend this if art did not matter to you, or you really like j-pop music. I only enjoyed around 4 episodes out of the 12, but do take my opinions with a grain of salt as I did not have any prior knowledge on the project and the idol group much on certain characters and neglected others.Art: 3/10I had high hopes for the art, especially when I saw the CGs from their game, but when I say I cringed, I mean I CRINGED.

Telling the stories of ten characters (3 idol units) requires solid writing to pull it off. However, the show failed to do that. Episodes shift from one unit to another so fast that I barely got to know them. Because of its lack of focus, the characters ended up more like archetypes and tropes than human beings trying to make it big in the entertainment industry. Their growth was either hard to tell or nonexistent as the storytelling makes relating to them challenging. Furthermore, B Project seemed more interested in adding...some fanservice instead of developing their personalities. The anime-only characters seemed to have more personality than the idols themselves.The only idols that stuck with me were the ones from Kitakore, because 1. their song plays in the ED and 2. they seem to be the only ones with the most screen time. The unit THRIVE was typical and I barely knew anyone from MooNs.Speaking of which, for an idol anime the show's OST wasn't fantastic. While the characters can sing, the insert songs didn't feel original or fun to listen again. The artwork was pretty with okay animation. The voice acting was alright, but nothing noteworthy given the writing.Overall, B Project is not a terrible idol anime. Rather, it's slightly below average due its writing and weak cats management. some fanservice instead of developing their personalities.

Beyblade Burst,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31049/Beyblade_Burst,"[""Note: I watched all of the beyblade generations and this is by FAR the best one.There are a LOT of shonen animes that try too hard to be unique, but most of them fail. Beyblade burst keeps things simple while really focusing on its characters and their interactions, unlike the previous generations who were just about battling and yada yada. In this season the beyblade battles are more of a plot device for the characters to fully interact with each other, and it works perfectly.Animation and voice acting is good, it gets better in the next season (especially the CG) but it's a pretty popular...show in Japan so of course the budget is pretty big. What sets this anime apart though is that there are SO MANY good soundtracks. In a 4-cour anime of course there's bound to be a lot of good music but giving almost every character their own theme was outstanding.The op fits this season well, they're more emotional than the Beyblade Burst God or Beyblade Burst Chouzetsu ones, since like I said battling is not that important here, the characters are.I've watched over 200 anime and honestly I love this with every inch of my body. show in Japan so of course the budget is pretty big.

I saw a random episode of Beyblade burst on the tv(in german language) and I thought that it was not even bad, actually the characters were funny and cool. Sure this is a kids show and many people are too mature or old for this, but if you can forget that his is a kids show than you will surely love it.Analysis time;Story: 9It's the typical sports anime story, the main characters starts weak but he trains alot and becomes really strong. The pacing is really good and...it's quite realistic. All the side characters are somehow important to the story and the battles are not extremly long, they are even epic and really nice to watch. Overall the story is great, because it's filled with comedy, slice of life and many epic beyblade battles.Art: 10The characters designs are probably the best ever. Sure they too cool and badass, but that's beyblade. Xander looks like he's 18 with bizeps and abs like that, but he is still 11 xD The animations are also exremly good and the fights looks great. I always wonder how they got that budget for that anime.Sound: 8The english and the german dubs are probably one of the best ever. They use like absurd and funny jokes(even memes sometimes) The best jokes and puns are from rantaro, the head honcho(sunshine and tacos) The music is really good and hype and the opening song is great(japanese and dubs version)Characters: 9The characters have all a strong personality and good designs. Well all girls love Shu, because he is looks good and he's an badass. But the other characters are great too, especially Rantaro and Lui. Even the noname characters have a nice design and even a personality.Enjoyment: 10I binged it in some days, because it was really thrilling and funny. Watching anime like this really wants me to be child again or even to live in an anime world(chuunibyo alaram lol)Overall: 5/5I really recommend it to everyone. Don't be so mature all the time and just watch it for having fun and enjoy the beyblade battles. it's quite realistic. All the side characters are somehow important to the story and the battles are not extremly long, they are even epic and really nice to watch. Overall the story is great, because it's filled with comedy, slice of life and many epic beyblade battles.Art: 10The characters designs are probably the best ever. Sure they too cool and badass, but that's beyblade. Xander looks like he's 18 with bizeps and abs like that, but he is still 11 xD The animations are also exremly good and the fights looks great. I always wonder how they got that budget for that anime.Sound: 8The english and the german dubs are probably one of the best ever. They use like absurd and funny jokes(even memes sometimes) The best jokes and puns are from rantaro, the head honcho(sunshine and tacos) The music is really good and hype and the opening song is great(japanese and dubs version)Characters: 9The characters have all a strong personality and good designs. Well all girls love Shu, because he is looks good and he's an badass. But the other characters are great too, especially Rantaro and Lui. Even the noname characters have a nice design and even a personality.Enjoyment: 10I binged it in some days, because it was really thrilling and funny. Watching anime like this really wants me to be child again or even to live in an anime world(chuunibyo alaram lol)Overall: 5/5I really recommend it to everyone. Don't be so mature all the time and just watch it for having fun and enjoy the beyblade battles."", 'SPOILER FREEWhere have the years of enjoyable Beyblade gone? As a huge fan of the original series, the contrast between that and this is painful. That isn\'t to say that this series in simply bad but it is simply worse than both the original and metal series. With little excitement, weak main characters and a story that only gets exciting after 30 episodes and introducing several new characters, Beyblade Burst instant charm.What is good about the anime is (sadly) the side characters. In this series it is easier to enjoy the appearance of supporting characters (such as Xander and Zac) rather than the main character...Volt; but there\'s a lot more to be said about that later on. The animation is pretty nice and clean and the dubbed voices are pretty good. But yet my largest criticism is the lack of enjoyment throughout the first half of the series.However managed to finish the series after all, so it can\'t be all that bad.Analysis time;Story: 3Whilst writing this review I\'ve constantly finding myself changing the score for story due to it\'s ridiculously luck based nature and repetitivity. Cliche and predictable, I found myself guessing the results of every match with a 90% success rate. However this wasn\'t the case so much in the end, instead battles were decided by injury or luck. Skill (or logic) no longer prevailed.What really disappointed me is the shift that the series has undergone. Originally, characters would improve through hard battles, training and important life events. In Beyblade Burst the ""power of friendship"" and ""bonds with your Bey"" seem to overcome all talent or skill. Worsening this is the confusing format of events such as tournaments, with participants only consisting of certain characters, and locations for events strangely close (yet there\'s a boat trip??) creating a mass confusion throughout.If you\'re a Beyblade fan this underdog story may be bearable otherwise it\'s hard to watch.Art: 7Not much to be said really. The characters do look great and the battles look great two. The effects in battles are nothing special but are easy to follow and rather nice. Not perfect but rather pleasing. Often I found things clear, but others who I watched it with saw it unclear when burst scenes occurred and thought some of the colours washed together at times so you don\'t know who\'s bey burst.Sound: 5What this series has a pretty good dub. Besides Volt\'s 5 year old voice, every other character has a voice that suits their character well. The opening is bubbly but not memorable and the sound of Beyblades colliding is decent.What it lacks however is a main character whose voice I can bare for 51 episodes. Often after watching more than 1 episode, I found myself feeling irritated at the overly loud and childish voice of Volt.All that said, 5 isn\'t a bad score, it\'s just okay.Characters: 5Zac, Xander, Lui, Shu, Orochi and a few other characters found themselves really likeable and created something for me to enjoy in the series. These characters in particular became favourites of mine. It\'s a huge shame that of these only Shu is a main character. That said, the majority of the main characters either have inconsistent backstories (Rantaro), bad morals (Daigo), or unbearable attitudes (Wakiya). What happened to making your main characters likeable? I truly believe a flaw in this series is that the side characters are 10 times more interesting than the main ones.Above all, characters (beside from Daigo and Ken) see no development. Each character has a moment from time to time where they learn something, only to be forgotten about the next episode. All this said, it was hard to score it above a 4, but due to personal likeness I pushed it up one.Enjoyment: 4This series of Beyblade just doesn\'t have ""it"". Throughout I found myself wondering why I would watch this instead of another Beyblade series. There are exciting moments at times and episodes can be fun, but the majority of the arcs lack anything special or unique that made me want to look at the screen.Thee series it\'s moments but certainly will not re-watch as I hardly kept my eyes on the screen the first time.Overall: 4/5Well Beyblade Burst probably isn\'t the worst thing I\'ve seen, but it is the worst Beyblade series undoubtedly. It has nothing likeable that the original or the metal series doesn\'t have.All in all, I can\'t recommend Beyblade Burst to others, unless you\'re a hardcore fan.

Better then Metal and less Shonen.The animation is fluid and clear. Theres tons of added effects like sparks to keep the audience entertained.Valt is a likable character, he isn't deep but he's likable with his energetic personality. Theres his best friend Rantaro who is the comedic relief but also a decent blader as well...as the champion Shu his rival and also close friend. Theres also an edgy Hiei type character and Chinese stereotype and a weird guy who talks with puppets.So why would you give Burst a try? Because Valt is the Ash Ketchum of Beyblade. He goes from a novice to champion. He is the underdog you want to root for. He's just a kid and it's made clear several times.Watching him grow in the series and take on new challenges is entertaining.You WANT Valt to succeed. You want to see him rise to the top.The show is filled with charming fun moments. It isn't a deep show but it's filled with drama and it's just a blast to watch Valt Rantaro and everybody else fulfill their dreams.If you want to start the BURST saga, you have to start with this show and honestly it's the best show in the saga.The later entries get too confusing but Valt is still a very likable protagonist. And Burst is still a good show. as the champion Shu his rival and also close friend.
