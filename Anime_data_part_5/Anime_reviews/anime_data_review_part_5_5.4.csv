Ano Hi no Kanojo-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37589/Ano_Hi_no_Kanojo-tachi,"[""Well, the synopsis tells you exactly, what this is.TL;DR If you are hunting for a quick entry, this is nice. I did not watch 22/7 at the point of writing this, but I could still enjoy the shorts. And if you did watch, I'm sure you could enjoy the additional content even more!Story: There is no real story here and we also get no context, there are only little sketches.Art: The Animation is looking really good and Cloverworks definitely put some work into the episodes, albeit falling short.Sound: There is mostly no background music with an exception of one episode with piano in the...background, but environmental sounds can be heard and are decent.Character(s): We don't get to know them really well, but we can see tiny bits of character within the present ones. They don't go through any development of course, as being in everyday life scenes. Wouldn't expect that anyway :DEnjoyment: Well, with only around 9 minutes watchtime, there is no big base to judge of, but the little episodes were fun to watch.Overall: It is a pity it's just one minute episodes. I do think it has potential for even more of such scenes and if you want to take a quick pause from, say an action anime, this is great. background, but environmental sounds can be heard and are decent.Character(s): We don't get to know them really well, but we can see tiny bits of character within the present ones.

Bananya: Fushigi na Nakama-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40228/Bananya__Fushigi_na_Nakama-tachi,"[""Whereas the first season of bananya was, although very refreshing, only a ccdct (cute cats doing cute things) its sequel, Bananya and the Curious Bunch, turns out much more ambitious than anyone could've expected it to be.The first important thing to notice is that this time the story doesn't happen on Earth but on the bananyas original planet, the small moon !As if it didn't think it was mind blowing  enough, the very first scene of the first episode depicts the birth of the first bananya from the bananya tree, as if to challenge creationnism and the different religious practices exerced around the world.The...following episodes are in a similar style to the first season following the bananyas in their daily life, the twist this time is that it revolves around how their society is affected by different elements of our world sent to them in the form of shooting stars.In the span of only 3 minutes, Bananya and the Curious Bunch manages to produce an elaborate critique of the danger our technological innovation can have on innocent creatures (it offers an interesting counterpoint on genetic engineering and robotic technologies).Of course some other episodes on only focused on the bananyas having fun with a random object which is always rendered beautifully with its gorgeous pastel art that never misses its soothing effect.Now where I think this second bananya season is a genius moves lies in its last 3 episodes (stop there if you don't want to be spoiled).It's precisely in these episodes where the connection with the first series is clearly explicit. To satisfy his wishes, our main Bananya is allowed to encounter Rainbow Bananya (the equivalent of God in the world of bananya) who send him to Earth because he was so eager to discover it in its complete prism. Of course you would expect all of it to go well for him but he almost gets crushed and discovers that people there EAT bananas in all kind of flavors !This is right after that scene that the other bananyas decide to join him aboard their rockets and explains why they became so numerous on Earth.From cute slice of life to an anticipation series simulating the Great Replacement, this season defied  my expectations and unironically became one of my favourite anime of the year 2019. following episodes are in a similar style to the first season following the bananyas in their daily life, the twist this time is that it revolves around how their society is affected by different elements of our world sent to them in the form of shooting stars.In the span of only 3 minutes, Bananya and the Curious Bunch manages to produce an elaborate critique of the danger our technological innovation can have on innocent creatures (it offers an interesting counterpoint on genetic engineering and robotic technologies).Of course some other episodes on only focused on the bananyas having fun with a random object which is always rendered beautifully with its gorgeous pastel art that never misses its soothing effect.Now where I think this second bananya season is a genius moves lies in its last 3 episodes (stop there if you don't want to be spoiled).It's precisely in these episodes where the connection with the first series is clearly explicit.

(This contains spoilers)The show\'s first season explores Bananya\'s depression and the need to understand his own puzzling existence. In this season we get to see more of this existentialism and delve into the puzzling world that is Bananya\'s home planet. However, I\'m here to talk about some of the questions this season left me with.In episode 10, Bananya and Droopy-eared bananya find a globe. This is an exact replica of the ""big round thing in the sky"", which is earth. However,...this version of earth is missing the whole continent of Africa, and America is divided (central america is also missing). Is this the result of nuclear warfare? Is this also how the bananya planet came to be?We see a mountain in the background of a lot of episodes. I noticed it has a face and the ability to emote, is it a sentient being? If that\'s the case, is the whole planet another being or is it just the mountain?Zombie bananyas are recurring characters. Is this how the bananyas reached immortality? Is this why this Bananya is desperate to find ways out of this planet, into the ""big round thing in the sky""? I believe this is rooted in his inability to understand his whole race\'s existence, half banana - half cat, conflicting halves.Lastly, bananya and his friends encounter Lengendary Rainbow Bananya and Night Rainbow Bananya. These two grant Bananya\'s wish, which is to go to earth. Are they the bananya equivalent of god?Honestly, I\'m intrigued. I\'m looking forward to more entries in the bananya extended universe. I personally think the Bananya Cult Bible is an interesting text for anyone who wants to go deeper into bananya lore, and maybe it would be worthy of an anime adaptation. I\'ll for sure be checking out the light novels.Edit: Here\'s a link to the Bananya Cult Bible, in case anyone is interested. https://codehs.com/editor/html/417414/986704/Bible.html this version of earth is missing the whole continent of Africa, and America is divided (central america is also missing).

When fighting there are no rules; anything and everything is fair game.The artwork from this preview seems similar to Drifters (aired Fall 2016).

First off, it was only four minutes. They should\'ve made it into a  Christmas themed episode, not just four minutes of characters saying what they like about Christmas. Second off, all the dialogue for the characters, other than the FFF (those guys who are dressed in the black KKK outfits) who\'s responses vary on the character, is EXACTLY THE SAME! For example, when Himeji said what she liked about Christmas, they said that Christmas is a time to celebrate the...birth of Christ, not love. On the other hand, when Hideyoshi said the SAME EXACT THING, they said, ""HIDEYOSHI PLEASE DATE ME!!!"" And the pattern goes on like that.

It's a good reminder if you wanna get into the manga or just wanna see our favorite characters again but it'll be...a bit confusing if watched first.Important to mention is that the adult Alice scenes do not exist in the manga, the staff had to make a connection to the recaps so they used that trick, it was refreshing and not annoying, those scenes were calm and beautiful.One major thing the viewers get to see (that isn't in the OVA) is the Mokuren concert from the manga, the piece is truly splendid to watch and hear, Mokuren's song is captivating, the VA did a very good job in singing that, I say that was the focal point of this recap and the fans will surely love it.In the end, it was a decent recap and enjoyable to watch from a fan point of view, the animation is on par with the OVA (as in stunning, beautiful and expressive with a gorgeous art style), we get to see all of the important events and it ends with Alice's trip in Kyoto and Mokuren's concert.

Choujuu Kishin Dancougar,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2255/Choujuu_Kishin_Dancougar,"['The mid 80s were a volatile time for the mecha genre, but at the time some didn\'t realize it. Mobile Suit Gundam ended prematurely in 1980, but it would nonetheless prove to be the kiss of death to the super robot sub-genre, as the ratio of real robot anime to super robot anime would become increasingly unbalanced all the way to the present day.Super Beast Machine God Dancougar came out in 1985, the middle of the transitional period, and unlike many other super robot shows that continued old trends, Dancougar is a strange one that is completely of and away from its time. SBMGD (which...I\'ll just call ""Dancougar"") remains an odd duck, a mecha anime that is defined by its titular super robot yet surrounded by influence of burgeoning real robot tropes.When Earth finds itself suddenly attacked by an alien race known as the Zarbados its defenses prove incapable of repelling the invaders, and the majority of Earth\'s forces and population are quickly wiped out. The survivors either form guerrilla groups or work with what\'s left of the regular army, as it hides and rebuilds its strength. The regular army assembles a team of four soldiers known as the Cyber Beast Force, whom are chosen to pilot the army\'s newest advances in weapon technology: you guessed it - the Cyber Beasts.The series\'s main character is Shinobu Fujiwara, an ace fighter pilot whose angry outbursts and confrontative attitude often draw the contempt of both subordinates and superiors. As the first CBF member, Shinobu struggles to balance his temper with being a capable leader. He is soon joined by old flight academy acquaintance, Sara Yuki, who is moderately less combative but still assertive, and much more compassionate. The far more easy-going and playful Masato Shikibu follows, and last to join is the eldest Ryo Shiba, who often rises to play a mentor role in the team due to being the most spiritual and calm-minded, as well as being the only one who can smack since into Shinobu when it\'s needed.The Cyber Beast Force aren\'t your typical super robot Combattler V team, here. These are all young adults, trained military men, and individuals with their own senses of ego. Not straightforward heroes who are simply best friends, but situational allies who support each other just as much as they fight with each other (often even physically). For these reasons, the Dancougar pilots have a true sense of humanity to them that old idealistic super robot heroes often lacked and it\'s much more entertaining to follow them and watch their interactions. Character development is sadly limited, but the banter is charming and it\'s easy to root for any member of the team, as they all have likable personalities, often proving themselves capable, and no one feels like a weak link in the team. Without a doubt, the CBF are the toughest, coolest super robot team I\'ve yet encountered, and their clashing personalities and dialogue are without a doubt the reason why I enjoy this show as much as I do.Supporting cast includes the incredibly blunt and harsh General Igor, who seems like he might take the defeat of the Zarbados more seriously than the CBF\'s lives, and his right-hand man Professor Kotaro Hazuki who designs the CBF\'s technology and often advises during missions. There\'s also Laura Sullivan, an orphaned American girl who comes to live at the regular army base after her rescue, and a mysterious Black Knight who sometimes shows up in his own mecha to save the Dancougar team - much to Shinobu\'s chagrin.But perhaps more important than any of the supporting cast is the true villain of the series, Shapiro Keats, Sara\'s ex-boyfriend whose limitless ambition causes him to immediately abandon the Earth after believing them to be doomed at the superior might of the Zarbados. Though initially rejected by the Zarbados as well, Shapiro quickly earns their trust by leaking information and advice to them which allows him to rise up through the Zarbados ranks to become a commander. Shapiro sets himself up as a genuine threat to the CBF early on as his strategies outmatch other Zarbados generals and his knowledge of Earth and humans prove to be what they needed. Shapiro\'s extreme arrogance sets him up as some sort of proto-Dio Brando (Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure) and the viewer is left curious on how far he\'ll take his manipulation of the Zarbados empire. He\'s a good, truly evil villain, and one of the rare that satisfies the ""love to hate"" type. Sara (for some stupid reason) often finds herself torn between her former love of the sociopath and her duty as his new enemy. To cut things short, I\'ll just say that the other members of the Zarbados army aren\'t particularly interesting.If there\'s an aspect old super robot anime are notorious for, it\'s the monster-of-the-week format (often just called ""MotW""). This format is defined by an episodic nature where each episode would introduce a new one-off monster that would easily be dispatched at the end of the episode, only for the major villains to escape and things to go back to normal, no real progress being made on destroying the true enemy. Regardless of whether there\'s a literal new monster or not each episode, this format is used to denote any series with a lot of tasks that are inconsequential to the main goal. Though coming from a time when this was still common, Dancougar does a solid job at avoiding this with a plot that slowly progresses over the series rather than suddenly at the series finale. While it\'s still easy to come across an episode where it feels like no progress is made, these episodes are often justified through giving character backstory or focusing on a single character and helping them define their personality as well as showing that they\'re a strong individual team member. The aforementioned realistic drama and character interactions also all go a long way towards keeping the series entertaining for its prematurely ended 38 episode run (probably for the best now that we\'ve got our sequel).This odd blend of realistic drama and situations combined with supernatural super robot abilities is also the reason why Dancougar is sometimes referred to as a deconstruction of the super robot genre. While this is technically true, I doubt it was intended as such, though a major point of advice given to Shinobu being ""battles are no longer going to be won through force, but through scientific strategies"" makes one wonder otherwise. Another thing is the team members confronting General Igor over being sent to take care of small problems rather than fighting the enemy directly, a reference and meta criticism to the MotW format. On top of this drama, there\'s also the odd mechs themselves. Let\'s get into that.The Cyber Beasts have three forms plus their combined form, with the exception being Shinobu\'s Eagle Fighter, as it doesn\'t need to separate its default and beast form. The default forms are all tanks besides Shinobu\'s fighter jet, and other than the fact that they fire laser bullets are completely standard military technology, hence they\'re real robot mechs. Things get iffier when they transform into their beast mode, each one representing an Eagle, Cougar, Liger, and Mammoth. These forms and beyond are powered by the pilot\'s anger (another super robot trait: gaining power through emotions) and move like the animals they\'re named after and even bite and rend enemies with their fangs and claws. Later the team gains humanoid transformations, going back to real robots. Breaking another super robot anime convention, the team doesn\'t gain the ability to combine into Dancougar itself until about a third of the way into the series, allowing some build up to this major event you know will inevitably come. This immensely strong combined form makes it more traditionally super robot, but it still uses primarily ammo-based weaponry, melee attacks, and is dependent on an energy source. On top of all this, the mechs are predominantly colored black and grey, standard military colors instead of a more elaborate cartoonish color scheme. This gives the Dancougar a more modern, sleeker look when compared to combining mechs before it. With many themes of the show being inspired by Taoism, the mechs also follow a subtle evolution motif, going from machine (weapon), to animal, to human, to God.A man named Osamu Totsuka apparently did the music, and considering the low budget he almost certainly wasn\'t paid enough. The Dancougar series is regarded as having some of the best music from any mecha show, and the theme songs Burning Love, Ai yo Far Away, and Burning Rage are possibly more well-known than the series\'s actual storyline, as they\'re popular among people who\'ve never even watched the series. If the big poofy haircuts and flashing lights during transformation sequences didn\'t tip you off, then the heavily synthesized soundtrack will remind you that this is an 80s anime. Nonetheless, there are plenty of organic instruments and electric guitar to keep up variety, and there\'s even many highlights among the background music in addition to the vocal songs.Now, being an old super robot anime you can still be certain that Dancougar has its blotches, many due to its time. For starters, the budget is absolutely horrible, leading to several nearly unbelievably hilarious moments in trash animation and constant stock footage. Though pretty much just a big detriment, these animation flubs can oftentimes make scenes a lot more charming and entertaining than they would\'ve been otherwise, but that\'s the only good thing to say here (well, the art itself is.. decent). Secondly, too much of an episode\'s time is often caught up in transformation and battle (again, often stock) footage, sometimes even showing aliens and regular grunts fighting for several minutes when we have no reason to give a damn about these faceless battles. Finally, though a step away from an episodic nature, story developments still happen slowly and many episodes primarily revolve around boring new characters who are quickly forgot about forever once the episode is over. Like I said before, it\'s probably a good thing the series was forced to end early and put the important events on fast-forward, since there\'s no reason to complain now that we have the series concluded in short sequel releases.I\'ve been singing a lot of Dancougar\'s praises because I completely love the team, mech, music, and would not hesitate to slap the ""underrated"" moniker on it, but it\'s still a flawed show that could\'ve done more with the great ideas I mentioned. It\'s not something I would recommend to someone who\'s not already a fan of old super robot anime, but it\'s still a fairly unique show in an often stagnant genre which alone deserves respect, and it could make a solid entry point into old super robot anime. In a way Dancougar shows us an alternate future of the super robot genre, where it met halfway with the real robot drama that killed it, instead of modern super robot shows that simply take the old tropes and turn the dial up on them. My love for the Dancougar team got me through the series\'s many troughs, so your mileage may vary greatly, but for people interested in the range and history of the super robot genre there\'s definitely at least something to find in this somehow underrated classic. I\'ll just call ""Dancougar"") remains an odd duck, a mecha anime that is defined by its titular super robot yet surrounded by influence of burgeoning real robot tropes.When Earth finds itself suddenly attacked by an alien race known as the Zarbados its defenses prove incapable of repelling the invaders, and the majority of Earth\'s forces and population are quickly wiped out.

Shapiro\'s extreme arrogance sets him up as some sort of proto-Dio Brando (Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure) and the viewer is left curious on how far he\'ll take his manipulation of the Zarbados empire. He\'s a good, truly evil villain, and one of the rare that satisfies the ""love to hate"" type. Sara (for some stupid reason) often finds herself torn between her former love of the sociopath and her duty as his new enemy. To cut things short, I\'ll just say that the other members of the Zarbados army aren\'t particularly interesting.If there\'s an aspect old super robot anime are notorious for, it\'s the monster-of-the-week format (often just called ""MotW""). This format is defined by an episodic nature where each episode would introduce a new one-off monster that would easily be dispatched at the end of the episode, only for the major villains to escape and things to go back to normal, no real progress being made on destroying the true enemy. Regardless of whether there\'s a literal new monster or not each episode, this format is used to denote any series with a lot of tasks that are inconsequential to the main goal. Though coming from a time when this was still common, Dancougar does a solid job at avoiding this with a plot that slowly progresses over the series rather than suddenly at the series finale. While it\'s still easy to come across an episode where it feels like no progress is made, these episodes are often justified through giving character backstory or focusing on a single character and helping them define their personality as well as showing that they\'re a strong individual team member. The aforementioned realistic drama and character interactions also all go a long way towards keeping the series entertaining for its prematurely ended 38 episode run (probably for the best now that we\'ve got our sequel).This odd blend of realistic drama and situations combined with supernatural super robot abilities is also the reason why Dancougar is sometimes referred to as a deconstruction of the super robot genre. While this is technically true, I doubt it was intended as such, though a major point of advice given to Shinobu being ""battles are no longer going to be won through force, but through scientific strategies"" makes one wonder otherwise. Another thing is the team members confronting General Igor over being sent to take care of small problems rather than fighting the enemy directly, a reference and meta criticism to the MotW format. On top of this drama, there\'s also the odd mechs themselves. Let\'s get into that.The Cyber Beasts have three forms plus their combined form, with the exception being Shinobu\'s Eagle Fighter, as it doesn\'t need to separate its default and beast form. The default forms are all tanks besides Shinobu\'s fighter jet, and other than the fact that they fire laser bullets are completely standard military technology, hence they\'re real robot mechs. Things get iffier when they transform into their beast mode, each one representing an Eagle, Cougar, Liger, and Mammoth. These forms and beyond are powered by the pilot\'s anger (another super robot trait: gaining power through emotions) and move like the animals they\'re named after and even bite and rend enemies with their fangs and claws. Later the team gains humanoid transformations, going back to real robots. Breaking another super robot anime convention, the team doesn\'t gain the ability to combine into Dancougar itself until about a third of the way into the series, allowing some build up to this major event you know will inevitably come. This immensely strong combined form makes it more traditionally super robot, but it still uses primarily ammo-based weaponry, melee attacks, and is dependent on an energy source. On top of all this, the mechs are predominantly colored black and grey, standard military colors instead of a more elaborate cartoonish color scheme. This gives the Dancougar a more modern, sleeker look when compared to combining mechs before it. With many themes of the show being inspired by Taoism, the mechs also follow a subtle evolution motif, going from machine (weapon), to animal, to human, to God.A man named Osamu Totsuka apparently did the music, and considering the low budget he almost certainly wasn\'t paid enough. The Dancougar series is regarded as having some of the best music from any mecha show, and the theme songs Burning Love, Ai yo Far Away, and Burning Rage are possibly more well-known than the series\'s actual storyline, as they\'re popular among people who\'ve never even watched the series. If the big poofy haircuts and flashing lights during transformation sequences didn\'t tip you off, then the heavily synthesized soundtrack will remind you that this is an 80s anime. Nonetheless, there are plenty of organic instruments and electric guitar to keep up variety, and there\'s even many highlights among the background music in addition to the vocal songs.Now, being an old super robot anime you can still be certain that Dancougar has its blotches, many due to its time. For starters, the budget is absolutely horrible, leading to several nearly unbelievably hilarious moments in trash animation and constant stock footage. Though pretty much just a big detriment, these animation flubs can oftentimes make scenes a lot more charming and entertaining than they would\'ve been otherwise, but that\'s the only good thing to say here (well, the art itself is.. decent). Secondly, too much of an episode\'s time is often caught up in transformation and battle (again, often stock) footage, sometimes even showing aliens and regular grunts fighting for several minutes when we have no reason to give a damn about these faceless battles. Finally, though a step away from an episodic nature, story developments still happen slowly and many episodes primarily revolve around boring new characters who are quickly forgot about forever once the episode is over. Like I said before, it\'s probably a good thing the series was forced to end early and put the important events on fast-forward, since there\'s no reason to complain now that we have the series concluded in short sequel releases.I\'ve been singing a lot of Dancougar\'s praises because I completely love the team, mech, music, and would not hesitate to slap the ""underrated"" moniker on it, but it\'s still a flawed show that could\'ve done more with the great ideas I mentioned. It\'s not something I would recommend to someone who\'s not already a fan of old super robot anime, but it\'s still a fairly unique show in an often stagnant genre which alone deserves respect, and it could make a solid entry point into old super robot anime. In a way Dancougar shows us an alternate future of the super robot genre, where it met halfway with the real robot drama that killed it, instead of modern super robot shows that simply take the old tropes and turn the dial up on them. My love for the Dancougar team got me through the series\'s many troughs, so your mileage may vary greatly, but for people interested in the range and history of the super robot genre there\'s definitely at least something to find in this somehow underrated classic.', 'There\'s few anime I love more than a good 80\'s mecha/sci-fi series, and Choujuu Kishin Dancougar is probably runner up for my favorite mech series next to Macross (Macross has the better.....everything). It\'s hard to find anything about it that separates it from any other given mech show with giant robots, but that means it retains the same charm that keeps you watching anime of the same mold.[STORY 6] Very clear cut and dry for the most part. Dancougar\'s plot won\'t blow anyone away if you\'re looking for a surprise. The story seems to have taken creative liberties from Genesis Climber Mospeada and...Voltron. Planet is under attack by aliens and a group of hotshot pilots are assembled to pilot machines to fight against the threat, you know the deal. I\'ve always questioned the motives behind evil alien warlords and empires in their schemes to take over earth. If you want this planet for it\'s resources and atmosphere, isn\'t zapping it to oblivion kind of counterproductive? Or if you were looking to blow up a planet, why not Venus? We\'re not using it. Anyway, so much of the first half of Dancougar is establishing the mechs the character pilot, so it becomes a bit repetitive early. Aliens attack, heroes show up, they fight, a new mech transforms, aliens retreat, and skirmish ends. The best element of the plot is an earthling working for the alien invaders and that\'s what kept me hooked to this show for so long just to see what happens to the weasley creep![ART 6] The art is extremely dated, doesn\'t particularly flow well, and often you\'ll see a lot of the same footage of tanks and airborne units explode constantly, even in the same episode. Transforming scenes run rampant and might drive you crazy after a short period of time, especially when Dancouga is finally formed. That scene alone lasts longer than the fights it\'s involved in.Character designs are by Masami Obari, and I have to give him credit. I really like the designs of the cast and the aliens. It\'s funny that there are music videos of the pilots singing, because in their casual wear, they may as well form a rock band. The aliens look good as long as you don\'t mind low-rent inbit knockoffs, but the three generals look pretty cool. Animation aside, the art is passable at times, but gets annoyingly repetitious.[SOUND 10] As with most mecha shows, especially the older ones, an awesome soundtrack is almost expected, and Dancougar\'s music is no exception. The theme\'s for both seasons are really catchy, a lot of the BGM and fanfare music is intoxicatingly fun to hum along to, and by the end of the show, you might be able to sing ""Harmony Love"". An A+ soundtrack that doesn\'t get old, except maybe the Harmony Love song. After the 500 encore, you might need a break.[CHARACTER 8] What robo series wouldn\'t be complete without a mismatch group of pilots to try and work together. You have Shinobu, a gung ho loudmouth, Sara, one of the prototype redheads that laid the groundwork for future hellcat females with fiery tempers, Masato, the young, carefree comic relief, and Ryo, the tall, scary guy that\'s fluent in rationality. They\'re fun as a unit, but after they\'re intial introduction and sporadic backstory in and out in later episodes, not too much is done with them, which may be a blessing in disguise, I suppose. Probably the highlight of the cast is Shapiro Keats, Sara\'s ex-boyfriend, resident traitor and all-around jerkbag. It\'s seldom when a man\'s grasp for power reaches this level of just complete insanity, I was almost rooting for him. Watching him worm his way to the top of the alien ranks is actually pretty damn admirable. He\'s one of the most overlooked villians in anime history as his body of work is pretty astounding, even in today\'s era where villians just stand in a close band and smirk all the time. Shapiro is keen, manipulative, devious, heartless, and sinister, and you want to punch his face in. If you fit in these prerequesites, you\'re a damn good villian Oh, and take a drink everytime Shinobu gets owned by somebody. It\'s a blast.[ENJOYMENT 8] While the stilted, looped animation gets aggravating, I found this show very easy and fun to watch, a must for fans of retro mecha anime. It\'s got really good characters, a solid, yet paint-by-numbers plot, a great villian in Shapiro Keats, and some mecha that would make awesome toys.[OVERALL 8] It\'s a hard show to find. It\'s only available in VHS in the States, and there\'s no DVD release to date. It\'s not as good as Macross or Mospeada, but it\'s a great slice of nostalgic robo-cake that should be worth checking out for fans of the genre.PROS: Great music, nice mecha designs, awesome villianCONS: Poor animation, sub-par story Voltron.

However, once I jumped into the show I had a slog to complete it. I found the series to drag mostly in the 17 episode build up to our titular mecha. Another detouring factor was the show often won\'t fully embrace its Super Robot elements. Also, the main characters are had to latch onto, with Ryo and the Black Knight being the standouts. At times the series is often similar to Chojin Sentai Jetman, as the CBF Pilots are often...found at odds with each other. Yet, the CBF rarely shows growth towards becoming a functioning team, to the extent it feels repetitive.Whereas, the villains have cool designs, but are lacking in character. Shapiro is the most prominent of the villains since he is traitor to the Earth. For the most part the show tries playing around with the idea that Shapiro simply went mad for power. Unfortunately, most of the early flashbacks of him with Sara depict him as a sociopath with a god complex. Then later flashbacks make him have more sympathy for Sara and society. Also, the finale works hard to make Shapiro out to be a tragic character who fell from grace.While I do aggressively dislike the show, it is mostly thanks to being highly disappointed. I do think people should see this series if they are interested in Dancouga though. However, be cautious that it may not live up to expectations. Heck, if people have tried to sit through the series and cannot then jump ahead to the OVAs. Starting with the first OVA is good because it is mostly a recap, but also features 30-minutes of new footage completing the main series. So, if people do decide to latch onto Dancouga via the OVAs or SRWs, please at least watch episode 23 ""Revenge for Murder!"" It is the most amazing SUPER ROBOT nonsense ever!

There are 2 brief nude scenes near the beginning, and it starts out slow. It gets better after about 10 minutes in, but the story ends abruptly. One important thing to note about this episode, and what lowers my score for it, is that it...has excessive eyecatches. There are a total of 10 eyecatches that appear throughout the episode to mark scene transitions, and they\'re jarring. This would be much easier to watch without them.

Coyote Ragtime Show,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1194/Coyote_Ragtime_Show,"[""Let's start off by saying that the first episode of this show was absolutely brilliant. It had everything: an engaging setting, intriguing plot, intelligent (if slightly gluttonous) protagonist, spunky sidekick, and killer robot maids. The animation was wonderfully done, and the story's pace was smooth and quick. By the time the first episode ended, I was SALIVATING for more.... and then, I watched the second episode. Everything fell apart after that.The worst mistake the show made, in my opinion, was switching protagonists from the space detective Angelica to the space pirate/bandit/whatever Mister. If they had stuck with the former, then the show would have stayed...in the wonderful sort of cat-and-mouse chase that the first episode pulled off so well. It would have been like a Lupin III, but in space. Instead, we get a show whose main cast (Mister and his band of merry cayote-outlaws) spending the entire series trying WAY too hard to be the Cowboy Bebop gang. After the brilliant first episode, the cast stops being smart, the plotlines veer off to somewhere between &quot;irritatingly cliche&quot; and &quot;boring as hell,&quot; and the villains just get plain irksome.If you have the money to spare, I suppose this set is worth it just to watch the great first episode, as well as seeing the Twelve Sisters in action. It's quite unfortunate, since it showed so much promise in the beginning.Fun Drinking Game: Down a shot whenever Mister or one of his gang puts on a stupid, goofy grin.

On top of that you have galactic federations in the middle of a planet-destroying war, a group of 12 psychotic and robotic killer maids hunting the Coyotes and as many plot twists as George Bushes presidency, all this packed in to 12 explosive episodes!Story- The main story kicks off in the very first couple of episodes without needing too much build up where we see ragged coyote &quot;Mister&quot; and his crew escape from a space prison and set off...for the treasure while picking up new eccentric acquaintances such as afro-gospel geezer- &quot;Swamp&quot;. In every single episode the story delivers a new piece of the puzzle to the treasure and shows off constantly in &quot;Oceans Eleven&quot; style heists and swindling. 8/10Art- The character designs for the characters and the spaceships were top-notch, especially when you are introduced to Marciano and her twelve sisters each on an original and unique design (except for the triplets of course). However i did feel that the animation in some of the conversational scenes were a bit lagging in quality. But the show draws you in right at the end half of the first episode just from the sheer amount of well choreographed action in it. 8/10Sound- The music in Coyote Ragtime was brilliant it so fits with the shows in-you're-face explosive style with it's jazzy tunes with a little rock in the background. The intro was also very enjoyable as it sums up the show basically and the music would vary well to the emotional scenes. There are some very strong explosion sound effects as well as completely obnoxious gun shot sounds which add to the style of the show. 9/10Character- The character set up is excellent with each and every main and even secondary character having an interesting past as well as future sights. Also i thought the whole concept of the 12 robotic assassin maids was pure gold as each one of them had individual personalities from April's crazy determination to July's Perpetual smile, also each of the 12 sisters are a specialist with a certain weapon ranging from knives, P90's, bombs, katana's and so on. As for mister and the crew of the Coyote i thought they were all so perfectly arrogant which is what makes them like able as criminals. 9/10Enjoyment- If you look at any episode of coyote you cannot help but be impressed by the sheer amount of stylishness to each action scene. it's not just the quantity of the action but its also how each explosive scene is always different and unexpected which leaves you thinking 'Holy hell, didn't see that coming'. It also plucks on you're emotions especially  with the relationship of Franca and Mister. Watch episode 1 and if you don't find it the least bit enjoyable then you're dead inside! 9/10Overall- To give this show an overall rating is quite difficult due to all the parts of the show that are awesome and parts which could have been improved but i've gone for an 8 because i wish there were more episodes, also i wish we could've seen more of the 12 sisters as individuals like you do with April and May, sometimes it feels like the others were just added on so that there are 12 of them, but that doesn't take away from this anime's overall awesomeness! 8/10 for the treasure while picking up new eccentric acquaintances such as afro-gospel geezer- &quot;Swamp&quot;. In every single episode the story delivers a new piece of the puzzle to the treasure and shows off constantly in &quot;Oceans Eleven&quot; style heists and swindling. 8/10Art- The character designs for the characters and the spaceships were top-notch, especially when you are introduced to Marciano and her twelve sisters each on an original and unique design (except for the triplets of course). However i did feel that the animation in some of the conversational scenes were a bit lagging in quality.

If it’s capable of destruction or distraction, it’s fair game, “ - Coyote Ragtime Show TrailerIf there’s one thing that’s undeniably true about Coyote Ragtime Show (CRS), it’s that this series is more than comfortable in its own skin. Never hesitant, never compromising, Coyote Ragtime Show is completely aware of its identity and wholeheartedly flaunts it in full display; an over-the-top shootout, whether aerial, spatial, or groundbound, is guaranteed with every episode. Often referred to as a cross between Cowboy Bebop and Ocean’s Eleven (I’d throw in the Fast and the Furious franchise for good measure), Coyote Ragtime Show...is an exhilarating and memorable adventure of a motley gang of space outlaws (aka “Coyotes”), with flashy explosions and dramatic heists being its bread and butter.“One planet’s gonna destroy another with a big bomb” is the easiest way to summarize this show’s synopsis. What we have in CRS is one big real-world parallel. Much like our political figureheads of today, the governments in this show have allowed their massive egos (and an obsession for leaping to conclusions) to give way to petty conflicts. Eventually, these petty conflicts escalated into all-out war. As a result, the Milky Way Federation (obviously a parallel to the US) plans to bomb Graceland (Cuba?) in an effort to end the war. These plans don’t bode well for our gang of Coyotes (their biggest heist yet happens to be on Graceland). This strange twist of fate naturally presents the gang with an opportunity to reflect on the nature of war, which CRS takes advantage of in one hopelessly misguided scene. When one Coyote, visibly frustrated, labels the political figureheads as “complete idiots”, another Coyote remarks, “So they start wars to figure out who’s stupidest”.(Coyote Ragtime Show, please stay in your lane).Social commentary is clearly not a calling card of Coyote Ragtime Show and, unfortunately, neither is character depth. However, what this series lacks in a multilayered cast, it compensates with chemistry and character dynamics. Angelica Burns and Chelsea Moore are a federal agent duo in pursuit of the Coyotes, specifically their leader. Angelica is stern and direct while Chelsea is childlike and carefree; the show performs admirably in allowing their personalities to complement each other. Katana and Bishop are fellow Coyotes and the closest of friends; they’re likable guys (with not one iota of depth) that tend to venture into witty banter. Swamp is a preacher/ex-Coyote that joins the gang for one last heist (He’s heavily inspired by Eddie from the Barbershop films). Swamp shares a contentious existence with Bishop (the two detest each other), which of course leads to an obligatory bonding episode later on. None of these characters have a particularly noteworthy dub performance to their name, excluding Franca (Brittany Karbowski gives a rather intense performance as the angsty pink-haired loli/Living MacGuffin)... and Mister.“Con man. Strong-armed robbery. Self-employed pirate. An outlaw who masquerades as an angel. And definitely a romantic hedonist,” - Angelica, referring to Mister (and the Coyotes by proxy)As Mister, John Swasey delivers the greatest performance of his career by far; his unmistakable, gravelly voice sells every line with confidence galore and an aura of hardened knowledge, With the look of a wizened fighter pilot, Mister is cut from the cloth of the modern action hero, guys with as much brawns as brains. What stands out the most about Mister is his passionate discourses on the concept of family. Mister’s speeches are the best bits of dialogue this show has to offer, especially the one in the last episode: “We are not animals. We drink together. We share our dreams. We trust our family. And risk our lives for our friends! And that - that’s who coyotes are.”Dom Toretto would be proud.In terms of visual appeal, there isn’t much to mention. Coyote Ragtime Show dabbles in fluid character animation from time to time, specifically in episode 2’s big bar fight. The CGI is a bit dated but not entirely terrible (it looks especially appealing on the Coyotes’ starship). Sadly, the most consistent visual technique in CRS is the outpour of T&A shots. Fortunately, Coyote Ragtime Show appreciates a nice soundtrack more than cinematography. Produced by Koichiro Kameyama (of Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo fame). The OST holds a huge affinity for electro pop alongside a passing affair for jazz, and a puppy love for electric guitars (This show’s music takes “eccentric” to a new level with a silly, brief gospel number in episode 3). The best song of the bunch has to be “The Showtime”, which is basically CRS’ signature “Big Damn Heroes” theme song; it’s an incredibly energetic jazz piece with orchestral strings and crazy drum interjections (I always fantasize of “The Showtime” playing during the final lap of a track race). It’s the ending theme (Sana’s “Usuragu Kioku”) that really steals the show; it’s produced entirely in claymation. The ED performs wonderfully at pulling heartstrings, especially when its inserted in the final battle against Marciano.What’s depressing about her character arc is the wasted potential. Marciano’s a murderous socialite with an ego the size of the sea. She rambles on and on about the pursuit of power. She lords over the Twelve Sister, a particularly ruthless gang of robotic schoolgirl mercenaries. Yet, the show struggles with creating a reason for Marciano to hinder Mister’s heist on Graceland. Sure, there was a scene focused on how perpetually unsatisfied she is with her success but it always felt as if CRS was grasping for straws when it involved Marciano. That is, until the grand finale that truly completed her arc.SPOILER ALERTAfter Mister obliterates Marciano in the final battle, he decides to unleash the biggest truth bomb of the entire show: “Marciano was - she was a Coyote a long time ago but even then I never shared a drink with her”.It was this line that sparked the theory I am about to share. This might sound farfetched but I feel that Mister is a close-minded chauvinist. Not only does he refer to women throughout CRS as “dolls”, “little girl(s)”, and “sexy” (he uses it as a noun, not an adjective) but Mister never truly recognized Marciano as an equal (the only woman he respects is Angelica). Remember the Coyote hideout/bar in episode 2? With the exception of Franca, the only female in that scene was a woman in a bunny suit. If that isn’t a red flag, I don’t know what is.SPOILER ALERT OVERProduced by ufotable (Fate/Zero, God Eater), Coyote Ragtime Show was a completely different series from what the studio was accustomed to. There are plenty of titles in ufotable’s catalog that are far superior to this show but they don’t possess the pop culture knowledge, the sense of humor, the simplistic charm, the sound, nor the unabashed confidence of CRS (after rewatching this show recently, I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time, if not more so). If nothing else, Coyote Ragtime Show proved that it doesn’t require a Super Saiyan nor a Servant to save the world.

Under-rated, and in my opinion, a masterpiece.I first saw this on one of the only anime stations we have over here. I guess at first the idea of it may not be appealing, I almost changed channel. But, seeing as nothing else was on, I continued to watch it. This defines an anime that is a diamond in the rough.I won't repeat the summary, I'm sure you can all read. I remember haggling with my parents on ways for them to let me watch this, it was funny, and 8/10 times I failed miserably. Cruel folks. Well, they're...nice really. So I decided to buy the DVD, I got the first 4 episodes. Why is it I wa compelled to do this? Character, Art and the story.Character- I guess taking a step back, 12 gothic lolita, two police officers, 3 misunderstood criminals and an innocent girl, they don't really sound at all appealing. But instantly I fell in love. 12 sisters, all (Apart from the triplets) with their own unique personalities, yet all innocent looking, but relentlessly sinister. (You might find in some of my reviews, I seem to love everything innocent but actually sinister) They, to me, are the highlight of the series. I'm not sure why, but they interest me most out of them all.There is so much personality in this anime, each with their own time in the light. Oh there's a preist too, but no spoiling I'm afraid, however minor.Art- Well to me this anime looked High budget. Not so much that it's ghost in the shell style, but still, far better than bleach, it's at Elfen Lied level. (No I don't hate bleach. I meant in general, the artists starting slacking, I love bleach) So, for this anime to be so well animated, yet to have only seen the light of day for a short period. . .Story- As previously mentioned, I bought the 1st DVD. It ended on episode 4. For months, I watched it over and over, rocking myself to silence afterwards, upset about not knowing what happened. It ended in  such a way, it made me sad unable to know what happened next.  I had never been so annoyed by the fact I didn't know what happened next, I had my Grandmother get me the other two DVD's for my Christmas. xDYes that's sad I know.So overall  . . .WATCH THIS! Even if you don't like it, you will have at least made your mind up on whether or not you like it. For, it is better to have loved and lost to have never loved at all. It's better to have watched and loved (or maybe dislike, though I love this anime) than to have never watched at all.;) nice really. So I decided to buy the DVD, I got the first 4 episodes.

All of the promotional material showed something that hearkened back to classic sci-fi action adventure series such as Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, and Outlaw Star, and a lot of people who had seen it seemed to be making the same comparisons. With all that going for it, this series definitely drew in my interest.Our story starts in the future, there are space outlaws called Coyotes who commit crimes but share a strong bond of friendship that a true Coyote wouldn’t betray. One of the most infamous Coyotes is Mister, who goes...by many different aliases. Detective Angelica Burns has spent the last four years trying to track him down. She finally received an anonymous tip that Mister was at a prison and the desert planet of Sandvil. A loyal but clumsy assistant named Chelsea meets her on the planet to help her.Right as Angelica and Chelsea arrives at the prison Mister is located at, Mister breaks out only 10 days from released with the help of his old partners Bishop and Katana. As he is escaping, an elite squad of android assassins show up sent by Madame Marciano to take out Mister. As Mister escapes, he seeks out Franca, the daughter of his best friend Pirate King “Blue” Bruce, as they seek out the treasure Blue left for Franca to inherit on a planet called Graceland, which is in a civil war and faces immanent destruction from the Milky Way Federation in a week.Soon, the group of Coyote’s are chased by the Twelve Sisters who want to take out Mister and capture Franca along with Detective Angelica and her assistant, as she wants to take Mister into custody, as the time is running out to get the treasure.With those comparisons and a plot like that, this series is setting some fairly high standards for itself, but is it anywhere as good as those series? Unfortunately, the series never reaches the heights of the influences that it’s taking from. But that’s not to say this series is bad by any stretch, and there is a lot to enjoy here.The series comes with a large colorful cast of characters with varied and interesting designs, and while not all of them get a fleshed out backstory, they all get enough of a time in the spotlight, all being memorable in their own ways and it’s really easy to tell them all apart. And sure, there is a lull somewhere in the middle, but I imagine the series as a whole would be worse off if it tried to keep the action amped up to 11 the whole time.Aesthetically, the series goes for a very rustic lived in world for it’s sci-fi settin, which helps this series to stand out from other stuff coming out around the same time. And I kinda wish more series used a rustic sci-fi setting, just in general. It feels like a highly underused setting.While there isn’t too much to say about this series, it does stand on it’s own and a good time. Coyote Ragtime Show might not come close to being a classic like the shows that it’s been compared to, but much like those series, it’s not going for high class or arthouse, simply trying to be a fun space adventure, and with those intentions, it does succeed, and is worth watching for those looking to find something like the classics, even if itself is not a classic. Also, it’s OP is pretty catchy. by many different aliases. Detective Angelica Burns has spent the last four years trying to track him down.

He also runs a bar where his best friend’s daughter resides, she plays a key...part in the series but I won’t say much on that. He and his crew embark on a journey to find the giga-banks and claim his best friend’s legacy. Unfortunately the planet the giga-banks resides on is about to be destroyed so time is of the essence in claiming it before the destruction of said planet. I forgot to mention the giga-banks is a vault, so no surprise it’s loaded with space bucks.It tries to be like other popular space outlaw adventure series but kind of falls flat (e.g. Outlaw Star or Cowboy Bebop) in my opinion.There is quite a lot of characters, I’m not going to go into massive detail about them. There’s Angelica, an inspector assigned to capture Mister. Her assistant who kind of just tags along. There is also an assassin group known as the twelve sisters (all named after months of the year) and their leader. Finally there’s the ragtag crew that accompanies Mister.Animation is good for the time (2006) and is done by Ufotable, they’re fairly good. Action scenes are pretty good but unfortunately the animation is the only strong part of this show. OST is unnoticeable and the opening fits but is not great, ending is done in a Claymation style and is great, I love it.Finally…my opinion…It’s okay, not great, it’s not anything special. That’s pretty much all I have to say really, if you like Sci-Fi space action shows about outlaws then you might like this. But I was just meh all the way though. Went in with no expectations and came out with no expectations.6/10 part in the series but I won’t say much on that.

I won't go into the plot, because it is already explained in the synopsis. I will say the story was a little confusing jumping from episode one to two, but you catch up very quickly. After that, it is an anime that is very well written and really enjoyable. This is an anime that can easily be watched in one sitting due to its very well done story and suspense. However, the pacing was a little too drastic at times. Where it would be so high octane one second, then the next it is very...mellow, which can take you out of the experience and really bored at times.I watched this in dub, and was very excited to hear some very familiar voices such as Chris Patton, Luci Christian, and Brittney Karbowski. The dub was done very well and all of the voices did not seem out of place.The art is very early 2000's which is what you should expect from an anime that came out in....well 2006. Even for 2006, the visuals looked fantastic and really colorful at times. Other times... It was a lot of dust brown and black. But that is also because the last quarter takes place in a desert section of a planet.I highly suggest everyone to at least give this a watch. I suggest you buy it even more because the rewatch value is pretty high as well. There is something I feel like everyone would enjoy so don't hesitate to try this one out9/10 mellow, which can take you out of the experience and really bored at times.I watched this in dub, and was very excited to hear some very familiar voices such as Chris Patton, Luci Christian, and Brittney Karbowski.

It's just boring and plain bad.CRS follows the exploits of a criminal mastermind named Mister + crew and a girl named Franca whom holds the treasure to her dead pirate father while being pursued by a detective and police officer.Other characters include:Angelica: an attractive investigator who is pursuing mister and seems to have had a past affair with Mister more then likely or is in love with him, shes always eating.Chelsea: a police detective who is the dumb blonde stereotypeMadame marciano: the leader of...the criminal guild who controls 12 robot assassins named after 12 months.And others that aren't really notable.The audio is good and the voice acting for the dub is average. There seems to be some issues with the lip syncing at times on the dub.The animation seems to be slightly choppy at times but its VERY detailed and it's gorgeous to behold.

I just didn't care at all anymore about Mister or the characters. The first episode was actually entertaining but the rest?

Dragon Crisis!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9330/Dragon_Crisis,"['Here be dragons!One thing can always be certain when it comes to anime these days, and that\'s the inclusion of at least show about anthropomorphised creatures of some sort every season. Many people will already be familiar with humanoid cats, foxes, dogs, etc, and with the ""popularity"" of the types of anime that normally include such characters, it\'s somewhat surprising to find dragons thrown into the mix.Now this isn\'t a new thing, especially as these giant fire breathing lizards have appeared in works of fiction for many, many years (and it\'s even longer when we start talking mythology - but we won\'t go there). From...tales of steel clad warriors going toe to toe with something that sees them as canned food, to the stylings of Anne McCaffrey\'s Dragons of Pern series where humans live and work with the creatures, dragons have long been a source of inspiration, fear, admiration, majesty, and many other things besides.But aside from their appearances in certain anime, nobody has ever called them cute (or tsundere - more on that later).Dragon Crisis is, first and foremost, a light novel series by Kizaki Kaya that spans eleven volumes, all of which have been published under Shueisha\'s Super Dash Bunko line, and as with any reasonably popular written work, it was earmarked for an anime adaptation, this time by Studio DEEN.Oh goody. More adaptations.The story is about Kisaragi Ryuuji, a seemingly normal high school boy whose life is suddenly thrown sideways by the return of his treasure seeking cousin Nanao Eriko. She persuades him to join her on her latest venture, but things don\'t turn out the way she plans when instead of treasure, they find a girl in a suitcase.Throw into this various other anthropomorphic beings (generally female), magical treasures called Lost Precious, and a very familiar comedy angle and what do you have?That\'s right. It\'s another supernatural harem romantic comedy.The main issue with the Dragon Crisis is the lack of explanations. There are any number of interesting aspects to the story that really could have been expounded upon, but in the typical manner that is common these days the viewer is expected to simply sit there, accept what they\'re given, and not want for anything better. The lack of any real detail about The Society, dragons and the Lost Precious puts a strain on the storyline that becomes more pronounced as matters progress.That said, the plot is actually paced reasonably well, but that\'s simply based on the even scattering of tokens throughout the series (usually one per episode), and it\'s pretty clear that a great deal of thought wasn\'t expended on making the story interesting. Instead Dragon Crisis relies on stereotypical comedy and the generic methodologies applied to almost every other harem rom-com in an effort to move things along, and because of all of this the whole show is about as predictable as the sunrise.Visually the series isn\'t bad, but it\'s not brilliant either. The reliance on generic character types is very obvious from the get-go as it\'s not something that can really be hidden by changing clothes (or school uniforms), hairstyles and eye colours.  That said, the characters are emotive to a degree, and it\'s nice to see that efforts have been made to allow a bit more expression that one might initially expect from this type of show.Sadly the typical anime reliance on the European style dragon once again rears its head, and this time they\'re coloured (which brings into question the issue of dragon racism, but that\'s a matter for another time).On the plus side the series features some nicely detailed backgrounds that, although somewhat generic, are also rather appealing. In addition to this there are some well choreographed and interesting CG effects that give the action sequences that little bit more flair, and the quality of the animation is stays at a pretty decent level over the course of the show.When it comes to music, Dragon Crisis has a range of tracks on offer to suit almost every occasion, from foreboding techno beats to melodic piano pieces, and there are also some rather nice audio effects throughout the series. Unfortunately there are occasions when the two clash, and although the timing is pretty good, this isn\'t enough to salvage the resulting cacophony.The opening theme, Immoralist by Horie Yui (who plays the role of Maruga or Margerite, whichever you prefer), is a rather dramatic J-Pop number with martial overtones that feels a little out of place with the concept of Dragon Crisis. As for the ending theme, Mirai Bowl by Momoiro Clover, this rather more playful piece also doesn\'t seem to fit with the rest of the anime, but that may be due to the rather whimsical beginning to the song.So, on to the acting, and oh look! It\'s Kugumiya Rie playing yet another clone of Louise/Shana/Taiga, except this time her role is far less tsundere so hopefully the industry will stop typecasting her at some point. Even with that though, she is able to inject a likeability into the character of Rose that is nice to see. Shimono Hiro and Yukana also play their respective roles (Ryuuji and Eriko), passing well, and while the overall series may be tediously generic in many aspects, it\'s nice to see the seiyuu still working hard to deliver some decent performances.The unfortunate part is that there\'s only so much a voice actor/actress can do in certain situations, and this is one of them.The reliance on genericism severely stunts the characters in certain fundamental ways that prevent even the best seiyuu from delivering a stellar performance, and while part of the problem stems from the anime, the majority of it comes from the source material itself. The simple fact is that each character is designed to deliver a specific plot token into the story, and this makes them objects rather than people. Because of this there is the appearance of development over the course of the series, but in truth this is nothing more than a veneer that covers some truly lazy characterisation. That said, Dragon Crisis does feature some diverting interactions and relationships, and while there is little in the way of real growth, the series does maintain a degree of enjoyability due the inoffensive nature of the characters.One thing that is a little puzzling though, is the decidedly human nature of the dragons themselves. While this could easily be explained away by stating that they\'re anthropomorphic creatures who have lived alongside humans and adopted their personality traits, this information has to be extrapolated by the viewer, and this brings up the issue of why they have to act like humans. It would have been far more interesting to see humans and dragons learning to cope with the problems presented by modern day society from the perspective of the dragons. Likewise the prospect of watching the characters adapt to the daily problems faced by each species would have offered some completely different insights, yet still left room for situational comedy.Dragon Crisis offers little in the way of innovation, but that\'s pretty much expected from supernatural harem rom-coms these days. While the original concept may have been interesting enough in the beginning the execution leaves a lot to be desired, and there\'s a mechanical feel to the show due to the ""fill in the blanks"" approach to the story, and the fact that this is essentially a ""production by numbers"" (hence Kugimiya Rie in a typecast role).The series does have its good points, and there are some enjoyable moments to see, but ultimately Dragon Crisis is yet another example of a wasted opportunity, only this time its not the fault of the anime as the source material is to blame. tales of steel clad warriors going toe to toe with something that sees them as canned food, to the stylings of Anne McCaffrey\'s Dragons of Pern series where humans live and work with the creatures, dragons have long been a source of inspiration, fear, admiration, majesty, and many other things besides.But aside from their appearances in certain anime, nobody has ever called them cute (or tsundere - more on that later).Dragon Crisis is, first and foremost, a light novel series by Kizaki Kaya that spans eleven volumes, all of which have been published under Shueisha\'s Super Dash Bunko line, and as with any reasonably popular written work, it was earmarked for an anime adaptation, this time by Studio DEEN.Oh goody.

I continue to be perplexed why tripe like this continues to sell and gets made into anime.  And I thought Hollywood had hit the bottom of the barrel when it comes to creativity and originality.The story concept for Dragon Crisis! has been repeated ad nauseum.  An ordinary school boy with average looks and the personality of an anvil is suddenly thrust into a secret world of the supernatural including, as the title suggests, dragons.  Of course...most of the dragons just happen to be cute girls who naturally flock to the harem of our slack lipped leading man.  The plot is virtually nonexistent since the writer seems to have decided to forgo anything resembling a story in order to load up the cast with every type of stereotypical character imaginable.  Instead we are inundated with obscure and nonsensical terminology such as ""Lost Precious"", ""Level 10 Breaker"", and ""Engage"".What little story it does have mostly falls flat on its face.  Red Dragon and loli Rose really loves Ryuuji and shows her affections in a very open and honest way, like a child.  It actually manages to be both kind of sweet and creepy all at once.  Ryuuji, like any red blooded Japanese boy maintains his puritanical values and attempts, unsuccessfully, to fend off all those cooties carrying girls who throw themselves at him.  However because just about every episode introduces a new character, the cast becomes bogged down with characters making the execution of any kind of serious story impossible.  What we do end up with has all the sophistication of an elementary school creative writing project.Much like the shows concept, none of the characters are all that special either.  They conform to basic harem archetypes and rarely, if ever, deviate from them.  A few of them might just be remarkable for how dull pointless they actually are.  Probably the best example of this would be Misaki, Ryuuji\'s shy secret admirer.  She is utterly a waste of the art materials, man hours, and computer time necessary to bring her to the screen.  She contributes nothing of value.  She has no powers and is just an ordinary human and she basically seems to only be in the cast because the ""How To Make a Harem Anime"" playbook calls for her type to be included.  The only positives amongst the characters, I suppose, would be Ai and Eriko.  Though it certainly isn\'t because of any originality on their parts.  It\'s only because they happen to come across as the most fun and enjoyable characters in the show.What Dragon Crisis! does do exceptionally well is its music.  Yui Horie\'s ""Immoralist"" OP is really a great upbeat and exciting table setter for the show.  The real shame that the feelings and action displayed in the OP do not really materialize within the show itself.  Overall though I think this is easily the best song from any of the anime from the Winter \'11 season.  On the flip side, the ED ""Mirai Bowl"" is a playful and naughty and at first glance seems out of place for this anime.  It features extreme chibi abuse, which raises it up in my favorability rating but it’s just so damn cute and adorable that I really looked forward to seeing it each week.  Of course this also meant the episode was over, which might have contributed to me liking it so much.The seiyuu cast is also very strong and chalk full of talented actors.  They are mostly wasted on this and none of their performances are really memorable enough to worth mentioning.  However it should be noted that this is yet again another loli role for veteran Rie Kugimiya.  I honestly love Kugimiya to death as an actress but it is really quite distressing to see her continue to be pigeonholed as the same damn character repeatedly either through her own poor judgment or from studio typecasting.  Though her role as Rose is not your typical loli tsundere per see, it certainly would be nice to see her try to expand her range a bit.  Honestly the been there, done that nature of her performance is one of the reasons this anime comes across as so lame and uninspired.When you get right down to it my entire experience with Dragon Crisis! was neither good nor bad.  A viewer is as unlikely to really hate it as he is unlikely to love it.  One can certainly do better, so unless you simply must see every anime about dragons you would be advised to give this one a pass and watch something better. most of the dragons just happen to be cute girls who naturally flock to the harem of our slack lipped leading man.

Honestly the been there, done that nature of her performance is one of the reasons this anime comes across as so lame and uninspired.When you get right down to it my entire experience with Dragon Crisis! was neither good nor bad.  A viewer is as unlikely to really hate it as he is unlikely to love it.  One can certainly do better, so unless you simply must see every anime about dragons you would be advised to give this one a pass and watch something better.', 'Dragon Crisis Review Version 2 (UPDATE)Here comes another harem anime! Now including dragons!Ok so the main theme here is about Forbiden love between Humans and Dragons.. Right... Incest and Bestiality.... The two most common theme in anime... Oh how I love you Japan...  (Oh and I;m not mentioning BL as forbidden love because otherwise a bunch of fangirls will come after me)So yeah, the story is about Dragons, lost precious (which are treasures) and of course harem. Boy meets dragon girl, dragon girl gets kidnapped by another dragon, guy comes rescuing girl, bad guy mysteriously disappear. All of that in the first three episodes!...Not to mention, an above average combat sequence so yeah Im not complaining.Now, the plus point in my book about this anime is that they both expressed their love for each other early in the series so yeah we wont have to deal with one of those dense male harem leads and you can expect more progress in their relationship. Oh wait? You didnt want any spoilers? You didnt wanted to know that Ryuuji loves Rose and the feelings mutual eventhough it\'s pretty obvious that will happen eventually? Well my sincerest apologies.I mean c\'mon, they get stronger by holding hands and say ""Engage"" This reminds me of Kanokon where the male and female lead fuse with each other to create one imbalanced super powered hero.Art and Sound are slightly above average. I do not get tears in my eyes nor do I get eargasm when I watch the anime.It\'s as enjoyable to watch a harem anime as watching your mac and cheese in the microwave (Now dont get me wrong, THATS IS AWESEOME! Or it just doesn\'t take much to impress me) How can you not like repetitiveness?I also love watching different variety dragons (Kinda reminds me of that movie, How to train your dragon, only the characters are more hygienic) and the dragons are in humanoid form and can talk too. Rose picked up how to talk like us by just watching a bunch of shows from the tele. Isn\'t that how we all learn to speak when we were kids?If any of you like ""The Legend about Legend of Legends of Legendary Heroes.. Legend..."" (Im not sure If I got the title right?) then you would probably like this one because it has the same treasure hunting theme only it\'s called ""Lost Precious""And by ""Lost Precious"" if you\'re thinking about that old stuffed bunny you had when you\'re a kid, it\'s pretty obvious your mum threw it out when your were 3 because it started to stink up the house. Wait? You didn\'t want spoilers on that too?? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!So overall..You want Harem?? Yes we CAN!!You want super powers?? Yes we CAN!!You want hot relatives?? Yes we CAN!!You want forbidden love?? Yes we CAN!!You want metrosexual villains?? Yes we CAN!!You want your old stuff bunny?? Dude.. Get over it.. I told you.. It\'s gone for good. So why don\'t you just get one of those Japanese body-pillow girlfriends. Not to mention, an above average combat sequence so yeah Im not complaining.Now, the plus point in my book about this anime is that they both expressed their love for each other early in the series so yeah we wont have to deal with one of those dense male harem leads and you can expect more progress in their relationship.

So that\'s why im going to review it, hopefully I\'ll save someone before it\'s too late. I\'ll try to be brief too.""Dragon Crisis!""Judjing from the title, you would think ""This is going to be an exciting show, full of epic battles, firebreath, swords and flying beasts"".... Think again.If i could summarize this show in one word, it\'s would probably be ""Dissapointing"", and I\'m going to tell you why, but let\'s start with the few good things this show has.The GoodArt/AnimationThe char designs are very well done, the backgrounds...are detailed, everything looks great, the eyes are beautiful, the effects look awesome and the movement is very fluid and natural. That\'s it, sadly.The WorstThe PlotIt starts quite good: Young boy (Ryouji) with unparalelled potential to use ancient relics, teams up with his sexy treasure hunting cousin, and loli millenary Dragon Queen in a journey full of mystic artifacts and epic fights (most likely involving dragons). Yeah, that would have been great,too bad that doesn\'t last more than one or two episodes.Soon, what started as an ""Action anime with romantic comic relief"" turns into ""Generic Harem (poorly done), with some short fights once in a while"".After all the ""Heroines"" (girls who have a romantic interest in the male lead) are intrudced, the original plot is put on hold, and replaced by filler episodes ment to create oportunities for the Heroines to show and/or develop feelings for Ryouji.I mean, seriously, over 5 fillers in a 12 episode show?. No thanks.The CharactersI\'m not going to go into details, but at least let me tell you this: They are as generic as they can get. Dull and predictable are their most outstanding features. You could guess everything about them, just by looking at the official poster. It\'s a shame that you will never be shocked by the character\'s actions or speech.So, In My Humble Oppinion:*If you are looking for an action/adventure show, Dragon Crisis doesn\'t have enough fights.* If you are looking for a comedy harem show, Dragon Crisis isn\'t funny enough.* If you are looking for a drama harem show, Dragon Crisis isn\'t serious or intresting enough.* If you are looking for a show with undefined plot and ""mass produced"" characters, Dragon Crisis might just be what you are looking for.I wish that you found the information you were looking for in this review. are detailed, everything looks great, the eyes are beautiful, the effects look awesome and the movement is very fluid and natural.

The title is a little strange considering the fact that the phrase itself is only used once in the series, and it\'s never really explained when mentioned.  For me to find an anime about anthropomorphic human-like people usually means that I\'ll watch it, to some extent.  Whatever the case, onto the review.Story (6.47/10): Story...isn\'t exactly Dragon Crisis\'s strong suit.  The beginning is very Angel Beats-esque, where the audience, and the main character are thrown into these set of circumstances without any explanation whatsoever for the sake of moving the plot.  Usually, unless there\'s the mystery element to...the story that the main character tries to find out, I will drop it without hesitation.  (Good exposition is something I like)  Though it was a bit strange to be thrown into this random scenario, I was still rather intrigued, and still continued watching.As the series went on, however, I felt that it was really arc heavy.  The 12 episode run is very clearly split into separate arcs, that detail the main character, Ryuuji, helping out random girls that he literally just met, only to have them be sucked into his mini harem by the end of the series.  It was kind of awkward for me to watch, and it felt quite side-story like, seeing as how the series immediately jumped to a new idea, and even new characters, making the old ones drop off the face of the earth.  (For a few episodes that is.)The story in the end was still somewhat generic, with the anthropomorphic twist on some of the girls, leading up to a really, really, really cheesy ending that you may like, if you\'re into that kind of thing.  Overall, the story of Dragon Crisis was watchable, at the very least.  It\'s not extraordinary by any means, but it is a good in its own way, like Dog days.Character (5.87/10): Character development is a key factor for an anime\'s success.  Without proper development of the characters, with good pacing, the anime can fall flat on its face without a second\'s notice.  The characters weren\'t bad, but they weren\'t fantastic.Ryuuji, our main protagonist, is our run of the mill, nice guy, overpowered main protagonist character, who meets a young girl via coming out of a suitcase, (yes, you read that right), and promptly takes care of her by basically raising her as his daughter, sort of.  While he does have some redeeming qualities, such as getting the most possible development in this show, as well as being the main protagonist, I find him rather dull and lacking.  He doesn\'t really seem to have a personality of his own, rather, gets influenced by people around him to get sucked into the situations he ends up in, like contemplating shit at the end of the series for what he\'s done.  We\'ve all seen this kind of anime troupe before, so there\'s not really much to explain beyond that.Rose, as the aforementioned Dragon, of this series, is...a child.  That\'s really all I need to say.  She loves Ryuuji, (way too obviously expressed), and that\'s pretty much it for about 9 or so episodes.  Towards the end, however, she gets this sort of, what I feel, unneeded development through some magical bullshit, that makes the show kind of stupid towards the end.  Though I personally liked Rose\'s character due to how adorable and awesome she could be at times, I wasn\'t fully happy with how she herself turned out over the course of the series.The side character cast is filled to the brim with overused troupes that I could go on and on about.  (like right now).  Let\'s see...comic relief/best friend character, big breasted fanservice, the shy girl, the shy girl\'s best friend that tries to hook up said shy girl with main character, the crazy scientist, the tsundere girl who\'s also a fox (My personal favorite), overly flamboyant looking main antagonist, and the parents that seems to never exist.  None of these characters get any development whatsoever, and some of them appear so late, that I even question why they were implemented in the first place.  (There\'s even one guy that\'s like a marvel villain rip-off.  WTF Japan?)Art and Sound (7.48/10): The art itself is pretty pleasing to look at, actually.  It\'s quite clear what style they were going for, and it\'s easy to distinguish who is what race in this series.  I quite enjoyed it, since none of the characters looked particularly bad, and none of the animation was jarring to look at.  Actually, the fight scenes looked pretty good and fluid. (Especially when mystical, dragon energy is involved.)The sound is actually pretty good.  The OP was a rather interesting sounding one, starting off as a generic shounen song, with these really quiet and soft parts that actually made it somewhat worth listening to.  It wasn\'t the greatest song the world, but it was quite enjoyable to watch and listen to.  The ED was the OP\'s contrast, featuring a rather bubbly song that I felt didn\'t fit in all too well with the show\'s idea.  It was good, but it felt a little weird.  The mood fillers of the series were actually somewhat good, as they sounded like some effort was put into it.Personal Enjoyment (6.46/10):  With the combination of a somewhat generic, arcic story, generic characters, and above average music and art, all combined with Rie\'s role as Rose, (I\'m sure the majority of people are familiar with her work), Dragon Crisis was a mix of fun and confusion.  They didn\'t really explain the supernatural part of the show too well, as the idea of the ""Lost Precious\'s"" weren\'t explained too in-depth as I would\'ve wanted it to be in.  There was also a backstory that was mentioned MANY times throughout the series, that never seemed to get any explanation, which really was a big put-off, since the series already didn\'t explain much of anything.  Massive story holes aside, Dragon Crisis was an interesting enough show for me to keep watching, and I was entertained while watching this, so it does get a plus for that.  By no means is this a show everyone must watch, god no, but it does help kill time when you want it to.  Besides, a fire dragon with blonde hair, in the body of what looks to be a 10 year old, kicking ass?  What\'s not to love?Overall Score: 6.75/10 the story that the main character tries to find out, I will drop it without hesitation.

What\'s not to love?Overall Score: 6.75/10', 'Throughout mythology, dragons are depicted as fantastic creatures whose significance dwarfs that of the mortal human. These dragons represent strength, power, and any other virtues a biker gang with dragon tattoos would respect. Dragon Crisis introduces a new type of dragon: dragons that are cute and loli and scream, ""suki"" and ""Ryuuji"" over and over again; the moe dragon.That\'s right: the MOE dragon.Can dragons be moe? Yes they can, but only while in their human form  (or unless there are fringe fetishes that I dare not dabble in.)Meet Dragon Crisis, an anime which casts Kugimiya Rie as Rose, a character who is *gasp*...NOT a tsundere. But fans who found Louise particularly annoying should NOT relax just yet, since Kugimiya Rie uses her most loli voice yet, twice as loli as Louise. On top of that, Rose spends a good portion of episode 1 not being able to say anything other than the word ""Ryuuji,"" which becomes tiresome to hear very quickly, even for fans. Beware of the word ""suki"" as well. Make no mistake; I love Kugi, but I also know that she\'s not liked universally.Once Kugimiya Rie\'s voice has been addressed, Dragon Crisis turns into a rather enjoyable anime to watch.In a modern world filled rare monsters that can take human form, there are magically imbued items known as ""Lost Precious"" which demonstrate mysterious powers, and are treated like dinosaur bones by collectors. Those who can wield such ""Lost Precious"" are known as ""Breakers."" The ""Breakers"" have formed a sort of guild known as the ""Association"", and it also acts to regulate the collection and distribution of ""Lost Precious""Enter our protagonist Ryuuji, a lonely high school boy who was living alone until his cousin Eriko steps in. Ryuuji is kidnapped and coerced into assisting his cousin in stealing a large briefcase from a black organization known as ""Fang"". With the help of Eriko\'s Lost precious, they manage to successfully steal the briefcase, and from here it\'s obvious what comes out.The story so far has been episodic with no overarching plot. Each character is given two or three episodes in which to develop, and then the story moves on to the next character. The arcs begin with comedic/set-up episode, and end with a rising action/conclusion episode. The story mainly focuses on character, and so the comedy and the ecchi scenes have been rather light. Action and dramatic scenes seem a bit forced at times, and the battles are smooth yet could use a bit more blood.Dragon Crisis suffers from the same character development issues as Kami nomi, mainly the girl-of-the-week plot format. The characters are well fleshed out within their own individual arcs, but once their story is resolved, they disappear, never to be seen again.  Rose, although present in all the episodes, gets pushed to the sidelines once her arc finishes, and simply remains as Ryuuji\'s lover. The most well developed character in this Ryuuji himself, as he slowly pulls himself out of his isolated shell and begins to accept both Lost Precious and his ability as a Breaker to use them.Ryuuji unfortunately also suffers from the same dysfunction that many male leads in anime suffer from these days; being a weak character. Not weak as in poorly developed, but actually physically weak and reliant on many of the bodacious females around him. Ryuuji is supposed to be a ""Level 10 Breaker"" and that there are only seven of such high level breakers in the world. With that kind of exclusivity, one would expect Ryuuji to be able to mow down his opponents like the Level 5s in Academy City can; he does not. His seemingly overwhelming strength is either overrated or still in latent form, and he has been reliant on Rose\'s powers to get him through most of his problems.The animation quality is up to par with current anime standards, special care and detail was put into backgrounds, trees, and special effects from Lost Precious. The battles sometimes tries to make use of dynamic camera movement, but perhaps due to budget restrictions, those scenes end up looking rough and choppy. The color palette is a little on the pale side but other than that the animation is quite solid. The character design seem a little off at first, particularly the eyes, which seem slightly too big. Other than that, the character are varied and diverse, one of them is even heterochromatic.The opening theme is rather unique sounding and memorable for this type of anime. I particularly liked the BGM I refer to as ""Eriko\'s theme,"" which was played when Eriko was first introduced. The sound is jazzy, classy, with a hint of sass perfect for Eriko\'s character, a well chosen track indeed. The ending theme was a circus-y song featuring chibi Eriko dancing (which is good) while shots of our heroines in swimsuits flash in the background (which is great), until the pace changed and suddenly all our heroines were dancing chibi style (which is also good).First and foremost, the ability to enjoy this anime is highly dependent on the viewer\'s ability to withstand Kugimiya Rie\'s overly loli voice. Once that has been cleared, one must accept that this anime is character driven. There are no Eragon-style dragon battles (yet), so the action is lacking compared to most shounen. But given that this a short, 12 episode series, it does a pretty good job  of entertaining the viewer.Questions, comments, criticisms and compliments are welcomed whether you found this review helpful or not.

People don\'t seem to understand that making an original story is impossible anymore, everything has been done already.The storyline in general was great but it left a lot of open holes, and it proceeded a bit too fast if you ask me. Also I don\'t like it when the fights are based on one special skill and when that\'s used the battle is over and the results are obvious. Even though I love seeing clichés and going through general storylines with different settings, basing...all the fights around one ability that is unbeatable is just plain boring if you ask me.The artwork was fantastic if you ask me. I really can\'t give any complaints about that.Sound? Well, I didn\'t really pay attention to the sound effects, but OST was great and I totally loved the voice actors.For the characters, I think they should have given more screentime for some of the supporting characters. I often prefer the supporting characters more than the main characters in most of the series\'. As for this series too. Bianca was my favorite character in this series, with Rose being the close second. I really think they did a good job with the voice actors too, they gave perfect voices for the characters!For overall enjoyment I have nothing else to complain about except for the battles.

Gunfights, magic (well i guess this is an exception) and car chases are not typical for a first episode of Harem so this will keep you on your toes. (Side note: its very refreshing to see an anime without a tsundere character, originality hells yea.) I dont want to give any surprises away but long story shot, boy meets girl, and another girl, and a third who i apparently...a dragon with an unhealthy obsession for him.Summary:This is without a doubt worth a watch this season as its exciting, funny, fairly original, and surprisingly endearing. a dragon with an unhealthy obsession for him.Summary:This is without a doubt worth a watch this season as its exciting, funny, fairly original, and surprisingly endearing.', 'Well, I must say, while this anime isn\'t a masterpiece I feel it deserves better than it\'s getting. Also... this is going to be my first review so forgive me if it\'s not that great XD.First things first, I\'m going to try to keep this short. Second, I will refrain from any spoilers. Third... I loved this anime. While the situations and characters may not be the most original, they work, and because of this they make a truly enjoyable viewing experience.Story 6/10It\'s been mentioned by other reviewers and I\'m going to mention it again, If you want explanations and depth this is not your...anime. Throughout the anime you will often be left to your own devices when thinking through certain aspects; however,  don\'t worry, this is an easy anime to follow.Art 8/10It\'s not the best, and they could certainly have sped up the characters and pacing in the action scenes, but it\'s not bad. I\'m a bit of a stickler for art but i wont abandon an anime for it. Luckily that\'s not an issue here, as i stated previously its nothing to marvel at but I seriously can\'t imagine anyone dropping this because of it.Sound 7/10If I will hold anything against this anime it will be the sound. While it isn\'t bad in it\'s own right they could have chosen better. The OP/ED are not terrible but I question their use for this anime. I normally forget about/ignore the music during an anime as it blends into the background and feels like a part of the scene; however, throughout this anime there were several times when I couldn\'t help but listen to the background music and think, ""Wow, I mean, it\'s not like it\'s bad, and it still (kind of) fits the mood, but, seriously? could they not find something better?"".Character 7/10Very little character development, I get the feeling reading the original light novels would be a much more fulfilling experience. As i stated in the beginning depth is not a terribly strong point here. Cliche characters meet Cliche events, to an extent. Even saying this thought I have to admit, they did a good job developing their separate personalities. Given more episodes I believe they could have done something truly amazing with this anime if they had been willing/had the time to devote to creating depth in a lighthearted anime. On the plus side the male protagonist isn\'t a completely clueless dunce that bludgeons his way through social situations :D.Enjoyment 10/10This is a lighthearted anime through and through. I love harems, I love comedy, and I love characters I can get behind. While there are times *cough* the last episode\'s ""engage"" animation *cough* it appears cheesy or cliche they still do a good job. And if there is one thing I love (as another reviewer I\'ve read has put it) it\'s watching my ships set sail. I love harem\'s but if there is one thing I love more it\'s an ending that leaves you with a conclusion. While a stickler may still argue the point I would say it\'s pretty damn obvious who ends up with who. While the premise is original the characters and the situations are not. Don\'t let this dissuade you though as every episode manages to bring something to the table to keep your attention and while it may not be the most original it is certainly worth watching.Overall 8/10If you are looking for a lighthearted comedy/romance/harem anime that can grab your attention and won\'t leave you feeling like you just wasted part of your life, look no further! anime.

While performing this seasonal task I\'m sure there are a number of us that came across Dragon Crisis. Being a series that I\'ve never heard of, I didn\'t know what to expect (other then the fact there were going to be dragons)Our main protagonist, Ryuuji seems like another average teenager attending highschool but there is more than that.  It turns out that he is a level 10 ""breaker"" which is pretty strong considering it is the highest level there is....Soon after, Ryuuji\'s cousin, Eriko randomly comes in and takes Ryuuji away to steal a briefcase from this organization.  As the two are being pursued, the briefcase opens and a red dragon, Rose comes out, and from here the adventures begin.Dragon Crisis does not follow one story, instead we are given many different stories which focus on a certain character, which seems pretty common these days.  However the problem I find with this is that after each story is done, the character that it focused on would just move to the background making it feel like the story that was irrelevant. I feel like the story could have been executed better as I found the original story that it was on to be alright. The story isn\'t bad but it wasn\'t great either.Our main protagonist Ryuuji although being well develop, doesn\'t seem to stand out from protagonists from other anime. I\'m not saying that he is a bad protagonist, I find that he has a pretty likable personality actually but he just seems so similar to protagonists from other anime that he\'s not a memorable character. However like I said before he\'s not bad for a main protagonist, there are way worse out there.The other main character in this series is Rose, who I think is a very likable character.  Also she does go through major development towards the end of the series which is a plus but in the middle of the series she is cast to the side a little. I would\'ve liked to see Rose get a little more screen time and development there but I don\'t find that a big problem.There is also a number of side characters who all have likable personalities and all undergo development in their own arc.  However Ryuuji\'s school friends did get a bit annoying sometimes and I feel that Misaki\'s crush was only there to make Ryuuji\'s love life more complicated than it already was. Overall the characters weren\'t bad but not very memorable either.The art is on par with many of the series out there today and the backgrounds I felt were actually drawn pretty well, the battles were done pretty well and I have no complaints about this section.The sound was also pretty good too, the opening was really catchy (I think I listened to it the most out of the openings this season that I have). I also like the ending too. The voice actors also did a pretty good job, the voices matched each character pretty well, but that\'s what I expect from such a well known cast.The series itself is character driven, which I am finding is getting more common these days. I find no problem with that but others may not find it suitable for them. The series did entertain me though and never did I have to force myself to continue.Overall Dragon Crisis is an alright series with a number of flaws like most anime, and it isn\'t a very memorable series but it manages to entertain and is certainly not a bad time waster Soon after, Ryuuji\'s cousin, Eriko randomly comes in and takes Ryuuji away to steal a briefcase from this organization.

This anime is not a ""harem"" anime. It is more like an action anime. The first episode you have a classmate who has a crush on the main character, then an older cousin of the main character pops into the scene, but there is obviously no love interest on either side there. Then you have a dragon girl who falls into their hands and that\'s where the real relationship and story is.Now for the review.The story I thoroughly enjoy. Stories are made...out of the setting, characters, and the plot. The setting is very good and I can imagine a lot from it which continues my interest in the story, though the characters might seem a bit cliche and annoying at times they do not bother me to the extent to not watch further. The plot also might feel a bit cliche at times though most of the plot is the actual setting and it is new and interesting, and there are no gaping plot holes as of yet. For me all I have to enjoy is the setting for me to enjoy the anime, because I don\'t feel like I can predict what happens next. When I get to a point where I can predict it, that\'s when it gets boring. So the story is a 10The art isn\'t spectacular or new but it doesn\'t let down expectations of this day and age. Like Freezing has where I feel the art is lacking a lot. So I gave it an 8The sound I do believe the opening sequence and ending sequence is very catchy. Though the sound also means the voice actors and background sound too. I have no complaints about the background sound and Rie Kugimiya seems to be trying something new other than a tsundere role for once. Difficult to say if it fits her or not because I am so used to hearing her in tsundere roles. I also give this an 8.Characters is something hard to be unique in. The main character was very annoying at first because I really do hate those indecisive characters. But he seems to have gotten decisive come episode 3.. so hard to tell now. The other characters, eccentric scientist, older dependable cousin who only uses the main character and is really loose. Innocent young female lead who falls in love with the main character without knowing much about the world. Not really sure what to rate this but I don\'t rate the characters very highly, though there is only so many personalities you can actually use in stories and it\'s difficult to say you haven\'t seen them all. I give it a 7, might be being generous.Enjoyment, this is one of my favorites of the season. I\'m looking forward to seeing the next episode. I don\'t give high numbers easily and think if something deserves a low rating it will get a low rating. I wont forget about the first 5 numbers! 1-5 if Something deserves a 4 I\'ll give it.So over all I think this is an 8. Not a miyazaki work. But it isn\'t bad in fact 8 means very good. out of the setting, characters, and the plot.

That said, I write with the precarious position of liking this show more than I probably ""should"".The setting is one with potential, and sometimes it shows, but mostly it\'s just used as a setting for yet another supernatural harem show. It\'s world where magical artifacts, called Lost Precious because it sounds sort of cool, are common enough to be well-known (and classified on strength) but only a few people can use them to their full potential. These people...are called Breakers, and all the official ones are sponsored and regulated by the government. Also, as you may have guessed from the title, dragons exist but they\'re considered extremely mysterious and aloof, so not much is known about them. In this setting dragons look completely human, with the exception of the classic bat-wings that stick out of their shoulder blades and the ability to transform into ""real"" dragons when they mature. There\'s some interesting stuff here, but so little is explored.Instead we\'re given all of this as an excuse to throw magical girls (no, not those kind) at our standard harem protagonist with the far too convenient given name, Kisaragi Ryuuji (played by Shimono Hiro). When helping his overly-affectionate older cousin, Nanako Eriko (Horie Yui), on a mission to get back a stolen Lost Precious, Red Dragon Rose (Kugimiya Rie), our female lead and main romantic interest is thrown into his lap, his life, and his home. There is some conflict, most of which from a black dragon named Onyx (Kamiya Hiroshi) trying to capture Rose but mostly it\'s your standard harem plots.That\'s not to say it\'s all generic and wasted set-up. Rose loves Ryuuji and admits to it with such a refreshing and passionate zeal it remains fun to watch long after it should become trite. After an endless slog of Tsunderes (some of which played by Ms. Kugimiya herself) it\'s a breath of fresh air. And, at the risk of spoiling a bit, we skip most of the pussyfooting around a confession incredibly fast. In fact, the story is at it\'s worst when it attempts to change that dynamic into something more usual for the genre (ie: cliche).The action scenes are often energetic, and there are usually enough of them to keep things fast-paced.Ryuuji himself has a bit more backbone and awareness towards his suitors than most harem leads, and in such a crowded genre a little goes a long way.As for the other characters, it seems they become more interesting the less we see of them. The would-be dragon slayer and improbably young priest, George Evans (Miyamoto Mitsuru) and a two episode villain are more memorable than most of the cast while Onyx, the main villain, is so devoid of personality and originality his only real saving grace is his leitmotief. Two cliche but enjoyable mad scientists hold there own during their screentime while genre-must, Unlucky Childhood Friend Etou Misaki (Nigo Mayako), is a walking, talking yawn. In the end, the talent is there but the script isn\'t willing.As for the visuals, they vary between mediocre and good but it has it\'s moments. The character design is incredibly generic but it manages to stay fairly fluid during the fight scenes. The lighting is pretty, but if you look for them there are a lot of off-model moments.But in the end, the real star of Dragon Crisis!, it\'s shining moment and most redeeming quality, is the music. The soundtrack is pretty when it\'s queit, a thrill-ride when it\'s energetic, and it\'s probably what will keep you around long enough for the show to sink it\'s claws in. The damning phrase ""too good for the show"" could be used, but it\'s used too well. Even better somehow is the opening by Horie Yui. The cut used is excellent, but it really shows it\'s true splendor in it\'s full length. From a tongue-twisting pop tune, to a powerful english chrous, to a waltz, to a militaristic march, and back again; this tune takes you everywhere and makes you love it for that. While the style is a little incongruent with the anime, the message is shared: the ever-favorite Power of Love. It\'s a shame the show wasn\'t as varied.Oh, and there\'s a cutesy/fun party song with chibis for the outro.Dragon Crisis! is a fun diversion with some great music. It fails to live up to it\'s high-concept setting, but it\'s always competent and does enough things slightly differently to be worth watching if you feel like a harem anime. The final decision is yours, though I would highly recommend checking out the soundtrack, at the very least. are called Breakers, and all the official ones are sponsored and regulated by the government.

Of course, she is not the only one because this has.. Oh wait, it doesn\'t have a harem tag. I guess there is what one could call feelings of affections form the male lead, but he is still surrounded by plenty of women.  As you will find that plenty of shows on my list are harems, you can trust me that I didn\'t give it any demerit for that. What usually happens though, is that it gets in the way of the shows progression, and well you don\'t...end up watching it for anything but the eye candy.That is not completely true with dragon crisis. There is somewhat of a plotline at times that carries out through the whole season though it disappears at times. There are plenty of small mini arcs as they introduce the other girls. The arcs aren\'t bad either in theory, however there is some other issues with the show. At times it feels fast paced because they want to fit as many arcs in a twelve episode season as they can.I have to say the cast is varied, as it should be when they spend so much time introducing them. There is the shy classmate who has nothing to do with Ryuji\'s background, the bad ass tom girl character, the proper lady, and of course Rose. Rose is undeniably a \'moe\' character, but also undeniably a spoiled Rie character. The newly \'hatched\' Rose is a double edged sword; she is adorable at times but the main female lead has the mindset of a small child. As a Shukagan no Shana fan, I kept mistaking the typical rie chant ""Ryuji,RyujiRyujiRyuji…"" for Yuuji at times. Thankfully it never has jumped over the fence into the annoying category.Ryuji is apparently one of the best \'lost precious\' users in the world. In talent at least. While he of course kicks ass when the lead needs too, there are plenty of times where he can be the rather frustrating lame lead.The action is pretty eye candy, and sometimes cool. Ryuuji\'s fighting ability is low so any long term battles consist of other characters for the most part. The dragons can also be impressive at times with their powers. There are plenty of mid combat dialogues that take place, and many times things end up being one hit KO style. What ruined my opinion the most was after a specific really cool battle Ryuuji finishes them off with the power of love...  No literally, there is a giant floating pink heart engulfing the sky. What before was just a combo attack, turned into that image of the power of love consuming people. I am fine with it figuratively but… This is the usual approach taking with romance in this show, as it usually becomes over the top.They don\'t do a good job at explaining things in this show. Something that makes sense because we are all sick of the clueless lead who needs to be taught, or the out of place ones. However, when they are planning to steal \'lost preciouses\' and everything revolves around them it is difficult to follow at times.

Yes, there was all the above, but every time that Horie Yui OP came up I got pretty pumped to watch the episode, and the animation is appealing. Nothing incredibly special, but a fine watch for somebody looking for a fantasy ecchi. end up watching it for anything but the eye candy.That is not completely true with dragon crisis. There is somewhat of a plotline at times that carries out through the whole season though it disappears at times. There are plenty of small mini arcs as they introduce the other girls. The arcs aren\'t bad either in theory, however there is some other issues with the show. At times it feels fast paced because they want to fit as many arcs in a twelve episode season as they can.I have to say the cast is varied, as it should be when they spend so much time introducing them. There is the shy classmate who has nothing to do with Ryuji\'s background, the bad ass tom girl character, the proper lady, and of course Rose. Rose is undeniably a \'moe\' character, but also undeniably a spoiled Rie character. The newly \'hatched\' Rose is a double edged sword; she is adorable at times but the main female lead has the mindset of a small child. As a Shukagan no Shana fan, I kept mistaking the typical rie chant ""Ryuji,RyujiRyujiRyuji…"" for Yuuji at times. Thankfully it never has jumped over the fence into the annoying category.Ryuji is apparently one of the best \'lost precious\' users in the world. In talent at least. While he of course kicks ass when the lead needs too, there are plenty of times where he can be the rather frustrating lame lead.The action is pretty eye candy, and sometimes cool. Ryuuji\'s fighting ability is low so any long term battles consist of other characters for the most part. The dragons can also be impressive at times with their powers. There are plenty of mid combat dialogues that take place, and many times things end up being one hit KO style.

So they drive to the docks, where they then sit there for hours because the people who are arriving with the Lost Precious aren\'t arriving until very late that night (so why the heck did she pull him from school?). Moving on,...they steal the very large crate that they believe to contain the lost precious, which actually contain a 14 year old blond girl. The people who they got the crate from aren\'t too happy so they chase after them. The girl then shoots out a giant blast of flames from this rose pattern on her hand to get rid of their pursuers. Turns out that that girl is really the Red- DragonAt that point in the anime, I thought that this was going to be a really cool an awesome show about magic battles with these dragons , the Breakers (people who can use the Lost Preciouses like Ryuuji and Eriko), and other magical creatures.  actually most of the anime is like that.  But it goes absolutely no where.   The 11th episode tries to bring in some huge and shocking twist, but fails to leave you with the shock because they don\'t explain why you should be shocked at all!You want to know why I kept watching the anime?  Well, half of episode one has Rose, that red-dragon girl, running around naked in her DFC glory, hugging Ryuuji every chance she gets. Rose is the main reason why I even watched this show.  She is just very cute and appeals to a decent amount of people.  Maybe she could have been a bit older, but she\'s cute none the less.Aside from all the ecchi and what not, there were many decent fight scenes in the anime.  Each episode had a new sort of force that they were fighting, and some new women that Ryuuji meets along the way.And the ending to the anime leaves you with all the girls all swooning over him.  At least he is a man who fights and not one of those other wimpy characters in a harem-ish anime.Story: Doesn\'t really go anywhere and there is no real plot.  The fight scenes were good and they had meaning, but they were all separate events and had very little to do with one another.Art: I liked the art style, but it felt a bit off somehow.Sound: I very much enjoyed the characters voices (especially Rose\'s!!) and I really like the Opening Song, but nothing special.Characters: The women were all lovely and Ryuuji was a cool an tough guy who I was glad that he was the main character.Enjoyment: I somehow got a lot of enjoyment from watching this anime, but then again I always really like animes like this one even if they aren\'t that good of a show.My final rating for the show would be a 7.  It\'s not a good anime, but it\'s not a bad one either.  If you are into shows that are a harem-like anime paired with some action and fight scenes, then you\'ll love this.

Purely and Simply this anime to me has not a single piece of originality, from the character personalities to the story it self it seems pretty much based of of other good anime series. But,(because there's always one) I won't tell you not to watch it because it's ok to watch if you just need a small laugh or wish to kill some time. Only if your a person who has seen a lot of different anime just be aware that you may...find some of the story a bit predictable.

Despite the few cliches in this anime, I could sincerely say with a good heart that you aren\'t wasting when watching this anime.Story: Good 7/10The story follows Ryuugi and Rose as we watch their relationship grow through facing struggles and enemies. After watching this anime i can say that it was very thrilling and that was because it had a great concept to develop on. They developed on a concept of dragons and magical relics which made up for the mediocre vibe that was coming of some episodes. What i also liked about the concept was...that it was easy to understand and it didn\'t leave me asking questions even though the anime was a mere 12 episodes. I would also give the conclusion of romance in the story a some points because it\'s the one thing we need to have in all romance anime but a lot of them sometimes leave it out. Even though the concluding romance was a success, the subject in general was a failure. Rose has a sort of unique character but i never really saw anything special about her relationship with Ryuugi. What I mean is that their relationship was developed okay but there wasn\'t anything special about it and that can be a turnoff for romance lovers like myself. When a relationship is done poorly  in an anime, we the viewers start to look for other characters we might want to end up with the main and that isn\'t a good sign. I personally don\'t mind cliches as long as the story was fun to watch but their were some that got on my nerves in this anime. The last thing that annoyed me in this anime was how all the females would have this love for the main character and i see this shit in almost every anime i watch. To me personally, i hate when the main is a chick magnet for ever girl they meet.Art: Great 9/10I have absolutely no arguments with the way the art in this anime was done. Vivid  colors aren\'t the only good thing in this anime. it had good action scenes and a unique art style. I especially like the design of Rose and Ai. Sure it may not have those spectacular and  beautiful scenes but most of the art was done with originality and and i loved that in the anime.Sound: Good 7/10 (Subbed)The voice actors did a great job in this anime but i won\'t stress on that because they they always do a great job. What appeals to me the most in an anime is the soundtrack. It plays a major part in adding emotion to a scene and it i have to say that it was done good. It was nothing special but it was enough to activate the emotion and tension of the viewer. The reason i didn\'t give it an outstanding or great rating was because there were absolutely no soundtrack that was broke the average barrier and i just didn\'t find it to be as effective as it could have been. All the tracks were forgettable and it didn\'t really scream to me.Character: Fair 6/10The only thing that kept me from rating this anime as average was the development of some characters. I wanted to give it a 4 or 3 rating because some of these characters are as cliche as shit. I have seen the same male attitude 4 times this month and i am honestly tired of seen this type of male lead. When i see Ryuugi I picture myself as a kid. I was kind, helpful, caring and at times was helpless and that is okay but i hate the way how some male leads can be so helpless to the point that it comes off as gay. Yes i just said Gay. He reminded me Bell Crannel ""is it wrong to pick up girls in the dungeon"" but the difference between them was that Bell was a Badass and he wouldn\'t hesitate to make decisions to protect the people that matter to him. Almost every time Ryuugi faces an enemy, he also faces the conflict of making a decision and the way he struggled with it was hard to watch because he acts like little girl who\'s afraid of the dark. The next rant i have about this anime has to do with the rest of shitty cliche characters like Eriko, Ai and Misaki. I won\'t even explain because you must already know what I mean. Although they were really Cliche, i will have to give them points for character design but thats the only super great thing about the characters, everything else are either average or good to a pointEnjoyment: Great 9/10 Overall: Very Good 8/10FYI.

A very good fantasy anime, I must say. I don't usually dive into the 'harem' side of Anime. I find it very unappealing and unrealistic for me. But this one had enough fantasy element's to keep me interested all the way through the end. In the series we follow a young 15 year old boy. Called Riuji, and a Dragon girl called Rose. They fight together and stuff.Overall, what I liked most about the series it's it's fantasy, romance element. It was a nice break from all the Werewolf, or Vampire stuff, that has been going around lately. You...know what I mean. *cough* twilight *cough*. Of course the Romance had it's Japanese appeal to eat. Being Moe, harem, and sometimes a little bit hentai.The series had one episode in particular that literally scarred the living holy mother of god out of me. Episode 9, called 'Mirror of Truth'. (Don't worry, it doesn't affect the overall plot.) In this episode we find our protagonist's trapped in a painting. (Like that hasn't been done before. but it's the execution that counts.) They soon start talking about a horror movie they saw last night, and without a doubt the same killer appears before there eyes. They soon hide in a safe house. Riuji then find out that his 'Lost Precious' isn't working against the enemy. Bianca appears to control the situation. Anyway, to get out of the painting, they have to tell the truth to the Mirror, who so happens to be the killer.Anyway, the scary part for me was the killer itself. It was creepy as hell! Just proves how good Japanese Filmakers are at horror.The plot overall was the best thing for me. With each new character the series kept it's momentum, it kept it fresh and interesting for me. And at the end, all of them come together in one climactic battle.If you have the time, you should definitely check out this series. Not for it's moe or harem side, but for it's Action/Fantasy side. :) know what I mean. *cough* twilight *cough*. Of course the Romance had it's Japanese appeal to eat.

I mean the usual set-up where a nondescript dude is inexplicably attractive to every girl he meets, except that he\'s gay. Think of the drama that the character would be faced with, constantly enduring unrequited sexual advances from girls (an enviable situation to his classmates but deeply uncomfortable to himself), and unable to refuse them with the truth for fear of judgement from society, but still motivated to go through his adventures and meet...all these girls out of pure-hearted altruism. A careful writer could use this premise not only for a metafictional analysis of the harem genre, but for incisive commentary on societal norms, adolescence, and the relationship between men and women.Dragon Crisis! is not that anime. It\'s a predicable little fantasy/harem show that\'s superficially about fighting monsters but in practice deals with teenage romance through the filter of trite wacky hijinks. I mention the idea of a gay harem protagonist because Dragon Crisis! made me think of it. There\'s a bit of an odd tendency in these shows. I think it emerges because they\'re trying to reconcile the wish-fulfillment elements with the need for adversity in narrative. Harem and ecchi shows go one of two ways: the protagonist is an unapologetic sex-pest but repellent to all women, or the reverse, as is the case with Dragon Crisis!\'s Ryuuji: all the ladies love him but he\'s somewhere between oblivious and uncomfortable in response. I don\'t know of any anime whose protagonist really strikes the more life-like balance between the pair. The best example that comes to mind is Shinji Ikari, but his character displays a specific psychological issue: withdrawn self-repression that eventually explodes horrifically. I\'ve never seen an anime that deals with the sexual aspect of the ordinary teenage male experience in a detailed or realistic manner - but that would be the territory of a smarter show than Dragon Crisis!.In the case of Dragon Crisis! there\'s an apparent disconnect between the protagonist and the target audience. Ryuuji slinks away from female affection as he would from the slowly-closing jaws of a yawning dragon. The boys watching probably wish he\'d take a girl out once or twice and have some fun with his one legitimate superpower of attractiveness to the opposite sex - they would, and that\'s presumably what they\'ve come to see. Although the show sort of slays my hatchlings by the end, my interpretation of the whole thing is that Ryuuji is gay but hasn\'t come to grips with it yet.And while he struggles with his sexuality, Dragon Crisis! has a hard time making sense of its own format. It makes a point of giving Ryuuji and token loli Rose linked backstories and combining powers, which would fit in a focused romance story, but then marginalizes their connection so that Ryuuji can hang out with the supporting female cast for two episodes at a time, and rather than staying around to build a big ensemble cast, those supporting girls mostly leave after their self-contained arcs are over, coming by now and again rather than sticking around as dedicated parts of the team. That makes the series feel less cohesive and the adventures less important. I can understand why it wouldn\'t be viable if there were 30 different girls or something, but this is a 12 episode series. Would it really have been so much to ask for them to come up with things for the ice dragon and cat girls to do in the background?What\'s really unfortunate is that the all-important introductory arc about Ryuuji meeting Rose is horribly paced, so that it can be compressed to three episodes and the other girls can have their mandated two episodes with the hapless gay boy. It\'s a real case study in how a story needs its breathing room. Rose starts out unable to speak and then begins using one-word sentences, and then I swear to God she makes the jump to complete grammatically-correct sentences in the space of a minute: she babbles a single word, someone asks her a question, and then she answers it with complete eloquence and no commentary from the rest of the characters. Then the arc\'s antagonist, Onyx, storms in, effortlessly smacks down Ryuuji, and threatens to butcher the kid until Rose comes with him. This is traditionally the point where Ryuuji would go through some training, become a man, make peace with his homosexuality, and then storm the villain\'s temple as a fully-formed badass and beat the girly-haired git until he\'s sorry.Instead of that, Ryuuji gets a cool knife.Apparently that\'s all it takes. He picks up the knife from a conveniently-nearby underground vault, learns to use it in two seconds, and then jumps right back into the action and gives Onyx what for. There\'s a pathetic little scene where Onyx tries convincing Rose that humans hate her for being a dragon, and she professes her hatred for humanity to the main characters in response. Ryuuji defuses the whole thing right away by saying that he likes her.And that\'s really too bad, because it undermines two scenes that could\'ve been impactful. First, there\'s the moment when Rose tells Ryuuji that she hates him. For a second the characters just stand there shocked. That could\'ve been a powerful scene if it had lasted longer or become more difficult to solve, because even a draconic treasure hoard of fancy knives are worthless against emotional manipulation. It could have forced the heroes to continue standing there in helpless awe, injecting an interesting sense of adversity and a healthy dose of heroic failure into the narrative.Then there\'s the scene where Ryuuji wins her back over. This is meant to be one of the big emotional payoffs of the series, and don\'t give me that standard spiel about the show being a comedy. In this scene, it\'s taking itself seriously. Because their relationship hasn\'t gone through any real build-up or tribulation, and because Rose\'s turn is so blatantly manipulative and superficial, this big emotional climax fatally crashes before it can give a single flap of its scaly wings.Onyx responds to Ryuuji\'s sweet knife by transforming into a giant dragon. Rose and Ryuuji have a paired power-up sequence and then Ryuuji swings his knife once, sends out a shockwave, and Onyx collapses. It\'s probably the most pitiful fight scene I\'ve ever seen in an anime, and it\'s for the same reason of pacing. We need to see them trade blows and Ryuuji take some hits to convey the idea that Onyx is threatening. If he just collapses in an instant it simply makes him look pathetic, which, in turn, undermines the already negligible sense of progression these episodes were supposed to give the characters.This is the only time we see a dragon until the last episode, by the way - and it\'s just as much of a let-down then.If you\'ve noticed the extremely tortured dragon-related metaphors I\'ve been using so far, they\'re here because I decided at least someone in this relationship should make an effort to include some goddam dragons. What this show calls dragons are actually anime girls with wings. One girl called Maruga claims to be a white dragon and provides some exposition on dragon society, and I don\'t think she ever shows her wings. There\'s one scene where the baddies have an airplane and she stands on the runway, and I thought ""Oh cool, she\'s about to transform and we\'ll see a dragon fight an airplane,"" and trust me, they thought of that idea! But Maruga doesn\'t transform. In another scene, she sprains her ankle and Ryuuji has to carry her home on his back. If she had wings, she would get by just fine, so there\'s really no doubt that she\'s just a bookish fraud with some magical powers.You know what, I think I\'ve figured it out. We only see Onyx actually transform into a dragon and he goes down with one swing of the knife. I think what\'s happening is that he\'s actually inflating a giant dragon-shaped balloon, and he\'s no more dragon than Maruga is. There are no real dragons in this show, and their supposed presence is a metaphor of some kind. Since they\'re long and serpentine, I\'m gonna go out on a limb and say they represent phalluses in some way. That would certainly explain why Ryuuji has such an affinity for them, and it would re-contextualize Onyx\'s statement that Ryuuji can\'t coexist with dragons in an interesting way. That\'s to say nothing of the whole business about kissing a dragon causing it to mature, keeping in mind that maturation tends to be accompanied by growth, and that a dragon can\'t properly express its romantic feelings until it ""matures"" in this way.Yes, I like that: for Ryuuji in particular, the path to manhood involves eschewing the safe and familiar option of celibacy (represented by his cousin Eriko) as well as the societally-approved heterosexual marriage (represented by his classmate Misaki,) and instead reconciling with his feelings toward dragons. Although the prospect of a dragon maturing and showing its love for him is terrifying at first, accepting and expressing his own love of dragons is a positive step forward for him.Speaking of which, Ryuuji is something called a Level 10 Breaker, which is treated as if it\'s very impressive but doesn\'t really have a clear meaning. Characters at lower ""level"" consistently outperform him and there\'s a scene where he gets tested by being bound with ball and chain and thrown into a pool. He survives, but we don\'t see how, and he never really displays superhuman physical capabilities outside of that scene. In fact, if we return to the scene where he carries Maruga we can see that he gets tuckered out from the exertion of that task. If she were a dragon, she might weigh more than you\'d think, but there are no dragons in this series, which proves that Ryuuji has the physical strength of a normal skinny kid. Therefore I choose to believe that the weights are also symbolic, representing the societal values that prevent him from expressing who he truly is.I\'m convinced that saying ""Breaker Level"" is a cutesy way of talking about how many inches long his dick is. You see, there\'s a scene at a party about halfway in where his cousin euphemistically hands him his little dagger and says that he\'ll make a big impression if he shows off his ""lost precious."" Not long afterward, Ryuuji feels the need to inform some kind of institution about his massive Breaker Level (possibly the Guiness Book of World Records?) and they send a representative to verify it. The first thing she does when she arrives - and I swear I\'m not making this up - is demand that he undress so she can take his measurement.(Ryuuji\'s body language and facial expressions during the nude measuring scene reveal that he is deeply terrified by the whole procedure, by the way - and he naturally decides that he\'s more comfortable having a guy do it, and so has his best friend, a character who frequently hugs Ryuuji out of relieved affection when he learns that he\'s not with girls, I might add, take his ""measurements."")This interpretation does raise some more questions when one takes into account that Eriko is a breaker level 7, though.It\'s not so bad once you get past the introduction. The artwork is cute except when they add a strange-looking extra line under the characters\' mouths, an effect which made me uncomfortable. It settles into an inoffensive episodic structure and there\'s a certain appeal to Ryuuji\'s almost parental concern for the girls and the simple laid-back scenes where the characters just do things like eat cookies together. There\'s a fun little episode that parodies horror films about halfway in which is probably the highlight. I thought the English knight guy was kind of funny, and it\'s nice that he is portrayed as a decent person despite being an anti-dragon antagonist. I liked the friend of Ryuuji\'s classmate Misaki who tried to help her get into his pants, as hopeless a cause as that was. I felt for Misaki too, actually. Her competition initially consisted of a loli and Ryuuji\'s cousin, so she probably could\'ve managed if she wasn\'t such a nervous wreck. She got dragged through a lot of danger as his satellite, too, which I imagine would\'ve made it rather galling when Ryuuji inevitably left the whole harem to hook up with his buddy Masato. Ultimately I can see a younger and less jaded boy than myself having some fun with the show - but only for its comedy. I don\'t think anyone would defend it as a touching romance or an insightful depiction of the awkwardness of growing up.There are no dragons in this show, and the villains are so weak that it can hardly be said to contain a crisis. Therefore, its proper title is ""!,"" which I feel represents it well: it\'s a meaningless but inoffensive burst of noise, like the screech of an anime girl.I have one last point of speculation to share about !, which is that it was planned to be longer at some point. The rules of its world never get properly expanded upon, it\'s stated that Ryuuji\'s Breaker Level will let him use lots of powerful weapons but he only gets the knife, and most notably there are the beginnings of a storyline about the Society (the lads who sent a woman to measure Ryuuji\'s willy) being corrupt because they hoard magical artifacts and refuse to use them for the benefit of civilians. That potential arc winds up completely forgotten. If they did intend to make more of it, then that\'s another indication of what has already been proven: that civilization at large has deemed ! a failure. It was rushed into a single 12-episode series and no one remembers it or cares to defend it now. That being the case, my decision to pick on it some more is clearly redundant. Why have I bothered, then? I couldn\'t help myself. I saw a chance to make dick jokes and I took it. all these girls out of pure-hearted altruism. A careful writer could use this premise not only for a metafictional analysis of the harem genre, but for incisive commentary on societal norms, adolescence, and the relationship between men and women.Dragon Crisis! is not that anime. It\'s a predicable little fantasy/harem show that\'s superficially about fighting monsters but in practice deals with teenage romance through the filter of trite wacky hijinks. I mention the idea of a gay harem protagonist because Dragon Crisis! made me think of it. There\'s a bit of an odd tendency in these shows. I think it emerges because they\'re trying to reconcile the wish-fulfillment elements with the need for adversity in narrative. Harem and ecchi shows go one of two ways: the protagonist is an unapologetic sex-pest but repellent to all women, or the reverse, as is the case with Dragon Crisis!\'s Ryuuji: all the ladies love him but he\'s somewhere between oblivious and uncomfortable in response. I don\'t know of any anime whose protagonist really strikes the more life-like balance between the pair. The best example that comes to mind is Shinji Ikari, but his character displays a specific psychological issue: withdrawn self-repression that eventually explodes horrifically. I\'ve never seen an anime that deals with the sexual aspect of the ordinary teenage male experience in a detailed or realistic manner - but that would be the territory of a smarter show than Dragon Crisis!.In the case of Dragon Crisis! there\'s an apparent disconnect between the protagonist and the target audience. Ryuuji slinks away from female affection as he would from the slowly-closing jaws of a yawning dragon. The boys watching probably wish he\'d take a girl out once or twice and have some fun with his one legitimate superpower of attractiveness to the opposite sex - they would, and that\'s presumably what they\'ve come to see. Although the show sort of slays my hatchlings by the end, my interpretation of the whole thing is that Ryuuji is gay but hasn\'t come to grips with it yet.And while he struggles with his sexuality, Dragon Crisis! has a hard time making sense of its own format. It makes a point of giving Ryuuji and token loli Rose linked backstories and combining powers, which would fit in a focused romance story, but then marginalizes their connection so that Ryuuji can hang out with the supporting female cast for two episodes at a time, and rather than staying around to build a big ensemble cast, those supporting girls mostly leave after their self-contained arcs are over, coming by now and again rather than sticking around as dedicated parts of the team. That makes the series feel less cohesive and the adventures less important. I can understand why it wouldn\'t be viable if there were 30 different girls or something, but this is a 12 episode series. Would it really have been so much to ask for them to come up with things for the ice dragon and cat girls to do in the background?What\'s really unfortunate is that the all-important introductory arc about Ryuuji meeting Rose is horribly paced, so that it can be compressed to three episodes and the other girls can have their mandated two episodes with the hapless gay boy. It\'s a real case study in how a story needs its breathing room. Rose starts out unable to speak and then begins using one-word sentences, and then I swear to God she makes the jump to complete grammatically-correct sentences in the space of a minute: she babbles a single word, someone asks her a question, and then she answers it with complete eloquence and no commentary from the rest of the characters. Then the arc\'s antagonist, Onyx, storms in, effortlessly smacks down Ryuuji, and threatens to butcher the kid until Rose comes with him. This is traditionally the point where Ryuuji would go through some training, become a man, make peace with his homosexuality, and then storm the villain\'s temple as a fully-formed badass and beat the girly-haired git until he\'s sorry.Instead of that, Ryuuji gets a cool knife.Apparently that\'s all it takes. He picks up the knife from a conveniently-nearby underground vault, learns to use it in two seconds, and then jumps right back into the action and gives Onyx what for. There\'s a pathetic little scene where Onyx tries convincing Rose that humans hate her for being a dragon, and she professes her hatred for humanity to the main characters in response. Ryuuji defuses the whole thing right away by saying that he likes her.And that\'s really too bad, because it undermines two scenes that could\'ve been impactful. First, there\'s the moment when Rose tells Ryuuji that she hates him. For a second the characters just stand there shocked. That could\'ve been a powerful scene if it had lasted longer or become more difficult to solve, because even a draconic treasure hoard of fancy knives are worthless against emotional manipulation. It could have forced the heroes to continue standing there in helpless awe, injecting an interesting sense of adversity and a healthy dose of heroic failure into the narrative.Then there\'s the scene where Ryuuji wins her back over. This is meant to be one of the big emotional payoffs of the series, and don\'t give me that standard spiel about the show being a comedy. In this scene, it\'s taking itself seriously. Because their relationship hasn\'t gone through any real build-up or tribulation, and because Rose\'s turn is so blatantly manipulative and superficial, this big emotional climax fatally crashes before it can give a single flap of its scaly wings.Onyx responds to Ryuuji\'s sweet knife by transforming into a giant dragon. Rose and Ryuuji have a paired power-up sequence and then Ryuuji swings his knife once, sends out a shockwave, and Onyx collapses. It\'s probably the most pitiful fight scene I\'ve ever seen in an anime, and it\'s for the same reason of pacing. We need to see them trade blows and Ryuuji take some hits to convey the idea that Onyx is threatening. If he just collapses in an instant it simply makes him look pathetic, which, in turn, undermines the already negligible sense of progression these episodes were supposed to give the characters.This is the only time we see a dragon until the last episode, by the way - and it\'s just as much of a let-down then.If you\'ve noticed the extremely tortured dragon-related metaphors I\'ve been using so far, they\'re here because I decided at least someone in this relationship should make an effort to include some goddam dragons. What this show calls dragons are actually anime girls with wings. One girl called Maruga claims to be a white dragon and provides some exposition on dragon society, and I don\'t think she ever shows her wings. There\'s one scene where the baddies have an airplane and she stands on the runway, and I thought ""Oh cool, she\'s about to transform and we\'ll see a dragon fight an airplane,"" and trust me, they thought of that idea! But Maruga doesn\'t transform. In another scene, she sprains her ankle and Ryuuji has to carry her home on his back. If she had wings, she would get by just fine, so there\'s really no doubt that she\'s just a bookish fraud with some magical powers.You know what, I think I\'ve figured it out. We only see Onyx actually transform into a dragon and he goes down with one swing of the knife. I think what\'s happening is that he\'s actually inflating a giant dragon-shaped balloon, and he\'s no more dragon than Maruga is. There are no real dragons in this show, and their supposed presence is a metaphor of some kind. Since they\'re long and serpentine, I\'m gonna go out on a limb and say they represent phalluses in some way. That would certainly explain why Ryuuji has such an affinity for them, and it would re-contextualize Onyx\'s statement that Ryuuji can\'t coexist with dragons in an interesting way. That\'s to say nothing of the whole business about kissing a dragon causing it to mature, keeping in mind that maturation tends to be accompanied by growth, and that a dragon can\'t properly express its romantic feelings until it ""matures"" in this way.Yes, I like that: for Ryuuji in particular, the path to manhood involves eschewing the safe and familiar option of celibacy (represented by his cousin Eriko) as well as the societally-approved heterosexual marriage (represented by his classmate Misaki,) and instead reconciling with his feelings toward dragons. Although the prospect of a dragon maturing and showing its love for him is terrifying at first, accepting and expressing his own love of dragons is a positive step forward for him.Speaking of which, Ryuuji is something called a Level 10 Breaker, which is treated as if it\'s very impressive but doesn\'t really have a clear meaning. Characters at lower ""level"" consistently outperform him and there\'s a scene where he gets tested by being bound with ball and chain and thrown into a pool. He survives, but we don\'t see how, and he never really displays superhuman physical capabilities outside of that scene. In fact, if we return to the scene where he carries Maruga we can see that he gets tuckered out from the exertion of that task. If she were a dragon, she might weigh more than you\'d think, but there are no dragons in this series, which proves that Ryuuji has the physical strength of a normal skinny kid. Therefore I choose to believe that the weights are also symbolic, representing the societal values that prevent him from expressing who he truly is.I\'m convinced that saying ""Breaker Level"" is a cutesy way of talking about how many inches long his dick is. You see, there\'s a scene at a party about halfway in where his cousin euphemistically hands him his little dagger and says that he\'ll make a big impression if he shows off his ""lost precious."" Not long afterward, Ryuuji feels the need to inform some kind of institution about his massive Breaker Level (possibly the Guiness Book of World Records?) and they send a representative to verify it. The first thing she does when she arrives - and I swear I\'m not making this up - is demand that he undress so she can take his measurement.(Ryuuji\'s body language and facial expressions during the nude measuring scene reveal that he is deeply terrified by the whole procedure, by the way - and he naturally decides that he\'s more comfortable having a guy do it, and so has his best friend, a character who frequently hugs Ryuuji out of relieved affection when he learns that he\'s not with girls, I might add, take his ""measurements."")This interpretation does raise some more questions when one takes into account that Eriko is a breaker level 7, though.It\'s not so bad once you get past the introduction. The artwork is cute except when they add a strange-looking extra line under the characters\' mouths, an effect which made me uncomfortable. It settles into an inoffensive episodic structure and there\'s a certain appeal to Ryuuji\'s almost parental concern for the girls and the simple laid-back scenes where the characters just do things like eat cookies together. There\'s a fun little episode that parodies horror films about halfway in which is probably the highlight. I thought the English knight guy was kind of funny, and it\'s nice that he is portrayed as a decent person despite being an anti-dragon antagonist. I liked the friend of Ryuuji\'s classmate Misaki who tried to help her get into his pants, as hopeless a cause as that was. I felt for Misaki too, actually. Her competition initially consisted of a loli and Ryuuji\'s cousin, so she probably could\'ve managed if she wasn\'t such a nervous wreck. She got dragged through a lot of danger as his satellite, too, which I imagine would\'ve made it rather galling when Ryuuji inevitably left the whole harem to hook up with his buddy Masato. Ultimately I can see a younger and less jaded boy than myself having some fun with the show - but only for its comedy. I don\'t think anyone would defend it as a touching romance or an insightful depiction of the awkwardness of growing up.There are no dragons in this show, and the villains are so weak that it can hardly be said to contain a crisis.

The art is well made not something extraordinary but better than average. What really made me think I had to write a review about this series was the protagonists character. In most harem animes the main characters almost always share some of the same elements but in this series the protagonist takes the most overused and cliche qualities in anime (an not the good ones) and bases his entire character off of them. An since the protagonist is important...to how good an anime is I've got to say he really ruined what could have been a slightly above average anime for me. to how good an anime is I've got to say he really ruined what could have been a slightly above average anime for me."", ""Oh boy dragons!!! Yup, that is pretty much all you can really say about this anime. This anime mixes in Action, Ecchi, Fantasy and Romance all together. Its story revolves mainly on the two characters (Ryugi and Rose) with some other main back characters who have a huge role within the anime. Once again I did not go into this anime reading a synopsis so instead I just went in with the picture and the categories it is in since it worked out pretty well last time I decided to do it and liked the anime. Lets go on to what I think about the...anime eh?!Ok, so there is action within the anime. Guns, swords, dragons fighting (kind of) and explosions. What guy doesn't like explosions huh? I personally liked the action in the anime even though some of the battles are fairly short and pretty much end in a similar fashion but regardless the action was ok.Ecchi is also part of this anime. Boobs, butts, collar bones . . . yea got it. The art work for the ecchiness was fine and did not take up too much of the anime (whatever type of anime they were aiming for). But there is always ecchiness and if you don't like ecchiness in animes then don't watch it or keep your eyes closed during those parts. I didn't see any censorship except in some spots but it didn't take anything away from the anime so I didn't mind too much but I still hate censorship!!!I am going to go ahead and guess the main part of this anime is fantasy. You have these magical items that people use, dragons, half dog people, magic, dragons. I don't watch many fantasy's but this was a pretty good one on this part i think. Dragons are pretty cool I must say so myself and people battling dragons is also pretty cool. If you hate dragons, go get punched in the face.There is some romance in the anime. More towards the end if anything. No dates that I saw, if anything just a nice trip but thats not a date unless stuff happen. For romance lovers, I would not watch this since it is not that in deep with romance.Overall I thought that is anime was ok which is why I gave it a 7. Going in not reading a synopsis again really paid off I must say so myself and I am going to do that for now on and just watch anime. But if you are reading this right now deciding on whether to watch it or not, I would say yea go for it. It is not a complete waste of time and I don't think you are going to completely regret watching it. Until my next review, farewell. anime eh?!Ok, so there is action within the anime.

The main reason I went for just this anime was because I\'ve always been fascinated and interested in dragons and I did expect some sort of deep conflicts between humans and dragons etc. Not that I got anything like that though.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.Story 3/10: I\'ll be honest, the plot felt non-existant. It felt like all the time this show didn\'t really know what it wanted to be – it\'s really confusing with a lot of plotholes and things that don\'t make sense or are just plain stupid. Normally I\'m...the kind of person who doesn\'t notice plotholes or inconsistencies but this show\'s ""story"" was so bad that even I couldn\'t miss it.The base premise is that there\'s a normal guy, with a hottie female sidekick, who end up saving some dragon loli who they need to protect. A few episodes later this dragon loli, named Rose, gets kidnapped by a black dragon guy named Onyx, whose sole purpose seems to be to forcibly marry the reluctant loli so that he\'d get more powerful or something. The issue is that he kidnaps the loli in the third episode (if I recall right), gets beaten up and magically disappears for almost the complete show, even though the beginning makes him out to be a great threat and a major plot figure – but guess what? After the bad guy\'s disappearance you\'re left watching our main heroes pointlessly hunting after some ""Lost Precious"" named treasures, or whatever. The thing is that we\'re never really told why they are after these treasures, what\'s so important and plot-significant about them (except that they have different rarities and grant special powers) that they\'d use up like 7 of 12 episodes on the hunting of those. Those episodes feel pointless to the story and just as a way to introduce more unimportant and boring characters to the cast.In the final episodes the bad dragon guy shows up again, kidnaps our loli dragon, again, and tries to escape to another country by airplane – aka loli\'s birth country. The thing is that this time the loli girl has suddenly lost her memory of the main guy, aka her lover, and she\'s just passively going along with the bad guy until she gets to eat some ICE CREAM THAT REGAINS HER MEMORY. Oh, and to make it even more anticlimactic the big bad dragon guy is defeated by no one less than... the main character\'s PARENTS, who had no fucking role in the series prior to this, whatsoever. They just suddenly appeared out of nowhere, no explanation, nothing, to save the day and kill off the dragon guy with a one-shot KO attack. Wow. It doesn\'t even make sense.This show was simply all over the place and really cringy to watch. You don\'t get any explanations for what the ""society"" is either or anything that is constantly mentioned in the show; you\'re just supposed to know it from the get-go but you don\'t. It\'s stupid.Art 6/10: I don\'t have much to say about the art. It looked decent and I didn\'t notice anything that seemed off, except for the CG cars.Sound 8/10: It feels like a waste that such a poor show had such good music, honestly. The tunes really got the mood right and were really pleasant to listen to. I was always waiting for the music to go on because it was really enjoyable.Characters 3/10: I\'ll be honest, most of the cast was either boring, predictable or unbearable. My favorite character was George, the priest guy, who sadly enough only was in like 2 episodes. I\'m disappointed that most of the dragons were lolis because I really can\'t stand loli characters because they tend to be either too annoying, too clingy, think they\'re adult when they\'re obviously not or they are just really fucking stupid and not cute at all. Another thing that really bothered me was that all along we get told that the main guy, Ryuji, is a ""level 10 breaker"" but we never get any kind of explanation on what the heck a breaker is and what their purpose or anything is?? Same thing in the end is that we learn that our main character is not actually human, even though he denies that he\'d be anything else, and is actually a Lost Precious or a destroyer or something... but guess what? Yeah, no more explanations about that either and the explanation that is given is terribly fuzzy and just leaves you even more confused and unsatisfied than you already were; it feels like just a half-assed try to make the plot seem like he and his dragon loli can\'t be together. There were a lot of other stupid reasons too but they all felt like they were made up when the manuscript guy was sitting in the bathroom with watery diarrhea...Oh and yeah, one thing that really bothered me was the whole ""love at first sight"" thing the dragons had going on. I mean really, first off it\'s super cliché and, secondly, how does that even work in reality? Most times when an egg hatches the first thing the kid will see is their mother and yeah, does that mean that all dragon kids would naturally want to fuck their mother because she\'s normally the first person they\'d ever see and thus fall in love with? Incest much? :D Oh and since when did you desire or have any interest in your ultimate husbando/waifu the second you\'re born – shouldn\'t you just care about staying alive and getting fed? Just wondering??Okay, that incest thing was not in Rose\'s case but I still found it to be a ridiculous and weak try at making our main couple\'s love legit and, besides, wouldn\'t love between a human and a dragon be considered bestiality anyway? Oh, and don\'t forget that they both are underage (approx. 15 years) and have the whole ""engage"" thing going on... ugh. I\'m sorry but their whole ""power-up engage"" combat skills made me cringe for so many reasons....Oh and let\'s not forget that completely useless schoolgirl who was so shy and always ended up in the shit when she wanted to confess her love to Ryuji. She was so generic that I felt sorry and ashamed just watching her fail all the time; she was so predictable it hurt and of course she doesn\'t end up with the main character in the end and does nothing actually plot-important. She\'s just there because every harem rom-com needs a shy schoolgirl who fails miserably and is there to be an awkward love rival.Enjoyment 4/10: I don\'t know why I even watched this to the end. I guess I wanted to see what would happen even though I could predict it for the most part. Or I guess I kept hoping that it would get better... and then it didn\'t. I feel so frustrated because the base for the story had a lot of potential to be a deep and actually interesting story and they just completely wasted it on some poor loli rom-com that can\'t even explain what\'s going on in a way that makes sense and feels realistic. This show could have been some deep story about humans and dragons living together after waging war against each other, serious conflicts and all – it could have been so much more than what it was.Overall 5/10: This anime is a waste of your time. It\'s okay if you are bored and need dragon lolis in your life. Don\'t expect any actually cool and powerful mythical dragons or dragon hybrids – expect silly dragons that look like little 10-year-old girls who can\'t even use their powers nor transform to actual dragons, save for sprouting wings. There are a few funny moments but those are few and far between and most of the time this series is really predictable, fucks up its chances and just makes you feel ashamed for the characters and the excruciatingly poor storywriting. the kind of person who doesn\'t notice plotholes or inconsistencies but this show\'s ""story"" was so bad that even I couldn\'t miss it.The base premise is that there\'s a normal guy, with a hottie female sidekick, who end up saving some dragon loli who they need to protect.

There are a few funny moments but those are few and far between and most of the time this series is really predictable, fucks up its chances and just makes you feel ashamed for the characters and the excruciatingly poor storywriting.', ""Dragon Crisis!, I started this anime as it was short and I didn't have a lot of time on my hands so the expectations weren't at all high. I'v heard many negative things leading to this anime but it actually really surprised me, It may not be everyone's cup of tea but you should give it a shot.Story: The story is a fairly average story but plans out pretty well for a 12 episode anime. Its not one to make you put it in your top ten but I found it defiantly enjoyable.Art: The art was very clean and clear and is the classic anime...style, unless your into the stranger anime looks then this should tick all box's, I personally really liked it.Sound: The opening and ending were fairly catchy but not in my opinion the greatest in the world. But I gave this a 9 because of the background music, I strangely enjoyed the music in the background as it sets the mood perfectly.Character: Characters were very cliche'd but were done in a very good way, I really enjoyed seeing the characters visually and getting to know them throughout the series. The development of the characters was very good and there were always new characters being introduced. Two Characters i would of liked to seen more of would have been Ryuji's parents but for a 12 episode anime I can't complain since there were plenty of other interesting characters.Enjoyment: As I have said, I personally really enjoyed this anime, I think this may be because it gives a more lighter feel to anime than some of the other anime's i have been watching recently but I still found this pleasant to watch.Overall: I really enjoyed this anime, it was light hearted and just pure fun to watch. If your looking for a quick anime to watch this is a really good choice, understanding that it may not be to everyone's tastes but compare to some of the other cliche anime's you could find, this is a real fun one to watch.(P.S. Just to say this was my first review on any anime/manga and don't normally do them, but since I saw so many negative ones about Dragon Crisis! that I had to write a nicer one :D. I hope you find this helpful and if I have made any mistakes or you would like to give feedback you are more than welcome to message me.):) style, unless your into the stranger anime looks then this should tick all box's, I personally really liked it.Sound: The opening and ending were fairly catchy but not in my opinion the greatest in the world.

Unbeliavable this show turning some of their best into that thing very quickly. I mean, i know this show all about the relations between dragon and human. But, turning that meaning into some kind of romantic feels really amusing. Maybe i just dislike the male MC, and irritated with female MC personality, but that only one thing of some factor. What i dislike most was the story plot become so generic, which only i can say as a lame excuse.The scenery within every episodes become so dull too. Idk what happen, but...at my view, i found every episodes not quite fit in each arcs. The connection lost on every aspect that i believe that must be a mistake made by the studio. But, when i see the public opinion about this show, my believe just dissapeared so fast like a dust. I dont like the fact, but its happen, so i need to move on it. Now lemme explain some of my thought for this show what i rely on.As a whole story explanations, the decision to conclude the romantic relations between the two of MCs, come from the very first beginning, was really a big mistake for the audience. For the half part until the end, all story telling to the show, will become like a filler. No more tension appear, in my opinion, since i was know the good part just end in the first sight. Tbh, i dont enjoy that decision. I realise, where every anime shall be preparing the idea like this one. But, their approaching in this show too rushed for only showing a little affection toward the whole series.Every people will think, to not watch this again from the half of the season until the end. They know what is goin on, why they must watch the show? The studio fail to make some excuse for the flow of the story, fail to make me curious. Instead make the story become clear with the flow, they even make another character appear as a backup.In this attempt, its somehow be a good respond, only to make me satisfy a little. Yes, the failure become big, so the decision to patch the hole via more cute character will only the temporary solution. Until this, the story become boring, become boring, and make me questioned myself, why i even watch this show?To hell with that, im here to enjoy myself with cute character, so i dont even need a good story! With that only reason, i hold myself to watch this until its end. The end, still the same conclusion from the first arc. I must say here, all thing happen from 4 until 9 episodes as a filler. No good for the story development, only to make the season filled to the normal 12 episodes, which is a shame from me. I find that strategy to be nice, only to making me another full of laughing. Why that shit happen?I can take that shit goes to the garbage, but i still have a pride. I know the risk, so i must return all the cost. 5 point for that amusing part of the story section. Okay, in this paragraph, i keep my review short, to the point what i dislike, and ofc, to the characterization. As i stated before, referring the half season only a filler with nonsense to the main plot, all the character development become dull too.What is they try to accomplish while their side character become a dumb doll? Nothing. Only their duo MC shines leaving every nonetheless supporting chara. Im crying, i dont even get a good linking between all of their character. All like puppet show within the brain, no personality, no great impact for the feeling. With only 12 episodes, 4 arcs with leading to the main plot only its beginning and ending, and 2 fan-services episodes, their character can not great me well. I may enjoy the 2 fan-services, but for the character development? Nothing, i won't leaving that excuse onto another excuse.As an amazing show, the character must flow into more human. In this show, they turn into no human. Heck, they half were dragon, but thats not my point. What i try to explain was their behaviour, their interaction, their past moment. And i found all of that in the bad level, even as a horrible one. Sad think happen to the conflicting idea too, that shit never get in to the show. They fail that again, so no progressment for the character development too, right? Ok, this is enough. I now feels bad with my decision, like my other bad show i ever watch in this year. But, its nice to seeing this series. Im glad, the story was exist in that past year. So, for my gratitude, i may not take this show lower than 5 (as this stated as a character section first). Then, what is the real score for this whole series? Lets continue for the next part.Art, sound, and music part were really only a strength for this show. Their great ED and OP OST greet me with most satisfying lyric and tone. Its all relaxing, and blowing my mind into the next level. I must say the music had an easy-going mode to make everything as simple as possible. Unfortunately, their story become too simple, which is make these as a lame show. Too bad, they fail to accomplish the music element into an amazing show. But, the show must go on, time never back to its greatness. Instead of raging, i make this section as my reason. Their decision for filling the male MC with Hiro sounds and the female MC with Rie not bad at all. I found that thing as an excuse too. If only their character not become too dull, i may greet this show more points than my thought now, if only....Okay, thats it all. To completely saying the score at the clearly coast, here my list through all of my rant:Story: 5Thats because i feel the story really a bad joke. No nice action, generic main story, dull and boring progression, no great conflict affecting the whole, and else. 5 point must be to big for my level of enjoyment.Art, sound, music: its 9. This only can give a proud judgement.Character : 5. As a dull character, why i give more than five?Enjoyment: i somehow had such a big hope for this. But, that thing only made a big hole onto my heart. 5 point only to make heart healing for that misery.As an overall, 5 point shall be good. But, since i kinda like the music, which is abit relaxing and easy-going, i may give a nice score too. Be proud of them, so my final really get high at high rate. To that point, my 6 overall can be my final judgement, only for my gratitude to all of the hotties appear here (yes, usually you, my Eriko). As my final word, i make a suggestions, if you enjoy such a lame drama melancholy with a little romanctic issue as an excuse, you can watch this show. Otherwise, or you just be an elitist with so much high level reasonal hating point, this show can be reveal as your nightmare only.Moving out. at my view, i found every episodes not quite fit in each arcs.

Also Dragon Crisis is such a misleading title it is not even funny, when you find out what it is referring to you just facepalm and go WAT.In any case if anything gets you to...watch this it would be the character design of Rose (Kugumiyas character) because those eyes and that soft blonde hair with little detail other than the silhouette is just... pretty good I must say, lights up the scene when it is present.The main problem in this show is that nothing is adequately explained: what are lost precious, why are red dragons so important, what is the society really, what, where, who, why,  oh and the show goes in a loop.In the end this is filler candy that could use another season, something to just watch because there is nothing else, but not really savor. watch this it would be the character design of Rose (Kugumiyas character) because those eyes and that soft blonde hair with little detail other than the silhouette is just... pretty good I must say, lights up the scene when it is present.The main problem in this show is that nothing is adequately explained: what are lost precious, why are red dragons so important, what is the society really, what, where, who, why,  oh and the show goes in a loop.In the end this is filler candy that could use another season, something to just watch because there is nothing else, but not really savor.', ""A story about a dragon girl that falls in love with the boy. It's kind of basic and everything feels sort of similar. I felt I needed to touch up on a few things. I actually enjoyed it very much. If you're looking for something to be like Bleach or Naruto in this aspect you came to the wrong place. This anime is only 12 episodes long, but is decent enough to enjoy watching it. Why?The story is pretty good. It could of been a lot better if it  summed up a good amount of the things going on. Which is why I gave...it the lowest score of the categories. The story is there, and its probably in the light novels. What I will say is this, if you enjoy action/comedy type anime it's definitely worth it.The art to me is fantastic. On par with some of the other stuff out there. Visually appealing to the eyes.The sound is great. I gave this the highest because the music is INCREDIBLE from this anime. The OST alone is worth it if you can find it. The voice acting is great as well. I can sit here and enjoy writing this review while just listening to the OST.Character stories definitely could of used a lot of time to work on. I'm not going to complain though because it got the basic point across.Overall, I think this show is worth watching at least one time through. I love action/comedy genre the most. My enjoyment and my laughing moments were definitely worth the time I spent watching it. My rewatch value on this is actually pretty high.

So for audio it is not the best but okayThe character designs are pretty good actually although the character design of Rose and Sapphi arevery Kiddish indeed the only character design that caught my eye was Maruga's design, it was structured exactly the way it would be according to her personality, the other characters are fine, I even liked AI's Character designMy overall Score would be a 7/10, and it is a good anime if anyone loves dragons and a little bit of action but don't expect it to be really exciting like High School DXD, but then again its good the Rose, but then another main character Rjuyi who is the first human to ever engage(you'll find out later what this word means in the anime) with a dragon and that dragon was Rose, so pretty much the story begins when Rose and Ryuji meet up for the first time and then the adventures they have together with Ryuji's Cousin sister Eriko, Later on in the anime you will find more supporting characters being added.The quality of the anime is okay, I have watched this in 720P Ful Blu-Ray rip and it's good, but don't expect a high load of graphics from it, there are at times i wish it could have been better but it is not something that would be un-watchableNext coming onto the Audio, the audio balance is pretty much lacking actually, the audio decoding system i used was FLAC (Which means that there is very less audio loss, and the bit-rate is exteremly good) but when it is with the anime i feel there is no difference, the theme song is pretty good but i got fed up of it after watching it for 2-3 times and the ending song is okayish as well(my opinions BTW) the soundtracks put in the middle of the anime are good as well but may not make the scene look very exciting actually.

It wasn\'t rushed, but it wasn\'t too slow. Each episode has something new waiting for u. The reason I gave it an 8 was in my opinion, some parts were just a bit boring for me.Art: 10/10Outstanding art quality, vibrant colors and smooth animation. That\'s probably all.Sound: 6/10This had the lowest score in this review and let me explain why.The OP was the one that let it down the most, because it was very random for this type of anime. I would\'ve liked a much more happy OP, this anime is mostly comedy and action. The soundtrack isn\'t that bad, but it can get random sometimes. And at last, the ED of this anime. First thing that comes in your mind after hearing it is, ""what the serious fuck?""I skip the OP and ED part though most of the times in anime, so the OP and ED doesn\'t really matter for me unless it\'s really good.Character: 7/10Kisaragi Ryuji, or let\'s just call him Ryuji like everyone does in the anime, is dense when it comes to love. If you realize a girl is very nervous when she\'s around you, then most definitely, she has a crush on you. He\'s not that dense though like Ichika from Infinite Stratos. But personality aside, is he smart? Above average. Is he strong? Pretty strong, if he\'s with Rose.Not a lot of character development, which doesn\'t really matter. I just wanted to see Ryuuji\'s parents, they need more screen time.I swear, half of Ryuuji\'s screen time is him being depressed.Enjoyment: 10/10As I said, this show will keep you on your seat wanting for more. I watched the whole thing in just 1 day. Comedy? Awesome. Romance + Comedy? Pretty awesome. Harem + Romance + Comedy? Fucking awesome.If you\'re looking for another title that is comedic and has an above average story, watch this.Overall: 8/10Re-watch value: Sure but in the future, most definitely.ps: there is a subtle spiderman reference in one of the episodes, look for it!hint: it\'s in episode 7 I\'d like to keep this short, no spoilers and give you a reason WHY I love this anime.Story: 8/10The story enough made me sit through the whole thing, sometimes laughing, sometimes made me think of how stupid this character is or how annoying that character is, or sometimes just sitting, watching the anime to see what happens next.

Enter Ryuuji (not to be confused with Yuuji in SnS) who happens to get a pet dragon (insta girl/dragon-friend), and gets caught in the middle of double trouble: a marriage dispute between dragons (her pet Rose already has a forced fiancee) and the human\'s standoff against dragons (dragons and humans don\'t mix well, humans always taking dragon\'s possessions (called lost precious) for their magical abilities).The series is a tiny bit harem...(one guy lots of dragon-girls and other not-so-normal girls), a slight bit of drama, and a fair amount of action. The major failing of this series is its lackluster story line and complete failure in developing the primary characters.If you just happen to need a bit of Rie Kugimiya, look elsewhere, as this show really isn\'t worth your time. If you\'re still adamant about reading more, then feel free to read on.Animation:The animation quality is fairly good here. Expect decent crispness and fair character design. The characters are a bit plain compared to other series but for some reason I happened to take a liking to wolf girl. In any case, there are quite a few fight scenes with huge amounts of destruction, and these are done fairly well but not brilliantly. There is some CG usage but I didn\'t find it too distracting. If anything, this show should get some praise for having very detailed backgrounds, though colors in general are a bit washed at times; if only they spent the same level of detail on the characters.There isn\'t terribly much ecchi stuff here, Ryuuji only ends up with his face under a girl\'s dress once if I recall correctly. Finally, I wish they\'d start drawing lead male characters a bit more maturely, I almost thought Ryuuji was a girl at the very beginning.Sound:The OP, by Yui Horie, is a catchy involved tune that fits well with some of the latter action-oriented episodes. The ED is a bit more ""fun"" but less of an organized tune so I ended up skipping it. The BGM is a bit unique with one very electronic-saw based tune that you\'ll start to hear repeatedly. As for VAs, despite some really high-powered VAs, I think more props go to the lesser known VAs (Yui Horie is relegated to a minor supporting character and Rie Kugumiya\'s brilliance is reduced to pretty much nothing as Rose doesn\'t get all that many lines, just a lot of ""Ryuuji, Ryuuji, Ryuuji!""). Yuka Inokuchi, for one, is a relative new-comer who voices wolf girl, she gives her a bit of a unique, slightly-rough but still feminine voice, a pretty good job.Story:This is where it all falls apart. While there are quite a few sub plots concurrently being explored here, the elements are only loosely tied together and many plot holes abound and haunt the series right through the open-ended conclusion. As this show uses a very over-used plot sequence, you\'re going to be able to guess basically every twist coming, and thus won\'t be terribly surprised or entertained. Furthermore, some of the decisions that the characters make just don\'t make sense from my point of view, decide for yourself but be warned.Character:For a series with Rie Kugumiya, I expected a lot more. Not only was her character fairly mute for half the series, but you really never get a sense of what\'s going on in her head, thus leading to some very confusing decisions. The only ""development"" is the fact that she can ""sync"" with Ryuuji in a very un-orriginal way (think synchro from Kurokami, in fact even the sequence looks similar) this time called ""engage"", powering up Ryuuji\'s pitiful looking dagger. In fact, I think the only decent piece of development in this entire series was the wolf girl arc (eps 6-7).As mentioned earlier, this is a ""bit"" of a harem series as pretty much all the secondary female characters develop some feelings for Ryuuji, and other than for the wolf arc, it isn\'t terribly convincing.Value:My main problem is probably that I came into this series thinking ""Rie Kugumiya"" and thus having fairly high expectations, which were clearly not met. It\'s a sub-par watch compared to some competing series in the same season. If you really don\'t have many expectations and just have time to kill, or if you\'re dying to meet wolf girl, give this a shot.

This anime had a really strong romance, love, relationship vibe to and I'm a sucker for those types of things but anyway, without further ado let's get right into it.**There are some spoilers in the story section, if you haven't yet watched this anime, skip to the Art section.**Story - 8/10The story begins with a teenager by the name of Ryuuji Kisaragi, he's just a plain simple teen who goes to school but his life changes dramatically when his second cousin Eriko Nanao sort of takes out of his School class...and rushes him off to a port where smugglers are transporting an unknown package.After a couple of scenes, both Ryuuji and Eriko try to steal this unknown package which they manage successfully however as they were escaping from the port and bullets start flying, one of those bullets hit the mysterious briefcase and destroys the locking mechanism, and out comes a red dragon girl who instantly forms a connection with Ryuuji and defends the van from the mercenaries. As the story goes on the connection between Ryuuji and the newly named red dragon Rose become's stronger. However, they are both attacked by Onyx who is part of the black dragon organization who tries to kidnap Rose of which he successfully does. Ryuuji however only just met Rose and he starts to show some strong emotions towards Rose, so they go on a rescue mission. After being successful, Ryuuji now must use his power as a relic handler to protect Rose from anyone who wants's to either take her or kill her.From then on, Ryuuji's world changes, and the story starts to unravel into a lovely tale of love, friendships, romance, relationships, and also some heartbreaks.I highly recommend you watch this if you're a fan of those genres I listed above.Art - 9/10There is no question about it, the Art in this anime was truly well done. It was beautiful to look at and the art team truly took their time to make a scene look great. It didn't feel like it was rushed in any way. They put love and passion into every scene that was shown.Sound - 9/10The sound included in this anime was again really well done. In some certain scenes, the music complements the action and romantic scenes perfectly. I also loved the opening and ending songs and humming along with them, not like I can sing Japanese.Character - 10/10This was no doubt an easy rating to give, I love all the character designs and how they were portrayed. I especially loved the character design of Ai, she is, without doubt, my #1 favorite character of the series.Enjoyment - 9/10I truly enjoyed this anime, it was a fun-filled action-packed romance and I'm a sucker for those type of things.Of course with all anime's it was a slow beginning but if you watch 2-3 episodes I would probably want to carry on, but don't take my word for it, go watch it yourself!Overall - 9/10This anime was great and for just a short series it was worth the watch. It really takes you on an interesting journey of love, romance, friendships, and relationships. I would give this a 10 but I just feel a 9 is more appropriate but that doesn't mean it's bad, not in any way!Anyway, that just about sums up my review on 'Dragon Crisis', if you read this far, thank you so much!

I think that seeing as they only had 12 episodes to work with they did an interesting job of things. It could have been a great hit if they had gave it more episodes to spread out the story details better.Please give a shot with this in mind and i think you'll agree with me, if not.... my bad. XDWell it grabbed my attention enough to start reading the manga it's from; starting from the beginning of course. "", ""Chilling anime, I would tell moar, because story is too short, but this is enough.Really well made ecchi themes.Sound was also great.Art: Not bad, there was some mistakes, but this is still enough.Story isn't very flat, but flat. Without super powers that anime probably would be nothing.I enjoyed this anime and I recommend this to others. "", 'Dragon Crisis! had originally been a light novel before it was adopted into an anime. Because of the twelve-episode constraint, the story moves fairly quickly, which some find inconvenient. I, for one, appreciate the lack of filler episodes and the introduction of important characters in every arc. My problem, however, lies with the introduction of terms specific to this show, or lack thereof. In order to explain this better, let me tell you the synopsis.A high school boy, named Kisaragi Ryuuji, dreams of a girl calling his name. After he wakes up and goes to school as usual, his second cousin, Nanao Eriko, who just...returned from America, comes at exactly 12 o\'clock and literally drags Ryuuji to her car. This is where the story gets complicated. It is then mentioned how they are both ""Breakers,"" and Eriko searches for ""Lost Preciouses,"" but wants to have the ""society\'s"" approval for her website, called ""Seven Tails."" If what I just said seemed vague, it is due to the fact that these words are never elaborated upon in the anime. You get what you get. Usually, in order to avoid this problem, series bring a character (sometimes the lead himself/herself, but this one already knows about everything) into the mix that does not know anything. Sadly, this anime does not, and it is not due to them  lacking, no, there are people who fit the description; three, actually. They are the protagonist\'s unsuspecting classmates, who appear quite often, yet are annoyingly left in the dark. However, unlike (at least) one of the other reviewers, I am not going to bash the show just because of this small technicality; it just means I have to be that much smarter, and hopefully they will talk more about this in future episodes.Since I left what makes up the title, I feel like I should continue on with the synopsis. So the second cousin, Eriko, says they are going to take a ""Lost Precious"" from ""Fang"" (same problem as above), who are apparently dangerous people. Somehow, the two succeed, and it turns out that what they really stole is a red dragon, something even more rare than an ""S class"" (again, you figure out the ranking yourself) Lost Precious, who can only say ""Ryuuji,"" but in time she learns to talk, albeit in a weak, naïve manner. From what I could gather, a Breaker is a strong person. There are only one-hundred Breakers in the world, including Nanao Eriko, who is a level 7; Kisaragi Ryuuji, who is a level 10 (higher); and George (appears later), who is also a level 10. There are eight level 10 breakers, making Ryuuji special. As you might guess, and as shown in the opening sequence, there are other dragons that appear throughout Dragon Crisis!Speaking of the opening, it is a nice, exciting, thrilling piece portraying the important characters in the series. The English/Japanese lyrics are also wonderful, having a ring to them, with one part going ""I cannot stop because I want/need/love you"" multiple times, and another going ""love is a lawless fight. . ."" (in Japanese)The ending sequence opens with Seven Tails Theater, and shows most of the cast in chibi form after displaying pictures of the female leads at the beach in their swimsuits. The song is cute, I guess, not exactly the somber, serious, calm kind an ED quintessentially has, which I prefer.One of Dragon Crisis!\'s strong points is the art, which is great and fluid. I could live with cute girls having wings on their backs, but I am really disgusted with the wolf-girl that appears later, known as ""Odd Eye"" (her master calls her Ai, I believe), referring to her different-colored eyes, another not-so-charming trait she has, as I am not fond of this character type.Of the other character types I dislike is the calm girl who barely talks and/or smiles (e.g., Sugai Hinata from Amaenaideyo!!, Kiyoura Setsuna from School Days, and Teresa Berea from Seikon no Qwaser); thankfully, Dragon Crisis! does not have that, apart from an underling for the main villain, Onyx, called Kai. All of the other characters are cheerful, upbeat, classy, clumsy, or serious. The main lead is a nice, quiet guy who is completely oblivious to the feelings of his shy classmate, Etou. Kisaragi had a bad experience with a Cursed Precious in the past, making him afraid to use a Lost Precious again. Nanao Eriko is a cunning, smart girl, who knows how to have her way. The red dragon, later named Rose due to the scales on her hand, is like an innocent little girl, who is fascinated with Ryuuji for initially unknown reasons.Overall, this a wonderful anime which you would be missing out by not seeing. If you like filler-less fast-paced action, with a hint of romance, comedy, and drama, combined with great artwork and sexy girls, then this show is for you. returned from America, comes at exactly 12 o\'clock and literally drags Ryuuji to her car.

It stars Ryuuji, an everyday perfectly normal high school boy who\'s also one of the world\'s greatest magical artifact users and managed to single-handedly reverse several centuries of deteriorating dragon/human political relationships purely by virtue of being a Very Good Boy. Together with his crack team of anime woman stereotypes, he navigates the deadly, cutthroat world of black budget magical relic hunting, only to discover that the world of relationships... just might be a little bit tougher.*canned laughter, theme song plays*There is basically nothing original on...display. A lot of big talk is made about dragons basically being evil and everybody hating them, despite the fact that A: the show\'s definition of ""dragon"" almost exclusively boils down to ""cute anime girl, but she can grow wings and junk,"" and B: practically none of the dragons shown seem to have any issue whatsoever interacting with people, and vice versa. The show\'s magic system isn\'t any more complex than ""here\'s a doodad that lets you shoot wind bullets and stuff."" Not even the relationships are fleshed out; Rose\'s cutesy insistence that she loves Ryuuji is taken as basically canon from femtosecond one, and the other members of Ryuuji\'s ""harem"" hover around him for seemingly no other reason than that he is the protagonist of an anime, and also a Very Good Boy.Oh, and did we mention he\'s a high school student? That\'s *very* important to his character. They spend literal *minutes* delving into Ryuuji\'s school life. He has friends there. They contribute to the plot. Really.I struggle to find an avenue by which this show is meant to appeal. Am I supposed to want to know more about the world, why dragons all seem to be anime YA protagonists instead of... you know, dragons? Am I supposed to like the five minutes of fight scenes, where a collection of characters with generic pretty light attacks fart around until Ryuuji and Rose bust out the canned animation ""we can do this because we love each other"" maneuver? Am I supposed to enjoy the blistering comedy that happens when a bunch of women flagrantly violate the personal space and boundaries of a Very Good Boy? It shall forever remain a mystery.In short, Dragon Crisis is the anime equivalent of a junk drawer.

Eureka Seven AO: One More Time - Lord Don't Slow Me Down,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34776/Eureka_Seven_AO__One_More_Time_-_Lord_Dont_Slow_Me_Down,"[""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS from the second paragraph on.This Mini ONA Series adds up to the running time of a regular TV episode. It's a remake of the last 2 minutes of the Eureka Seven TV series. Titulated as the Final episode it's literally that and docks onto the last TV episode quite seamlessly. It heavily refers to the prequel TV show so be warned that watching it as a standalone will in all likelihood not make much sense at all. It was created as a promotion to an Eureka Seven AO pachinko game, but that has nothing to do with the episode contents at...all.This remake deals with Ao's fate after he shot the Quartz Gun the third time thus saving his mother the fate of wandering around aimlessly in Space-Time, but ends up having to do the same himself instead. The Tv Version only showed how it started and when the journey ended. This ONA explores what he went through on that lonely journey with only Truth for company and nobody remembering him in this new timeline even when he has the chance to see people he knew alive. As he drops around in time, he takes the chance to change a couple of things in the history of his former comrades. Which in turn forges some new connections to them, who -also at the behest of Eureka- set out to free him from the journey. As in the TV Version it ends again with Ao and Truth going seperate ways and Ao flying back down to earth.Visually this ONA is pretty outstanding and in no way worse than the TV show. It does a really good job in depicting Ao's character under the circumstances, from boredom, mild frustration, depression and borderline despair in it's first segments to the huge relief and emotional salvation in the last segment's final scene. Ao does get a genuine happy ending this time. Despite this being mostly a character episode for Ao in his loneliness, it's regularly spiced up with some humourous scenes inbetween. The other characters from his days in Pied Piper and Naru all get more or less screentime and there is some pretty good looking mecha action as well. Nirvash Neo/Truth even gets a dedicated new revamped design facelift for this ONA.Despite maintaining the basic happenings, there are some changed details to the original TV shows's last two minutes, which makes this ONA a slightly retconned remake. all.This remake deals with Ao's fate after he shot the Quartz Gun the third time thus saving his mother the fate of wandering around aimlessly in Space-Time, but ends up having to do the same himself instead.

Fireball,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4362/Fireball,"[""Another new and short CGI anime from past year.But this time, it's done by Disney, yes, Disney.Fireball excists out of 13 episodes between, roughly said, 1 and 3 minutes.The story's no big deal, since there's none.. no.. really. On the back-back-background there is on, some war between Mankind and Robots, or something of the sort. The &quot;story's&quot; that happen in the episodes is a different story, it starts the same everytime, but it develops to some random conversation ending or monkey sounds. Which is pretty fair, since it's hilarious.The art is very good, I like it, the Robots are done great and the animation is...a bit stiff (it's supposed to be stiff) but good. Nothing to say here really, for a short like this, it's great.The sounds great to, besides the &quot;stop-motion&quot; conversation parts, the voice-actors do a great job, and so does the monkey. All sounds are done carefully, but good.The characters are the highlight of this series, the robot who's name isn't important (Ged&auml;chtenis) and none other than Drossel von Fl&uuml;gel, apart from the names (that makes sense if you know these characters), they are unique. The &quot;stop-motion&quot; way Drossel lives is at least unique, but hilarious, she does randoms poses every two seconds, if not every second. Ged&auml;chtenis is a smart robot, but probably a bit frightened of his master. Then as last, the funky monkey which delivers some problems in episodes and scares the main characters with loud screeches, he .. or she.. is done brilliantly as a background character.This is a good-to-highly-enjoyable series for a quick fix of anime, if you need it. It's not really a recommendation, but you just have to see this. The overall rating brings the score back to an 7,8 which I'll round off to an 8. Which, is my personal score too. a bit stiff (it's supposed to be stiff) but good. Nothing to say here really, for a short like this, it's great.The sounds great to, besides the &quot;stop-motion&quot; conversation parts, the voice-actors do a great job, and so does the monkey. All sounds are done carefully, but good.The characters are the highlight of this series, the robot who's name isn't important (Ged&auml;chtenis) and none other than Drossel von Fl&uuml;gel, apart from the names (that makes sense if you know these characters), they are unique. The &quot;stop-motion&quot; way Drossel lives is at least unique, but hilarious, she does randoms poses every two seconds, if not every second. Ged&auml;chtenis is a smart robot, but probably a bit frightened of his master. Then as last, the funky monkey which delivers some problems in episodes and scares the main characters with loud screeches, he .. or she.. is done brilliantly as a background character.This is a good-to-highly-enjoyable series for a quick fix of anime, if you need it.

God Eater Prologue,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10470/God_Eater_Prologue,"['For a 12 minute episode, it doesn’t really say that much about the story. Keep in mind, that this is a prologue for the videogame “God Eater.”The events of this story takes place six years before God Eater. The year is 2065 and three members from the Fenrir Far East Branch, an elite military task force that was sent to a strategic command base to assist troops in guiding an Aragami Colony towards a nuclear fusion reactor in which would be detonated to wipe them all out, but the story mentions some things to take note of.Throughout this prologue, you’ll meet three characters, Soma, Lindow,...and Tsubaki. For those who are watching this for the first time, you’ll only get to learn about two of the main character’s name, Soma and Lindow. You don’t get to learn too much about these characters except that each of them is capable of doing the work of an entire battalion and that they wield these “divine weapons” that can kill mysterious monsters known as Aragami. Upon watching the episode, you’ll find out that Soma is the son of Director Schicksal and that it’s his first mission. However, even though we don’t learn anything about Tsubaki, like her name, we do see some similar physical characteristics between her and Lindow, leaving you to guess if they’re related somehow.There’s no opening or ending theme song for this, the Japanese acting seemed to be fine, and the art looked almost plain, but I didn’t really mind it.Overall, this episode somewhat provides a backstory for Soma, but it doesn’t reveal too much detail about the other main characters or the story. What this prologue fails to do is make us feel emotionally invested about the rest of the characters and the storyline and makes this episode feel like another senseless fighting scene. For newcomers watching this, you may have many questions unanswered such as, who is Lindow and the other female member, where did these Aragami creatures come from, and why are they such a threat? For those who never played the game, you may be confused on what was the point of this episode, but it’s supposed to set up for the game and upcoming anime, that takes place in the year 2071, God Eater. and Tsubaki.

Hi no Tori: Eden no Sora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53720/Hi_no_Tori__Eden_no_Sora,"[""Talking about bad adaptation, I guess most of us already know about the live-action “Dragon Ball Evolution” or the second season of “The Promised Neverland”. Welp, unfortunately, it just happened to be the same case for this Anime. I didn’t have much expectation when seeing the trailer but this is just too much to deal with. Calling this abomination a trainwreck is even an understatement.The disaster inherently stems from the concept in the first place. Let’s imagine, if allowing Anime to be aired on Netflix through batch release is considered a crime, then allowing the masterpiece “Hi no Tori” to be directed by an incompetent...person and exclusively aired on Disney+ is unquestionably an atrocious sin that must never be tolerated. Whoever came up with this idea has made the worst decision in their life.You may already know or maybe not but the prototype of this one - “Nostalgia” is deemed one of the greatest arcs in the Manga, along with “Karma” and “Resurrection”. Harsh, raw, dramatic, high-stakes, psychologically heavy, these characteristics are what made the original highly regarded. It doesn’t shun bringing controversial subjects like incest, homicide, cannibalism for its thematic exploration. Yet sadly, none of those traits are presented in this adaptation. Instead of getting something deep and mature, we’ve got a light-hearted, shallow, frivolous, child-friendly story that is safe to watch in your living room with your niece or nephew.The over-modification to befit the medium is repugnant to the point no trace of the source can be found. I really really do wonder if that director actually read the work himself. Almost every setting and world-building was altered. Characters should appear never appear, characters shouldn’t appear appear. The details should exist never exist, the details shouldn’t exist exist. The character should be dead somehow alive. What a heinous joke, I can’t remember how many times I shook my head while watching this.Man, if only it had at least one saving grace. The characterization is even more cringeworthy and the theme of homesickness is portrayed in the most superficial way possible. In the work, Romy is depicted as a strong, determined, independent, decisive woman. Her struggle for survival and to carry the weight of being the only woman on the planet Eden, seeing her husband and her offspring gradually pass away causes great damage to her mind. It’s the trauma that begets an immeasurable pain of fear, loneliness, despair, and thus, leads to her strong feeling of nostalgia. The sincerity and earnestness make us sympathize with her and her story. So what do we have in the Anime? A weak, naive, happy-go-lucky mother who sleeps most of the time until her descendants wake her up because the show has to avoid incest which is not suitable for kids. Then she stays as the queen for 40 years, the motivation for her homesickness only boils down to her boredom. I’m crying hard for its cheap sentiment not gonna lie. In addition, her journey returning to Earth later is also a mess. The Manga provides us with an arduous voyage that’s full of terror and danger, a dark and vast universe as though depicted in Lovecraftian horror. Upon reading this part, I could feel every fiber of my body getting goosebumps. Alas, just like other elements, what is presented in this Anime hardly can’t be taken seriously.It's all I want to talk about. Sorry if it feels like a rant but I’m not only madly disappointed but also irritated by this disgraceful piece of crap. If you feel tired of mainstream Anime and currently are seeking a new experience then it might not be a bad watch. However, if you’re a Manga fan or merely someone who loves to see something profound, intellectual, impactful, thought-provoking then I genuinely advise you to stay away from it at all costs. person and exclusively aired on Disney+ is unquestionably an atrocious sin that must never be tolerated.

Apparently, they also plan to release a movie version of this with an alternative ending, so I'm looking forward to seeing how that turns out.Although I liked the visuals, the background art was beautiful, and the character designs successfully captured the essence of the old animations.I would still recommend watching this, not only for its beauty but also because the story revolves around themes of loneliness, pain, suffering, and the journey towards hope.

There should be no spoilers in this review.I genuinely don\'t know how I feel about this film. I don\'t know much about the source material, but I can say that I left the theater somewhat confused on the overall meaning that was meant to be conveyed. I have no clear indication of what the general message of the film was, other than a critique of the human condition and that greed is a vice that will consume all. I say this very loosely, only because that is the only non-weird conclusion...that I can come to about this film.The film also suffers from pacing issues, as well as several themes feeling like they were shoehorned in for ""emotional impact"" but their presence in the film feels tacked on rather than incorporated into the story. There were several potentially interesting themes and events introduced that could have easily been expanded on to create a deeper sense of connection with the characters, but these all fall flat in how a lot of them fail to resolve, and a glaringly important event abruptly begins and resolves completely without the interference of the main cast. A questionable decision to take this facet of the story and neglect to elaborate on it, to be honest.I especially had mixed emotions when coming to terms with the general events that happened and the sequence they were happening in. A lot of the events in the story really felt like they were placed in there simply to solidify a fact as it happened, rather than feeling like the characters were experiencing their own lives. It felt like they were only placed in some of the scenarios they were in not because we\'re expecting them to learn about their situation, or about themselves, but rather they needed to be there or else the story wouldn\'t progress. It felt like a very linear and almost 3rd-person approach to storytelling that makes emotional impact fall flat because there are no emotional ties tying them to their quest to keep living and deal with their struggles.At the very least, I can admit that I am very interested in reading the source material, as this is my introduction to the series. It does a great job at making you want to see what the emotional depth was meant to feel like. I genuinely want to know more about the world, and as a person that adores the sci-fi genre I can easily say that I will make a conscious effort to find a means to experience the source material! that I can come to about this film.The film also suffers from pacing issues, as well as several themes feeling like they were shoehorned in for ""emotional impact"" but their presence in the film feels tacked on rather than incorporated into the story.

The show seems to be 5% zombies, 95% cleavage, and this time around, it was 95% cleavage, 5% unusual sex situations.I mean, I guess I enjoyed it... but there is no story line anywhere in this OVA.Okay, so technically there was a story line, but it's somewhat difficult to extract.The odd thing is that if I tell you the story line, I spoil the OVA.Well, I'll try.Story- 1Yes, I gave it a one.The group comes to an island where they're supposedly safe from the zombies.. typical, right?

Nobody changes, and there's really nothing to differentiate any of the females from one another.

Sure, why not.Story - 2Does this OVA continue the open ended story of...the series? Nope.Is it relevant to the plot ? Nah.Is it worth watching at all? Well, its only sixteen minutes long, so you may as well.Its all lighthearted and there are some jokes, but i feel as if the 'secluded island+zombies' setup coudve been used for something cool and it wasnt.

How OVA?99.9% ecchi(Mixed with HENTAI[It can\'t be even said, that it\'s ecchi.]!), 00.1% story and 0% zombie killing?*facepalm*Overall - 4If you search for a GREAT OVA with zombie killing... Don\'t even come here.If you search for more story in this OVA... Also don\'t try to come.BUT... If you are a sick pervert, which can\'t even stand a second without seeing breasts, then this is something for you.However I\'m not one of them.What\'s next?

Yeah I said it! Well almost but all jokes aside I really enjoyed H.O.T.D. I am intrigued with the idea of a zombie apocolypse but this OVA did nothing for the anime. It might have even knocked it down a peg.Lets face it, H.O.T.D has alot of zombies and blood but if anything else it has more breasts out and about. This OVA was just on the border of almost being porn. There were so much cleavage I was almost a tad bit uncomfortable. The whole episode was nothing but a dedication to fanservice. There's nothing wrong with that but I...was hoping the OVA would should shed some light on what happened after the last episode.I dont mind fanservice occasionally but this was a bit much for me. I love H.O.T.D, so being a fan I watched this. If your a fan and you got time to kill, go ahead and watch this episode. If you love fanservice, you will love this OVA. Everyone else, flip a coin. was hoping the OVA would should shed some light on what happened after the last episode.I dont mind fanservice occasionally but this was a bit much for me.

This is the proof that even with glorious girls and a lot of ""almost-raping-you ecchi"" an OVA can bore you to tears.If the level of fan service in the series is too much (yes, I think that there can be too much fan service in a series), in this it is ridiculous. Far from being funny or getting anyone (over the age of 18) horny, the over-exploitation of sexuality in the ways used here is so unrealistic and immature that borders the vulgar and grotesque, plus the depth of every character was was sent to oblivion, making them no more than ""porn...stars"".I\'d recommend it for boys (or girls, who knows...) that would gladly sacrifice an entertaining/interesting story for tons of big breasts and second-to-third bases.Sincerely, the funniest part of Drifters of the Dead was (SPOILER) when Kohta was humping the broom like there was no tomorrow (END OF SPOILER). stars"".I\'d recommend it for boys (or girls, who knows...) that would gladly sacrifice an entertaining/interesting story for tons of big breasts and second-to-third bases.Sincerely, the funniest part of Drifters of the Dead was (SPOILER) when Kohta was humping the broom like there was no tomorrow (END OF SPOILER).', ""A calm episode without zombies in wich HotD crew spends a day on the small island's beach.

It's pure and silly ecchi breast action involving all female main characters halucinating, but it's not even interesting.The only reason I could think of that somebody could watch this OVA is for seeing Miss Shizuka's nipples. :] Fortunately it's short and there's only one episode so I didn't have to watch more of this kind of OVA's to...check if the story will evolve in any way. check if the story will evolve in any way."", ""This OVA is definitely made for people that enjoyed Highschool of the Dead, which I can definitely say I did. This is one of my favourite anime series (I originally watched the entire thing and the OVA in one sitting because I literally couldn't stop) and rewatching the OVA now that the English dub has finally been released really reminded me of why I love this series and this little extra snippet we got.Whilst this OVA doesn't necessarily have much of a storyline, and definitely doesn't continue the story from the original series, it does a great justice as a comedy short. It's 15 minutes...long, what were you expecting? Fulfilling everyone's favourite cliché of the beach episode, we see our protagonists go on what is frankly a hilarious adventure in the sand. It's silly and ridiculous, but it's fun. Exactly the sort of fun that made the original series great.The consistently good art of the original also continues here, seeing the protagonists in brand new beachwear (some pretty fabulously tight fitting beachwear too, I might add), with some really nice background art of the beach to go alongside it. It's just generally really nice to look at, especially in certain shots (I'm talking about the boob close ups). The ecchi in general is really high quality, which is pretty much what anyone watching a Highschool of the Dead OVA is after, let's face it.The voice acting in this OVA is fantastic too, both in the Japanese and English dub. It portrays the humour well and keeps everything light, the English dub especially. There's funny references, good portrayal of the emotions, and you can almost feel that they had fun saying these ridiculous lines. It all just brings a smile to your face.In fact everything about this is, frankly, exactly what I wanted from an OVA of this series. Yeah, there's not really any zombies, but who the fuck was watching the original for zombies? Go out and watch this OVA, have fun. But please, remember your tissues. No-one wants to have to clean that up off the carpet. long, what were you expecting?

However, in protest of this arbitrary rule, Highschool of the dead: drifters of the dead has reached the pinnacle of anime, no, art itself.

'Well the HOTD is my first ecchi anime to watch, and it happens to be one of those anime that is actually very enjoyable, even if the boobs of the women, are massive, and jiggle more than jello.   But this review is just for this OVA.There is no need to write anything long or fancy for this, because the episode is straight forward.  Basically, this episode is about how the gang arrived at an island and had a wild and crazy night due to ""something"" in the air.  There is no real plot to it and it is all about just...showing more heavy breasts and very soft core sensual scenes.  That\'s it, nothing more nothing less.   So, if you want more HOTD plot, then don\'t expect much.  If you want more HOTD fanservice, then bon appetite. showing more heavy breasts and very soft core sensual scenes.

But the coloring is good, for the most part.Sound: Sound was ok, the best part of this ova imo is the ED. The OP doesn\'t fit in the progression in this OVA. Voice acting was ok for the most part, but the narrator at the front sounds a bit strange. I thought it would be the main male lead\'s (normal) voice.Character: For the most part, they stayed true to...their original character traits.

Yes!But, as with all apocalypse (death by zombie) genres, I have yet to see a good series that has a well established beginning (character establishment during the 'event' and the creation of the 'new' reality), a solid middle (development of the cause and effect and further...character development and interaction) and an end (where either the human's triumph, face their ultimate extinction or unknown future) without defaulting to 'deus ex machina'.HSOTD started out well, establishing that this was a human extinction event - a global event of unknown origin and 'fleshing' out the characters so to speak (Love Saeko!).But, this episode was a miserable attempt at maintaining interest in the series.I have bought the DVD of the series and the graphic novel as well for my library.Lowering my review accordingly.This Episode, Overall: Poor character development and interaction) and an end (where either the human's triumph, face their ultimate extinction or unknown future) without defaulting to 'deus ex machina'.HSOTD started out well, establishing that this was a human extinction event - a global event of unknown origin and 'fleshing' out the characters so to speak (Love Saeko!).But, this episode was a miserable attempt at maintaining interest in the series.I have bought the DVD of the series and the graphic novel as well for my library.Lowering my review accordingly.This Episode, Overall: Poor"", ""Well, let me just say this: Drifters of the Dead is basically a filler episode, full of jiggly boobs and yuri action.

Yes? Are you looking for more H.O.T.D.? Yes? Well, this is coincidentally the perfect OVA for you!There was never a beach episode in HOTD (or at least, I can\'t recall if there was) and we all know that an ecchi anime can\'t be complete without a beach episode ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) so the creators were nice enough to give us what we all wanted: A beach episode with plenty of ""plot."" Of course, there is no real plot in this OVA, but that\'s not the point of this OVA is it? As I stated before, this is a...beach episode, NOT a critical part of the story line, or even connected to it. It\'s not supposed to have an actual plot in it. Since when has a beach episode had a plot in it? Anyway, let\'s move on.This OVA is honestly one of the best I\'ve seen (ignoring the plot holes). After about 5 years since I watched the anime, it brought back a lot of memories I had of this show. The characters all have a place in the show, none of them are ignored and none are favored more.

Amusing as hell though. Even if it's a little contrived but why should I care when it entirely consists of the female cast dressing up in bikinis 2 sizes too small and some more girl-on-girl action, right?Not a masterpiece but you could definitely do worse. It's got babes in bikinis, it's got humor, everything looks pretty, it just...works. works."", ""Well, that was nothing short of an utter embarrassment.Let us break this down.Story: 3/10The main cast of HOTD goes to an island that pretty much has no zombies on it. They all get into swimsuits and 'vacation', topping it all off with a drug induced sex party of sorts. (Thankfully, the underage girl of the group is excluded from that.)Yeah, I'm not joking. The stupidity of this series gives mediocre hentai series like Resort Boin a run for their money. It adds nothing to the story, characters, world, or anything else.Art: 6/10It never looks bad. But it never gets a chance to show off...anything amazing either. Um...all of the girls looked sexy? Yeah, that's about it.Sound: 4/10Decent. I never had an issue hearing anything, but nothing from it was memorable.Character: 1/10The characterization was -beeping- pathetic! Sure, they start out much like what they originally were by the end of the series. However, they quickly loose all sense of responsibility, and after accidentally inhaling excessive amounts of some drug, all of them (Underage girl aside) just start...ugh. I'll put it to you this way. Every character does the dumbest thing(s) and acts nothing like their old self.Enjoyment: As a hentai, the enjoyment would be a 5/10. As anything else, 2/10. There is NOTHING of substance here. No character development, no action, no clever lines. Nothing. It is all just a buildup to a stupid sex party.Overall: 3/10.The only reason it gets even a 3 is because...it isn't that bad as a hentai, and the art and sound are not really bad. But it fails in every other way, shape, and form. I guess if you just want extreme fanservice, grab this. But I could never, ever, EVER suggest anyone watch this.

Rather than being littered with zombie apocalypse nonsense is oppai paradise and nonsensical ecchi high jinks on a deserted island.Anyone who laments this OVA not having a ""plot"" is misguided. High School of the Dead was never a success because of it\'s story. The (literal) biggest reason it was such a commercial juggernaut in the early 2010\'s was the well animated fan-service and using zombies as an excuse to put the girls in compromising positions. This OVA panders directly to the shows fanbase by giving them exactly what they want to see.If you are honest...with your taste in anime and are interested in an extension of one of the best fanservice anime ever,  this is your thing.

Thank you.I'm gonna make this review very nice and simple. This OVA is absolute shite. It's literally just fanservice, like literally, it even says so in the description of the show for god sakes.This is pretty much a poor excuse to get all the female characters into bikinis.

No slow-mo boobs matrix though....Character: 2Females have boobs and males are horny. That\'s it.Story: 1As I said, it has none. It takes place after the main anime. They get to an island, go swimming (insert bikini scenes here), Takashi and Kouta try to find food, the make a fire with hallucinogenic leafs, more fan service and roll the credits. Hentai have better plot than this.Enjoyment: 1It was a waste of my time.Overall: 2It has none of the elements that made me finish the original series. The \'action\' is completely gone, the only time we see zombies are at the very end, and they are used for more ""sexy times"" and fan servie. ALSO, even the fan service is lacking compared to the original.I don\'t recommend it. But if you really want to watch it, you can do so for free on Pornhub.

No real zombies in this one its pretty much fan service galore without much else. Hey I like fanservice but id like some other enjoyment with it.Nothing really happens in this. Its only 16 minutes and they arrive at an island , find some swimsuits, have fun on a beach, cook some food with some drugs that they don't catch till its to late. Then a lot of dry humping happens with no nudity. They wake up the next day and that's it.No action and sadly...thats where this series ends as we will not be getting a second season to HSOTD. While its not an amazing show i did find it fun and enjoyable.The Voice acting is alrightThe animation is kind of janky and some times doesnt even look good. They cheeped out a bit on this.Not really worth seeing. thats where this series ends as we will not be getting a second season to HSOTD.

Ichigo 100%,https://myanimelist.net/anime/248/Ichigo_100,"['First of all, I\'ll try not to swear too much. So, is\'nt it always a sign of quality if an anime makes you have strong feelings about it? I think good animes are the ones that make you relate and be truly interested in the characters, loving some of them, hating some others, and Ichigo 100% certainly succeeds in these things.Okay, I have seen many echhi/harem animes and they all have their similarities, but never has the protagonist been even nearly as retarded as in Ichigo 100%. Usually ecchi boys have these problems like not being able to decide between girls, or thinking about sex...and female parts for 99% of their time only to freak out if a girl gets close to them. They also tend to posess only one argument in a conversation, which is to repeat the girls name over and over: ""Ni-ni-nishino-san?"". Junpei-kun from Ichigo takes these problems to a whole different level.The main thing that annoys me in the setting is that all the three girls are shown as truly equal, and you really can\'t tell which one Junpei likes the most, as his opinions seem to change in split-second mode. In most of the other harem animes I\'ve seen, you can tell the favourite girl of the protagonist even though he can\'t decide between her and a few others, but in Ichigo 100%, there really is\'nt a main girl. Everybody can tell that in Rosario+Vampire, Moka-san is the one Tsukune likes, and the other ones are not nearly as important. But in Ichigo 100%, Junpei\'s favourite girl seems to always be the one he is not with at the moment.This leads to a situation where Junpei spends time with all the girls equally and hurts all of their feelings. For example, he first spends some great fan service -time with Kitaouji thinking only about Toujou. Then, leaving Kitaouji behind he meets Toujou only to begin thinking about Nishino, and of course hurting Toujou in the process. And all the time the viewer is wondering: ""What the **** is wrong with this guy?"".When Junpei finally ends up saying: ""I love you, but I love others too!"" and when he cried to his friend saying ""I\'m so unpopular"", I was already carrying my laptop to the nearest industrial shredder. There was about a million situations where I was just staring at the screen of my laptop shouting ""Answer her, you f****** retard!"", shaking my whole computer in despair or watching with my eyes closed not being able to understand what he does to these girls.Okay, I\'ve focused way too much on Junpei and his problems, but that\'s really the main thing I got from this anime. It\'s like the script writers have intentionally created a character, who you\'d only want to beat up if you\'d see him. Keitaro from Love Hina is a really good guy, Yukinari from Girls Bravo is okay, but Junpei really is someone I only wanted to hate.But well, this really is a decent anime. Really. The animation is quite good, most of the characters are cute, especially Toujou, and I like the school club setting, although it\'s pretty used nowadays. The ending theme is also quite nice. Eurodance and strawberries, what more can you ask?Overall, if you like to watch harem-anime thinking ""I\'d be way better a boyfriend for her, her and her"", this one\'s definately for you! If you hate watching popular retards making girls cry, stay far far away from Ichigo 100% ^^Whoa, maybe this genre is not for me :D and female parts for 99% of their time only to freak out if a girl gets close to them.

I\'m not really the Ecchi type, although there are times I might watch them. I\'m more of an action/supernatural/horror type, so let me say this first before continuing:If you\'re a real Ecchi fan, and all you\'re looking for is Ecchi, you may not find exactly what you\'re looking for with this series. Don\'t get me wrong, there is plenty of it (probably much more than it sounds), but even for the occassional watcher like myself; it didn\'t feel like it was the real foundation for this series. It does seem to cater to both...guys and gals as its mostly based on relationship. Either gender may actually find appreciation for it. If you\'re looking for some huge story to open up later like the typical shounen series where there is normally some much bigger plot, you probably will not enjoy this as much, if at all. I think I happened to watch this one at JUST THE RIGHT TIME, as I felt very satisfied with how it went and how it was written.Story/Plot: 7Where\'s the story? You\'re looking at it. It\'s pretty much as the Synopsis says and what the genres indicate; your typical harem (although there\'s so much more to it). Why a 7, though? This series wasn\'t created for pure story conception, but is based more on character development and the character and story development compliment each other nicely. As far as I\'m concerned, it couldn\'t have been handled any better, and it was handled rather nicely. It does navigate through the end of Middle School on into High School years, so there is some of that story progression taking place, although a lot of the story advancement is through plot devices; not the kind that leave plotholes, however.Art/Animation: 6It\'s not a secret. This series isn\'t as visually tantalizing as a lot of the others out there, especially with the ones from the same year. A very visually pleasing anime is always a big plus, but the quality here doesn\'t hurt it, either. It didn\'t seem like this production was given that big of a budget, and its a real shame because it could have looked a lot nicer. The art and animation that was used does suffice given the fact it\'s not really ABOUT how good the art, or animation was. Sufficient enough for me.Sound/Music: 8I found the music to be very.. ""fun"". This is strange for me, seeing as how I\'m not the typical kind of guy to really ""like"" anime music, although I\'m coming around to it. The OP for this is simply awesome. It provides a lot of good memories and tends to help me remember a lot of those great times I had in my school days. The voice actors on this (japanese) were awesome, as well. I didn\'t once feel that a voice was out of place, and they pulled everything off quite nicely.Characters/Character Development: 7This is where the main basis for this series lies: in it\'s characters. All of the characters are the types you might be able to find in just about any series, but not necessarily in one as fluent in relationships as this series is. The characters fit with this genre-type, most definitely and not one character is the exact same as the other, so there is plenty of diversity and differing interests and personalities. It\'s very interesting to see how relationships strengthen, or crumble a bit with certain actions throughout this series, as well.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed this series a lot. It was worth my time. If anyone has ever found themselves in similar \'situations\' that take place in this series, you\'ll probably appreciate it just as much as I have, if not more. There were many times that I laughed until I drooled (I know it sounds gross, just emphasizing how funny it was). A lot of the comedy was based off embarressing types of occurences, but it certainly wasn\'t limited to just that. It didn\'t need some long drawn out story to please me, either. I was grateful for that, but I truly wish there was much, much more to it, or a sequel. That would make my day.Overall: 7It\'s a fair rating and it does represent how I enjoyed it, while still being a critic at the same time, however there really isn\'t anything rather negative to say about it. I think I\'ll go as far to claim that this series is truly underrated in probably a lot of circles, and this rating certainly doesn\'t overrate it, either. By the time you get to the end, you\'ll probably feel a sense of satisfaction coupled with regret for not catching it sooner, and perhaps the urge for more. If you came across this review and decided to give it a try, awesome. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and if not; sorry.SuggestionI\'d suggest watching this series, but also the other OVAs and such that are paired with this series. Jump Festa 2004 seems to mark the ""end"" in most respects, although it was produced before the series, itself.Watch Order 1Episodes 1-9, Ichigo 100% TV Special 2, Episodes 10-12, Jump Festa 2004, DVD Animation OVAs.ORWatch Order 2Episodes 1-9, Ichigo 100% TV Special 2, Episodes 10-12, DVD Animation OVAs, Jump Festa 2004.________________________________Addendum (03/09/12):I no longer use the scoring format this site offers and have not for some time.

This was made in 2005, but even so, other shows, like Naruto was out then, and had great art style. The art is Ichigo 100% is plain and not amusing. Everyone looks bland and the same. The only difference that i...find in the characters is the haircolors.Sound: Now the opening and ending themes are really good. The opening theme is a great song that makes you move your head around and can always put a smile on your face. The ending theme is also a fun one that makes you want to dance around. But even so, the voice actors were not strong. The only voice actor I found good was Satsuki\'s because she is very spunky and her voice actor does a good job of having a spunky voice. And the score wasn\'t strong. It has the same sexual music in the parts when characters ""accidently"" get their panties shown, and all the rest in just little piano music that you would find in every other harem.Characters: None of the characters were memorable at all. Tsukasa was boirng to me, even though she does have fanbase. Satsuki\'s annoying, Aya\'s an OK character, but she needs some more story to her, Manaka\'s a retard just like every other main boy in harems, and Yui\'s just weird. None of them stood out.OVerall, Ichigo 100% was a waste of my time. If you\'re into ecchi or harems, I highly recommend it for you. I\'m not into harems that much, and that\'s probably why I didn\'t like it. And when you\'re watching Ichigo 100%, there will also be a few mindfucks in it to mess with you. I hated that as well.

Long before I started watching anime, it was one of the animes whose name was being circulated in my circles. So now, years later, I thought I\'d give it a chance, however, I\'m sorely disappointed.Ichigo 100% is a cookie cutter anime with flat characters and virtually no storyline. While, granted, it is difficult to write a compelling story in twelve episodes, this anime does not measure up in other ways to be allowed that kind of leniency.The storyline for Ichigo 100% develops in one whole episode. And then, once that episode...is passed, there is no more story. When I think back on the series, I find it lacks rising action. After the story is set up and everything is set in motion, nothing else happens. The main character has no hurdles to cross, nothing to lead to a climax of any sort. (And when I think about it, that\'s kind of a feat in itself, not putting in any rising action or a climax). The main character is simply pushed through the motions, but instead of making anything happen, he just pulls back and everything restarts as if nothing had happened.Instead of seeming real or sympathetic, the main protagonists come off as caricatures or stereotypes that are often seen in other anime. The main male character is flat and hesitant and stumbles and cannot make his own decisions. Instead of truly seeming interested in any of the female characters who are fawning over him, he repeatedly say ""I don\'t feel for you that way"" to at least one of the female cast but is ignored or simply ignores his own thoughts; not because of logic or because he is simply being bashful, mind you, but for the continuation of the storyline. He is a backdrop character and in my opinion, is used to facilitate the watcher\'s ability to place himself in the character\'s feet.The main female cast, while colourful, don\'t fair much better. In the effort to make them all unique, I think the writer made them too characterized and again, the ability to sympathize with the characters or relate is lost on me. They are all either too forceful, or too dainty, or simply unrealistic and of course, they are fawned over, in their turn, by all sorts of other men so as to make them all the more desirable to our protagonist.The art is mediocre at best. I found the characters disproportionate and unnatractive, but I can easily ignore that. It\'s not the worst art, but again, it\'s not the best.This anime feels lacking to me. If you\'re into harem, you\'ll hate that nothing ever happens to progress the story in the way that is expected of harems, if you\'re into anime generally, you\'ll hate that there is nothing to really grip onto to make you keep watching. There are good moments, there are bits that can make you laugh, especially when you begin watching and everything is fresh, but otherwise, this anime is pretty mediocre. Nothing I will be watching again.I give it a 4/10. Maybe a 4.5/10 because the opening and closing sings are cute and catchy. is passed, there is no more story. When I think back on the series, I find it lacks rising action. After the story is set up and everything is set in motion, nothing else happens. The main character has no hurdles to cross, nothing to lead to a climax of any sort. (And when I think about it, that\'s kind of a feat in itself, not putting in any rising action or a climax). The main character is simply pushed through the motions, but instead of making anything happen, he just pulls back and everything restarts as if nothing had happened.Instead of seeming real or sympathetic, the main protagonists come off as caricatures or stereotypes that are often seen in other anime. The main male character is flat and hesitant and stumbles and cannot make his own decisions. Instead of truly seeming interested in any of the female characters who are fawning over him, he repeatedly say ""I don\'t feel for you that way"" to at least one of the female cast but is ignored or simply ignores his own thoughts; not because of logic or because he is simply being bashful, mind you, but for the continuation of the storyline. He is a backdrop character and in my opinion, is used to facilitate the watcher\'s ability to place himself in the character\'s feet.The main female cast, while colourful, don\'t fair much better. In the effort to make them all unique, I think the writer made them too characterized and again, the ability to sympathize with the characters or relate is lost on me. They are all either too forceful, or too dainty, or simply unrealistic and of course, they are fawned over, in their turn, by all sorts of other men so as to make them all the more desirable to our protagonist.The art is mediocre at best. I found the characters disproportionate and unnatractive, but I can easily ignore that. It\'s not the worst art, but again, it\'s not the best.This anime feels lacking to me. If you\'re into harem, you\'ll hate that nothing ever happens to progress the story in the way that is expected of harems, if you\'re into anime generally, you\'ll hate that there is nothing to really grip onto to make you keep watching. There are good moments, there are bits that can make you laugh, especially when you begin watching and everything is fresh, but otherwise, this anime is pretty mediocre.

I\'d like to note first that I had watched this series some years ago when it came out, but dropped it. After my second time though--- I think I should have left it where it was. However as I am on this wonderful little adventure with my girl-friend; Zabbichu. I thought; ""well, why not?""[ STORY: 4 ]  ""Pretty much your run of the mill harem.""So, as you would suspect from these genres, we have one guy and...a group of lovely young ladies who, for some unknown reason--- fall in love with him, and in this case; pretty much unconditionally. The main character is perhaps a vicarious writer tool to live out his own wishes and desires, however if this was the case I would say that the writer is a bit of a masochist. The story itself really kinda spins its wheels without really going anywhere, or deciding on how it wants to be. It starts out well enough, but after the middle a lot of things just keep repeating and dulls the rest of the series. What I found interesting though, towards the end it appears that in a few conversations the non-essential characters had with the main cast seemed to reflect kinda how things were going in the series itself. It was like it was arguing with its self for some sort of validity. Other than a few elements about the girls, it\'s pretty much your run of the mill harem, which I have nothing against. I actually quite enjoy the genre; however this series was very lackluster. Even more boring is that it\'s themes don\'t even really bring much new to the table.[ CHARACTERS: 7 ] ""Would have been higher if not for the main character.""So I\'ll get one thing out really quick. The main character? Forgettable, boring and pretty much useless. Most times I felt him using lines I would see if I were playing a dating sim; bland and pretty much all-fit scenario comments. He does well by encouraging the girls in their various talents, or chasing them when they run. But other than that, he felt generic and could have been anyone else. His buddies had more flavor to him. However the reason I\'ve given this section such a high score, which would have been higher if not for the main character; is the love interests. I found them more entertaining to watch grow and act as the series went on. Even though they really don\'t develop too much, I wasn\'t expecting much in the short 12 eps. I find it really amusing when the main character doesn\'t act and they then react like a normal girl would, instead of one of the paper dolls in other anime I\'ve seen.[ ART: 6 ] ""If you\'re like me, who\'s a big fan of girls with lip gloss then this series might just have a little something for you to enjoy. ""Ichigo 100% came out in `05; so with that in mind I would have to say that the art was good. It wasn\'t anything too great. However I was disappointed in the wide gap between the key animation ( the parts where the better animators do the important scenes ), and the other frames. I understand they might have not had quite a big enough budget to have everything look really great, but some more effort in a few scenes would have been better. The background was professional, but they were bland settings. It did shine in whenever it came to an ecchi scene though, with good detailing on the panties, plenty of not just the same old white school girl ones. It also did well whenever the camera focused on the cleavage, which seemed to gleam with every close-up. But most of all I really liked the close-ups on the lips. If you\'re like me, who\'s a big fan of girls with lip gloss then this series might just have a little something for you to enjoy. The character art was again, good for the time. But just that--- good. The girls were quite enjoyable to look at and the supporting cast didn\'t just fall into the background, so it did well enough.[ SOUND: 6 ] ""The ending was great.""The opening was alright. However the ending was great, it was fun to hear them use the ""Vengaboys - We like to Party!"" (The Six-flags theme these days) sample for the ED theme, they did a good job of using it for their song without making it feel like it was a copy of the same song. The background music throughout the anime was again, good enough. It didn\'t really catch my attention, and I probably won\'t recognize any of the tracks ever. But sometimes that\'s good in an anime like this, since you wouldn\'t want to take away from the dialog. But I felt that the music changed at the right parts to add to what was happening on screen. The SFX blended well, but didn\'t really fill out the rest of the atmosphere around the cast, pretty much just simple focus on what was happening. The voice cast did okay, but there were a few points when characters were off screen and they were talking to the protagonist that I didn\'t know one from the other. These are key points in a anime like this, where you fall in-love with a character so much that you can point them out without even seeing their faces. However all the girls pretty much fell into two characters; soft spoken sweethearts. Or precocious loudmouths. Which disappointed me quite a bit.[ ENJOYMENT: 3 ] ""if you got your hopes high for something really hot and fun... turn away now.""I was at first really excited to see where it was going to take us, hoping that the fan-service would escalate as it went on and the relationships grew. However I will spoil something right here and now, it doesn\'t. So if you got your hopes high for something really hot and fun... turn away now. I really was hoping as the first series on my little perverted adventure with my girlfriend would be a lot more entertaining. However I found myself waiting for something to happen, but was left waiting even after the series ended. Which now, I\'m glad it\'s over.[ OVERALL: 5 ] ""There\'s much better out there.""At this point I cannot recommend this series, unless you\'re really hardcore and looking for a rerun of something you already seen. My views might change after I am finished watching through the various OVAs, but as of right now I can\'t really say that anyone should go out of their way to watch it; there\'s much better out there which share the same themes. So in closing I would like to thank you for reading this first review of mine and I\'d like to encourage you to read my girl-friend\'s review as well; Zabbichu, and look forward to the rest of our stuff as we continue our adventures together! a group of lovely young ladies who, for some unknown reason--- fall in love with him, and in this case; pretty much unconditionally.

The love story leaves you on the edge all the time. For those out there, there is plenty of fan service. the songs are catchy especially the ending theme. ', 'It might be un-ethical to review a anime after only viewing the first two episodes but after watching the second episode i just had to post this.Story (5): The synopsis above is a bit off. The beginning of the story basically has a girl who drops a notebook falls down to catch it and exposes her strawberry panties to our protagonist. after a whole 25 seconds of seeing her face the protagonist and the viewers can already tell who she is before the end of episode 1 and on top of that he becomes another girls boyfriend leading the story to be shallow in its...original concept. if the main guy is supposed to get the main girl why did the creators choose the main guy to ask a ""side"" girl out?alas all was fine until the male lead finds out which person was wearing the strawberry panties and says the most shallow thing a protagonist would say. It\'s as if, in the extra 5 minutes of screen time the female lead gets, it gives the male protagonist the ability to fall in love with her over the girl he is already in a relationship with. it put me off this anime almost completely.Just because the male lead saw the female leads panties twice, share synergizing hobbies/goals, spends sometime together studying, and the female lead happens to look more beautiful than the girl the male lead is currently dating doesn\'t mean that the male lead should automatically fall in love with her. what happened to all the time he spent with his girlfriend? its as if all consideration of a current relationship was cast aside like a kid with toys.so far the story recieves a 5 for having a first good hand concept for a romance/comedy/harem anime but a 5 because of how the story is being played out and lack of a good focus through the first episode.Art (6): The art isn\'t bad, its not great either. its similar to the older animes styles like gundam or dragon ball z, without totally touching them. the coloring is very bright and almost but somehow feels very original too.characters hair, eyes, mouths, and faces are in between the orignal styles of anime and the newer concepts sometimes the art would feel very cheap and sometimes the would feel very much like the current ongoing anime. overrall rating art is based on consistency of shapes and sizes and this anime feels like a montage of papers put together. the art is somewhat inconsistent feeling making viewers feel a pull between the show wanting to be comedy based,harem based, or romance based.so far the art recieves a 6 for being above average and could have been a 7 had it been more consistent but a 6 because it felt inconsistent in drawing styles.Sound (6): The sound is good. However the problem lies in when and where the sound is placed and how often the sound is brought up. this also includes character voices and the overall tone the sound produces in order to create the scene in anime. i\'d like to say that even with a weak story or weak characters good sounds or tones put through may actually make it to be much better than it really is and thus sounds/music/tones are very much important. this anime has all the right sounds but sometimes it over uses them and it ends up feeling more like a video game that keeps playing the track from the beginning everytime a person were to change menus or screens. it becomes annoying, repetitive, and overdone. some character voices are a bit annoying especially the male leads friend with orange hair or when a character has fully completed his or her sentence and the corresponding character seemingly acts like s/he hasn\'t heard it at all or only part of it. newer animes would have one character cut off another characters sentences similar to a real life conversation but this anime perhaps wasn\'t in the year where that concept was put out or picked up yet.had the art been as consistantly semi annoying as the sound this anime may turn out for the better so far it recieves a 6 for having good sounds effects but only a 6 for its repetitive usage.Character (4):Male lead: is a shallow pervert who suddenly forgets his relationship with his girlfriend to persue a girl he fell in love at first sight because of her strawberry panties, synergizing goals and study time.Female lead: is a girl who wears glasses and has pig tails but is very ""beautiful"" when her glasses are off and hair is put down. wears strawberry panties, is very smart, and pretty magically makes the male lead fall in love with her. has brown then redish hair.Male leads friend 1: has orange hair, very very annoying. and over exagerrates everything. (the comic relief character)Male leads friend 2: the cool guy. nuff said this guy should be the lead instead.Male leads girlfriend: a short haired blonde girl who the male lead ask out and they become a couple. (why is it that in every harem the blonde girl isnt the female lead...its always the pink or red haired one.)Overall they\'re all normal except the male lead. hell even the slapstick comic relief character has a better chance of being the lead at least he\'s faithful unless this anime is trying to go for another ""school days"" O_O;;;Enjoyment: not enough funny, not enough anything, and hopefully after im done this will be edited if not then beware this anime just might waste away my life as well as yours.overall: so far this anime is bull compared to everything else i\'ve seen hell im starting to think i like school days better. yeah its that bad right now. original concept. if the main guy is supposed to get the main girl why did the creators choose the main guy to ask a ""side"" girl out?alas all was fine until the male lead finds out which person was wearing the strawberry panties and says the most shallow thing a protagonist would say.

Who is this mystery girl? Apparently she dropped something, but it couldn\'t be... it belongs to the plain-looking bookworm Aya Toujou. This introduction pretty much describes the majority of Ichigo 100%. It is 100% about judging people and actually not having to act; why would you when girls land in Junpei\'s lap left and right?Ichigo was an extremely ecchi show for its time, though by now it comes across as...only ""standard"" ecchi. Honestly after watching many works in this genre, this is not one of the stronger ones, it is most memorable for its unique BGM and songs more so than any plot or character.Animation:The animation is fair for its time but quite blurry and antiquated by modern standards. Colors and are still nice but don\'t expect the level of detail you\'d see in a current work. The characters are drawn fairly nicely, and Toujou shows that you shouldn\'t judge a book by its cover. Really, all f the girls are way too nice looking for a douche like our protagonist.There isn\'t much action here, though there is a fair amount of ecchi fan service; the protagonist does have a panty fetish.Sound:As mentioned above, the show has a very unique vocal BGM and and a nice OP and technoish(?) ED. I didn\'t really think that the ED fit the series very well but it sure is catchyl. Some people may recognize the high pitched whine of the male lead as Shin Asuka from Gundam Seed Destiny. Yep... same noise... The VA cast in general is very strong and does a good job.Story:There was definitely room for improvement here. Girls seem to just pop into the male lead\'s life continuously through the series and essentially ""court"" him in their own ways to no avail. There are some nice developments here but they failed to capitalize on these (mostly held back by the lead male). The series just feels like it isn\'t making any progress. And the whole movie/theater club thing has been way over-used.Don\'t expect much of a conclusion to this harem as the guy is indefinitely indecisive. And the only thing worse than having a harem show where the guy chooses someone I didn\'t want is a show where the guy chickens out. I hoped the OVA would fix this but see that review for more details there.Character:The main male is pathetic, he epitomizes the hopelessly nice harem lead that all girls should avoid like the plague.The girls here didn\'t get the message and are somehow attracted to his  thick-headed, not-that-good-looking persona. For a while, I thought we were going to have a Nice Boats ending.The girls on the other hand are well developed and well played. They are all unique and all express themselves to Junpei, but he doesn\'t do them justice. What a pity... I won\'t go into details on the gals as they\'re perhaps among the few things that are worth discovering here.Value:There are moments of humor in this but not enough to put a serious comedy tag on it. There is likewise occasional tension but nothing terribly excitable. Despite my like of strawberries, I\'d have to say this is a show to pass on due to a lackluster story and a lame lead. only ""standard"" ecchi.

The artwork in the anime is decent, but lacks the subtleties of the manga art. I did not really like it, but figured it was just because it's harder to get that kind of art in anime.The story is not exactly top notch in the manga, but I feel even less affected by the anime... There are too many moments where you'll think every girl should just drop Junpei and go lesbian, cause...all the male roles are somewhat dull.Junpei is a crappy main character to boot, but it gets worse as the serie continues. He is the sole reason I am rating the characters as low.

One day Junpei goes to the rooftop and a girl falls over him and the first thing he sees it’s her underwear of strawberries, he has a glimpse of her face and he can’t say a word, he stares at her. She leaves and Junpei realizes she left a notebook and decides to know who she is to give the notebook back to her. Frustrated by...not getting any clue of which that girl can be he’s challenged by his friends to ask out a girl called Tuskasa Nishino. He asks Tsukasa to go out doing exercises, she finds it funny and accepts. Everything goes right in the relationship for some time until one day, they tell him the owner of the notebook is a girl called Aya Toujou, the best student of the high school. Attracted by his skills in writing and in the need of help in some subjects he asks Aya to help him. During a study session, Junpei realizes he likes her because she’s a bit shy, kind, intelligent and because of her skills to write. From that moment he won’t know which girl is better for him. Impressive, right?In his new school he makes a movie club with some of friends including Aya. During this new period he’ll meet a girl called Satsuki Kitaouji, she’s pretty and brave, something he likes and falls in love with her.

The moments and the longing for each other gets repetitive but with nice variations, such as adding an additional character, event, etc. made the series very fun to watch. ', 'All romance-oriented shows have a goal that a character - or characters - is/are striving to achieve. In the romance genre the case is always thus: to develop the relationship between two characters significantly enough that it becomes more than a friendship. In the case of Ichigo 100%, and, sadly, most romantic harems out there, the aforementioned statement of the underlying goal of romance-genre animes is missing.It’s a fault that\'s hard to overlook. It would be equivocated to a blanket that only covers your torso and legs, but not feet; you remain uncomfortable, constantly twisting and pulling to right the position but… you cannot...change the length of the fabric. Do not be misled by the seemingly quick start the show gets off to (as to be expected from a 12-episode-long series). Although it starts like something shot out of a cannon, expect the same mundane situations predictably repeating itself until you find yourself thinking what will happen next, looking at the screen, and shrugging to yourself – “That’s another correct for me. Ichigo Originality: 0, Me: 12.”Another thing that can be deceptively enticing is the way that all girls are fairly represented in terms of Junpei’s (our hero) feelings towards them. Each girl, so to speak, is “kept in the running” for longer than you might expect, hell, I think they might still be running. This “everyone is even” approach will most likely leave you rather intrigued during more “ecchi” and jealousy scenes (the latter mostly involving Satsuki), but during the later episodes wondering and waiting: when and who? Don’t get me wrong, I think in harems that a lot of competition is good at the beginning, but as the show progresses, a thinning of the “crowd” is a must. If it cannot be achieved the viewer (like me) will just get flustered, confused, and annoyed with the hero.That leads me into my next major gripe about the series: Junpei might be the most annoying protagonist I’ve encountered in my short – but thorough – adventure into romance anime. The dialog for his character makes me feel like the writer for said lines was “out to get us” for some unknown action. You want to shake him (Junpei) and say, “No. Say this: ___.” This may seem trivial because frustration/awkward situations come with all romantic animes, but when compounded with the indecision already taking place, it’s exasperating.Looking back though, upon hearing the voice actress for Tojou (one of the female love interests) first speak, I should’ve known this would be THAT kind of anime. The voice actress of Tojou is played by the same actress that voiced Haruka for the “Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu” series. She has a great voice for the kind of role that’s being portrayed, but in the back of mind I was thinking, “It can’t turn out like the first and second seasons of ‘Himitsu’, can it? *After the final episode* Ugh.” (I do know that 100% came before Himitsu.)The animation could be considered a tad bit dated, but the overall affect is present and it doesn’t detract from the show at all. There are a few scenes, especially in the more “zoomed out” ones where the art is a bit sketchy. The art does seem to improve greatly in the OVAs. though.I have to admit that I got sucked into this anime’s ploy by buying into the rocket-like start and loved the show immensely. Then as it went on I grew more and more wary of the string by which the show was pulling me along (rather effectively, I might add). I wanted a drastic change and remained blissfully ignorant to the fact that the show wouldn’t answer in kind. So learn from my blunder: if you’re like me and want a definitive resolution: he ends up with her, caution, I pray you. But if you don’t care about that, but like the genre and premise of the show, give it a try.Overall: 6Story: 7The way the characters are introduced through the story is a familiar, but it still leaves a nice affect.Art: 7It is a little dated by our standards, but it doesn\'t hamper the anime whatsoever.Sound: 8The voice acting and tracks were solid. The voice actress of Tojou was cast perfectly.Character: 7Each had a distinct personality and you could really see why Junpei would have such a hard time deciding who to ""choose."" However, the score is lessened because of the hero, Junpei.Enjoyment: 6At first it was a 12.

They're often cliche, boring, and lack interesting romance. But there's plenty of harem animes I enjoy, and even some I love. Ichigo 100 was not one of them.Story: 3/10This is the MOST SORRY EXCUSE OF A STORY I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!! Sao did it better. No joke. At least it had a story. Idk what Ichigo 100 did. Romance?Think again kind sir, cuz it most certainly was not.So we get our typical harem protagonist and the typical girls that are crazy for him. Blah blah blah,...the usual. But the story never GOES anywhere. Just when he thinks he finally picked a girl he likes he suddenly sees one of the other girls and his feelings waver. Oh joy, my least favorite trait of the protagonist. And spoiler, it goes unresolved. And he gets none of the girls. Big whoop.Basically here is the story:Film enthusiast is really good at getting in compromised situations  involving the panties of the female characters.If you like that, you'll enjoy. Romance? Hmm gotta look elsewhere bud.The most romance this anime has to offer is the relationship between Manaka (protagonist)  and Toujou. It is very cute, well-developed, and has a strong building history. However she is nothing more than a girl in his harem. The reason the anime even interested me enough to give it a 6, is because I thought their relationship would progress. I wanted to give that potential a chance.Art: 8/10for a 2005 anime especially, the art is relatively attractive. It's pretty cute and overall I have no issue with it.Sound: 8/10The ops and ends are catchy and I enjoyed them a lot. The soundtrack is also pretty nice. Nothing too much standout, but it was good nontheless.Characters: 6/10The characters were are all pretty interesting. The problem was just that they lacked development and story progression.Manaka: He has a strong passion for film and filming that sticks with him throughout the anime. But his dumbness ruined his character. He spent the entire anime trying to choose a girl and talking to himself about who he liked. Then it seemed he was finally waking up and making a decision, only to go back to square one the next episode. This dumb pattern filled the whole anime and wasn't even resolved in the end. He's all worried about hurting people's feelings, which is nice and all, but he'll never get anywhere in life.Toujou: she's the mysterious, shy, and timid girl who has a passion for writing and wants to make movies with Manaka. She's the blushy, runs away when stuff gets serious type and has been in love with Manaka since very early in the series.Nishino: she is the studious, popular idol girl who falls for Manaka after a misinterpretation in middle school. She goes to a different high school and pops in on occasion. Her relationship status with Manaka  is very confusing. She is a likable character, and isn't pushed around easily by Manakas annoying ways, even though she has feelings for him.Satsuki: she's the tsundere of the series. She's energetic, playful, and athletic. She is first cold and mean towards Manaka, but eventually falls for him too in the typical tsundere way. She becomes very aggressive with trying to get her love across. For the tsundere, she isn't terrible, I just don't like them in general.Yui: Manakas childhood friend who basically will randomly get random ecchi moments with him. She is mostly used to fill a character space and isn't very likable or plot progressive.The other two supporting males are typical supporting male characters. They aren't awful but none of them progress the plot any which is really stupid and sucky. With the addition of more girls in his harem, the characters are technically the same beginning to end. Satsuki isn't as tsundery and Toujou is not as shy, but romantically there's no even a moresal.Enjoyment: 5/10I obviously did not enjoy this anime. Simply because the romance sucked and the protagonist was an idiot. It was a pain to watch and made me bang my head into the wall so many times I probably have a concussion.If you wanna see a stupid guy look at cute girls' panties, boi I found your anime!Overall: 6/10Like I said. It's the perfect example of what I hate about harem anime:-cliche-LOW story progression-dumb main character-indecision that eats up the whole anime-LACK of romance-end of episode teases that get erased each new episode-ecchi overloadIts terribly formulated and progressed, and mechanics-wise deserves a 3 or 4, but it DID succeed in keeping me interested so thus the higher rating. I rate based on how much an anime interests me, so even crap can get a higher score than it deserves.Ecchi and harem fans will love this I'm sure, but as a romance fan, this one belongs in the trash. the usual.

You must have plenty of time to spare and 2. Be watching it for the girls in it, it is a harem afterall.I can not emphasize this enough. If you are watching this for some reason other than the artwork, ecchi scenes, or romance in it then you are probably in the wrong place.Story (5/10):The...story revolves around a perverted kid (big shocker, I know) in his last year of middle school (the story covers between this time and up to, I think, his second year in HS).You see the story begin when the Manaka discovers this girl\'s (Toujou\'s) notebook which has an apparently fantastic novel written in it by her. The protagonist Man (Manaka from now on) reads it by accident and when he goes to return the notebook emphasizes how good it was and tells her she should be a novelist. He also opens up to her a bit, explaining how he aspires to become a film director. She is so touched by the fact that he complimented her novel so much that she decides to follow him to the highschool he wants to go to (she picks his highschool over her highschool that would be better suited for a smart girl like her). At this point he suddenly confesses, get this, to some other girl (Tsukasa) he barely knows over Toujou who he so clearly has common interests with. He confesses to Tsukasa in an extremely exaggerated, ridiculous manner which somehow convinces her to go out with him. So that is the force stopping Toujou from getting closer to Man, however soon after this it becomes obvious to Tsukasa that Man likes Toujou so she pretty much says to Man, ""You seem to have your eyes on Toujou so instead of going to the same highschool with you I am going to a different all-girls school, even though we are not going to the same school I am not giving up on you. . ."". Personally in that situation I think that the more logical approach would be to just let him get it on with the girl he actually likes, but this is a harem we are talking about so...Moving on.The day before Man\'s first day of HS, we are introduced to Satsuki and in the most ecchi way possible (well, that s an exaggeration). Man is testing out his new camera he got from his parents, he spots this girl by the lake, begins filming and then... Oh no! A gust of wind comes rushing by! This was probably the wrong day to wear that skirt dress, Satsuki you foolish girl. She then proceeds to tackle Man in an attempt to erase his footage, and he ends up grabbing her tits. Yup, this is what I am watching. And I do not feel ashamed one bit.Somehow our protagonist, Man, turns into a huge gentleman and Satsuki can\'t help but fall in love with him.. Not sure how that happened... AGAIN. Only difference this time is that the girl is getting all lovey-dovey in public.Satsuki and Toujou are easily likeable characters, if not the most likable in this anime, but that is just my subjective opinion. Thats all I am gonna cover story wiseArt (9/10):I personally loved the art in it, particularly the female characters looked really appealing visually. This is emphasized in the OP ""SHINE OF VOICE"".Sound (9/10):The OP is really good (easily one of my favorites of all time) and I especially loved the soundtrack that would play whenever there was some sort of ecchi scene occuring. For some reason I found that particular soundtrack hilarious and enjoyable. Not sure why it would make me laugh inside, may have something to deal with the fact that it was just someone melodically singing ""Chuchuwa fufu Chuchaa"" in a very late 90\'s tune (maybe idk, i don\'t remember the 90\'s too well, I was 4 in 2000). It\'s just hilarious. DO NOT ask me why.Character (8/10):The development between the characters was OKAY. I felt all of the girls had enjoyable ""personalities"" especially Satsuki and Toujou. Everyone else was okay, in my opinion.Then again if you are just watching for some semi-highschool romantic situations (like I was) not even slight issues will really bother you. All the characters are pretty cute.Enjoyment (9/10):I really found myself enjoying this series, it had good characters, great art, and some great ecchi scenes mixed in. There is also the sexual frustration (not sure if this is the right word) between the protagonist and the girls. I was able to keep myself fully awake past midnight watching this.. ON A SCHOOL NIGHT. It\'s not really a big deal i know, but I have to be really fixed on something to be able to not fall asleep.Overall (8/10):Assuming you are or plan on watching this for sexual situations, decently good characters and ecchi stuff then you will most certainly not be disappointed. The art is great, characters are exceptional and plenty of ecchi to go around. This is not meant for everybody so if you are feeling iffy about then just. . .

Good anime, but no sense of completion. ', 'Well, it wasn\'t awful, but it most definitely was not the best in the world. Normally, I\'m a big fan of fillers since they can be quite hilarious. This 12 episode anime, however, didn\'t really have much of a plot. There was one, obviously, but it was mainly a ""Let\'s see how many times we can make it perverted.""Instead of the perversion, the makers of this show could have expanded on the plot more and the conclusion may have been better. To end it the way they did just was not right.The only way I would truly recommend this show is if you...can\'t think of anything else to watch and just want something to pass the time. can\'t think of anything else to watch and just want something to pass the time.', ""A good ecchi with some great humor. Almost like a harem, the anime stays fresh with a little rejection of the main character. Instead of everybody going head over heels for him, there's one girl who switches up the story, and keeps the story moving.Only problem for me was that there was no definite solutions to the love problems and many feelings are lost in translation.Over all i give this anime a 8/10, nothing special, but it's a well rounded story. "", ""The whole anime is passable(judging from a general view). Actually, the storyline is deviant from the original manga. There isn't a transparent ending in the anime.The anime apparently treats Toujo as the No.1 heroine and Nishino in the second place, which in the manga is the other way around I think. In the original story, Junpei and Nishino has the sex relationship at Nishino's home and eventually Junpei chooses Nishino as his girl when Nishino comes back from France, but not Toujo, who is then a novelist. Anyway, it's a competition merely bewtween East(Toujo) and West(Nishino), other girls are not in this virtually fierce...war and convoluted relationships(including Satsuki).Fortunately, I like Nishino better than others so the ending satisfies me properly. Toujo is too weak in character to be recognized. war and convoluted relationships(including Satsuki).Fortunately, I like Nishino better than others so the ending satisfies me properly. Toujo is too weak in character to be recognized."", ""I really like this show, that's saying a lot since I strongly dislike the Harem Genre. This show is just good, unlike most of the others of the same genre, although it isn't that unique as it still has the same things that you would find in your average harem show. What makes this show unique are the 4 female main characters. They were the reason why I kept on watching this show, otherwise I would've just dropped it, since the MC is such an Idiot, well it is to be expected since all harem MCs are Idiots lol. I particularly liked Satsuki as she...is the most unique female archetype out of the 4 female leads in my opinion, the rest of the female leads we've seen before.I've gotta give kudos to the character designers. The character's design is just amazing, especially for the 4 female main characters. It's a mix of early 90's and a bit of late 2000's type of character design. Animation is kind of meh though, well it's to be expected for a show aired in 2005.The opening song, 'Shine of Voice' is just amazing. I get the 90's kind of vibe from the song, and it just makes me want to dance, same goes for the ED.Oh and #fucknishino is the most unique female archetype out of the 4 female leads in my opinion, the rest of the female leads we've seen before.I've gotta give kudos to the character designers.

I guess bad reviews of this anime only spur on people who can't relate. The differential of each female protagonist showcases each person's uniqueness and that makes the choices so hard.

A tsundere, an intelligent and polite girl, a klutz, a whimsical seductress etc... and for a certain reason - a handicapped male lead. Now this handicap may be physical or psychological or even cultural, or all of those, but it...is there to make the male lead appear inferior to the females and thus create this Freudian image of motherly figures who eventually pamper and smother the male lead with affection; except they\'re not his mothers - they\'re his romantic interests.

They were actually fairly realistic portrayals of teenage girls. I liked the way they were presented and the fact that they were all given a background story that related to the male lead. Some harems omit this step and instead go straight for the fan-service and plot progression. I liked the fact that they never acted out of character and the writers did a superb job at giving all of them more or less equal screen time.Now, I didn\'t like the male lead. This character is the most retarded creation in the world of fiction that I\'ve had the displeasure of stumbling upon. This guy would not survive a single day in real life. This is is the type of person who wouldn\'t know seduction even if you shoved a sex starved porn actress right in his face. Junpei Manaka is one fucking mess of a man. This character will maniacally go from ""That girl certainly likes me"" to ""I\'m the least popular guy in school"" in a matter of seconds before jumping back to the first conclusion given positive female stimuli. He goes around arousing girls all day and then pushes them away when they jump on him because what they\'re doing is all inappropriate only to nonchalantly arouse them again later and repeat the whole process every.single.episode. Are you fucking kidding me!? Is this meant to be a joke or were the writers being a sadistic bunch of villains with childhood issues?I do not know the answer to those questions. What I do know is that I did not enjoy that aspect of this anime. You always want to see closure to a romantic situation and this anime just did not do that a single time.Apart from the cast and the plot the art and sound departments were nothing special. They weren\'t bad but did not merit a high score either. I found the quality of this piece to be fairly average.Enjoyment wise, Ichigo 100% is a bit of an oddball. I did enjoy it but absolutely despised the male lead with a passion. I think it\'s probably the female cast in this show that really saves it makes it actually enjoyable.

Remarkably for an ecchi anime based off manga they did pretty well.Well story wise this is one of those anime that start off with the standard ecchi plot single guy in high school has about as much experience with...girls as half of the intended target audience.

And like all harem protagonists Junpei lacks any ability to decide who or what he is after, as he is deciding to look for the one girl he saw on the school roof who happened to have strawberries on her panties which of course like any Japanese man in anime (or reality?) has some sort of immediate visual recognition software installed in his brain which lock on to said fabric on the girl and the anime decided this is time to start the story.Kudos to him for having an aim, but the fact that panties were involved as a plot device in the story of the manga and anime makes me laugh as though someone catapulted a squirrel cruelly over a garden fence when they realised I was watching. I found it funny but I feel bad for laughing.Unlike most harem anime. The characters progress with their story lines and it doenst always go well for any of them all of the time.

Kakurenbo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1192/Kakurenbo,"[""Kakurenbo is a one-shot ova and is Yamatoworks first attempt at an anime. And as the title suggests, its an OVA about hide and seek. But like any good anime out there theres a lot of rules and twists to this 30 minute show. Thirty minutes isn't enough time to flesh out character backgrounds and a deep story but it gives out the rules and punishments of the game all in the beginning  of the show. And that gives this show a lot of points from me considering how confusing and crazy the show gets right away. For example one of the rules gets...broken even before the game begins. But it all will start to make sense toward the end.As for the characters, they're all grade school children but they all have their own unique style and look. For instance, one kid has earrings big enough to have a kanji symbol on it, another has a mowhawk, etc. Regardless these kids arent your typical type of kids but I don't think this show is aimed toward a young audience considering the graphic nature of this OVA. Well its not a graphic violence but more of a psycho thriller. Which is pretty unique since you dont see these types of anime being produced as much. But back to the characters, they all wear fox masks as a requirement to play the game. I'm assuming this is a move to save money on animation, or it can be to increase the scare factor of the show. Which brings me to the art and animation of the show.Apparently it took the production team 6 months to produce this one episode, and you can see that most of their work was put into the art and animation of this show. It looks like most of the show was hand drawn but the characters are a mix of cell-shading and hand drawn animation. As you well know this combination usually looks pretty bad, but surprisingly they managed to make it look really REALLy good in this show. The antagonists are all vibrant and oozing evil, neon lights all have a soft neon glow, posters on abandoned walls are written out with care, and even heaps of trash and debris have their own beauty to them. The detail to the background artwork is just insane it appears they put in just as much work to the backgrounds as they did to the characters.As for the sound effects and voice acting, one turns out VERY EXCELLENT and the other turns out VERY mediocre. The sound effects are top notch and set the mood all perfectly. Almost a little too perfect. Still air can be heard, buzzing of neon lights, even the dilapidated buildings that make the setting all creak and crack with antique clarity. At times, the sound will actually make you jump if you get too into the show. On the other hand, the voice acting is mediocre at best. Most of the time they don't even speak, they mostly run and scream in fear. Two of the kids don't even speak at all. But where there is no dialog, they're usually some sort of suspenseful, creepy, or downright ominous song brooding over the show.As usual, my review is starting to becoming longer than the whole show itself. Overall, the show is a great psychological thriller who is very open minded to unique shows. This show is obviously full of holes and inconsistencies, but the whole experience will still be exciting every time i watch it. And I've watched it 4 times already :) broken even before the game begins.

Most of the time they don't even speak, they mostly run and scream in fear. Two of the kids don't even speak at all. But where there is no dialog, they're usually some sort of suspenseful, creepy, or downright ominous song brooding over the show.As usual, my review is starting to becoming longer than the whole show itself. Overall, the show is a great psychological thriller who is very open minded to unique shows. This show is obviously full of holes and inconsistencies, but the whole experience will still be exciting every time i watch it. And I've watched it 4 times already :)"", ""Title: KakurenboAnime: Kakurenbo is a half-hour OVA that was produced as a collaboration between CoMix Wave Inc (known for their work on 5 Centimeters per Second and Voices From a Distant Star), Dentsu Inc (known for their work on Antique Bakery and D.Gray-Man) and Yamatoworks/D.A.C (this was their debut production), and directed by Shuhei Morita (who also directed the Freedom OVA series).  Kakurenbo was released on September 1st, 2004 in Japan, was licensed Stateside by the now defunct Central Park Media, who released it on October 30th, 2005.Story: In a city that's now in ruins, children play the game of Otokoyo (a Japanese version...of hide and seek), but seemingly disappear whenever it's played, supposedly spirited away by demons.  A boy named Haraku enters the game hoping to find his sister, who went missing playing Otokoyo.This OVA's really good at ramping up the creepy factor.  You're thrown into this world with little to no background whatsoever, and truths unravel slowly as you watch these kids going through the game, which grows more and more scary as you go through.  You don't know much about the kids initially, as they're all wearing fox demon masks, as required per the game, but you learn enough details about them as they go through the game.  And there are some excellent and truly scary twists in this, though I would suggest some cultural background before going into this, as it'll make these make a lot more sense.  And everything wraps up neatly in a half hour's time.Art: Kakurenbo was made entirely using 3D CGI and cel-shaded animation, like in Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.  The art for this in general is incredibly well done, and conveys the creepiness of the atmosphere perfectly, not to mention the designs of the creatures you find in here.  'm personally not that much of a fan of cel-shaded animation, though, as it does look a bit strange in places, especially with regards to the childrens' expressions, which are incredibly wooden.  It is a fairly new technology, though, so it'll probably become better-used with time.Music: I really like what they did here.  Traditional instruments are used and orchestrated perfectly, as is the incredibly understated use of silence, to add to the tension in the entire thing.  Excellently done.Seiyuu: They didn't particularly stand out, but neither did they leave much of an impression on me.  Overall, passable job here.Length: The OVA does feel a bit constrained by it's half-hour run time, but it still manages to tell a good, creepy story, even if we aren't as invested as we could be in the kids.  Overall, it does well with what time it has, even if it could be a bit better.Overall: An amazingly creepy OVA with a pretty good story and music track, decent art and seiyuu, and a length that could've been longer for maximum effect.

Is this anime for you?A: If you are easy to trick and get lost in atmosphere quite often, or don\'t watch horror much or are frightened easily then yes.Now part 2 is justify why you hate something to the people who love it. (Fair enough since you should at least provide good reasoning for liking or hating something.) Past this part has SPOILERS.It is a game of 7 children. There are 8 children. This is the start. Gee, WONDER WHO THE 8TH IS!? Also, she looks exactly like the one kids sister (despite wearing a...mask), and they all wear fox masks. Now they spend 16 minutes running around the city looking for the girl (8th child) as well as being chased by monsters. During which period, they find a poster with 4 monsters and a fox in the middle.Right then I stopped the movie, walked to my brother\'s room and explained to him That I\'m watching a OVA in which there are kids running around with a fox mask, an extra kid pulling a Silent Hill 2, and that the fifth monster was a fox. We said IN UNISON ""She\'s it"". She literally is ""It"" btw. To catch the children. Then after 16 minutes elapse, we get to see that SHE IS THE MONSTER! Oh wow, shocker on shock street. They still feel the need to then explain that however. Then she says ""When we play Hide And Seek the city gets brighter, but only for a minute"". Right then I said ""She\'s using them as batteries"" then that\'s revealed, as if that\'s a surprise. Then it\'s revealed the last child is it, go figure.So in addition to being 100% predictable, how is the atmosphere since that\'s a key aspect of horror! It\'s not great. The music is poor, it\'s often annoyingly dark despite being animated, the creatures are not that scary, the characters are not particularly likable. They\'re UNLIKABLE CHILDREN, how is that possible!? Probably because they\'re soulless, in a 20 minute production, designed primarily to serve as fodder for the monsters.The only thing it does well is somehow make 3d cell shading not look horrible for 20 minutes.So I guessed the plot, I wasn\'t afraid or creeped out despite watching it at midnight in a dark room, and it didn\'t entertain me. Enjoy! I am being generous with my rating. mask), and they all wear fox masks. Now they spend 16 minutes running around the city looking for the girl (8th child) as well as being chased by monsters.

This being of the horror genre can mean only one thing: a group of kids got curious and were lured into the game, with obvious disastrous consequences, as they found out just why the game is a taboo.I'm not expecting much from the characters, since this is such a short film (and a horror one at that). You have the bully/ jerk jock archetype and his cronies, followed by the stoic and...quiet characters, the obligatory mysterious creepy child and so on. The cast may not be outstanding, but they suit the show just fine, though it would be nice if the movie were somewhat longer so as to allow a little more characterization; a bit more background on the characters' motivations, maybe a little bit about the town and so on. While the idea of having the entire cast wearing the fox masks in order to play the game prevents the audience from seeing their expressions, it does add to the ambience and that's the crucial point.Indeed, because the story is such a simplistic and short one, the movie relies heavily on its audio and visual elements. As such, the animation quality is unsurprisingly impressive. Things such as the way shadows are cast, as well as how the various lighting effects are done all helped to create a spooky atmosphere for the story. Furthermore, the abandoned buildings in the background are detailed and appear to have a tint of cyberpunk feel to it, suitably adding to the mood. Last but not least, the music compliments the movie well. Using an orchestra of traditional Japanese instruments certainly helped in creating a haunting, chilling soundtrack throughout the movie. My only complaint however, goes to the demons themselves. They are too obvious. A large element of horror and paranoia stems from not knowing what you’re up against; yes, the demons need to be scary looking as well (and they do look menacing) but it is building up the suspense of them appearing that really sets the tension. In this case, the demons are properly seen right from the beginning. We see them too clearly and that results in the show being less spooky than it could have been. I guess this is attributed the fact that film is simply too short to do proper build-ups. On the other hand, the designs for the demons are interesting: traditional Japanese folklore sort of demons but part mechanical – further contributing to the subtle cyberpunk feel.All in all, Kakurenbo is a reasonably decent show to watch. While not downright spine-chilling scary, it is nonetheless relatively creepy, particularly with the reveal and the stinger at the end. It being such a short film thus bears resemblance to those series of short horror stories prevalent on the net (also known as 'creepy pastas'). If anything else, Kakurenbo is at least worth the visual treats it offer. quiet characters, the obligatory mysterious creepy child and so on.

It's so short that it's not really a question of &quot;why watch it?&quot; but &quot;why not?&quot; If you still want to know why, then read on.There is an urban legend that tells about kids disappearing in a strange abandoned city, the protagonist is there to search for his sister while other children have their own reasons to venture into that desolated place reminiscent of the Midgar slums from Final Fantasy VII, such as proving they are not afraid or simply exploring.The children all wear fox masks as part of their game...so we don't get to see their expressions as they explore the city and unravel the mystery behind the disappearance of several children rumored to have been spirited away.The art is a mix between the computer flash style animation and classic animation. It gives a nice balance to fit most preferences. Since this movie is so short, just under half an hour, there's no time to develop the characters too deeply, but the main focus is the mystery.I'll only say that the Matrix comes to mind, but this isn't about being in a virtual world so it's not exactly like the Matrix. Watch it yourself to see what I mean. There are also hints of mythology mixed into the eerie environment for an entertaining result. so we don't get to see their expressions as they explore the city and unravel the mystery behind the disappearance of several children rumored to have been spirited away.The art is a mix between the computer flash style animation and classic animation.

We have a strange band of characters that are brought together by the fight to survive a game that they know they could be killed in. There really isn’t much I can say about the show since I really don’t want to spoil if for you. It’s one I say you should watch. Also would like to note, very rarely does a Writer also become the director of his own show but in this case, it...happened. Shuuhei Morita actually not only wrote the show, he was the director and producer of it. I think that is part of why this was done so well. Because he had a point to put across and it wasn’t diluted by anyone else in the way.Now for the psychological part of this, I had to look at Wikipedia. Sadly I couldn’t get it but now I see what the show was actually trying to show. The idea was that Tokyo was losing its aesthetic, its beauty for a more industrial looking life. If you look at its aesthetic before being like a child, then you can see where a child’s game turning into a scare trip in a large abandoned city more based on industry could lie. Sadly, if I told anymore, I would be doing spoilers again.The animation style feels much like a cut scene from a rather well made game. The mixture of 3D and cell shaded textures are almost seamless although once in a while they use the same model over and over again. There are times when you will see very small clips of what all the characters are doing to stay alive and sometimes they don’t seem to be congruent at all. They are placed randomly to break things up and so it ends up a bit hard to tell where everything is taking place. Still I fully love the post-apocalyptic feel they have for the show. It’s hard to tell where the show is taking place because it’s a large mixture of Japanese structures and yet the demons have a more hindu looking design. At least that’s in my mind.Surprisingly, this was actually dubbed and the dub is rather well done in my book. Voices work for many of the characters in how I would picture them sounding, some might be whinny but it was the personalities were the only things that annoyed me, not the voices. The music captures the mood well and keeps you hyped up long after watching it.Again, you should watch it if you like thrillers or anything psychological.

One of my favorites in fact. The feel of the movie itself was freaky as hell! (watched it with my friend at 2:00 in the morning!) The animation was top notch as the creatures were quite horrific. The plot was very interesting and gave you just enough information to keep you interested. Though at times it was a little confusing. The sound was ok as the silence added to the chill, but the characters themselves were given very little depth. The overall feel of this movie was great (in a scare the crap out of you sense) as...it blended perfectly to the genre. It left you to decide for yourself. The ending was great!this really is a spoiler:All those lights on the tower were kids! Not to mention the fact they were screaming as the things plugged into them!Its a movie that I would seriously love to watch again if I could find it and I recomend you do the same! it blended perfectly to the genre. It left you to decide for yourself. The ending was great!this really is a spoiler:All those lights on the tower were kids! Not to mention the fact they were screaming as the things plugged into them!Its a movie that I would seriously love to watch again if I could find it and I recomend you do the same!', ""This is my first review so I hope it sums things up alright.Also DON'T READ THE SUMMARY ON THE KIDS, MAJOR SPOILERS. Someone should fix that, the entire story is given away on Hikora's summary and Sorincha's in particular.I first off would like to say I am not a big horror fan and am very queasy when seeing gore. That being said, even if I liked horror, I will stand by saying everyone is an idiot 99% of the time who is in a horror movie, but I suppose that's the appeal? Anyway, regardless of this, I did actually like the story, even though I...was shaking my head at some parts or rolling my eyes or even yelling things at the characters.Story: The story is quite unique from what I've seen, but has a very traditional Japanese feel, IE the kids playing a game in an old town abandoned town at night, which I have seen in other animes. However, that's pretty much the only thing that's normal by this movies standards. What happens at the end with out giving anything away makes this movie chilling (especially the very last scene) yet entertaining to watch regardless of the implications it holds. The kids having to wear fox masks also makes for a very different feel in the scope of the story. The pacing is off at times, but that might be just me. I wish it was longer, there are still quite a few things unanswered, but it does well to give you enough gist of the story to understand everything that happens. Overall I give it an 8.Art: I loved the art, I know others don't, but I think it was perfect for this kind of story. You can put a ton of detail in there that stands out on it's own, which I enjoyed. Also the way the kids are done, even though you can only see their eyes and body language, it makes it very easy to read what they're thinking and feeling. Due to the cell shading it also felt a bit like a live video game, which makes for some people like myself more vested into the whole ordeal, like I'm apart of it somehow. I give a 9 for art. I think the style was perfect for this.Sound: I liked the music, it was creepy yet ancient feeling, the kind of music you'd think you'd hear in old ruins on a video game, however at the same time, that doesn't totally fit the idea of a semi-modern abandoned town. It does however fit the idea of ancient demons, which by the looks of it I don't think are so ancient themselves, but perhaps they were supposed to be. The use of bells and creaks as well as other eerie sounds worked quite well to the already creepy feel of the movie. I give an 8 for sound.Character: I liked the characters, save for Sorincha (giggling girls who won't tell you things piss me off) and the bully kid. I especially like Hikkora and Yaimao. I thought the twins were cool too, even though they didn't talk, I liked their designs and despite the lack of emotion in their face, probably due to their masks, you could still tell what they were thinking and how they communicated with each other by their body language and actions. The last 3 characters (minus the silent girl) were typical idiot bully and his two lackeys which he has no regard for. I felt sorry for them but at the same time, it's an over done stereo type. They're smart, but the big fat loud and non-believing in demons one is an idiot. And small spoiler, he'll get what's coming to him. It is horror after all. Back to Hikora though, I really felt for his character, him wanting to find his sister and his friend determined to help is what kept the story going for me, wanting them to win and get out. There is a part at the end though that made me a bit furious with his change in character, or maybe fear does it to people, but why didn't he just throw it off the edge when he's handed it? You'll understand when you see it. Other then this, over all I give the characters a 9. They were well fleshed out for a 25 min OVA.Enjoyment: Even though as I stated I dislike horror and rarely if ever watch it, this was actually quite a good watch. I really feel for Hikora and that was what drew me in after the first 3rd of the movie. The story is good, I loved the art, the characters are great, the sound is good and it's a good creepy movie, despite the usual flaws nearly every horror movie ever has.Over all: 8 1/2 was shaking my head at some parts or rolling my eyes or even yelling things at the characters.Story: The story is quite unique from what I've seen, but has a very traditional Japanese feel, IE the kids playing a game in an old town abandoned town at night, which I have seen in other animes.

The last 3 characters (minus the silent girl) were typical idiot bully and his two lackeys which he has no regard for. I felt sorry for them but at the same time, it's an over done stereo type. They're smart, but the big fat loud and non-believing in demons one is an idiot. And small spoiler, he'll get what's coming to him. It is horror after all. Back to Hikora though, I really felt for his character, him wanting to find his sister and his friend determined to help is what kept the story going for me, wanting them to win and get out. There is a part at the end though that made me a bit furious with his change in character, or maybe fear does it to people, but why didn't he just throw it off the edge when he's handed it? You'll understand when you see it. Other then this, over all I give the characters a 9. They were well fleshed out for a 25 min OVA.Enjoyment: Even though as I stated I dislike horror and rarely if ever watch it, this was actually quite a good watch. I really feel for Hikora and that was what drew me in after the first 3rd of the movie. The story is good, I loved the art, the characters are great, the sound is good and it's a good creepy movie, despite the usual flaws nearly every horror movie ever has.Over all: 8 1/2"", ""The time has come to start horror anime month in earnest. First up we have Kakurenbo, a short film from 2005. It was done by Yamato Works, written & directed by Morita Shuuhei.Story:There's a mysterious game of hide and seek played by seven children in fox masks. There's just one problem. Every child who plays the game vanishes. Rumour says that they're spirited away by demons or possibly creepy old guys with worn down ice cream vans. We see various groups. A pair of twin brothers, a trio, a pair of friends and a girl on her own. Giving us eight players for the game.The...biggest problem with the film is a very simple one. There's a real lack of investment. The film isn't long enough for us to get to know or care about the characters or what happens with them. The trio seem to be there for no adequately explored reason. The twin brothers never speak and have absolutely no motivation. The main pair have some motivation, to find the main protagonist's missing sister. And while that is understandable at a basic level, it's kind of weak in terms of getting the audience invested when you never see the siblings interact.I will give some credit. Having a twisted area of the city where a bunch of children are fleeing and hiding for their lives is a potentially good set up. I also appreciate that the ending is allowed to be a horror ending. It doesn't hold back or try to be nice and sanitised. So, that's something.Characters:I've already somewhat covered this, but the characters are really the big problem. In order for you to have a strong horror work, you have to get the audience to care about the characters. Spend some time with them, develop them and then put them in peril when you've built up that investment. In this, they try for a very short, clean narrative but in order to achieve that they sacrifice any potential for characterisation. You don't give a shit what happens to these kids because you know virtually nothing about them. They're simply too dull. Even if they aren't actively obnoxious, it's still a bit like trying to care about a slice of dry white bread that's been left on the counter.Art:In terms of art, I'll credit\xa0Kakurenbo\xa0with not falling into the too common horror pitfall of having a bunch of over the top gore and violence. Because, like I talked about with Elfen Lied last year, that's not scary. It's just ridiculous and quickly loses its impact. I may not give this film credit for being great horror, but I will gladly give it credit over the gore festival films that just have no sense of subtlety. And the Cel-shaded style does look pretty decent. Although it might not be the most suitable style for a horror work. The atmosphere around the city and the demon designs are pretty good.Sound:The acting is decent enough. We have both Takeuchi Junko & Suzuki Masami in major roles. They may not be at their best in this since the characters are so mundane but they manage to turn out performances that are all right. Which is also how I'd describe the music. It's okay.Ho-yay:None of these characters are developed enough to have interactions that come across as potentially romantic. I honestly don't even know if these kids are old enough for that to be much of a concern with them. We seriously know that little about them.Final Thoughts:This is a horror film that might be effective for actual children who are used to media having under-developed one-note characters. If I were watching this as a ten year old, it would probably scare me. The problem is this isn't a film intended for that audience. It looks to be made for the younger end of the shounen spectrum IE, teenagers. And with teenagers, I don't think it's going to work all that well. But if you want to experience the atmosphere and watch a bunch of children get chased down by demons, by all means give it a try. For myself, I'll give it a 5/10. I've certainly seen worse horror, on many occasions, but I also can't call this a good one. It's just kind of middling. biggest problem with the film is a very simple one.

Not for Japan.Kakurenbo is a short film mixing the classic hide & seek children\'s game with the Japanese folklore of demons by Yamatoworks. It works pretty well as watching innocent children fight against nightmares and terrors can be an inspiring experience... if they do emerge with victory anyway. But instead of being something akin to the likes of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, where we witness the unimaginable horror of children being slaughtered in a bloody fashion, Kakurenbo is more subtle, utilizing an intense mix of background sounds and tight...framing to produce a suspenseful atmosphere.Within the 25 minutes runtime, the movie still manages to incorporate information about the children\'s personality through an excellent use of ""show, don\'t tell"". Aside from the obvious bully of the show, Noshiga (and his posse), the most notable use of such storytelling are the twin brothers, Inmu and Yanku. They do not speak throughout the entire movie, and we are not fed expositions about them, but rather, from the way they try to survive against the demons, you could tell they are fast runners, that they seemed to be more capable of handling such intense situations than the others, and from their creepy masks (creepier than the ones the other children are wearing anyway), there\'s something disturbing about them. All of these are great examples of visual storytelling that don\'t rely on dialogue expositions.Unfortunately, the weak point of the movie comes in the form of the demons - they just aren\'t that terrifying-looking. In fact, their mechanical movements made them seemed more like animatronics than demonic beasts haunting your nightmares. Part of the reason for this, I feel, is the cel-shading that gave them a sort of ""high tech"" texture. Their skin is smooth and very clean, not like the gnarling, drooling and blood-soaked demons you would usually imagine. That being said, I could understand why they look like that. These are demons from the Japanese folklore, and they do look historically accurate. But as someone who\'s used to more obvious depictions of demon spawns from hell in American movies, I just had a difficult time associating these beasts with anything nightmarish.But thanks to the good cinematography, the movie does have its fill of tension and suspense, particularly when you learn the true nature of the lost children at the end. While not graphic in nature compared to Higurashi, Kakurenbo does have its own way of shocking you with a disturbing plot-twist - and it is deliciously horrifying. It makes for a very unique concept that highlights the creative nature of short films. Usually, shorts have the potential to input very creative little concepts that wouldn\'t work as effectively in a full-length movie, and this is one of the best examples. framing to produce a suspenseful atmosphere.Within the 25 minutes runtime, the movie still manages to incorporate information about the children\'s personality through an excellent use of ""show, don\'t tell"".

A more creative approach that requires little in terms of changes is to have subtitles in place until the voices become clear.Overall: kids will be kids, no matter the generation.

The worldbuilding leaves something to be desired but they did a wonderful job for the 25 minutes that they had. I really wish there was more in this world because I was absolutely entranced for its short duration.The art was absolutely beautiful. Though I know CGI isn\'t everyone\'s cup of tea, this OVA is stunning. The combination of hand-drawn animation and cell shading blew me away, honestly. Obviously it isn\'t perfect, it was released in 2004 (and even now a lot of CGI is sorta glitchy) but I loved how it looked.I think this short really captured...what psychological thrillers are supposed to be about. Yes, the story is a little ""predictable"", but it isn\'t supposed to be a surprise. The ""twists"" aren\'t supposed to be twists. The point of the story is to instil a creeping sense of dread, that there\'s nothing you can do to stop what you KNOW is going to happen. And I think that this story pulls that off perfectly.I try to look at this as an indie film more than as anime. Because that\'s what this is.

Thats all I really can say about this movie.Story: 7 - Among the ruins of the city, there is a game only children can play. It is called “Otokoyo”; a game of hide-and-seek. But whenever children play this game, one by one they would disappear into the blinds of the buildings… The story begins when a boy named Hikora enters the world of Otokoyo, to find his sister Sorincha who disappeared afer playing this game.

The creepy and unsettling movement of the demons as well as the use of lighting are vital in creating an unnerving atmosphere that sets your stomach with dread.

I dont care about the runtime of the movie because it started strong en ended very strong! Charac. animation is not too special, more a bit kiddy, an very good background story historical places and char. development really were put potential in there , and good mix of 80´s synth and 18th century japanese interpetation music. Beautiful anime sketches inbetween the movie is what i really miss of 21 century anime! just because u can see the drawing...of it partially unfinished, just great! of it partially unfinished, just great!', 'At just over 2 hours long The Dagger of Kamui is a historical epic most people can enjoy, although it will feel a bit more rewarding to those that have experienced a decent amount of anime and manga beforehand and know a few things about the Japanese history and folklore.The first thing of note is the outstanding soundtrack. It\'s a unique mixture of electro rock and funky synth tunes, merged with traditional instruments and spoken sound effects. If you\'ve seen Miyazaki\'s highly acclaimed The Wind Rises, you\'ll remember the amazing train scene with spoken sound effects. Kamui uses a lot of that and it sounds...cool. The music also blends in perfectly - when Jiro is with the Native Americans there\'s even a pan flute in there.The second thing that woos the viewer is the animation. There are a number of impressive scenes, but arguably the best ones are the ones where characters and objects dissipate into colorful particles that fly around and glitter like in a kaleidoscope. All of this is not that surprising when we look at the production list. Made by Madhouse - one of the oldest studios that constantly puts out high quality content. Directed by Rintaro, also behind jaw dropping visual masterpieces like the Adieu Galaxy Express 999. Key animation by Kawajiri and Takashi Nakamura, whose hands touched a number of extremely cool and stylish animated works.The third thing is historical accuracy and here we get to the part that seasoned viewers might appreciate a bit more. By no means is Kamui hardcore accurate, but the environments of 19th century Japan and America are pretty believable. The Ainu and Native American tribes are a bit romanticized of course, but it\'s quite pleasant to observe their habits and attires and compare them to the Japanese.Another interesting thing to observe is the clash of ideology, culture and religion of the time. The main clash is obviously between the Shogunate and the rising imperial forces that happened during the Boshin war. A more subtle one is between the Japanese and the indigenous Ainu tribes. This being portrayed at all is kind of a big deal, because the Japanese are a bit shy and embarrassed when it comes to depicting their native tribes, because of the complicated ways in which they were ""assimilated"" (unlike Americans who like to flash around with the heritage of their natives).The religious clash is kinda connected to the cultural one - Buddhism VS the worship of local deities. It\'s a common theme, often present in anime and manga too. If you look closely you can draw the following parallels: Tenkai\'s face = Buddha = the Devil\'s incarnate. It\'s not uncommon to see in Japanese literature the tales of Buddhism spreading from Korea or China and violently trying to phase out the local deities. One of the most fascinating depictions of this clash can be found in the Sun chapter of Phoenix, a most influential manga by Osamu Tezuka.The Dagger of Kamui is a pretty interesting work indeed, although it\'s not as well defined and polished as let\'s say Princess Mononoke, on which Miyazaki worked meticulously to atone himself for Nausicaa (which he was forced to do a quick adaptation when the original manga was just starting out). Neither is it as striking as works like Ninja Scroll, but even action fans shouldn\'t be disappointed as there is enough slashing and slicing to go around. cool.

That setting is the backdrop for the story, and it\'s one of mystery, intrique, betrayal and vengence.He\'s framed for the murder of his mother and sister and forced to flee from his village and is taken in by a monk named Tenkai whom gives Jiro the task of training to become a ninja.The art...style is very well suited for the anime and the ninja fight scenes are done quite well. The musical score is truly something else, it\'s something like a fusion of 80s rock and traditional Japanese music and in a lot of scenes it does a really good job of setting the mood.Over the duration of the story, Jiro learns about the (then) small world of feudal Japan and the remainder of the modern world. He even meets some significant historical figures along the way.One of the themes touched on by this movie is the question that the Japanese likely asked themselves during this era.. that is, ""If we become a modern nation, will we lose something in the process of doing so?""If you\'re into action anime, you\'ll enjoy this one.

When I first watched this title back in 1995, you could not tell me this anime was not amazing to look at. That opinion has certainly changed some but I still maintain that the animations and much of the choreography are amazing to watch.

Jiro, an orphan child, gets tangled in a wicked game of deceit driven by a powerful shogunate who seeks an item discovered by Jiro's father who once served under him. As the truth begins to unfold, it leads Jiro on a journey to uncover the mystery of his father's past as he fights to stay alive all the while.By the end of the film my stake in the characters quest for vengeance was through the roof and it may have been the biggest thing keeping me intrigued in what felt like a very lengthy film.The music during this period of anime was always enjoyable to me and Kamui No Ken is no different.The characters in this anime did not carry a great deal of gravity to them. For Jiro to have such a level head in all this calamity, it was quite unthinkable looking back at it and what mainly stuck with me throughout the film was the pure empathy that I felt for his plight.  Even as sadistic as the antagonist is, I felt nothing from him outside of the contempt that I had from his actions.My biggest take away's from this film is the insanely detailed plot and the ninja battles that took place. Outside of Ninja Scroll, there was nothing within the genre that was quite like it at the time and it is still mainly why I have such a high regard for this film.If you think Naruto had it bad, then I suggest you take a look and see what Jiro went through. It is this kind of story telling that kept me really engaged during this period of anime and it is ultimately why I can keep coming back to revisit this title time and time again. film in other anime like Naruto and Samurai Champloo, then you know this anime left a big impression.The story is not your average revenge tale and the twists were pretty mind blowing.

Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/667/Kashimashi__Girl_Meets_Girl,"[""Kashimashi is the story about a boy hit and killed by a spaceship, then aliens bring him back to life and reconstruct his body as that of a girl's because that's what they thought he was. Now that we're past the bogus premise, we can focus on the series as what it really is; a touching, thoughtful romance.After the smoke clears on the ridiculous catalyst, the series quickly turns into a love triangle between the newly-female Hazumu, the girl Yasuna whom Hazumu has always had a crush on, and Tomari who is Hazumu's childhood friend since he was a boy. The various reactions and plot...progression revolving around Hazumu's gender-bender are taken with extreme and realistic care, but just as the series picks up some serious steam, it is all exchanged for some needless episodes revolving around mostly useless supporting characters. Fortunately, the series dives back into the drama for the final round of episodes, demonstrating some serious characterization and relationship changes that make Kashimashi more than a throw-away love story.With a more thoughtful narrative comes more thoughtful characterization as well. Hazumu is a surprising character, not necessarily apathetic to his/her new gender, but not overdramatic about it either. The real shining stars in this drama though are Yasuna and Tomari. You know right off the bat Hazumu will end up with one of these girls (this IS labeled shoujo-ai after all), but they make the love triangle much more richly complex than it had to be with their own personal feelings. This is actually a good thing. Supporting characters are abound, mostly for comic relief, but they don't interfere with the main characters so they aren't too much of a distraction.The animation is pretty standard for today's anime, clean-looking and a relatively bright color pallette. It flows well throughout.The gentle melodies of the BGM are nice, but not particularly memorable. The OP is fair as well, but the ED deserves some special credit, being the melancholic gem of the music.Kashimashi is a series that, for me, becomes finer with every viewing and the subtleties to the characters shine more as well. It is a series that started with a ridculous premise and strived to overcome it's Achilles' heel to becomet he best romance it could be. Putting romance ahead of fanservice, Kashimashi is a delightful surprise of a series that, while a little cliched, never settles for being a cookie-cutter romantic drama.Overall I give Kashimashi an 8 out of 10 progression revolving around Hazumu's gender-bender are taken with extreme and realistic care, but just as the series picks up some serious steam, it is all exchanged for some needless episodes revolving around mostly useless supporting characters.

It started its run on May 21, 2004 in Dengeki Comic Daioh, with a new chapter released every month; currently, there are four volumes out.  The manga has been licensed Stateside by Seven Seas Entertainment, and the first volume was released on December 25th, 2006.A game based on the series, entitled &ldquo;Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~: Hajimete No Natsu Monogatari&rdquo;, was released on March 30, 2006, for the PlayStation 2, published by Marvelous...Interactive and developed by VRIDGE.  The game itself is a visual novel, and is rated 12+ by the Japanese rating system.And the anime itself was twelve episodes long, and ran in Japan from January 11 to March 29, 2006 on TV Tokyo.  Studio Hibari, who are also famous for &ldquo;Petite Cosette&rdquo; (2004) and &ldquo;Oroshitate Musical Nerima Daikon Brothers&rdquo; (2006), was the studio behind this show, and Nobuaki Nakanishi directed.  The anime has been licensed Stateside by Media Blasters as of October 2006, and runs under the title &ldquo;Girl Meets Girl&rdquo;.Story: Mkay, here's your basic series overview for Kashimashi:Boy (Hazumu) gets rejected by girl he's had a crush on (Yasuna), after being urged on by girl friend who may possibly have a crush on him (Tomari). Boy goes off by self, is slammed into by alien spaceship, which looks extremely phallic. Boy dies, is revived, and has a sex change.  Rest of series centers around boy-turned-girl&rsquo;s relationships with two aforementioned girls and others, and eventually ends up in a love triangle with the two girls.And that&rsquo;s Kashimashi&rsquo;s story in a nutshell. The story itself is full of plenty of twists and turns, and never plateaus.  You get to know each and every character that&rsquo;s involved in the main plot intimately.  It also has a tendency to get to you, because of the both of the above; this series is probably the closest I&rsquo;ve ever come to crying during an episode.The series ends up being a combination of screwball comedy, romance, with a hint of melodrama.  Frankly, that&rsquo;s a relief, considering that it easily could&rsquo;ve taken a turn into hentai or something of the like.  Fanservice does appear almost every episode, but it only plays a small part overall, and doesn&rsquo;t drive the series.The only gripes that I have are that some characters have a tendency to fall into certain roles, and that just about everyone seems to fall in love with Hazumu at some point or another.Warning: In case you haven&rsquo;t figured it out, this is a shojo-ai show.  That means there are girls kissing.  If you don&rsquo;t like that, stay away from this series.Art: The art for this series is absolutely beautiful.  The 2D is absolutely exquisite, and the colors they use take a turn towards either autumn or spring tones.  It&rsquo;s obvious when CG is used, sometimes, but, for the most part, it blends in well with the 2D.Music: Again, absolutely no gripes here.  The OP and ED don&rsquo;t particularly stand out, but they&rsquo;re nice, all the same, and the background music itself tends more towards use of piano and strings.  Might try and find it, as it&rsquo;s very relaxing.Seiyuu: I couldn&rsquo;t find anything wrong with the voices for this series.  Every voice  fit their respective character perfectly, and they sounded like I&rsquo;d expect their characters to.Dub: N/ALength: Just right.  Cutting a few episodes would&rsquo;ve made it too short, and, originally, twelve episodes didn&rsquo;t feel like enough, but the addition of the OVA was just what the series needed.  Any longer just wouldn&rsquo;t have felt right.Overall:  A nice romance/screwball comedy, with plenty of twists and turns, characters you care about, beautiful music and art, and perfect length.Story: 8/10Art: 8/10Music: 8/10Seiyuu: 8/10Length: 7/10Overall: 39/50; 78% (C) Interactive and developed by VRIDGE.

But I just... can't.I am a male-to female transsexual and a lesbian, and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ was one of the first anime/manga I discovered having to do with those subjects at the same time. So when my nerdy male pal recommended it, I had to stop everything I was doing to watch it immediately. Headdesking ensued.This was not because Kashimashi is shallow and trivial work and I had schoolwork piling up the entire time watching it consumed. It was because of the annoying and and outright insulting nature of it.While it...is not uncommon for any media, but anime/manga especially, to not have fully grasped the idea of transsexuality and hence the portraying of such characters and their trials and tribulations tends to be awkward, stereotyped, unrealistic and shallow, I often manage to find some new insights from the overall setting, even if it is there by just accident. This requires, however, that the characters are just plain dull and generic. In the case of Kashimashi they are not, they are way out on the negative scale, disturbing and annoying (or she is). Kashimashi takes all the imaginable half-assedness of handling such themes to a new level, treating the main character literally like an object for the first half. Both she does it herself, and all the males close to him suddenly turn into voyeurists and sex-maniacs. And she's supposed to be a normal girl here, the original Hazumu's Y chromosome just got misplaced with an X during his body's reconstruction with the alien technology. Give me a break! In works like Happiness! OVA this kind of behavior / reaction is justified, and actually manages to be both funny and thought-provoking because of that. Here, nothing is explained.Kashimashi is obviously oriented primarily for males with a fetish for a thought of themselves as lesbians (as a fantasy it's completely different thing from reality, after all lesbian porn is highly popular among men), or just extra kicks from the knowledge that a hot female used to be a guy. Probably both. That means, as you'd guess, the fanservice is inevitable. We can't just have Hazumu behave like any normal person in a bit strange new situations, we must have her be an complete idiot without any common sense. Or how many of you guys think if you suddenly were dressed in a skirt you would reflexively use it as a fan and having to have someone else to tell you that's not a good idea? Yep, this is what Kashimashi is largely about.The result of this is that actual lesbians, transsexuals, and ESPECIALLY transsexual lesbians, who would be interested in the show's premise will not be able to identify with the main character - unless of course they're exhibitionists - and will end up with mixed feelings with probably the negative ones triumphing the positive over time. The last thing you'll remember about Kashimashi will be the episodes consisting of nothing but fanservice comedy, and how they ruined all the potential.The last few episodes were like I would have wanted and expected the whole show to be like - serious, realistic drama. Still nothing outstanding.It has been a few years since I watched Kashimashi. And time has not goldened memories. I viewed it in the most positive light maybe two weeks after watching, when I compared it to other pure-fanservicey series and thought it stilll had some desperate trying (in this sense, I think of Kashimashi much the same way as of Code Geass R2). I still have very mixed feelings and don't know whether it should get 1 for completely ruining the good premise or 2-4 for having that good premise and a few relatively good episodes toward the end that make up for those preceding them.The last episodes have completely their own problems though. Another thing that highly pissed  me off was Yasuna's mental health problems and how they're handled. While I have never heard of a disorder which would prevent you from 'seeing' things associated with a traumatic experience, in this case, men (it is never explained though, how come she sees both effeminate males and rough tomboy girls), this is not the problem here. But at no point anyone, male or female, says to her straight on how wrong her twisted thinking is. They just go along with it and discreetly want her cured because it would easen her life. And for the time being, the girls just enjoy their being girls, and the guy(s) are excluded from any emotional scenes most if not all of the time. All notable male characters in Kashimashi are either borderline rapists or violents. I guess most feminists would like Kashimashi because of this.--Story - 4. The main setting is simple yet interesting and usable, however, badly executed. Also the whole Yasuna thing is so black-and-white and poorly handled, that while the latter half becomes progressively better on one level it stil retains the same level of stupidity and offensive undertone.Art - 2. Nothing ground-breaking in the animation section. Typical school and city and forest settings. All the girls are über cute and males dull-looking, like with all male-oriented fanservice series. And I happen not to like that, it's unrealistic and sexist. Also, the alien was just very, very ,very stupid looking. It was totally out of place among those über cute girls and immemorable guys. The designs also would subtract few points from the character section if you could get lower than 1.Sound - 4.  I think the opening theme is supposed to add to the 'girly' motif of the series, and while in a honestly girly series (where feminine caring is the main theme instead of bashing one group of people after another) it could have been perfectly in place and nice, now it just adds to my rage for being part of the 'how being a girly girl lesbian radical feminist is so much über alles' message. Nothing else is memorable.Character - 1. Main character who is pure fanservice machine and offensive to several minorities, the most ladylike girl on the planet who detests all 'normal' males because of her traumas up to the point she becomes completely unlovable, all 'normal' male characters being unemotional jerks? Definite 1.Enjoyment - 1. While it has got some good moments really, the bad things cause so much rage and nausea throughout the ride it would take something of a cosmic level of goodness to override those. Nothing of the drama / psychology / romance section is so touching it would be remembered.Overall -1.  After careful consideration, I decided to score Kashimashi only for it's distinctive themes, what it stands for. After all, you could make Nazi propaganda cartoon and it could manage to be entertaining, but it would still be Nazi propaganda. And that is.. male-oriented fetish fuel of various sorts and more or less subtle radical feminist / misandryist propaganda combined? There's little room for positive viewing of something like this.So, should you be a misandryist radical feminist who also happens to think that transsexuality is all about autogynephilia, e.g. getting sexual kicks from practicing exhibitionism with a female body, this is a series for you. All others, stay away, it can corrupt. is not uncommon for any media, but anime/manga especially, to not have fully grasped the idea of transsexuality and hence the portraying of such characters and their trials and tribulations tends to be awkward, stereotyped, unrealistic and shallow, I often manage to find some new insights from the overall setting, even if it is there by just accident.

The aliens managed to regenerate him however they made him into a girl and that&rsquo;s the beginning of this messed up gender bender.From the summary of the show it may be difficult to take this anime series seriously, however the way the first episode is done, actually allows you to do just that. It introduces the strange concept of a boy turning into a...girl fairly well, for an anime that is an adaptation of a visual novel. After that it is just Hazumu getting used to his new life and the affect it has had on those around him. The romance aspect of this anime moved fairly quickly, developments occurring in the first couple episode however after that, it quickly became dull. Of course it managed to end well, with a few twist added in, but it didn&rsquo;t feel original. Also what else were not original were the characters with their 2 dimensional personalities. Apart from the 3 main characters, the rest were pretty much there for comic relief or to fill in the quota.The animation is nothing short of beautiful, with cutely designed girls, which is pretty standard for this type of anime. The detailed environments add something to the look and even though there&rsquo;s also some CG used it isn&rsquo;t too noticeable, half the time.Apart from the usual silent moments, the music is pretty great and suited the show well. The OP and ED themes were somewhat catchy and there was a bunch of insert songs added every now and again, but it was the string symphony that added towards the ambiance.Overall this turned out to a good Yuri anime with a decent, heart-warming story to match. The comedy is very generic and stupid however you just can&rsquo;t help but laugh at this enjoyable and weird anime. What also helps is that something as insignificant as well spoken Engrish (in the Japanese dub) adds quality to the show, because it is so hard to find an anime where the Japanese can find people who can speak good Engrish. Well if you know what you&rsquo;ll expect from this series, then go ahead and watch, otherwise you should just stick to what you usually go for.^_^ girl fairly well, for an anime that is an adaptation of a visual novel.

In all honesty I want to call it a masterpiece, problem being I don't know why!  I mean seriously... boy runs into forest, gets run over by alien space ship... aliens turn boy in to girl, girl falls in love with girl breaking other girls heart, blah blah blah... Can the plot get any more retarded.  But... the way the story is told is captivating.  The characters are amazingly simple but effective.  It must have taken pure genius to make a boy that turned...into a girl be a very believable character and to top it off... he/she is a crybaby and a damn good one!?!  The killer about this story especially for guys who watch it.  The entire time your watching it your thinking:  Wow... why am I watching this.  I should think this is the worst anime ever made... but the reality is your liking it and the panty shots are far and few.I found myself seriously torn through the entire story:  Who is better for Hazuma, Yasuna or Tomari?!  To make matters worse, I honestly couldn't decide if the ending was right or not; and I think that is exactly what was supposed to happen.  Bravo on the way your emotionally involved in the stroy at ever step from Hazumu fanning air up his skirt to Tomari having a royal heart attack about it.  I'll be the first to say that there are no great leaps in anime  history in this series but as a total package I can't imagine it being done any better.  There are a few annoying parts of the story but nothing you can't get over.  The father dieing to bathe with his daughter thing gets old real quick and so does Namiko-Sense.  You'll hate her for just existing a few times in the series.  Over all, definately enjoyable.  It's pretty light hearted which is definately one of it's strong points and although your emotionally involved your not strangled by it's intensity either.Even if your dead set against the mere thought of this anime's existence, watch it!  If you approach it with an open mind and really allow yourself to be taken by the story you will not regret it.  Especially you guys, put away the manly pride.  It is definately worth a go. into a girl be a very believable character and to top it off... he/she is a crybaby and a damn good one!?!  The killer about this story especially for guys who watch it.  The entire time your watching it your thinking:  Wow... why am I watching this.  I should think this is the worst anime ever made... but the reality is your liking it and the panty shots are far and few.I found myself seriously torn through the entire story:  Who is better for Hazuma, Yasuna or Tomari?!  To make matters worse, I honestly couldn't decide if the ending was right or not; and I think that is exactly what was supposed to happen.

Now that I\'ve seen it, I can confidently say Kashimashi is a beautiful romance that unfortunately gets bogged down by the author trying to be funny.I was very thankful to see that the series was void of any transphobic themes or jokes and was generally pretty respectful. Only thing I find strange is that throughout the course of the story, people constantly refer to Hazumu...with male pronouns. There are some outliers sprinkled around here and there, but Hazumu doesn\'t ever object to being referred to one way or the other, so I\'m going to assume she\'s cool with it. Gender is a fuck, be whatever the hell you wanna be. Oh and for anyone concerned that Hazumu turns back into a guy at the end of the series—don\'t worry, she doesn\'t. She becomes a girl at the end of episode 1 and never goes back.The first two episodes consist of some very strange plot themes around aliens and... fanservice. They\'re unfortunately required for plot purposes, but if you can get past those two though, you\'ll finally be treated to the good stuff. Episodes 7 and 8, being the beach and ""test of strength"" episodes are basically filler and you could probably skip them entirely and only miss out on one or two important details. Basically any time you get a comedic scene you can just skip ahead until it\'s over to avoid any gross shit. Especially the dad, the dad is the WORST part of the show. I wish he just dropped dead.If you can grin and bear through all the bad stuff, or find an edit that removes all of it, you\'ll find the rest of the series is really touching and heartbreaking at the same time. I adore the three main characters and didn\'t want to see any of them hurt. I\'d elaborate further, but I don\'t want to spoil anything, but trust me, Hazumu, Yasuna, and Tomari are great and I love them. with male pronouns.

I\'m going to try to dig into nuances that might be easy to miss if you\'re just a casual watcher/reader, and try to keep spoilers to a minimum (but there will be some; you should watch the series for yourself first if you mind spoilers, and if you don\'t the ones here shouldn\'t affect your enjoyment). Also, it\'s gonna get pretty long.Let\'s start by saying Kashimashi is one of my favourite yuri works. The manga is slightly preferable but only slightly; overall, both it and the anime...are great stuff, sweet and earnest and with some true drama that never feels like they simply slammed the Drama Button. I won\'t go into a lot of detail up front about the basic plot, since I think the synopsis at the top covers that: Hazumu was a boy, now she\'s a girl, and all of her relationships change. Chaos ensues.Before we get into the meat of my review, I want to take a moment to mention the title: ""Kashimashi"" is an onomatopoeia that basically means ""blah blah blah"" or ""noisy"", but is only in reference to three or more women gossiping. Specifically, three or more. That it\'s used for a series that focuses on a love triangle between three young ladies is a stroke of brilliance that should be appreciated. Names are important.Also, quick note: the dub is awful. If you really can\'t watch subbed anime, then it can be charmingly bad if you don\'t mind charmingly bad dubs, but none of the VAs will be winning any awards for these performances - though some are not as bad as others. Reminds me of Tenchi Muyo! and other victims of the early process of English dubbing, though not nearly as terrible as the Speed Racer days. Just something to keep in mind for those of you who can watch either; subs are preferable. Anyway...First, I\'d like to address the issue of Hazumu\'s transition. Of course this transition is a ridiculous; it\'s a science-fictional version of suddenly being flipped to one gender from the other. Coming to this expecting an earnest, realisitc portrayal of transitioning genders is like going to McDonalds and expecting a Michelin 3-star restaurant. For that, you might want to read the Hourou Musuko manga. Keep in mind that the overall attitudes toward gender and sexuality in Japan are complex, and not the same as those of the Western world; that tends to colour every anime in ways that are hard to define. But that\'s too deep to get into for this one review.Let\'s look at our main character, Dude-Hazumu, at the beginning of the story. He\'s a boy who\'s always been highly feminine in the ways most people would view femininity. His best friend is a girl (and I mean Tomari; I think we can agree that his friendship with Asuta is mostly a survival mechanism for him, since he\'s not very masculine and he needs a ""guy buddy"" for support), his only thriving interest is in flowers and horticulture, and he has no desire to do anything sports-related, or ogle women with Asuta, or anything else typical of the average high school boy. Ayuki (another girl) is his only other friend, though not close as he is to Tomari or Asuta. Yasuna, the girl he\'s flower-buddies with but has a crush on, presents something he doesn\'t quite know how to navigate because (here\'s a red flag) HE DOESN\'T QUITE RELATE TO HER IN THE USUAL BOY-HAVING-A-CRUSH WAY. His confession to her in the first episode can be seen as just a really awkward love-declaration from a boy, but by the same token, it could be because he feels a little guilty for trying to change their important friendship, which is why he blurts it out like he\'s confessing to a crime - and only after encouragement to do so.Basically, the point I\'m trying to make is that Hazumu was always a closeted, blissfully-unaware trans woman. Because of Japanese attitudes towards gender (and let\'s face it, the same goes for a lot of the rest of the world, too), it\'s completely conceivable that she could have gone all that time without ever having considered the possibility that maybe her lack of masculinity is because she\'s not actually a man at all. There\'s sort of this unspoken expectation that anyone who\'s trans should have figured it out all on their own during early childhood, but without any queer friends or other transgender/transsexual examples to look to, she\'s content with being a feminine boy because she simply never thought about any alternative. It\'s a very ""it\'s something I can\'t change, so why worry about it?"" attitude. This carries over to her body being transformed, as well; she\'s shocked, but doesn\'t spend a great deal of time fretting over it since it\'s beyond her control.Now... about the crash itself and the transition. The ludicrous premise of the aliens landing is actually beautifully brilliant in an oblique way. Why would the aliens remake her body to be female? It\'s never stated openly, but considering how she was before the accident, her demeanor, and the fact that Yasuna could almost see her (I\'ll get into her Male Blindness later), it can be assumed that since her body was eradicated, they reconstructed it in the way that best matched her soul. Her brain chemistry seemed more ""girly"" to them, so they naturally constructed her that way. Later on, they reveal (spoiler!!) that their entire purpose on earth was to learn about love; it makes sense their instruments would be finely tuned into emotion and other spiritual aspects like those. Again, not realistic at all, but in a series that already has a spaceship that can transform into a cute, floating, ""-puu!"" exclaiming, pink-haired ""mascot"", let\'s not get TOO wrapped up in realism.On to Hazumu-The-Girl. There have been comments from other reviewers that ""common sense"" should have helped Hazumu\'s adapting to her new body be more smooth than it\'s portrayed, but would it really? Considering that her spirit was feminine but she has literally never been encouraged to EMBRACE that femininity throughout her entire life (during a flashback, when Lil Haz asks Lil Tomari if he can be her ""bride"", she immediately crushes that dream and says he has to be the groom. It\'s a pattern of gender reinforcement that probably came at her from all sides), of COURSE she wouldn\'t know things women take for granted, such as ""hold the back of your skirt as you walk upstairs so the boys won\'t see your panties"". How would someone who\'s never worn a skirt know that? The fanning of her skirt, thinking ""hey, it\'s nice that I can have a breeze in here, pants really suck apparently"" is such a pure, innocent moment of self-discovery; it\'s up to her friends to remind her that no, you can\'t do things like that in a world full of male gazes. So I think this period of adjustment is not only totally understandable, but also serves to add some needed whimsy to offset some of the more serious themes and keep it a fairly light-hearted anime/manga. Most of the character\'s attitudes and reactions feel completely natural for me, even if the premise itself isn\'t at all natural.That some moments do serve as very mild fanservice is understandable, but to be honest, the fanservice in this series is pretty negligible and doesn\'t even come CLOSE to ecchi levels. Thank God.One final thing about Hazumu, and this is a BIG SPOILER but too important to leave out. It\'s my opinion that, when later offered the option of de-transitioning by the aliens, the fact that she turns it down cements that she was always a woman from the very beginning. She\'s happier as a girl, things FIT for her now, and her friends have accepted her (some more reluctantly than others, as is normal; it helps that it\'s an accident that she couldn\'t control, otherwise there would be more realistic negative reactions from them if it were her choice to ""come out"" from the beginning). There\'s a lot of subtlety that could go unappreciated if you don\'t know to look for it, or if your mind is closed to spotting it.Let\'s move along to the other characters. It\'s tempting to write them off as two-dimensional or ""tropes"", but tropes are tropes for a reason; they represent real people, and they work. Besides, I think they defy their own tropes on multiple occasions.Yasuna presents an interesting challenge for the viewer/reader. How are we supposed to accept this girl doesn\'t see men? Well, actually... it\'s scientifically possible, even if used a little fantastically in this case. The condition is known as ""prosopagnosia"", and there are multiple variations and multiple causes. Whereas most patients suffering with face blindness never recover, some do, which especially in a case like Yasuna\'s that seems to be caused by a feeling of detachment from the male gender, seems as possible as her having the condition in the first place. Think about this from her perspective: she\'s never been able to see men, so she very naturally is only interested in women (whether or not she would have been from the beginning WITHOUT propsopagnosia is debatable; maybe the condition is a result of her sexuality, or maybe they\'re unrelated. Who knows? But it\'s fun to speculate). The first boy she can actually ALMOST-see is an immediate fascination for her, but she can\'t fully accept his confession of love, because he\'s not her type; she likes him as a friend, of course, but how could a romantic relationship develop if she can\'t even recognise his face? Hence her clear frustration and sadness with having to turn him down. The transition solves that for her in a wish-come-true fashion; how many of us have ever had thoughts such as ""Oh I like this girl a lot, if only she weren\'t my coworker/teacher/student/barista/cousin/driving instructor""? There are endless examples. If you take one of them, such as a barista where hitting on her at her job just makes you a douche, and then you run into her outside of work and strike up a conversation, the relief at that barrier being removed is HUGE, and something most of us can relate to (even if we\'ve never been that lucky haha). That\'s where Yasuna is living from episode 2 onward; a little bit stuck up yet lonely, because she\'s artistic and clearly affluent, but getting closer to Hazumu through her eager gratitude that she CAN helps her open up to other friendships, as well. Really, she\'s a very tragic character once they start exploring her more deeply. Though some could write it off as ""convenient,"" personally, I\'m a fan of where she is in the end of the series (but I won\'t get into that for spoiler reasons); it\'s a fitting and satisfying, optimistic point for her to end on.Tomari hits the classic childhood friend category, but I love her to pieces. Absolutely my favourite character. While mostly accurate, I think writing her off as ""tomboy tsundere"" does her a huge disservice. She\'s used to protecting Hazumu because she\'s always had to; that\'s what you do for friends. Of course it also frustrates her, as it does most people who have friends who seem to constantly need protection, and it actually becomes a point of contention between them often. She clearly cares deeply for everyone in her social circle (except maybe Asuta, though I think she doesn\'t mind him as much as she lets on). Her acceptance of Hazumu\'s transition is a long and twisted road; she\'s the one that misgenders her the most often in the beginning of the series. Even after her parents, Asuta, Yasuna, and everyone else have already come to accept it, Tomari still struggles, because under her surface annoyance with his ""wimpiness"", she\'s always harboured a deep affection for Hazumu and secretly been hoping they could be closer. Initially, she rejects this gender change because (as she\'s been told by a largely homophobic society - meaning ALL human society, not just Japan) this means they can\'t be together. Two women don\'t get married, right? That just doesn\'t happen. So she\'s understandably angry, frustrated, resistant. On top of that, sometimes people just really have a hard time with change. Still, even through this process she helps Hazumu buy a bra, protects her ""dignity"" on many occasions, tries to help even while she\'s irritated at having to help. Jealous of how Hazumu still flocks to Yasuna, but never wants to admit it. I won\'t go into spoilers about how that eventually resolves, but it moves me to tears.The side characters, I will say, aren\'t explored much but I don\'t find them as colourless as a lot of other reviewers seem to. Asuta is an idiot boy who suddenly wants to bang his best friend now that she\'s turned into a woman; we can safely assume that he might be a closeted bisexual who always felt some attraction to Hazumu, or that he simply really likes how Hazumu looks as a woman. Either/or. Ayuki is the most forgettable, but she\'s very quiet, always thinking more than she\'s talking; it would take a lot of metagaming to display anything more for her, though they do take an episode to show what\'s going on in her head a little better. The aliens are the plot foil, though I think they\'re both fun comic relief (when Hitoshi isn\'t outlining some of the deeper plot elements, such as why it was important for them to understand love by turning a hetero love triangle into a lesbian one. I mean, have you ever seen a shipper so intense they literally CREATED yuri?! But I\'m kidding). Namiko-sensei is hilarious, and she always makes me laugh even if she\'s pure comic relief. In closing, the side characters definitely stay on the sidelines, and I think that was smart; I\'m always annoyed at series that waste too much time on them when they aren\'t meant to be the focus in the first place. But they\'re pretty clearly defined and help round out the cast, so they do their job.One of my few caveats, and one a lot of people could have with the series, is the pervy father. It\'s nasty and I greatly dislike him for sexualising his ""new daughter"", HOWEVER... I think this is actually very clever satire; they show him being pervy, just enough to make your skin crawl (if you aren\'t equally pervy as the father haha), and then right afterward show the mom literally physically accost him for doing so. Seems more like a pot shot at other anime/manga with ""take a bath with Daddy"" scenes than anything. Plus it never goes TOO far.Now I\'d like to talk about Yasuna and Tomari. This could easily have gotten as Betty-And-Veronica ugly as most love triangles do, but this series was able to stay away from that. Yes, there\'s definitely some strife between them, but it\'s pretty minimal when all is said and done; and understandable. Also, Hazumu, the object of desire, is actually held accountable for her indecisiveness, which is something that rarely happens in a triangle. There are multiple occasions where it\'s made clear Yasuna and Tomari do care about each other, even if they are frustrated with losing Hazumu\'s attentions to the other sometimes. Everyone treats each other with care and at least SOME respect, and they are clearly struggling with their emotions; at no point does it feel like any of them views the others as a mere object or obstacle, even when jealousy rears its ugly head. (Quick side note, even Asuta, who does begin to objectify Hazumu, struggles with it because he realises she\'s still a PERSON; a lesser series probably wouldn\'t bother.) The resolution at the end is amenable, and I think is fair to all parties.The ending shocked me, because I thought I saw exactly how it would play out. It didn\'t; similar, sure, but it took a twist that made me quite happy. The manga version is a little more emotionally-charged (and I prefer it), but both it and the anime have a very satisfying, sappy, end point. That\'s why I\'ve read the manga twice and watched the series a few times, and would love to play the game. I\'m a sucker for a happy ending.Since this is already super long, I\'ll be brief with technical aspects: art style is beautiful, I always liked it, though the animation of this adaptation can seem a little stock at times - like Naruto for the first season or two, where it took the GORGEOUS manga art and boiled it down into something easy to animate. Japanese voicework is fantastic. The music is great, though nothing terribly memorable; I do find myself humming the opening now and then, and the ending theme stirs instant feels. The length, if including the specials, is just right; any longer and it would have dragged, and any shorter and it would feel rushed. Simply put, well done and worth watching.STORY/PLOT: 10/10CHARACTERS: 9/10ART STYLE: 9/10ANIMATION: 8/10MUSIC: 8/10VOICEWORK: 10/10 sub, 6/10 dubOVERALL: 9/10Before I wrap this up, I do want to mention that this is a review by a trans woman. While I can definitely understand how MOST trans women dismiss it as too fantastical, not realistic enough and thereby think it\'s damaging to the overall ""societal narrative"", I think if there was ever going to be a (for lack of a better term) silly, light-hearted, sci-fi story about a high schooler being turned into a girl by aliens, this is about the best you could hope for. It manages to convey a sweet, endearing yuri tale AND portrays a cursory glimpse into transitioning, despite the many pitfalls it could have fallen into along the way. Maybe in another ten years we could have anime deeply delving into gender and sexuality (I\'d love to see yuri NOT set in high school, or trans men and women living out their lives - especially if they aren\'t even the focal point of the series but merely shown as a regular person), but given the social climate at the time Kashimashi was made, I think it handled the subject with care and finesse. ""These feelings in my heart"" will always have a place there. are great stuff, sweet and earnest and with some true drama that never feels like they simply slammed the Drama Button. I won\'t go into a lot of detail up front about the basic plot, since I think the synopsis at the top covers that: Hazumu was a boy, now she\'s a girl, and all of her relationships change. Chaos ensues.Before we get into the meat of my review, I want to take a moment to mention the title: ""Kashimashi"" is an onomatopoeia that basically means ""blah blah blah"" or ""noisy"", but is only in reference to three or more women gossiping.

She clearly cares deeply for everyone in her social circle (except maybe Asuta, though I think she doesn\'t mind him as much as she lets on). Her acceptance of Hazumu\'s transition is a long and twisted road; she\'s the one that misgenders her the most often in the beginning of the series. Even after her parents, Asuta, Yasuna, and everyone else have already come to accept it, Tomari still struggles, because under her surface annoyance with his ""wimpiness"", she\'s always harboured a deep affection for Hazumu and secretly been hoping they could be closer. Initially, she rejects this gender change because (as she\'s been told by a largely homophobic society - meaning ALL human society, not just Japan) this means they can\'t be together. Two women don\'t get married, right? That just doesn\'t happen. So she\'s understandably angry, frustrated, resistant. On top of that, sometimes people just really have a hard time with change. Still, even through this process she helps Hazumu buy a bra, protects her ""dignity"" on many occasions, tries to help even while she\'s irritated at having to help. Jealous of how Hazumu still flocks to Yasuna, but never wants to admit it. I won\'t go into spoilers about how that eventually resolves, but it moves me to tears.The side characters, I will say, aren\'t explored much but I don\'t find them as colourless as a lot of other reviewers seem to. Asuta is an idiot boy who suddenly wants to bang his best friend now that she\'s turned into a woman; we can safely assume that he might be a closeted bisexual who always felt some attraction to Hazumu, or that he simply really likes how Hazumu looks as a woman. Either/or. Ayuki is the most forgettable, but she\'s very quiet, always thinking more than she\'s talking; it would take a lot of metagaming to display anything more for her, though they do take an episode to show what\'s going on in her head a little better. The aliens are the plot foil, though I think they\'re both fun comic relief (when Hitoshi isn\'t outlining some of the deeper plot elements, such as why it was important for them to understand love by turning a hetero love triangle into a lesbian one. I mean, have you ever seen a shipper so intense they literally CREATED yuri?! But I\'m kidding). Namiko-sensei is hilarious, and she always makes me laugh even if she\'s pure comic relief. In closing, the side characters definitely stay on the sidelines, and I think that was smart; I\'m always annoyed at series that waste too much time on them when they aren\'t meant to be the focus in the first place. But they\'re pretty clearly defined and help round out the cast, so they do their job.One of my few caveats, and one a lot of people could have with the series, is the pervy father. It\'s nasty and I greatly dislike him for sexualising his ""new daughter"", HOWEVER... I think this is actually very clever satire; they show him being pervy, just enough to make your skin crawl (if you aren\'t equally pervy as the father haha), and then right afterward show the mom literally physically accost him for doing so. Seems more like a pot shot at other anime/manga with ""take a bath with Daddy"" scenes than anything. Plus it never goes TOO far.Now I\'d like to talk about Yasuna and Tomari. This could easily have gotten as Betty-And-Veronica ugly as most love triangles do, but this series was able to stay away from that. Yes, there\'s definitely some strife between them, but it\'s pretty minimal when all is said and done; and understandable. Also, Hazumu, the object of desire, is actually held accountable for her indecisiveness, which is something that rarely happens in a triangle. There are multiple occasions where it\'s made clear Yasuna and Tomari do care about each other, even if they are frustrated with losing Hazumu\'s attentions to the other sometimes. Everyone treats each other with care and at least SOME respect, and they are clearly struggling with their emotions; at no point does it feel like any of them views the others as a mere object or obstacle, even when jealousy rears its ugly head. (Quick side note, even Asuta, who does begin to objectify Hazumu, struggles with it because he realises she\'s still a PERSON; a lesser series probably wouldn\'t bother.) The resolution at the end is amenable, and I think is fair to all parties.The ending shocked me, because I thought I saw exactly how it would play out. It didn\'t; similar, sure, but it took a twist that made me quite happy. The manga version is a little more emotionally-charged (and I prefer it), but both it and the anime have a very satisfying, sappy, end point. That\'s why I\'ve read the manga twice and watched the series a few times, and would love to play the game. I\'m a sucker for a happy ending.Since this is already super long, I\'ll be brief with technical aspects: art style is beautiful, I always liked it, though the animation of this adaptation can seem a little stock at times - like Naruto for the first season or two, where it took the GORGEOUS manga art and boiled it down into something easy to animate. Japanese voicework is fantastic. The music is great, though nothing terribly memorable; I do find myself humming the opening now and then, and the ending theme stirs instant feels. The length, if including the specials, is just right; any longer and it would have dragged, and any shorter and it would feel rushed. Simply put, well done and worth watching.STORY/PLOT: 10/10CHARACTERS: 9/10ART STYLE: 9/10ANIMATION: 8/10MUSIC: 8/10VOICEWORK: 10/10 sub, 6/10 dubOVERALL: 9/10Before I wrap this up, I do want to mention that this is a review by a trans woman. While I can definitely understand how MOST trans women dismiss it as too fantastical, not realistic enough and thereby think it\'s damaging to the overall ""societal narrative"", I think if there was ever going to be a (for lack of a better term) silly, light-hearted, sci-fi story about a high schooler being turned into a girl by aliens, this is about the best you could hope for. It manages to convey a sweet, endearing yuri tale AND portrays a cursory glimpse into transitioning, despite the many pitfalls it could have fallen into along the way. Maybe in another ten years we could have anime deeply delving into gender and sexuality (I\'d love to see yuri NOT set in high school, or trans men and women living out their lives - especially if they aren\'t even the focal point of the series but merely shown as a regular person), but given the social climate at the time Kashimashi was made, I think it handled the subject with care and finesse. ""These feelings in my heart"" will always have a place there.', 'Gender Benders are my personal favorite, By the exception of ""Kashimashi: Girl meets Girl"" Oh god that anime still makes my blood boil, The message of the creator and the labeling of the tittle and genre totally contradict eachI\'m not an expert in romance but i\'m quite the observer and use common sense, when creating ""Yuri"" based on GENDER BENDING, Timing is crucial, The 2 female characters in love, Had history with ""Hazumu"" the gender bending victimA) Was a childhood friendB) Was a classmate and love interestIf it was to be a ""Yuri"" romance, Hazumu the character in question.  had to have...no ties whatsoever to the heroines , Thus creating a chance in which the heroines fall for the after known female ""Hazumu"" Thus making it ""yuri genre"", If it\'s done before their history and timing of infatuation causes It\'s ""Yuri"" Genre to be  automatically ""NULLED"". making the author and labelers complete morons1.

Everything will be fine.', ""Kashimashi started as a yuri manga by Akahori Satoru, the same writer behind the generic Bakuretsu Hunters. He was also one of the writers for Kyatto Ninden Teyandee, which was pretty decent. In 2006, the manga got adapted into a twelve episode anime, and a follow up one episode OVA, by Studio Hibari, the same studio behind the mediocre Venus Versus Virus. So, given the people behind it can we anticipate something that's mediocre or just all right or will it surprise us in a positive or negative way? Let's look at Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl and find find out. Keep in mind, I will...be covering both the series and OVA.Story:We open with young Hazumu wandering around some hills to get over his broken heart after he was turned down by Yasuna, the girl he likes. The melancholy scene is interrupted by a spaceship crashing into him. But it's okay, they reconstruct him, just in a female body. Apparently these aliens can rebuild someone who gets mangled by their ship, but they can't figure out their gender or reverse their reconstruction process. Thus he begins his new life in his female body while caught in a love triangle with Yasuna and his childhood friend, Tomari. Strange, I thought this was a yuri romance, not a romance about a cis man who becomes a trans man due to bizarre and stupid circumstances.Let's start with the faults of the series, and there are a lot in this one. The first problem is that the romance is really melodramatic. We're talking bad soap opera levels. It's not just really stupid, but it clashes with the various attempts at humour. Speaking of, the comedic elements in this are absolutely horrible. One of our big jokes is that the teacher takes pratfalls, which could work except that they're ridiculously forced. To name an example, there's a scene where someone suddenly shouts in class, the teacher hops backwards on one leg thrice or four times and falls out the window. How does anyone manage that? The clumsiest person on the planet couldn't be that clumsy if they tried. However, compared to the other big joke in this series, that's comedic gold. The second major joke we get over and over and over again is that Hazumu's father acts like a creepy incestuous pervert towards his son now that he has a female body. That's not funny, it's creepy. It's vile. It's nauseating. But it's okay because his wife hits him for it and we all know that domestic abuse makes attempted incestuous relations between father and child okay. Wait, it doesn't help at all.There's also the dialogue to consider. It's really badly done. There's one scene where one of the other girls is talking to Hazumu and it's supposed to be really sad and dramatic, but she's talking about his future children and grandchildren. Which is odd since he has a body that's biologically female and his potential love interests are both girls. If we're going to give her credit, we could assume that she's talking about adopted kids or possibly children obtained through one of the processes that allow two women to have children together, but it still feels like an incredibly awkward and idiotic thing to bring up in context. There's also the basic premise itself. We're supposed to believe that these advanced aliens can reconstruct a human body, but can't reverse the process or figure out what someone's sex is? Even for a work that has a lot of “comedic”elements, that's pushing it.Then we have the biggest problem with the series. The fundamental flaw that really makes the whole thing irredeemable. This is a supposedly yuri series that seems to actively abhor yuri. It's like Ice in that regard. Every single character who gets involved with someone of the same sex has to have some convoluted, nonsensical reasoning behind it. For Hazumu, it's that he's a boy who had his DNA mucked with by aliens. For Tomari it's that she liked him when he was still a boy and that makes it okay. Yasuna also liked him as a boy but she gets the additional element of not being able to see men except as shapeless blobs. She must have the same plot contrivance disease as Kei did in Onegai Teacher, just with different symptoms. There are a few girls who offhandedly mention liking Tomari, but they also say she's like a boy. Could you imagine how much it would weaken Sasameki Koto, Blue Drop, Sakura Trick, Grand Pilgrimage or any other yuri work if the writer spent a lot of time coming up with insulting explanations for why the girls liked other girls? It would be a really stupid decision especially since you don't need an overly complicated explanation. Some people are just attracted to the same sex. It's not a big deal.Characters:The characters don't help matters. A lot of the side characters exist for a single joke, just one that gets repeated throughout, and don't really have personalities. Even the main cast is just made up of weak stereotypes. The result is that we get a cast that ranges from actively annoying to just being badly done.Art:The art in this is kind of weak, but not all that bad. The main problem with it is just that it's lazy with environments that lack detail and character designs that don't seem to be trying. It's odd because there's a computer that gets given a female body based on Hazumu's and we're told that she looks like him, but all the girls in this have basically the same face so I don't know how you'd be able to tell without the exposition. Even the alien spaceship is boring looking.Sound:This is one of those series where they got talented actors but you wouldn't know it to hear their performances in this. Our main trio is voiced by Horie Yui (also the voice of Nepgear), Tamura Yukari (the voice of Nanoha) & Ueda Kana (the voice of Toosaka Rin). All three of them are really good actresses who have given some amazing performances. The problem is that their characters don't really have anything to them and their performances come across as weak. They don't get it as badly as some of the actors for supporting characters. Mizutani Yuuko & Yasumura Makoto both sound terrible in this with really exaggerated performances that are just obnoxious to listen to. Hosoi Soshi's music is forgettable but inoffensive.Ho-yay:There's a little. Hazumu's friend, Asuta starts to develop a thing for Hazumu based on Hazumu's new female body. There's also the disturbing stuff with Hazumu's father and the girls who mention liking Tomari because she's like a boy.Final Thoughts:Kashimashi is complete rubbish. The romance is overly melodramatic. The characters are pants. The comedy is painful and disturbing. There are a lot of things that are completely stupid. Then we have its biggest failing. It's a supposedly yuri series, but not really, that seems to have serious problems with yuri existing. My final rating for Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl is a 2/10. Next week I'll look at Koutetsujou no Kabaneri.

Next week I'll look at Koutetsujou no Kabaneri. It would be hard for it to not be better than this."", 'As a huge yuri fan I was happy to find out that Kashimashi isn\'t quite your typical girl-loves-girl romance. It\'s so much more and in this review I\'ll try my best to explain why I think so.First of all, apart from the slightly absurd first episode (check the story summary) this anime is very calm and down-to-earth. Nothing about it is rushed, or exaggarated or extreme. I\'m pointing this out because this is a very strong quality in anime, and even more so in the yuri genre. In most yuri anime relationships tend to be very exaggarated and, well, too perfect.This is not the...case with this anime.Story: 8Read the plot summary. This isn\'t the best story ever offered in anime, but it does stick out when we\'re talking about purely romance stories. The gender bending aspect is used as wisely as possible and it moves the story in unlikely directions, making the anime unpredictable and fun. Some would point out the ""deus-ex machina"" aspect of the first episode\'s ending as a major weakness in the plot, but this is not the case. It\'s actually a strength and makes way for the second reason I think this anime is special: it\'s light hearted spirit.Art: 8Very bright, beautiful and light hearted. A lot of flowers, eye candy nuances and at times, beautiful sceneries. Other than that it\'s nothing special. There is some occasional CG, which is used fairly well. Couldn\'t ask for more in this anime\'s case.Sound: 7Nothing outstanding but there are some good moments. As other reviewers may have pointed out, the ending theme is quite good and has a slightly melancholic tone. The opening theme is, well, cute and sets the mood, some background music pieces in the anime, especially in the more dramatic moments are spot-on.Character: 9In my opinion, this anime\'s strongest side. There is some very serious character development going on, especially in the main character, Hazumu\'s case. He starts out as a shy and not particularly sociable boy, hindered by his effeminate nature in his male body. Others expect him to be more masculine which he cannot help, but his transformation changes all this. The female Hazumu gradually gets more comfortable in his own flesh, becomes sociable and charming and his life gradually gets a lot better. As time progresses he also becomes more feminine, finally being able to relieve the pressure from his heart.Yasuna is also very interesting. She\'s a classmate of Hazumu\'s who\'s also pretty quiet and lonely, but also very beautiful and cute. Despite all this she doesn\'t have any ""suitors"" which is due to her having an unusual, dark secret, revealed later in the anime.Tomari is your typical violent, coarse tomboy. She\'s a childhood friend of Hazumu and will crush anyone who means him no good. I didn\'t find her particularly likeable at first because I\'m not really fond of this type of characters but by the end she had me won over. She might certainly look like that typical sledgehammer bearing ""BAKA"" spitting anime demon woman, but in her heart she\'s hardly anything like that. The firefly scene with her has to be one of the most beautiful and heartwarming moments I\'ve witnessed in anime.The supporting characters are nice, if mostly for comic relief, and they work well. I didn\'t like the teacher as she was a bit TOO comical, but she might appeal to some. My favorites were definately mr. Sora and Jan Pu, and they did give me a few good laughs.Enjoyment: 10I definately enjoyed the anime and would watch it again. It made me feel good and content about life. As I said, everything about it was so down-to-earth and light hearted. It flows perfectly and makes you feel good, which is the exact point of this type of anime. Everything which is unnessecary about romance and shojo-ai anime is gone here. All that\'s left is the essence, what truly matters.Overall: 10Since it\'s a yuri anime, and a yuri of this quality is a truly rare occurrance I\'m giving this a definite 10. Most of you wouldn\'t, but in Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl I found that it has what more than 90% of romance animes lack: a spirit. A love triangle that\'s actually unencumbering to watch and a story that goes in many ways at once. An ending which doesn\'t make you feel bad about any of the characters. All that I love about yuri and romance in general I have it in Kashimashi, and I\'m thankful it exists and for what it gave me. case with this anime.Story: 8Read the plot summary.

She might certainly look like that typical sledgehammer bearing ""BAKA"" spitting anime demon woman, but in her heart she\'s hardly anything like that. The firefly scene with her has to be one of the most beautiful and heartwarming moments I\'ve witnessed in anime.The supporting characters are nice, if mostly for comic relief, and they work well. I didn\'t like the teacher as she was a bit TOO comical, but she might appeal to some. My favorites were definately mr. Sora and Jan Pu, and they did give me a few good laughs.Enjoyment: 10I definately enjoyed the anime and would watch it again. It made me feel good and content about life. As I said, everything about it was so down-to-earth and light hearted. It flows perfectly and makes you feel good, which is the exact point of this type of anime. Everything which is unnessecary about romance and shojo-ai anime is gone here. All that\'s left is the essence, what truly matters.Overall: 10Since it\'s a yuri anime, and a yuri of this quality is a truly rare occurrance I\'m giving this a definite 10. Most of you wouldn\'t, but in Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl I found that it has what more than 90% of romance animes lack: a spirit. A love triangle that\'s actually unencumbering to watch and a story that goes in many ways at once. An ending which doesn\'t make you feel bad about any of the characters. All that I love about yuri and romance in general I have it in Kashimashi, and I\'m thankful it exists and for what it gave me.', ""Kashimashi is a perfect example for a truly magnificent anime. It stands out in a crowd of anime that anyone could watch. It is a trip of wonderment that viewers will never forget. But what makes it that great? Well, let's have a look see.Story: I don't have to tell anyone that this is a unique story line. It's story really is fascinating. It's like the Yin-Yang of anime. It is completely normal at times, and at other times, seem fucked up. But both of these aspects are balanced well, compliment each other and are executed perfectly. Another thing, it is paced excellently. The episodes...run with each other to create a story. It doesn't move too fast or too slow. It really know how to use your emotions as well. It actually feels like you're watching someone's life rather than an anime.Characters: All of the characters are good and entertaining, and you would find something to love, or at least like about them. They all feel like people, and you can understand how each of them feel. They are really human.Art: It may seem simplistic, but that's what makes it good. It's simple, realistic, and easy on the eyes. It's not flashy, or dark, or what have you, it's just simple. It again feels like Life is breathed into the anime.Sound: The voice actors are all talented and do a good job as the characters they play. The OST is just brilliant. Normally, I'm a loud, blaring music, so the soft, melodic music in here normally isn't my style, but damn. This is awesome. It sets the mood perfectly. It makes you feel what you're supposed to feel during the scene that's playing. It is pure ear candy.Overall: This might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's worth checking out at least. It is a masterpiece and deserves all the good credit it gets. 10/10 run with each other to create a story. It doesn't move too fast or too slow. It really know how to use your emotions as well.

Concerning Art and Sound the series is in my opinion and experience rather OKAY. There were better made anime in that time but there were much much worse ones.The storytelling and the idea of the anime are pretty okay too. But what really ticks me off about this series is the obvious forceful behaviour to push and pull a non-heteronormative person into their predefinied position in society. Because of external influence a boy becomes a girl. That is a rather modern concept of breaking...the habits and the rules our society embodies concerning the sexes. But the entire show focuses on ridiculing the ""unnormal"" behavior of a boy who is in the body of a girl and of the surroundings that tries to force this ""unnormal"" person into the heterosexual heteronormativity or reacts with great irritation because a girl dont act in the way she is expected to.The protagonist themself is written in a way that they is nothing more than a pawn in the hands of those who decide how the society has to be and is completely denied to find their own way.This series reflects in my opinion the normative, sexist and forceful aspects of modern society in which there is still no completely accepted place for intersex and transgender people either let alone for men and women who dont want to be restrained and repressed by the rules of their secietal sex. the habits and the rules our society embodies concerning the sexes.

The expectation of most love story is: guy loves girl guy tells girl guy and girl go out. For love triangles the guy chooses the one he knows the most. But for this series they screw around with your mind till you had enough. In the end I found it all mad sense and it all was worth the time. "", 'kashimashi is one of those anime that make no sense but people really love..and i can see y this anime is amazing..... it starts of with a boy called hazumu who by some quite odd scences is now a girl..Then the girl that had rejected him early that day, Yasuna, and his friend, Tomari, both fall in love with Hazumu. even though the anime i very one minded with loads of characters i only focuses on a few..Story..the story is nothing sort of amazing.. a quite wierd start but in the end everything came together great even if it meant watching the ova.. all in...all i give the storyline a 10.Art..the art is nothing more than what you expect from a well made anime  with some parts that stick out. And other bits that are quite dissapointing it gets no more than a 10.Sound...hhhmmmm.... sound...... well it worked on my computor....8Characters......like i said a very variaty of charcters but very dissapointing how they only focused on a few even some quite inportant main charactors ended up being pushed to the side,,9Enjoyment....it may have took a few episodes but i REALLY enjoy and i would definatly recommend it to anyone who asks.Overall...i give a nice 10/10 yeah all i give the storyline a 10.Art..the art is nothing more than what you expect from a well made anime  with some parts that stick out.

This is um… something a little different then what I have ever seen before. I give the show props for an idea, but an extremely lousy way of making that idea bare fruit. The story feels shallow, the execution is bland, the English voices are a mess, the animation is just standard fan fair. I would of loved if they got into the physiological aspects of a man turning into a women a bit, but they don’t. They just pussyfoot around like it’s a teenage drama. I know it is one but with a concept this interesting, I wish it could have been...better done.Hazumu really freaken sounds and acts like a girl! It doesn’t seem like there is any freaken difference to him being male or female. I do think its somewhat Ironic that when he first sees the ‘star’ coming straight at him, he wishes to be manlier and yet he was turned into a woman. And then after he’s a woman, he accepts it rather fast to the point of saying that nothing really changed. (Kurai: “WHAT THE FUCK!? How can he act like nothing changed at all! When you turn me, I freaken hate it!”) All the characters act really stupid and it’s hard for me to even feel for any of them at all. His parents are the worst to because they just are way to excitable. (Akuma: “Excitable? Her Dad a big fat pervert!” Angel: “Alright, ya, I’m trying to make things better then they are.” ) They look at her as if nothing happened at all and start treating him like a girl the day she gets back home. Everyone around her acts as though she should know exactly how to be a women when she doesn’t know the first thing about it. It pisses me off slightly in that aspect because none of the characters seem to think how she feels. If we really get right down to it, it wouldn’t make any difference weather she turned into a girl on her own with a operation or with space aliens. In fact, it would be better if it was a operation then alien because then it would be more believable.Tomari was doing nothing for him when he was a guy it seems, and treated him like a child that needed protection all the time. It makes me wonder if she is the one that’s the reason that he never became a manlier guy. The whole second episode was pretty much Tomari saying don’t do this, don’t do that and don’t act like a man but she does it rather harshly. We do get into the physiological aspects of her dealing with a friend that changed into a guy but it sometimes feels bland.Yasuna on the other hand is awkward. It’s almost like she can’t see any men at all and only a hazy look to them when she can. I’m not sure what the hell they did that for because they could of just as easy say she was into girls instead and it would be so much better. It would of actually been closer to a real life story.This is more of the story that centers around everyone around Hazumu rather then Hazumu herself. We only learn about everyone else and their feelings, and only a little bit of Hazumu’s thoughts and feelings in the first part. When we do learn about Hazumu’s feelings, it feels a bit to late, as we have to go through a lot of crap to get there. Sadly, every single character falls for Hazumu, which makes the damn thing a harem anime.I have problems when Aliens look exactly like the humans without much difference to them. I also have big problems with the fact that the aliens crash into him, turn him into a woman, and then just leave him to the world. They pretty much do nothing to help him. And when they do show up, they just make things even worse for her. She ends up having a ‘clone’ of herself. (Akuma: “That’s a clone? She doesn’t look like her at all for crying out loud! We look closer then they do and we are just twins!”) Yes… clone… with light pink hair that will not stop hanging on her.The animation is really based for the fan service. We have a lot of naked shots of girls changing and just doing random stuff. It’s pretty standard and just basic. Many times, they seem to cop out and not even draw the background of go for the close up on the faces. They also do the fucken close ups on the breasts and body too which make me smack my head into the wall.I have problems with the English voice. Male Hazumu sounds so much like a girl that I see no difference in him being male or female. Tomari sounds more like a boy then he does as a guy! Everyone else sounds so much like a whiny little girl that it just bothers me a lot. The script is so cheesy that I just want to smack the writer. No really, its really really bad! The words sound so much like the person is just reading lines without any feeling what so ever. Even when they do have emotion, it sounds forced. It’s also done rather close to the translation so it feels really choppy. People keep saying ‘it is’ instead of ‘it’s’ and all this other problems. I just want it to end! Though the voices do get a little better (more on the lines that I had to get used to it for necessity rather then it being good) like around the 5th episode, it feels a little late. better done.Hazumu really freaken sounds and acts like a girl!

For me, Kashimashi Girl Meets Girl is one of those shows.The premise of this show was great: we have a guy who is in love with a girl, gets rejected, turns into a girl by some bizarre accident and then maybe has a second chance in winning this girl's affection, this time in a yuri way. Once that accident happened at the end of episode 1...I was as hyped as I've could have been, and if someone would ask me to rate this show right then and there I would have given it a 9. But, unfortunately, it was not meant to be.The two biggest problems with this show were the story and the characters. Sound was OK, art was fine and the OP wasn't bad either, but the story was, well, basically shit. This is first and foremost a romance anime, so it should do good in that aspect of the show, but it didn't. The show used cliché upon cliché: I've stopped counting for the number of times a character in the love triangle just happens to walk in on the other two at exactly the right moment. I mean, if that happens once or maybe twice it is still a bit cringy, but I can deal with that. But when that happens nearly every episode or so and most of the drama comes from those encounters, you have a badly written story. The overload of clichés and the weird turns the story suddenly makes, along with Yasuna's main plot point, are what ruined this story and by extension this show for me.But wait! There's more!The characters in this show also really suffered from poor writing. We have mister/misses protagonist Hazumu who is nice and all but A: adapted to being a girl really freaking quickly, and B: is as indecisive as you can get, miss initial love interest Yasuna, who starts out as a selfish bitch in my opinion but gets better sometime later, only to get me to dislike her again right before the end, miss childhood friend Tomari who is was rooting for from the start, but also managed to gain my disliking near the end of the show, and a bunch of side-characters who acted as comic relief and actually did that fairly well... but then disappeared halfway through the series and didn't come back. Whyyyyy?In short, I really hoped this would be a great show but it let me down. I'm quite sad about that, especially since there is almost no chance that someone else also used this setting and plot, but did it right this time.You should watch this if:- You just want to see a bunch of cute girls who are in love with each other- You really like love triangles- You like a good laugh (only the first few episodes really)You shouldn't watch this if:- You like yuri and you have high expectations for this show- You like a well written (love) story- You are easily annoyed by clichésInitial score: 9/10Final score: 6/10[By the way, this is my first review, so please feel free to tell me if I did something wrong or did something right!] I was as hyped as I've could have been, and if someone would ask me to rate this show right then and there I would have given it a 9.

Then the girl that had rejected him early that day, Yasuna, and his childhood friend, Tomari, both fall in love with Hazumu. As the story progresesses it can get a little sappy at points, but the story is otherwise enjoyable, Although I wish they did more with Hazumu's friend Asuta's feeling of Hazumu after he is transformed into a girl. The art is absolutly fantastic and the characters were well developed. I highly recommend this anime to everybody "", ""This was a huge let down for me. I knew it wouldn't be as good as Maria Watches Over Us but I hoped for something at least interesting. Poor characters don't help the boring story. Bad run on jokes, a poor thought out romance, and overly dramatic plot twists with the most pointless central idea of a boy turned into a girl make it even worse. Yasuna's weird illness just becomes stupid the instant its mentioned. Hazamu is unlikable as either a boy or girl. I can't say enough bad things about this show. "", ""Honestly, I am not good at writing reviews especially in this situation. Hashimashi is my favorite anime of all time it hits you on every level from super funny to just straight depressing. This show made me reflect a lot on my life and while it probably doesn't deserve all tens (what does?). It has greatly affected my life in ways I do not know how to explain; this show is the embodiment of what makes love so special and also how important it its to be able to balance the mixture of friendship and romance. Kashimashi is a masterpiece it cuts down to the...core roots of what love really is about. This show is about trying to juggle between love and friendship and not everyone can win. I have never been so emotionally involved with and anime than this one although Strawberry Panic is pretty damn close (maybe better depending on my mood). Anyway I know this might not seem helpful due to my personal bias, but believe me if this is a genre you like your gonna love this show.

And oddly enough, it turned out as something of perfection.Although at first it may sound either like some junky fanservice anime, or something just plain weird, I\'ll tell you right now that the ""core"" of the series isn\'t about Hazumu\'s gender change, it was something more of an initial gimmick. But for a gimmick, it worked well and evrn tied itself into the larger, real story in an oddly natural way.I consider one of the most important points in a series its \'heart\'. Kashimashi fully succeeded in having heart to it. The characters, from the dynamic characters of...Hazumu, Tomari and Yasuna, to even more static characters like Jan-puu and Ayuki, were likable and easy to understand. When the series took its turn for the emotional, we got to see deeper in every character\'s heart. Some characters like Asuta and Hazumu\'s dad were only for the purpose of humor. It got mildly repetitive, but in the long run, it added to the complete package.The way the last few episodes were done amazed me. Totally unexpected from something that at first seemed so trivial and weird.I would complain a bit about this anime\'s slow and goofy first few episodes, but then I realized it was the series\' way to really get the feel of the atmostphere and characters so that the ending would feel even stronger and more like every character grew. And Hazumu has to be one of the nicest, sweetest characters I\'ve ever known.Tomari was my personal favorite, her emotions were everywhere and she went from a playful, brash tsundere-type to a broken, stubborn character, to a deeply caring girl with a huge heart. And there was Yasuna, who\'s story was the most outright emotional. Explaining more about Yasuna though, would lead to spoilers.The sound and art were standard. Girly soundtrack and a very nice ending theme. The emotional tracks were well done and added greatly to the mood, but the rest of the tracks were a bit forgettable.The art style was adorable and pretty, yet it was a bit bland. Since the anime was made in 2006, I wouldn\'t call it bad. I\'d call it standard.The character designs I felt were great though.Kashimashi is a series where you can laugh and cry with the characters, and the ending provides with a very warm, fuzzy feeling that lasts for a while.

In short, it was a well-done and sweet series.Story: 7Art: 6Sound: 7Character: 9Enjoyment: 8Overall: 8', ""I just needed to post thisi was introduced to anime when i was young and Ive watched countless series but this was the first anime that i actually cried about its just so sad,i was told it was silly because the anime was about a guy that got turned into a girl but its not about that really its just a way to get the story rolling but i really cried on  the later episodes when there all so confused about the relationship between the three girls and there all so hurt by the fact that it takes so long for Hazumu Osaragi...to make her decision that it tears them all apart and when Yasuna Kamiizumi looses her sight to the ill treated love between the three i really had to stop watching it then i had to calm down and continue.i know its weird for a guy to cry over something so simple but it reminded me of when i couldn't tell my first love how i felt about her and at the time i worked up enough courage.i moved to another town and didn't see her again the same way it was for Yasuna Kamiizumi.this brought up too many memories so for me this anime was very good but it made me very sad and i really felt for the characters in kashimashi girl meets girl.that's why i rate this anime so highly,even though its only 12 episodes they did a great job making it. to make her decision that it tears them all apart and when Yasuna Kamiizumi looses her sight to the ill treated love between the three i really had to stop watching it then i had to calm down and continue.i know its weird for a guy to cry over something so simple but it reminded me of when i couldn't tell my first love how i felt about her and at the time i worked up enough courage.i moved to another town and didn't see her again the same way it was for Yasuna Kamiizumi.this brought up too many memories so for me this anime was very good but it made me very sad and i really felt for the characters in kashimashi girl meets girl.that's why i rate this anime so highly,even though its only 12 episodes they did a great job making it."", ""The storyline is a bit weird. Aliens? Come on now. I think they could've taken out the aliens and the way Yasuna can't see guys (then later on, no one) and it would've been a decent storyline about teenage girls who happen to have feelings for each other. Why did Hazumu need to go from a guy to a girl? I don't really see the point in that. Other than all that weirdness, it was a cute little romance anime. "", ""(Note: Not a full review; I've yet to watch the final 3 episodes)Alright, don't judge me.  Yes, yes, I watched a yuri.  Me, lover of serious anime, lover of things I can respect, hater of fluff, watched a yuri.And I kind of enjoyed it.Yeah, it was cutesy, but I was surprised by how much substance it had, compared to my expectations.  And for what it was, it definitely accomplished its goal.Story: 6This is probably the weakest area for me.  The premise is... yeah, let's face it, the premise is pretty stupid.

Sure, they were characterized with gimmicks, but they themselves were well-developed and human.  In particular, I really loved Yasuna - yes, I am aware that the writers were using every cheap trick in the book to make her a sad woobie, but I hardly even cared because it worked so well.That said, there were too many side characters.  A lot of them were supposed to be funny, but they all fell flat for me.  Most notable was Hazumu's dad, who was just plain creepy - father-daughter incest is not funny at all.  I kind of wish the writers had just focused on the main characters, because none of the side ones worked.Enjoyment: 8*sighs*  I mean, there were just lots of funny moments, from the main characters.  And the writers did a great job of making them human and relatable.  The love triangle was engaging and surprisingly realistic, and it was just really easy to get invested in.

They hit some right notes along the way, for example the scenes where Hazumu is learning to cope with her gender change, but the majority of the show felt pretty bland and unoriginal, and I had to force myself a little bit near the end in order to finish.The (extremely cheesy/cliché) OVA clears up any questions resulting from the shows ending, and while I was happy to see things work out for Tomari in the end (the only good character in the show), the OVA felt...forced and a little bit unnecessary.On an unrelated note, the show's OP and ED were both very relaxing and enjoyable to listen to. forced and a little bit unnecessary.On an unrelated note, the show's OP and ED were both very relaxing and enjoyable to listen to."", ""I watched the dubbed version of this. It started out really weird and it was easily a wtf anime. It's just got this strange vibe to it. The characters are quite likeable - it's easy for me to hate characters, especially girls, but I couldn't hate any of them in this anime. It wasn't the most entertaining and the story can be pretty repetitive but for 13 episodes, it's not terrible. I did find myself laughing and smiling a few times, so it wasn't bad enough that it didn't engage with me at all. It was a bit frustrating, but I guess high school drama...is meant to be that way, and I really liked the message at the end.

I loved the characters and loved the twist and turns on their path to love. I just wish that the creators had taken the story seriously.Dissecting the story though, shows flaws that towards the end I could not ignore. The opening was totally idiotic. Someone wanted a yuri harem series, so instead of doing it in a mature way, they come up with a really stupid alien angle. A ship crashing into a mountain, killing male Hazumu. Their alien ""space science"" is able to restore...him, but for some reason comes away from it as a girl. That is stupid, sorry creators, you could have done better. The ship crashed like a lawn dart. Come on! If a ship that size had really crashed, there would have been a crater the size of that entire city.Next, the comedy was unnecessary. It distracted from things. I swear, it is like they took Brock from Pokemon, made him even WORSE, and transported him to this anime. He is Hazumu\'s best friend and when he becomes a she, is super conflicted in Brock fashion, over how he feels. It could have been done SO much better had they just treated Asuta like a real person and not a cartoon character. The teacher was stupid, she should have died 50 times. The space aliens... stupid. They were a contrived add-on to check some sort of comedy box that the anime creators have and use. Her parents were stupid. Her father was a pervert verging on being a pedophile. I kind of liked the mom, because she kept kicking his ass.Ok. That was long... and if you are still reading, thank you.

Love is love and is not limited by gender, race, job, etc. True love for someone is timeless.Art: I didn\'t like the art on this show. It was too comedic for the story. The exaggerations and the poor line quality and lack of any sort of subtlety really is a letdown. This story deserved a lot more from the art. The creators really let us down.Sound: Nothing to write home about. I liked the intro and end music. I didn\'t really notice the music during the show, so at least it didn\'t get in the way. The voice actors were ok, no one stood out to me, but at least no one was distracting in a bad way. Overall, it was serviceable.Characters: The girls were good, maybe even very good. They all had their own motivations, reasons, and they stood out from each other. They had their own reasons for loving Hazumu, which I appreciated. But I didn\'t like Hazumu. I consider him to be a crappy friend and a worse potential partner. His indecisiveness constantly hurt the girls, and his obliviousness about how his friend Asuta felt is criminal. As I said above, I consider Ayuki to be the most tragic figure of the show. Her refusal to ""step on the stage"" freezes her in place. She starts and ends the show exactly the same, even though I am certain that she was the third girl that loved Hazumu. Despite that though, she just does... nothing. It should have been developed and was a missed opportunity.  But in the end, with all that salt set aside, I loved them all. Wipe all the comedy and other stuff away and it is a good cast that could, again, have been great had the creators taken the story seriously.Enjoyment: I know I have trashed the show a lot above... but I really enjoyed this series. I rooted for everyone. The stories tore at my heartstrings constantly and I find myself really passionate about the show. I am even considering writing a fan-fic recreation of the show as it SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. Damn, I\'m salty.Overall: I have been flickering between a 6 and a 7 since I started writing this review. I eventually went with a 7, because I honestly love Kashimashi, despite all its flaws. It told a beautiful love story with the twists and turns that love can take... and like I have said many time, I just wished the creators had given this show the love and subtlety that it deserved.

It had one major flaw. Boy gets rejected by girl, gets wiped out by spaceship and is then made into a girl too! However, once I got past that, things got interesting.The main character Hazumu definitely looked better as a girl, and it was hard to get over the fact that he was now a she. Tomari is cute, and a tomboy at that, but her connection with Huzumu was deep because of her childhood friendship. Yasuna was the girl who rejected him originally (although she has a valid reason...too).Once that is out of the way the story becomes a problem because who will Huzumu fall in love with? and did any of them notice he is really a girl now?There is also the seemingly mysterious Ayuki who kept on throwing me off the trail. But, I am glad I stuck with it because its a bittersweet story with so much potential. Usually I watch the backgrounds for quality, but this time I was too engrossed in the characters and the nagging question of ""how will they resolve this situation?""I did feel that the alien and his sidekick Jan-puu were a bit odd, but they helped provide comic relief that really had a part in what was a very interesting situation.It is a sweet story about friendship and fate and relationships, and yes, everybody lives sort of happily ever after, but there is still a hint of other things.This story may not appeal to everybody, but its well worth sticking with. too).Once that is out of the way the story becomes a problem because who will Huzumu fall in love with? and did any of them notice he is really a girl now?There is also the seemingly mysterious Ayuki who kept on throwing me off the trail.

While there are obvious nods to the Trans-community, I would argue that this anime\'s goal wasn\'t to target that part of the LGBTQ+ group.  For this review, I\'ll be reviewing the entire series, including the thirteenth episode that came out a little later and is listed on MAL as it\'s own entry.Story: Girl Meets Girl starts out with us showing schooler (their ages are never revealed) Hazumu asking out Yusana, but she rejects him.  Saddened,...he goes to the mountain for a hike, but gets lost and gets hit by an Alien spaceship.  Yes, you read that correctly.  To make up for this, the ship\'s pilot, Hitoshi, ""regenerates"" Hazumu, but explains that he needed to regenerate him into a girl.  When she is regenerated and sent back down the mountain, Yusana and childhood friend, Tomari, are there to catch \'her\'.  Now in this new body, Hazumu needs to adjust to life as a girl, permanently.Honestly, the most problematic thing about the story is the first episode, just because of how wacky it feels, for a series that is meant to be mostly serious.  I was tempted to type messy, but the writers clearly knew what they were doing.  The entire premise of this gender change is really weird and I can understand why this sort of thing would bug that community.  The thing is, after you finish that first episode, the rest of the series, story-wise, is really good.  Yusana and Tomari help Hazumu adjust to her new gender and teach her how to be more ladylike - which is funny considering how much of a tomboy Tomari is.  They do cover a bunch of stuff like how to dress and act, though this series really doesn\'t go for the shock value, so anything you might see in modern-day drama isn\'t present here.  I liked that they touched on it without getting too fan-servicey.The rest of the series focuses on the obvious love triangle between Hazumu, Tomari and Yusana.  There are some really great moments throughout and this series that does focus on trying to keep things light.  You see this evident in most episodes, especially when Tomari and Yusana try and not be antagonistic with each other.  I actually really welcome this because it keeps us from internally vilifying one or the other.  It constantly feels both girls wants to have faith in both themselves, and the other, and it\'s just not something we see much of nowadays.  Regardless of who you\'re cheering for here, I did find the conclusion of this love triangle to be slightly awkward.  It\'s not that it\'s bad, but it feels like something just kind of... happens.  You appreciate what they\'re going for, but it definitely threw me off a little.  My understanding is that the source material was almost at the conclusion when this series finished, so that might explain the awkward ending.  (8/10)Characters: Our main cast consists of Hazumu, Tomari and Yusana and there actually is a solid amount of depth on all three.  One of Hazumu\'s hobbies seems to evolve around gardening, somewhat akin to Yui from Kase and the Morning Glories.  She\'s quite knowledgeable about them and even brings a plant back from the mountains to care for on school grounds.  Her childhood does seem somewhat complicated, but it seems implied that she is a girl ""in her own brain"", prior to the gender swap.  They obviously could have expanded on this, but you\'d be touching some pretty controversial territory and I\'m not sure this series wanted to be that.  We also learn that Hazumu\'s really not good at making decisions - she tries to make sure everyone happy and basically rejects any ideas about there being a downside to not picking one choice or the other.  This is a great character trait because there\'s a lot of people out there that can relate and it does play a larger role in the series later on.  Tomari grew up with Hazumu and ended up developing a crush for him pretty early on, which was maintained, even after the gender swap.  This is fantastic because she clearly doesn\'t care what Hazumu looks like, going against the grain of what I assume to be a pretty young school-age.  Tomari\'s great because she sticks up for her friends and almost acts like a guardian to her friends.  Yeah, she\'s pretty tomboyish, but it works well here.  Yusana actually also has an interesting past, as it\'s revealed early on that her eyes are literally blurred out whenever she looks at a male.  This has obvious impacts on our cast, but that alone allows her to open her eyes as to what Hazumu means to her.  It sets up a really touching story and I really like this angle over the more straight-forward one that Tomari has.  However, above all else, she\'s clearly well liked upon her peers.Ayuki and Asuta round out their little circle of friends.  Asuta is Hazumu ""best bro"", but after the genre swap, his role somewhat changes and it really feels like he doesn\'t have much of a role in the story.  I sort of see why he was included, but the amount of screen time he got really bugged me because he never offered anything meaningful to the plot.  Ayuki feels like she\'s in the same boat in that she\'s mostly irrelevant, though has some decent moments late in the series.  Hitoshi and Jan are the two aliens from the ship that hit Hazumu, but I feel like they were mostly there to try and add comic relief here... which just didn\'t work for me.  Their thing was that they were trying to gather data about human interactions, but I\'m not entirely sold on... why?  They could have hit Hazumi, left, and I wouldn\'t have missed out.While our main cast were incredibly strong here, I found myself not caring about the side cast nearly as much.  Which is fine because our main three took up most of the runtime anyway.  (8/10)Art: Being fifteen years old, you tend to forgive the lack of high-end art, but it was fine and never got to the point of unwatchability.  For what it was, it delivered.  And before you ask, no, this anime doesn\'t have much in terms of fan service - it likely wouldn\'t have fit much anyway.  Aside that, visuals remained pretty consistent and, while you can never really call it pretty, it\'s enough to hold up.  (7/10)Sound: The OST, OP and ED are mostly forgettable, but the VO work was actually pretty good.  Something you have to remember is that the VO work back then was really unrefined and still learning how to grow.  Some older classics like Pokémon and Dragonball Z were probably ahead of its time, but Girl Meets Girl has a cast that was mostly fine.  Stephanie Sheh (Hazumu) was exceptional here and definitely didn\'t get enough credit back then for her fine work, especially from me.  In fact, she actually does play Hazumu pre-gender swap really well too.  Mona Marshall (Tomari) is definitely someone I\'m not used to playing younger girls and I\'m not sure this was the best casting choice.  It sounds awkward at times, even if Marshall might be one of my favourite VOs who simply doesn\'t do much in the way of anime voice work anymore.  Karen Strassman (Yusana) isn\'t anything I\'d call special, as her work to this day has never impressed me too much - she actually sounded a lot like Mela Lee, weirdly enough.  There are still some strong voices as side characters as well. (6/10)Overall Enjoyment: Girl Meets Girl was an enjoyable watch, even considering how old it is.  The characters are super relatable the story\'s enjoyable after you get the weird stuff out of the way.  (7/10) he goes to the mountain for a hike, but gets lost and gets hit by an Alien spaceship.

(8/10)Characters: Our main cast consists of Hazumu, Tomari and Yusana and there actually is a solid amount of depth on all three.  One of Hazumu\'s hobbies seems to evolve around gardening, somewhat akin to Yui from Kase and the Morning Glories.  She\'s quite knowledgeable about them and even brings a plant back from the mountains to care for on school grounds.  Her childhood does seem somewhat complicated, but it seems implied that she is a girl ""in her own brain"", prior to the gender swap.  They obviously could have expanded on this, but you\'d be touching some pretty controversial territory and I\'m not sure this series wanted to be that.  We also learn that Hazumu\'s really not good at making decisions - she tries to make sure everyone happy and basically rejects any ideas about there being a downside to not picking one choice or the other.  This is a great character trait because there\'s a lot of people out there that can relate and it does play a larger role in the series later on.  Tomari grew up with Hazumu and ended up developing a crush for him pretty early on, which was maintained, even after the gender swap.  This is fantastic because she clearly doesn\'t care what Hazumu looks like, going against the grain of what I assume to be a pretty young school-age.  Tomari\'s great because she sticks up for her friends and almost acts like a guardian to her friends.  Yeah, she\'s pretty tomboyish, but it works well here.  Yusana actually also has an interesting past, as it\'s revealed early on that her eyes are literally blurred out whenever she looks at a male.  This has obvious impacts on our cast, but that alone allows her to open her eyes as to what Hazumu means to her.  It sets up a really touching story and I really like this angle over the more straight-forward one that Tomari has.  However, above all else, she\'s clearly well liked upon her peers.Ayuki and Asuta round out their little circle of friends.  Asuta is Hazumu ""best bro"", but after the genre swap, his role somewhat changes and it really feels like he doesn\'t have much of a role in the story.  I sort of see why he was included, but the amount of screen time he got really bugged me because he never offered anything meaningful to the plot.  Ayuki feels like she\'s in the same boat in that she\'s mostly irrelevant, though has some decent moments late in the series.  Hitoshi and Jan are the two aliens from the ship that hit Hazumu, but I feel like they were mostly there to try and add comic relief here... which just didn\'t work for me.  Their thing was that they were trying to gather data about human interactions, but I\'m not entirely sold on... why?  They could have hit Hazumi, left, and I wouldn\'t have missed out.While our main cast were incredibly strong here, I found myself not caring about the side cast nearly as much.  Which is fine because our main three took up most of the runtime anyway.  (8/10)Art: Being fifteen years old, you tend to forgive the lack of high-end art, but it was fine and never got to the point of unwatchability.  For what it was, it delivered.  And before you ask, no, this anime doesn\'t have much in terms of fan service - it likely wouldn\'t have fit much anyway.  Aside that, visuals remained pretty consistent and, while you can never really call it pretty, it\'s enough to hold up.  (7/10)Sound: The OST, OP and ED are mostly forgettable, but the VO work was actually pretty good.  Something you have to remember is that the VO work back then was really unrefined and still learning how to grow.  Some older classics like Pokémon and Dragonball Z were probably ahead of its time, but Girl Meets Girl has a cast that was mostly fine.  Stephanie Sheh (Hazumu) was exceptional here and definitely didn\'t get enough credit back then for her fine work, especially from me.  In fact, she actually does play Hazumu pre-gender swap really well too.  Mona Marshall (Tomari) is definitely someone I\'m not used to playing younger girls and I\'m not sure this was the best casting choice.  It sounds awkward at times, even if Marshall might be one of my favourite VOs who simply doesn\'t do much in the way of anime voice work anymore.  Karen Strassman (Yusana) isn\'t anything I\'d call special, as her work to this day has never impressed me too much - she actually sounded a lot like Mela Lee, weirdly enough.  There are still some strong voices as side characters as well. (6/10)Overall Enjoyment: Girl Meets Girl was an enjoyable watch, even considering how old it is.  The characters are super relatable the story\'s enjoyable after you get the weird stuff out of the way.  (7/10)', ""Aliens, a boy becomes a girl, and yuri....somehow good?  That's right this show is actually good.  First off, it is yuri, so that needs to be taken into consideration.  I got into this anime because I was interested in this yuri thing.  Turns out I chose the right show.  If you are a yuri fan you will really like this!  There is just enough physical activity that it doesn't take away from the show actually being good.  It doesn't try to be just an in-your-face-yuri-fest.  My only complaint is actually the alien aspect.  While they do...add to the story, I feel like it takes away from it being taken more seriously.  The only thing is I don't know how else the boy could be turned into a girl genetically, so I suppose that is an issue.  Either way, this is a fun, but serious and actually interesting yuri!  I highly recommend it to fans. add to the story, I feel like it takes away from it being taken more seriously.

The fact that I disliked two of the characters in the main love triangle didn’t help matters much. It helped even less that the remaining character in the love triangle, who I did like, gets completely shat on. The only reason I finished watching this series was probably due to...the fact that I am almost obsessively against half watching/reading/playing something. It’s probably a good thing I did as the series does redeem itself somewhat at the end, but the weirdest thing about it is probably the main characters blasé reaction to the loss of his knob. the fact that I am almost obsessively against half watching/reading/playing something.

But as a child who think of a superhero is this anime perfect. It\'s story is really great and the characters were maybe not in art developt but their stories are clear.If you are able to watch an anime with a mind of a child who likes superheros. Totally watch this anime. There is a lot of drama, but that really makes this anime a little different than most others.I hope you all will enjoy it like I did.--/UpdateI think this...is one of the most underestimating animes from this time.

As for Sound, nothing to special or worth mentioning.Characters - Again nothing worth mentioning, typical characters.Enjoyment - Those who like Powers Ranger and anime series which have similar plots to power rangers would find this good. ', ""Majin Bone.  A show that really tests the value of everyday life.Story 7/10:  The story isn't terrible, but it isn't really ground breaking.  But what is shown is actually very well paced, it never really felt like they had to rush a certain detail and it does have a good since of discovery within the world that they have given us.  There were also moment that it did draw me into the story of it, especially closer to the end.  I just wish it kinda happened a little bit earlier.Art 8/10:  Now this is where I felt that the...show really shined, the animation.  There are two different styles 2D and 3D, if anything this kinda reminded me of Aladdin in the Cave of Wonders part.  And I was a fan of the 3D part, what I wish they did was put more of the two styles together more often.  Aside from the first few episodes it doesn't happen that often.  And when it did happen, the 3D stuff didn't do much, it need to more interactive in my opinoin.Sound 6/10:  It is well voiced acted, and the effects are good enough.  Music okay, but no real battle music aside from the big ones.  If they had something that match the fights it would of been that much better, but as it is, it is passable.Characters 6/10:  The characters are kinda all over the place.  Some I really like, some I didn't (which is really only one), and some were tolerable.  The antagonist had the most development here, you see them struggle with faith a lot more then the actual protagonist.  I like that, but it was obvious that they never really were the bad guys simple because they give off a likable trait early on.  The main character on the other hand, started off great.  I was really able to tell his struggle and pains that he went through, and what he fights for is a good cause, but my main problem with him was that he had too much doubt in himself.  First few times understandable, rest too much.Enjoyment 7/10:  I did enjoy the anime, and I probably would watch it again.  The fights were fun, no doubt about that.Overall 7/10:  A good anime, I think people would enjoy it.

I really enjoyed the premise and the plot along with the idea\'s meant to be taught, however there were times when the forward progression falters. The premise of the planet and the elements of nature lending there powers to a select few chosen people to protect the planet. That is a somewhat common plot.This may start out that way but they expands to encompass the protection of the whole universe. They really push the envelope with that addition. When these things are attempted the majority of the time it backfires, though, in my opinion,...the writers ""just"" manage to pull it off. I\'m also pretty sure I can speak for most us when I say ""no one really likes recap episodes"" All it is is a filler episode. Just an attempt to fill time while they work on the next episode, but it losses the stories over all flow.Even with these flaws and a few others, they manage to pull it all together in the end. The conflicts are resolved, their destruction is held off for them to clean up their act, and the two opposing forces join in a common goal. The best part for me is this is not one of those cliff hanger, unresolved ending stories. the writers ""just"" manage to pull it off.

I went into the show not expecting to like it; I’m not a fan of mecha or coming of age stories for boys. It was a recommendation from my brother who told me to stick with it, but even as I dove into it I just couldn’t find my footing. I started to enjoy it, eventually, but I was disappointed that it took so long. Despite my displeasure at its length it wasn’t SO bad that I wouldn’t recommend it. My feelings towards the show aren’t so much with its execution but how...I felt personally as a viewer.The show is about high schooler Ryujin Shougo, a boy who lives with his father and older sister at their family dojo. Shougo’s mother has disappeared for many years, but he’s not lonely with his best friend Sato and her mother living next door. After tragedy strikes Sato’s family, Shougo is granted the powers of the Dragon Bone, the planetary core that has been assigned to protect the Earth and its inhabitants. Using the power of the Dragon Bone, Shougo and his new friends from around the world use their powers to protect the Earth from intergalactic threats and the sinister Primordial Majin.Visually, the show looks *alright*. I was going to give it a pass because it came out in 2014, but when I did a little bit of research I realized that a lot of good anime managed to come out that year. Yuki Yuno is a Hero, some pretty Idol shows, and even the reputable favorite, No Game, No Life. So then I dug a little deeper thinking, “Okay, maybe it was made from a low budget studio…” Wrong again. It was produced through Toei Animation which happened to release a One Piece movie, Dragon Ball Super, and multiple beautifully styled PreCure series that year as well. So that begs me to think, who exactly was working on this project? Did everything else come out looking beautiful because they were already fan favorites and they couldn’t disappoint? Whereas Majin Bone was just a fighting card game that didn’t really take off in America and no one would notice if it was bad?What’s bothersome about this style is that the characters are juuuust on the cusp of “same face-ism”. There’s a boy template and a girl template and with some slight modifications in hair and eye color you have a different character. It isn’t helpful in the beginning when you’re trying to learn people’s names and Bone partners. Dark Wyvern, Phoenix, Crocodile, Cerberus, Raven, Hawk...which side are they on and who are their adepts?The best way I could describe it is that it’s...shapely? It’s an anime of polygons...it looks like the kind of drawings that a beginner artist would make and the artistry is almost 2D. There’s no definition, barely any shading, hardly an effort to take advantage of shadows...there are times when they do a really phenomenal job with super smooth frame by frame motions, particularly when they’re fighting in their armor in the cocoons. But it goes from super cool fluid fighting motions to crickety-rickety slice of life polygons. As if there was a switch labeled “budget” and someone kept playing with it throughout the show. One of my favorite characters, Luke, the Shark Majin has super long Sesshomaru/Sephiroth hair. You can do a lot to show the volume and flow of the hair, but it ends up looking like the hair from a plushie; just a long, solid piece of fabric. Did the animation progress as the show progressed? Yes, but not by much. It progressed as much as One Piece’s animation did in all the years it’s been on air.The show was 52 episodes long, but it could have been cut short to at least 40-45. There were filler episodes, 1 or 2 recap episodes, and I can’t believe they managed to sneak in a beach episode. What I don’t like most about the shounen and shoujo genre is that it focuses on the “heart of a boy/heart of a girl’ trope and from that other notable instances arise.“I can do this! As long as I have my friends by my side!”“I have to believe in the power of my heart! Only then will I be able to succeed!)**“I won’t let them beat me! Not when I still have the strength to fight!”“I have to win! Everyone is counting on me!”I got tired of the whole “Believe in yourself” rhetoric very early on in the show. It has a very “believe in the heart of the cards” aspect, the cards being the Majin Bone that the adepts were piloting. They were very clever to include actual plot in episodes that were filler so you couldn’t skip most of them. If you thought you could skip the beach episode and went onto the next one, you’d be wondering why someone was in the hospital and the city was in ruins in the next. It’s not fair! *sobs*I started to get frustrated at certain points because it was so obvious that the antagonist was up to the absolute worst, but for the sake of the succession of the plot most of the people in the inner court turned a blind eye or played ignorant so we could get to the major boss fight in the end. Even when 2 of the highest members of the court disappeared under mysterious circumstances and the shifty, braggart takes the seat most people don’t show much skepticism.Because the show is 52 episodes, 2 seasons, I must admit that the best part of the show is character development. Each character truly feels like they have a proper place within the storyline, its progression, and a true sense of teamwork. They have to complete a ‘line’ of at least three people so they can summon a Majin to do their bidding. So having all of your teammates with you is crucial to fighting the enemy. There were also many fights that didn’t include the main character so the others had to hold their own when help was never going to come. I can’t stand watching anime when even though there’s like 5-6 people in the group you only need the leader to commit the finishing blow. I’ll give a pass to Miraculous Ladybug because she needs to do that because of reasons.The music in the series was alright, it wasn’t half bad. I caught myself humming along to it not really because I liked it but because I was watching it back to back to back and the tune ended up being kinda catchy. I DID get tired of the insert tunes though. Not the songs, but the tunes that play at certain times when characters are doing certain things. We all know what those are. All I have to do is mention that “plucky tune from Naruto” and almost everyone will start to hum it in their heads. Or that “sad flashback flute” from Naruto as well. *cue wooden swing*I’m going to give this show a 2 out of 5. I don’t think there was any room to make an anime out of a card game like Majin Bone. Pokemon and Yokai Watch are much more entertaining when combining these two elements of entertainment. It’s like if L.O.L Surprise! Dolls got a television show. I took off for the visuals, the length, and how it leans too heavily on tropes. Perhaps I’m biased because I don’t usually gravitate towards mecha, but I’d like to hear an opposing perspective that actually appreciates the show.**Only acceptable in Kingdom Hearts I felt personally as a viewer.The show is about high schooler Ryujin Shougo, a boy who lives with his father and older sister at their family dojo.

Maomao no Hitorigoto,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56975/Maomao_no_Hitorigoto,"[""To those of you wondering what this is, its just a compilation of chibi skits. Each skit is around 1 min 30, and it usually follows this pattern: Maomao and Jinshi run into each other, they banter a little, maomao gives us a fun trivia fact, they proceed to banter more and the skit ends. The skits are fun and short, and the interactions between Maomao and Jinshi are very comedic and lighthearted. I'd say these skits are very comparable to the Frieren skits (which are also airing right now). Low budget, dumb fun. If you're a fan of Apothecary Diaries and you want to...see more amusing interactions and dialogues between Maomao and Jinshi, this is worth the watch. If not, then u can probably skip this. Just don't go into this expecting the same level of quality as the main show, because that's certainly not what you're going to get. see more amusing interactions and dialogues between Maomao and Jinshi, this is worth the watch.

IS: Infinite Stratos,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9041/IS__Infinite_Stratos,"['**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**IS: Infinite Stratos..If my Greek isn\'t so rusty, I would confidently say that ""Stratos"" means ""Skies""But after watching this anime for the first time, I could conclude that Stratos actually means ""Harem""Why? Because when you\'re the only guy in a girl school, THERE\'S INFINITE HAREMS POSSIBLES! Thus they should rename this anime to Infinite Harems!Now to tell you the truth, I was a bit reluctant to watch this. Oh sure, harem turns me on, like any normal guy, but mecha genre really turns me off.But after looking through the mecha suit design, ""Hey! You can still see the girls! They\'re not...covered under huge piles of metal!"" So I decided to give it a shot.Wow... Was I wrong about this being a whole mecha genre. They focused more on the harem part! What proof do I have you ask?? Other than the fact he is the only guy?? Well in the ending, they add every new girl he added to his ""harem"" running along with him. HOW DOES THIS NOT SHOW THAT THE ANIME IS GOING TOWARDS THE DIVINE HAREM ROUTE!The artwork is up to date with your standard mecha genre anime so I see no disappointment there for those who loves mecha with a harem. No, not mecha sex you perverts! And don\'t you go googling ""Inyoku Tokkyuu Zetsurinou"" or ""Dyogrammaton"" neither!Nothing to add about sound, it\'s well balanced.Anyways, onward to the characters! The main aspect of every harem animes!-Male lead who walks into girl while changing [CHECK]-Dense Male Harem lead [CHECK](If all the guys were dense like the typical male harem leads, we wouldnt need birth control)-Childhood friend who is likely to be friendzoned by the producers cause somehow anime directors hate Childhood friends [CHECK] x2-High class lady with a high ego whom parodies western people [CHECK](Why do some japanese people think Westerners are all egoistic? Who knows *rolls eyes*)-A hyper active and high pitched girl with an attitude [MAYBE EVENTUALLY]-Chinese girl wannabe with a chinese restaurant (Macross frontier reference??) [CHECK]-TSUNDERE!!! [CHECK]-YANDERE!!!!

[CHECK](Correction: My friend corrected me that in the future, technology is so advance, that breasts can be compressed)]Im not being sexist here. I think it\'s a good thing women are advance and inventing machines....Despite all the criticism, this anime is enjoyable if you just wanna watch something haremic (Yes I invented that word!) but with a touch of action, mecha specificly.Overall, for all you harem lover who enjoys imagining themselves in a school full of girls and you\'re the only guy then this is the anime for you!Even if you do get a renob like me by watching mecha animes. (Oh please don\'t google renob up...)For you mecha lovers out there, this might be a disappointment but fear not, every season, new mecha animes are coming in so there\'s still hope!

So put down that gun.. Yes.. slowly, put it down.. Sit back.. and relax...', 'One of the problems with the anime industry is the tendency to overuse stereotypes and themes, and many of the studios in Japan continue to operate under the idea that the shows they create will generate a profit in some manner (regardless of the content), through DVD sales or merchandise. The sad fact is that many producers barely break even from one season to the next, which then prompts arguments of piracy, licensing, pricing, distribution costs, etc, all of which seems more than a little strange as while it may appear that the studios have some perfectly valid arguments, they\'ve neglected to talk about one...thing - the anime they make.Every season viewers are subjected to a barrage of average or substandard fare that serves no other purpose than mindless juvenile media, yet these shows continue to be made because the entertainment industries always prefer the safe bet over a ""risky"" venture. That said, there are always one or two anime that manage to rise above mediocrity, but there\'s still a very large gap between being good, and being great.IS  is, first and foremost, a reasonably popular ongoing light novel series by Yumizuru Izuru that began publication in May 2009. Six volumes have already been released under the MF Bunko J label (part of Media Factory), and the seventh is due out in April 2011. In May 2010 a manga adaptation by Akahoshi Kenji began serialisation in Monthly Comic Alive, with production on the anime adaptation beginning later that year.Set in the near future, the story initially seems to be about powered exoskeletons called Infinite Stratos, an advanced piece of technology that is more powerful than any existing weaponry, but can only be used by girls and women. Because of this, society and the world have had to adapt so that females are now in authority, but all of that changes when Orimura Ichika, a 15 year old student, is found to be the only male in the world with the ability to pilot the machines. Because of this, and for his own protection, he is forced to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy.Seems a pretty straightforward set up right?In fact this show is so straightforward and predictable it verges on being dull. Aside from being a light novel/manga adaptation (which seems to be the rage these days), the storyline is about as generic as one can get in anime, with almost every stereotype and ""popular"" theme on display. The plot initially seems intriguing until one realises that the whole concept of Infinite Stratos is nothing more than an excuse to put a ""special"" teenaged guy in a school full of hormone crazed girls, and let them have fun with each other. The storyline is only peripherally about the problems resulting from the development of the Infinite Stratos machines as they never really come to the fore until towards the end of the series.But those are only the surface issues.The series is limited in terms of design as many aspects of the visuals are adapted directly from the manga. Unfortunately this doesn\'t really do the show any favours as aside from a degree of futurism in the backgrounds and the conceptualisation of the exoskeletal armours, everything else is the epitome of genericism. The big book of harem characters has been used extensively for pretty much everyone, with all of the lead roles looking more like cardboard cut-outs that would readily grace any other generic high school anime of this type. Granted there is a degree of facial expression, but that\'s not enough to raise the character design in any measurable way.Thankfully there are two areas where the visuals actually manage to pass muster. The backgrounds are coloured and detailed rather well, but there are some scenes where the quality improves dramatically in order to focus the viewer\'s attention on the action. In addition to that, the animation is pretty good throughout the series, but the quality work only really comes to the fore during sequences of IS combat.Another area where Infinite Stratos does manage to attain a degree of respectability is the acting, but even that\'s not really saying much. After all, this is a harem romantic comedy with some science fiction and fanservice thrown in for good measure, so viewers shouldn\'t expect Shakespeare. It\'s surprising then, that Uchiyama Kouki actually manages to play the role of Ichika rather well, and the same could also be said of Hikasa Youko et al in the roles of the girls who want to find out how well Ichika can use his weapon.That said, all of the exclamations, weird noises, mannerisms, and changes of pitch and tone that one would associate with this type of show are on offer, but while they\'re handled rather well by the seiyuu, there\'s simply too little going on for them to really show off their talents. The main reason for this is the mundane script, and viewers may find themselves suffering from bouts of deja vu during specific scenes, especially if they\'ve recently watched any other harem anime.As for the music, the background tracks are nice enough and there is some variety to be had thanks to the composition skills of Nanase Hikaru, but the problems lie in the choreography, and more importantly, the relevance. There are occasions where the score seems out of place with the on screen action, and while this is due to a slight error in the timing in some cases, more often it\'s because the background music simply doesn\'t mesh with the scene. This is also true for the opening theme, Straight Jet by Kuribayashi Minami, which already has difficulty standing out since it\'s a pretty standard J-pop affair so the last thing it needed was poor choreography. As for the ending theme, Super Stream, this generic little ditty is sung by the actress of whichever female character is managing to keep up with the manliness of Ichika during the credit sequence, while the other female seiyuu performing backing vocals.Speaking of manliness, it should come as no surprise that there\'s little in the way of it here, but then this is justified to a degree by the fact that Infinite Stratos features a female dominated society. Ichika is the typical harem lead who doesn\'t seem to have a clue that so many girls like him, especially as he has very few redeeming features and a slight complex about his older sister, and in true harem fashion he even forgets or misunderstands childhood promises so the story can have that little bit more drama.And that\'s just him.The girls are just as poor when it comes to characterisation, although thinking about it, maybe poor isn\'t the right word. They fit into the story rather well, they may look like cardboard cut-outs from other harem anime but they do retain some individuality. They can be annoyingly self centred and stupid, but they\'re supposed to be hormone crazed teenaged girls so maybe that\'s normal (apologies if you\'re a hormone crazed teenaged girl who doesn\'t act self centred and stupid).Oh wait. Most of them are supposed to be tsundere characters (all of them except the one with the short blond hair in fact), so maybe poor was the right word after all.There\'s little in the way of actual character development as the derived and contrived nature of the plot and story doesn\'t really allow for any great introspection from any of the roles. There are many potential opportunities to push the characters in a totally new direction, but these are not taken as the whole series is less about telling a good story, and more about cashing in on the harem bandwagon.Regardless of its flaws, Infinite Stratos will undoubtedly find a home in the hearts of some viewers, which is perfectly fine if you like this type of show, and to be honest much of the series is reasonably inoffensive, especially if the viewer has managed to sit through any other harem anime. That said, it should be pointed out that the concept of the story had the potential for being something special. The idea of a society dominated by women due to the development of a new weapon offers up questions of gender roles, societal balance, political machinations, technological advancements, etc, etc, all of which are treated as minor annoyances that get in the way of finding out which girl Ichika is going to choose.Granted there are some good points to be found in various aspects of the series, but these are outweighed by a lacklustre storyline, poor characterisation, and an overall sense that everything has been done before. thing - the anime they make.Every season viewers are subjected to a barrage of average or substandard fare that serves no other purpose than mindless juvenile media, yet these shows continue to be made because the entertainment industries always prefer the safe bet over a ""risky"" venture.

In this review, I will attempt to describe IS: Infinite Stratos and it\'s components, then give you it\'s worth as a series.The basic premise of Infinite Stratos is set in a world where armored mecha suit, the Infinite Stratos is invented, thus rendering all other technology obsolete. One catch, this suit can only be worn by women.While this was an interesting premise, the setting itself just attracts questions. Why can only women wear it? What has the effects of this technology had on society? What happened to the political...relations of the world after this technology? What governments has used it?Sadly, none of these questions are satisfyingly answered, because the next portion of the premise is going to make the TRUE premise apparent. While the original premise demanded world-exploration and examination, none of that is shown because the series basically only sets in one place: IS Academy. The place where Students aspiring to learn the techniques of IS from all over the world, where the armor/suit is used as an entertainment device(I will get to this later).Our Main Character is Ichika Orimura, an average High School student and the only male on the planet so far to discovered to have had the capability to use Infinite Stratos. And because of circumstances, he has to head to IS Academy, a place where he will be the only man.And because of this setup, the show faithfully follows the route to harem, where 90% of the girls wants the Main Character\'s D, otherwise is interested(and certainly the main protagonists). Since it sets itself up as a Harem series, what is should do is explore the characters who are complex and makes us care for them, let\'s see the components of this series:Coherency/Continunity: While the series sets itself up as a series that begs exploration of the world\'s politics and what happened in the world after the invention of IS, this is merely a setup where the main character can have a school full of girls all to himself.The idea that women started to dominate the world is hardly ever shown, since the show secludes itself in the IS Academy. Where contrary to common sense, depicts females just about every other Harem series does! I will get into the characters later. The main point is, the social/political changes is shown without any changes!And the fact that IS is a weapon(more powerful than any, mind you) begs the question on why has it not been used militarily? A weapon this powerful would have the government SCRAMBLING for it, and certainly not only used as an entertainment device(LOLWUT?). The idea if that if it is women who controls it would lead to world peace is completely illogical and is given as a fact. Any person has the power to commit evil, and being a part of a gender does not exclude you.Characters: The worst aspect of the series are the characters. Virtually all but one of the female cast is depicted as a Tsundere, and often violent too and nothing outside her stereotype. Rin the Chinese girl and Houki the Japanese girl are basically the same in terms of personality. While Cecilia the British girl have nothing really defines her other than ""Ojou-sama"" type of character. The only one that is not depicted as a Tsundere is Charlotte, whom is wonderful.And the main character? About as generic as you get, and so dense that you can\'t even find it on the periodic table. Ichika is a self-insert character that has to deal with the woes of ""GIRLS ALL AROUND ME! OH NOEZ!!"" Difficult to achieve an level of empathy to and overall a dumbass to peoples\' feelings to an unrealistic degree.Production: The production of the series is relative above average. By no means is it bad. but the sound is rather generic and nothing I could remember to write home about, although the opening song was somewhat memorable. The character designs are generic by today\'s standards, again, nothing to write to home about. Although there are several prominent Seiyuus acting in the characters, such as Kana Hanazawa. But obvious incoherencies is show, such as one episode, a character fights the main character but is somehow stopped by Chifuyu\'s sword... Out of nowhereBeing a mecha anime, there are also fight-scenes featuring the Infinite Stratos\'. Probably the best part of the series, unfortunately, are short, insignificant, and CGI-animatedPlot: Wait, what? Oh, the plot. Simply put, there isn\'t much other than a string of events that puts Ichika in various situations where the main characters fall in love with him. Infinite Stratos, as well as the expected consequences of it existing, is not a part of the plot. A random IS does show up and destroy stuff, but next episode, that is no longer a worry.Verdict:If you are here looking for a good plot that maps out the consequences of it\'s premise, turn around. If you are here looking for an above average harem story with quality characters, go elsewhere. Truthfully, without the ridiculously unnecessarily armored IS, this series is just a generic RomCom Harem series that is barely funny at all.There are bunch of holes in the plot and story. If you are looking for fanservice and cute girls(relatively) or Charlotte Dunois with a splash of CGI-animated Mecha fighting, come right in.ADDITIONALLY:If there\'s one thing thats also great about this series, it\'s that the series does not pretend to be deep or anything that it is not, making it far less cringeworthy for some viewers to enjoy. relations of the world after this technology?

Why i did it for this anime is beyond me. Second i would like to say that i am no expert with anime. I'm just your regular Joe that has a lot of anime and likes to watch em, so i wont go overly critical to my review. I'll just say write in why i scored the way i did in each of the categories given to me.Story (6-fair) - Well I've watch a lot of anime. i have over 400 in my collection. and to tell you the truth,...watching all of them you'll soon realize that plots are rehashed all the time. It might be a different setting, characters, and events, but if you dig deep into the basic plot, you could usually count the different kinds they're using. This anime is no exception. its your typical harem scenes. One guy and a bunch of girls. plot line revolves around girls pilots, and the only Guy in the world who could pilot the Power Armors. of course, the girls fall in love with him because hes such a nice guy, revolving around that plot, they placed in action, power armors, and a mystery. Its not your award winning story, but if you want original, those things are usually reserved to the drama anime. I gave it a 6 because plots thin, but very enjoyable.Art (9-great) - I like the art direction to this one. Its nothing i haven't seen before, but animation is smooth and consistent. Unlike some anime, that seem to dull down when you get to the middle of the series, or seemed rushed, and cheap during some fight scenes like in gurren laggan, so far its been consistent halfway thru the series.Sound (7-good) - Sound, well i really didn't notice anything good or bad about it so i gave it a 7. Its good, Not great, but not bad either. All in all, nothing significant to talk about.Character (8-V.Good) - Characters are good, aside from the robots and the fighting, the anime does touch up on the character development. Not so much for the girls, but more of the main star and only guy. Stories usually revolve around the girls and how they are connected to the main guy. Big diversity of characters too, given the fact that its an international school, and so far, Japan, England, France, and Germany, are represented. Good mix of characters and personality.Enjoyment (9-Great) - I really like anime like this. Nothing hard to think about, and i like the interaction of the characters. Primarily because its one of those fast anime. There are only 12 episodes to this series, its halfway, and they're very aggressive about the story telling. I like this anime also because i'm partial to Sci-Fi and Mechs, and Power armors.Overall (8-V.Good) - Overall i gave this one an 8. I enjoy watching it, and there are a few anime out there that i do actually wait for to come out to watch the next episode. Its not a smart anime, bring nothing new to the table, but highly enjoyable. Even the little humor that is inserted here and there are noticeable. But if you taste is not like mine, you might not like it. All i can say is watch the first episode, if that doesn't hook you in, then the rest wont either.Enjoy watching all of them you'll soon realize that plots are rehashed all the time. It might be a different setting, characters, and events, but if you dig deep into the basic plot, you could usually count the different kinds they're using. This anime is no exception. its your typical harem scenes. One guy and a bunch of girls. plot line revolves around girls pilots, and the only Guy in the world who could pilot the Power Armors. of course, the girls fall in love with him because hes such a nice guy, revolving around that plot, they placed in action, power armors, and a mystery. Its not your award winning story, but if you want original, those things are usually reserved to the drama anime. I gave it a 6 because plots thin, but very enjoyable.Art (9-great) - I like the art direction to this one. Its nothing i haven't seen before, but animation is smooth and consistent. Unlike some anime, that seem to dull down when you get to the middle of the series, or seemed rushed, and cheap during some fight scenes like in gurren laggan, so far its been consistent halfway thru the series.Sound (7-good) - Sound, well i really didn't notice anything good or bad about it so i gave it a 7.

Long story short: A universe that has mechs piloted by only females , but one guy is able to pilot it without any reason. So the government sends him to school full of chicks so that he can pilot better and learn. Oh, did I mention he\'s dense. Beyond, Naruto dense! Also, the girls in the school want to be in his pants. Horny much?  Now for the girls:The following competitors are:Houki- Stupid, USELESS, tsundere childhood friend who has the brain capacity of 10 year old.Cecelia- The Ojousama of jolly good England who...has a superiority complex to Harem lead, but then gets her ass beat and turns a 360 and starts getting wet for him.Rin- 2nd Stupid, ANNOYING, tsun-tsundere childhood friend who fails at being the next Asuka and that is one of the harem girls I show a deep animosity for. Second is Houki. I mean i want to go Shizuo on her.Charlotte- She\'s a French plot twist: OH GOD!! A SANE GIRL IN A HAREM? WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TOO?!Laura- The German who has the hots for the lead\'s sister and  is pissed that the lead is not worthy of being the brother of the Famous IS champion...........Am I forgetting something? OH, and she has the knock-off eye patch supernatural eye of Mio Sakamoto of Strike Witches. LAME.So, who will be the champion of the heartthrob prodigy? Well, what do you think Charlotte? Do you think you have a chance with him?Charlotte: ""Ichika no ecchi""Me:........... (looks at the fans)Fans: (Andy Samberg\'s ""Jizz in ma pants"" face)Me: (looks back at audience) WINNER: CHARLOTTE DUNOA!!!Seriously, that\'s all Infinite Stratos is in 5 seconds. Everyone hearts Charlotte because of ONE line. They should just have Charlotte be the female lead or even better let it be a normal romance with Charlotte being the heroine.All I have to sum up about this is that: IT LACKS ORIGINALITY. Nothing in this show is something I haven\'t even seen before. This is proving that Japan is running out of ideas in creativity in adapted works. Forgettable trash. Watch at your own risk.

Scroll to the very bottom of this review to see IS S2 review (it\'s legit I promise!!)There is absolutely nothing wrong with over-used generic stories. Nothing, really! Except when they\'re like IS. The anime that failed from the start. Though I can\'t say I\'m surprised, with predictable story, characters, there\'s nothing to keep me guessing or wondering what\'s going to happen next.I can sum up the story with a couple of common words:BoyGirl(S)High schoolMechas...Now go ahead and guess: Will the story be interesting or not?There you go.Instead of putting us into a world where the reality of a Woman > Man type world with mechas and perhaps applying Marshall Mcluhan\'s four laws to that, and showing us the complexities of it\'s layout. Instead we get, teen boy hustled by horny teen girls.Plot? Oh I\'m sorry, THAT WAS THE PLOT!!!In all honesty though: the story takes a while to introduce the full cast using a few episodes dedicated to each girl. In some parts there are fights and a tournament, terrorists yadda yadda blohmadda.The art suffice to say was, great!(it is in no way close to any of the other factors in terms of weight) The settings were detailed enough so I could recognize the general things. You could identify the main characters easily as well (although you can\'t remember their names cause they\'re blander than me blending water). The fights were, pretty good but the MC should really ask people to stop giving his butt to him as a damn Christmas gift. All I can say is, decently-good.The sound was fine as well, but no really interesting music to get your blood pumping.Characters: Shit. Now I know what you\'re thinking, ""Hey don\'t be too harsh, the characters are vibrant and have different personalities"". I say NO. Let me explain:What makes a good character? Personality sure! but what other qualities should they have? A decent art model yes. But what makes the character         -stand out from the rest-? There we go.Picture those 5 girls. Imagine in your head about how they interact with Ichika. Now take away Ichika. What do you see now? Nothing.You know that saying where you say ""I can\'t imagine X without X"". Yeah well that\'s mostly used in a positive context. Here? Bad.Ok I found their names and here: let\'s see how this goes now.Houki: Childhood Tsundere. Enough said.Cecilia: Proud, stuck-up rich girl who likes Ichika.Rin: Chinese Loli (pig-tails are bonus OH YEAH!!)Charlotte: Blonde girl who tried to be a guy.Laura: Angry German Loli with military background.BONUS: Chifuyu: Angry older sister, constantly hits Ichika. Gets mad at him for unfair reasons.BONUS: Tabane: Created the idiocy that was IS.See? Aside from the 2 bonus characters, I can\'t see any sort of character in these Haremettes. All I see is some saltless-butter of a bunch of dolls. This is the problem in most harems. (ignoring the fact that harems in general suck) The girls are nothing without the dumb MC to anchor them to be pseudo realistic in any sense.Almost forgot Ichika.He sucks......I won\'t go too much into it I\'ll point form it.-Too stupid to exist.-Boring personality-Scared of girls-Did I mention boring?Enjoyment. I forced myself to watch this because it was so bad, I really had to see just to what extent of bad this was. No I don\'t torture myself to watch anime, I did this as a self experiment to see just what to expect when going into this type of genre. It didn\'t disappoint my expectations at least (good!) because they were zero (oh...). But seriously, I was bored as heck. I was very tempted to skip to the second halves of the episodes to see some action... then to my dismay finding out that there was no action in some episodes. Boring Boring Boring. *SPOILER* Not even that climactic battle with Laura was good, it was just stupid in all places. *END SPOILER*This anime was bad, I\'d hate to see it\'s manga/LN version because I bet that\'s a bunch of useless writing.I obviously expected too much from this anime. No wrong. I expected too much of what I WANTED from this anime. Instead, it did the usual pander otaku schtick and rolled with it. Obviously it was a harem/romance/romcom/highschool/mecha anime. But still, just seeing these always piss me off at how blatantly Japan doesn\'t care to try and even try something new for once.The settings could really have been expanded on. Like I said, Marshall Mcluhans 4 laws could have been applied here.Enhancement: No brownies here, this is too easy to explain.Reversal: Instead of it\'s intended purpose of space exploration, it could have added on to that, explaining how technology can be manipulated into a purpose of reversal.Retrieve: What earlier actions/service could have been brought back because of the intricacies of IS?Obsolesce: What does this technology make obsolete. Again too easy.It could have showed these 4 laws applied in greater detail. EVEN IF YOU DON\'T KNOW MARSHALL MCLUHAN, there could have been some more focus on looking at the mechs do stuff. But no, Ichika and his teenage crisis with his girls is wayy more important. (sigh)But as I said. It was doomed from the start when it said Harem, Ecchi and those buzz words right off the bat....Anyways here\'s my IS S2 review.It\'s shit.THANKS FOR READING!!!

Seriously. Complete with a retarded protagonist who wouldn\'t know know a girl was interested in him even if she sucked his dick, a childhood friend apart for six years who will be doing some of the sucking, a big sister, a tsundere high class stereotypical blonde blue eyed english girl (definitely gonna be sucking his dick), and of course it all takes place in the over used setting of...boy in an all girls school, all the girls doing some dick sucking too. I predict a kuudere too. I don\'t see a yandere though it would be too thoughtful of the anime staff to put anything in there that would make you think bad things and possibly offset merchandising.---Characters---Just looking at the character list it looks like a total rip off from strike witches (which in turn ripped off from other anime) Charlotte looks EXACTLY like Erica Hartmann, Laura Bode-whatever has that same dumb eye patch that Mio does and even Lin Yin Fang (chinese foreigner dur dur) reminds me of Lucchini. Bravo ""8bit"" and dumb producing name.---Sound---Nothing memorable. Dumb ass stupid generic OP that tries to copy what Railgun\'s OP did well. Don\'t even remember the ED was probably dumb too. No not probably, definitely.---Art---Not bad the cgi looked a bit wonky but I don\'t really like cgi so I\'m biased. The air fight in the beginning honestly wasn\'t that bad if a tad over dramatic and confusing but it was just a cock tease. ---UPDATE--- Second episode action was pretty good actually.---Enjoyment---I\'ll watch the next episode but only to see the blonde tsundere\'s ass handed to her predictably.UPDATE: Second episode slightly better than the first but the ending was SO DUMB. Ooooh why do I feel these feelings? Anh! Ichika-Sama!!! So. Dumb. So. Rehashed. I also am hating the childhood friend more and more. I\'ve seen her character a hundred times and better.UPDATE: Third episode was stupid stupid stupid. The blonde goes from absolute hatred to complete ""let me juggle your balls"" in what must be an amazing bankai hypnosis ability that the dense brick Ichika has. We introduce the stereotypical energetic chinese foreigner ""second"" childhood friend (as if one wasn\'t enough) who also is under Ichika\'s hypnosis expanding his rapidly growing cliche harem to three. Well I\'m a bit wrong when I say cliche, I\'ve never heard of having a first AND a second childhood friend but on the other hand who would be so stupid as to introduce a weak plot device like that. boy in an all girls school, all the girls doing some dick sucking too.

The key to enjoying this anime is to completely ignore the attempts at plot throughout the anime while savoring the characters and their fanservice. Infinte Stratos' premise is begins with our main protagonist, Orimura Ichika, just happens to be the only male that can pilot the Infinite Stratos mecha unit, which was thought to be only compatible with females. Thus our main protagonist is sent of to the IS academy and becomes the only male in a sea of females. And by stint of being male, he becomes the most...popular student in the academy -_-.The plot is simply torturous to watch. Throughout the series, major story developments have been random and sporadic; the events throughout the anime seem to have no relation to one another. Major events often occur suddenly only to fade away without leaving any trace of their occurrence or importance. The premises and themes used all have their potential, they were just extremely poorly developed by sloppy writing. The societal structure of woman dominating men which would have provided numerous opportunities for genuine conflict and for Ichika to develop as a main character is completely ignored. Various fancy names and technical terms are thrown around without explanation of their significance or origin. The power levels between characters are not only ambiguous, but also inconsistent, so no apparently growth in IS piloting skill actually takes place. The complete abolition of plot would have made IS much more tolerable.Character development simply fails due to its ties with the plot. Ichika undergoes no development at all; his skill at pilotnig the IS as well as his thickheadedness remains constant throughout the story. The development of the girls themselves lacks the drama needed to make their supposedly difficult pasts believable, which results in a general lack of empathy for the characters. Important plot elements used in character development are grazed upon so shallowly that they fail to be thought provoking and emotion evoking and end up as just laughable. The development itself is sometimes overly drastic; some characters experience complete 180 shits in attitude and personality that do not coincide with the resolutions of their non-existent drama.Once their development has been completed however, the characters become astoundingly entertaining; the actual characters are easily the strongest part of the anime. Ichika, although undergoing no development, was never really a weak or herbivorous character, given his tendency to feed and massage the ladies around him. Each female character can be easily related to a certain trope or character archetype, but they are portrayed as more than just moe anthropomorphisms of abstract personality fetishes, although this certainly does not mean that the characters are not moe. Each character is given personality traits and quirks outside of their defined trope that makes them more real and likeable; even aspects that seem trivial are given some detail. Most entertaining is the interactions between characters, the abundance of various personalities allows for different chemistry mixtures that spice up situations that are otherwise very cliched and trite. Although all the reactions are often predictable, the characters are executed soundly and the situations are still fun to watch. Easily the weakest character is our main protagonist himself, as he remains a thickheaded punching-bag for the girls around him.The production quality for Infinte Stratos is quite high, which is a shame given it's agonizing plot. Immediately noticeable is the cast of seiyuu; most characters are voiced by a well established seiyuu famous for her roles in other anime. Not surprisingly, the voice acting is top quality; special props goes to Kana Hanazawa for the most moe anime voice this season. The music is of satisfactory quality with a catchy opening theme and a decent ending theme. The animation for the ending theme is actually not a harem-o-meter; the most recently captured character runs closely behind Ichika and moved to the back of the line as the next character is captured. The art itself is clean and vibrantly colorful, up to today's standards as a 2011 anime. The IS personal units themselves are well designed and easily differentiable from each other. The battles themselves are quite well done, with dynamic camera movements drawn well and plenty of special effects.The amount of negative reaction Infinite Stratos has received is definitely understandable; I myself at first whined and pussy bitched about the horrendous plot, and found the character interactions to be predictable and boring. However approximately half-way through the season, I finally accepted that Infinte Stratos was not the awesome mecha anime that I expected, but was instead a decent romantic comedy. Suddenly the plot became much easier to ignore since I stopped looking for it, which allowed my mind to be more positive and accepting of the character interactions, making them more entertaining. Therefore, although still accompanied by the frequent face-palm, I found myself smiling much more naturally and frequently as I watched this anime, and was sufficiently entertained.Questions, comments, criticisms and compliments are welcomed whether you found this review helpful or not. popular student in the academy -_-.The plot is simply torturous to watch.

It\'s a show that\'s primarily mecha, with the robots piloted by humans and function like body armors rather than bigass robots that tower over the skyline (Zero--and pretty much all the other Maverick Hunters--from the Megaman X franchise inspired this). I wanted a little romance on the side, and awesome fights here and there, with possibly a few moments of comic relief. Character designs should be clean and crisp, with detail in the eyes and the mecha suits. Fanservice is not desired, but allowable to an extent. A male or a female lead would be fine, so...long as the female lead doesn\'t lead the series into a shoujo dive.Keeping this in mind, I searched for shows that have any one or a combination of these characteristics. I searched high and low (I wasn\'t aware of MAL at the time I watched Infinite Stratos), and I eventually stumbled on Infinite Stratos.Characters:- Clean and neat, with the occasional excessive cheek tints. (AWESOME!)Fanservice:- Bordering the allowable and the excessive, but nevertheless still allowable. (Fine.)Mechas?:- Yes. Battle suit-style mechas. (F**K YEAH!)Tags:- Mecha (AWESOME!)- Romance (NICE)- Harem (...huh?)Then the plot dawned me. Frankly I was initially disappointed to see that the title closest to being my dream animé was quite possibly the largest harem I\'ve ever encountered (and frankly, it still is). At least Gundam 00 had 4 Gundam Meisters; Code Geass had a myriad of pilots; even Megaman X had Maverick Hunters and Navigators. And here we have Infinite Stratos, set in an instructional school in a setting where females are the only ones capable of piloting these mecha suits--with the exception of our lead character. (Whether this is positive or negative is entirely up to the reader.) I\'ll leave my ranting for now, and move on with my review.Story: 5/10Infinite Stratos introduces itself by giving us a heads-up on what\'s going on in their world: mecha suits called Infinite Stratos (or IS for short) are the latest in technological innovations, but only females can control them. A worldwide pact was made to prevent the use of these suits for war; instead, the suits are used for sport, and a school off the coast of mainland Japan teaches students how to use them. Obviously, the school would be an all-girls school, with a peculiar exception of a student: Orimura Ichika, the only male in the world who can pilot an IS.The show manages to compress all this in one episode, which was good. The bad part was that they didn\'t follow it up. They didn\'t give so much as an amply descriptive story behind why Orimura is the only male who can control an IS (they tried it near the end of the series, and even by then it was still largely vague). Also, for some magical reason only females can pilot the suits. No explanation given. It\'s probably just a plot device to maintain the ""harem"" status of the series, but it doesn\'t help the story at all besides giving the viewers girls and more girls.The 12 episodes of this series are roughly about class competitions, a single person\'s flashback, and one mission that was supposed to be a climactic ending but certainly fails to do so. If Infinite Stratos is bad at somethine, it\'s the story.Art: 9/10Here Infinite Stratos tries to redeem itself (and at least in my case the redemption effort works). Art in this show is clean and fluid--just the way I like it. People are drawn quite well, and nothing is left without detail. Even the GUIs of the students\' workdesks and the classroom screens are well-made. Mechas are presented in 3D when in combat, and in 2D when in static frames. I think this is a plus, since the 3D action scenes are certainly eye-catching (I mean, with all those lasers and boosters and all that). Color schemes for the mechas aren\'t really stellar, but at least they match the mood of the show. Also, if you\'re going to do a mecha show, you have to pay attention to the mecha designs. Luckily, Infinite Stratos does this well, and the mechas certainly look great.Environment-wise, it\'s pretty much standard. You won\'t expect any vivid settings from a school that\'s pretty much isolated at sea, but at least they try their best to give it a futuristic feel. Personally, I liked the art direction of this series.I suppose animation goes here as well, and the fight scenes are well-done. Not the type of fight scenes you\'d expect from a 12-episode harem series, but still well-done.Sound: 10/10Here\'s something Infinite Stratos is definitely good at. Sound in this show is quite excellent; the quality of BGMs on battle scenes are at a level that probably won\'t match the storytelling. Opening and ending themes are also well-done. Look, if you want to get a general feel of Infinite Stratos without watching it, then go look for its OST tracks. You pretty much get all the good points of Infinite Stratos by listening to the OST alone. (There\'s no harem in OSTs, right?)Character: 6/10The only reason I didn\'t give this a score lower than 5 is because of a certain French girl (this statement also happens to be a weird Titanic reference). The rest of the characters are pretty much shallow; actually, they\'re just ""pretty."" Not even the lead character stands out. Our lead Orimura is just a dense boy with a strange admiration for his older sister (no worries, it isn\'t incestuous); his childhood friend is the usual tsundere; the English girl is just simply arrogant and aggressive (but she\'s not annoying, though; I did like her at one point); the Chinese girl is also a tsundere (surprise, surprise); the French girl is the only character that has an actual backstory worthy of being called a ""backstory;"" the German girl is the one with a weird obsession for both Orimura and his sister (this is the kind of obsession you should worry about). I\'ve pretty much described the other 4 characters. I\'d really like to do defense on the French girl, but she comes out near the middle of the series, so I\'ll leave it for you guys to watch and find out.Enjoyment: 10/10This might seem confusing, since I gave some components pretty low scores. I already mentioned that Infinite Stratos pretty much embodies my dream anime (only ruined by a harem element). In this sense, I did give it a chance, and I did like it. I suppose it was because of the suits? Perhaps I really just wanted to see mecha-stye battle suits. It was so close to being my dream animé. So close.Overall: 8/10Generally, Infinite Stratos is lackluster. My scores for Enjoyment are pretty much fed by bias; had I had a different idea for a dream animé, Infinite Stratos would have scored pretty low. However, if you\'re into harems and fanservice, and if you have the slightest interest in mechas, then you might just like Infinite Stratos. I watched the show like how I leisurely go hiking on a mountain. You don\'t hike to meet and talk with your fellow hikers; you hike to enjoy the view. That\'s what I did with Infinite Stratos: I didn\'t watch to understand the people inside; I really just watched for the view. And by my standards, it was a pretty good view. long as the female lead doesn\'t lead the series into a shoujo dive.Keeping this in mind, I searched for shows that have any one or a combination of these characteristics. I searched high and low (I wasn\'t aware of MAL at the time I watched Infinite Stratos), and I eventually stumbled on Infinite Stratos.Characters:- Clean and neat, with the occasional excessive cheek tints. (AWESOME!)Fanservice:- Bordering the allowable and the excessive, but nevertheless still allowable. (Fine.)Mechas?:- Yes. Battle suit-style mechas. (F**K YEAH!)Tags:- Mecha (AWESOME!)- Romance (NICE)- Harem (...huh?)Then the plot dawned me. Frankly I was initially disappointed to see that the title closest to being my dream animé was quite possibly the largest harem I\'ve ever encountered (and frankly, it still is). At least Gundam 00 had 4 Gundam Meisters; Code Geass had a myriad of pilots; even Megaman X had Maverick Hunters and Navigators. And here we have Infinite Stratos, set in an instructional school in a setting where females are the only ones capable of piloting these mecha suits--with the exception of our lead character. (Whether this is positive or negative is entirely up to the reader.)

That\'s what I did with Infinite Stratos: I didn\'t watch to understand the people inside; I really just watched for the view. And by my standards, it was a pretty good view.', 'Even before I touched the play button on Infinite Stratos (IS), all I\'ve heard about it was ""wow so generic"", ""so boring T_T"", ""another one of those stupid harem ones"". Screw what people think, but I still started watching with a rather pessimistic opinion. IS is generic, but what\'s so bad about being generic? Isn\'t the entire definition of being general the idea that it follows the popular and majority trend? Truthfully, an anime that is only accused of being generic doesn\'t provide ample and concrete evidence of being a bad anime. In fact, I believe that IS is progressing rather nicely. Despite the setback...from the uneventful first few episodes, the later episodes really suggest some exciting developments into this ""generic"" load. Nevertheless, before you read on, think about why you even watch anime. Is it only to avoid watching generic animes and, as a result, stuffing your brain full of random crap that you don\'t even like or are you truly watching anime for the enjoyments and benefits it gives, regardless of the peripheral labels and whatever\'s been said about it? Hopefully it\'s the latter, because if you chose the former, then there really isn\'t a point in reading on since I\'m pretty sure you\'ve already made up your mind about Infinite Stratos.Story (5/10)Despite the previous paragraph of me showering praises on IS, I\'m getting out my flamethrower and shoop da whooping the story and setting. Seriously, the plot doesn\'t make any god dam sense. Infinite Stratos follows the life of Ichika, as he transfers to the Infinite Stratos (basically a mechanical body armor) Academy as the only guy since apparently only girls can use IS. There he meets a few childhood friends ( girls of course) and seduces a couple more distinguished students -- basically a harem type setting. When I first saw the mech stuff, I thought ""crap, what a ripoff mating between code geass and gundam."" Hey! We have these giant bigass robot suits and we\'re just going to fly around in them for fun! Achieving something with IS? Tehe no need for tha- OF COURSE YOU NEED A FOKIN STORY. Seriously, screw this plot. It\'s illogical and pitiful. This is where the ""generic"" accusation hits Infinite Stratos hard in the nuts (or somewhere else for girls). The lack of an adamant plot development, coupled with absolutely no innovation on the mecha aspect vehemently cripples the story potential of Infinite Stratos. Sometimes I feel like I\'m just being pulled around randomly by IS. Suddenly there\'s this event, then there\'s that event, and etc... IS doesn\'t show the viewers the way it\'s heading, if it\'s even heading a way. For some viewers who are ravenously persistent for a bite of plot, Infinite Stratos has left them to starve in the crappy 3-D world.Art (10/10)The art... what can I say. I guess animes have large budgets nowadays because the art is absolutely fantastic. Ahh...Charlotte...she\'s drawn so cute and so awesomely 2-D styled that it really makes me feel better watching the parts with her in it and makes me feel nicer towards the entire series. If you take an incredibly obsessive preference in art like me, then Infinite Stratos will not disappoint you in that aspect. Prepare those pencils and papers, and the mouse on the pause key.Character (9/10)Everytime I decide to watch an anime under the harem label, I prepare myself for immutable facepalms and headdesks at how pathetic the male character will be. Lucky for my brain cells, Ichika didn\'t kill as many of them as other harem animes would have (It\'s ridiculous how much calculus I forgot after watching certain parts of To-Love-Ru). Ichika is a bit spineless at times but overall he has the right spirit. The problem with having that typical ""I\'ll protect you"" spirit is that it\'s overused to the point where they forcefully yell it out every, oh let\'s say 5 minutes. And of course, that\'ll cause this bunch of lovey-dovey mushy crap to magically appear and ruin whatever positive feelings I have towards the anime. Ichika had less of those experiences, but nevertheless, he is still lacking the standard of determination, seriousness, and independence that I look for in male protagonists. As for the girls, all of them (except for a few of them when they are in their super WTF tsundere mode) were decent and tolerable. Laura and Charlotte were probably my favorites. Laura, for the groundbreaking determination she shows later that\'s rarely seen in harem types, and Charlotte simply because she\'s so cute.  Everytime Charlotte says ""Ichika, you pervert"" with that shy look on her face, my infinite quantum black hole of a heart melts a little. I would have given the characters a 10/10, but Ichika\'s lack of skill and an adamant personality, and the other average characters unfortunately lowers the aggregate score to an 8/10.Enjoyment (8/10)I certainly do enjoy IS very much. It gives me the feelings of living in such an academy and the excitement of endeavoring in those events (both unfulfillable in the mundane 3-D world). However, one thing that I find IS to be lacking in is consistency. During one fight, Ichika is suddenly god-hack mode powerful. In the next fight, he\'s pathetically weak and a pushover. This inability to adequately address his skill level on a stable standard shows mediocre planning and over-exaggeration on idea conveyance. Another hole in the enjoyment of Infinite Stratos is the predictability of some battles, and how incredibly annoying it is to always have Ichika lose the battle when he\'s about to win because of some retarded reasons like ""running out of energy"". Overlooking these two flaws, Infinite Stratos can be very entertaining for some personality of people.Overall (7/10)Infinite Stratos has amazing art and pretty good characters, however, it only gets an average 7. It\'s tragic to see an anime with a high potential of proving itself despite being criticized for being ""generic"" only to fail miserably with the lack of a concrete plot. It\'s truly tragic. If the producers only spent a bit more time to develop a plot for IS, I believed that it could have well received higher scores and reviews. However to me, it seem like the producers kind of just half- assed their way through, trying to make an exciting action packed harem type anime, without actually having to plan for an exciting action packed harem type anime. You know what they say about life. ""Nothing is free"". from the uneventful first few episodes, the later episodes really suggest some exciting developments into this ""generic"" load.

""Nothing is free"".', 'First of all i would like to start this review with the fact that THIS IS NOT AN  ""Genres: Action, Mecha, Sci-Fi, Shounen""  but it\'s a  ""Harem, Romance , Mecha with a spoon of Action and a pinch of Shounen""  , i dont even feel the need to add a Sci-fi genre considering this is a mecha anime .And second is that this show has nothing original in it , the Mecha looks like Strike Witches with some add on , the characters are like any harem characters , the story  ( still undeveloped )  gives you nothing...to even consider a storyline or just leaves you with some questions , the sound is okey , nothing new , nothing original .Chapter 1 :  ""The story""I would say , what story , the only things given are the fact that only females wear the mecha suits and for some reason the male character  ( THE MALE since i have seen no other males so far )  can also use them and a fight at the very beginning with an unknown  ""enemy"" .And that is it , ohh i forgot , the scientist who created these mechas is missing? if i recall it and there are only a  ""few""  mechas  ( a couple hundred for the entire world ) .Chapter 2 :  ""The art""I would say it\'s very ordinary , nothing really stands out as good . The movements seem fluid but like i said , just ordinary .Chapter 3 :  ""The sound""Again , nothing special , the OP seems okeyish but it\'s like i seen something the same more than once and it doesn\'t really make it more interesting at all .The ED is far worst than the OP imo , something used like a thousand times . The only sound that is okey and blends well is probably the  ""during the view""  sounds you encounter , they fit good enough with the scenes played .Chapter 4 :  ""The character""This is the worst part of this show imho .You have the thick like a brick male lead with a  ""wanabe""cool attitude surrounded by girls ;The blonde with blue eyes  ""foreign high-class""  stereotype with a superiority complex that  breaks?  down immediately after facing off the main male character and falls in love with him , going from hate to love in like  ""snap""  ;The  ""childhood friend""  who\'s an usual tsundere  ( like many other )  who is also a kendo master? and has a promise  ( of love probably )  with the main character that he forgot , before she had to leave  ( like many other ) ;And in episode 3 we\'re introduced to  another?!  childhood friend , who is also chasing after the male character with a promise of  ""being together forever""  that the male character conveniently misunderstood being the brick , oups i mean thick as he is ;And the cherry on top for all of them is the fact that there are a lot of misunderstandings between them or subtext or one sided emotions that create a lot of awkward scenes that usually end up with the male character getting wacked or something like that .Chapter 5 :  ""The enjoyment""I would like to say that i started off kind of enjoying the show , with good expectations of shounen mecha action  ( mostly because of the first minute of the show and the setting used for the show , an academy for training to fight? )  but by episode 3 kind of all of it was shattered with the 15 times use of the word  ""childhood friend""  to  ""clear"" misunderstandings , and totally setting the show on a harem / romance path .OVERALL  i would say this show is like a combination of Strike Witches + Chrome Shelled Regios +  ""insert random genre/show stereotype"" x \'n\' . The probably only  ""original""  ( as in  ""i have not seen that many"" )  is the having of two  ""childhood friends""  introduced as such , and they clearly try to sell out this in episode three one way to many times .For mecha / harem / romance fans this will be a show they probably will like , but for people who expected to see mecha / action this will be an annoying show . to even consider a storyline or just leaves you with some questions , the sound is okey , nothing new , nothing original .Chapter 1 :  ""The story""I would say , what story , the only things given are the fact that only females wear the mecha suits and for some reason the male character  ( THE MALE since i have seen no other males so far )  can also use them and a fight at the very beginning with an unknown  ""enemy"" .And that is it , ohh i forgot , the scientist who created these mechas is missing? if i recall it and there are only a  ""few""  mechas  ( a couple hundred for the entire world ) .Chapter 2 :  ""The art""I would say it\'s very ordinary , nothing really stands out as good .

This doesn't mean I examine and inspect every aspect of the show, but that I try to discern the things it does well and the things it doesn't do well so that I may develop an informed opinion of it. Sometimes, however, I don't really want to bother with that, and I just want to sit back and enjoy myself without having to worry too much about reading through the lines, and usually I'll reserve moeblob anime such A-Channel or Hidamari Sketch for this role. This time, however, I decided to go with a...harem.And it was not a good decision.Infinite Stratos has a standard harem setting: the slow, kind, and incredibly normal male main character, Orimura Ichika, transfers into an all-girls military academy that trains teenagers to pilot 'IS', highly advanced power suits which can be piloted only by women and, mysteriously, our male hero. Okay, so maybe that's not very standard, but it certainly isn't as awesome as it sounds. The all-girls setting naturally paves the way for a harem (though pretty much the whole school wants to shag Ichika), this particular one consisting of five main archety-COUGH I mean 'characters': the tsundere childhood friend, the posh foreigner, the genre-savvy bishoujo (well they're all bishoujos, really), the stoic social retard, and a second tsundere childhood friend.None of these characters are developed particularly well, any development being completely cliché or just simply not existing – this is particularly evident in the case of our main character, Ichika, who remains constantly stupid, hard-headed, overly-optimistic and COMPLETELY oblivious to his harem throughout the entirety of the show. No, I don't like him, why do you ask?In any case, regardless of the characterisation, the story doesn't very much help to relieve it: the opening sequence shows the group battling a mysterious IS, with heavy hints at a bigger plot in the background being dropped all over the show, with a major one presenting itself roughly halfway though. The thing is, though... that this 'secret and dark background plot' never actually happens. All the introduced implications are completely ignored by the finale and never dealt with, leaving one with a bitter taste regarding the last few episodes due to its nature as a random 'monster of the week' crisis, and whilst the 'harem' plot shows some development, it is quickly shunted back to square one.As such, the majority of the series focuses on Ichika's school life and the various perverted situations he finds himself caught up in. But, as a general rule, this rarely works very well, and Infinite Stratos is no different, eventually becoming outright annoying due to Ichika's obliviousness to everything. And its not exactly as if the aesthetics help matters much: the animation is low quality and in some areas, outright shoddy, using some weak form of 3D CGI for the IS suits that doesn't work very well and can be very jarring to switch to; the audio is, frankly, completely forgettable.Infinite Stratos is an anime that achieves at, basically, absolutely nothing. Everything about it is completely standard, and represents exactly the issues the anime industry is facing with harem-based romantic-comedies. Nothing whatsoever is resolved by the conclusion, and the show just pissed me off more than anything else. As you have probably gotten by now, I don't recommend watching this in the least. 2 out of motherfucking 10. harem.And it was not a good decision.Infinite Stratos has a standard harem setting: the slow, kind, and incredibly normal male main character, Orimura Ichika, transfers into an all-girls military academy that trains teenagers to pilot 'IS', highly advanced power suits which can be piloted only by women and, mysteriously, our male hero. Okay, so maybe that's not very standard, but it certainly isn't as awesome as it sounds. The all-girls setting naturally paves the way for a harem (though pretty much the whole school wants to shag Ichika), this particular one consisting of five main archety-COUGH I mean 'characters': the tsundere childhood friend, the posh foreigner, the genre-savvy bishoujo (well they're all bishoujos, really), the stoic social retard, and a second tsundere childhood friend.None of these characters are developed particularly well, any development being completely cliché or just simply not existing – this is particularly evident in the case of our main character, Ichika, who remains constantly stupid, hard-headed, overly-optimistic and COMPLETELY oblivious to his harem throughout the entirety of the show. No, I don't like him, why do you ask?In any case, regardless of the characterisation, the story doesn't very much help to relieve it: the opening sequence shows the group battling a mysterious IS, with heavy hints at a bigger plot in the background being dropped all over the show, with a major one presenting itself roughly halfway though. The thing is, though... that this 'secret and dark background plot' never actually happens. All the introduced implications are completely ignored by the finale and never dealt with, leaving one with a bitter taste regarding the last few episodes due to its nature as a random 'monster of the week' crisis, and whilst the 'harem' plot shows some development, it is quickly shunted back to square one.As such, the majority of the series focuses on Ichika's school life and the various perverted situations he finds himself caught up in. But, as a general rule, this rarely works very well, and Infinite Stratos is no different, eventually becoming outright annoying due to Ichika's obliviousness to everything.

The main character is a retard who happens to be the ONLY male in the world to be able to operate an IS. The reasoning for this is explained later in the series, but if you haven\'t watched it then I won\'t say how. Did I mention how he had a sister complex? Anyway, this show contains almost all the harem cliched elements that one show could have.Elements:[X] Tsundere[X] Robot Girl (Laura)[X] Retarded male character[XX] Childhood friends[X] Girl with glasses[X] Reverse trap...[X] Bossy older sister[X] Main character walks into someone else changing (This happens way too often -___-)Those are the things that I remember seeing off the top of my head. I watched the show around 3 months ago and just now decided to write reviews. Anyway, Ichika is also oblivious to the extremely obvious signs that the females are giving showing that they want the D and it\'s not even funny. It\'s actually really annoying and stupid.I think this is how it went down:Ichika: ""I\'ll go out with you.""Houki: ""R-really?!""Ichika: ""Out shopping that is!""Me + Houki: -_____-Art: 5The artwork is average. It doesn\'t look any different than any other show that aired around the same time. Pretty standard modern anime designs. Nothing too special.Sound: 6The sound is  average, but I really liked the ED. I downloaded the song. Nothing really needs to be said about this other than average.Character: 3The characters are pretty bad. Cecilia was really annoying and went from tsun to dere in one episode. It might not really be a big deal, but that\'s just not right. Ichika is a complete idiot and gives off the idea that he has no fucking clue what is going on around him and somehow that gives him the attention of the entire academy. The girls there must have low standards or not like men with brains at that school.Enjoyment: 4Honestly, the only thing I enjoyed about this show would have to be Charlotte. I\'m a huge moefag and she was just adorable.Overall: 4This show is really no different than any other harem. It\'s pretty average. If you like average, then this is the show for you.

It's sticking so close to the formula, in fact, that it feels like a copy-and-paste of harem anime done before.If you're someone who's seen plenty of anime in your time, particularly harem anime, you'll be pointing out many details, character-types and scenarios that are very typical to harem anime in general as you watch this.In short, this is just another harem anime. While the addition of the mech-suits makes for interesting possibilities, the characters themselves are cookie-cutter and predictable in...how they will act.If you enjoy eyecandy and what harem anime have to offer, you may like this series. But, if you're looking for something even slightly original, best look somewhere else. how they will act.If you enjoy eyecandy and what harem anime have to offer, you may like this series.

Ok, amigos how do I rate this anime:Story- 7Ok, so the anime is about a girl genius, Tabane Shinonono, who invented an exoskeletal suit called ""Infinite Stratos"" or ""IS"" for short, which  can only be operated by women thus gives them greater dominance in society and  leaving men to be wussies ( I wonder what happen to the nukes?) but the story is more focus...on the misadventures of the un-expecting Ichika the only muchacho who can operated an IS and with his harem, other genres are  trivial, but it\'s all good.Art- 6Artistically-wise, It\'s good, but the technicality bad. Well, I\'m referring to the mechs or IS\'s in a technical way is too overly decorated. Going to the school uniform, well, the way it is drawn it kinda conforms to the time but as in any school genre it  ain\'t 100% uniformed, co\'z every girl in the academy sport a different style: like when it comes to their socks: some wore high knee, some wore low knee, while there are others sport ankle length socks and as always they come either in black or white, but quite a few wore panty hoses . There is the shoes, which loafers are the usual choice by many, while quite a few have there own style of foot wear and let\'s not forget the skirt\'s length, in a schools genre the length of the skirt is either short or very short (Oh my I can see their panties from here), but rarely does it goes long, and in the case of this anime, I\'d say that this is the only one that I know which the length of the skirt or the whole uniform itself (since it is worn like a one piece dress with 3 layers beneath ) whose length varies from one girl to another.Sound- 7I just like the opening theme, that\'s all.Character - 7Ichika Orimura - As it is said he is the only muchacho in the academy, actually he never intended to attend the academy in the first place . It\'s just that he happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and can\'t seem to keep his hands to himself when he touched an IS, which by the way it reacted to him, thus he got drafted into the academy and he seem to do pretty good in getting into a lot of uncomfortable situations involving his harem. And as in any harem genre, he is oblivious and very much indecisive as what to do with them,  he operates a Byakushiki  a close quarter melee IS and he only has Yukihira type 2 saber as his weapon because of his kendo background, not surprising since he was trained by his Nazi sister Chifuyu.Houki Shinonono - Ichika\'s childhood friend (the 1st one), she\'s a tsundere which make up part of the harem, she and the muchacho (male lead) could have been lovers if she and her family were not not taken away and placed under protective custody due the sensitivity of her sister\'s work. She\'s an top notch kendo (and Iaido) practitioner, and she looks good in the uniform that she wore, in fact her style really trends up to that particular time (which is the future). She harbors feelings for the muchacho, however she can also kick his butt......when she\'s jealous and pissed. She\'s the first chica who slept with the muchacho (in separate beds of course) and she was almost see naked ( unintentionally that is). Since we now know what her personal IS look like which is the Akatsubaki, it is yet to know as to what it is capable of, judging from her kendo and iaido skills it is believe that her unit is a close quarter melee .Cecilia Alcott - the 2nd girl who entered the muchacho\'s life, overall, she\'s a bitch at first to the muchacho but later on warms up, she always brags about her being part of royalty (even if she\'s just been orphaned....according to info) and being a representative from the UK (my ass). She\'s very clingy to the muchacho and would be rude to anyone who comes near him, she\'s the forth girl which the muchacho has see naked (being topless in the beach counts and it\'s her fault ). Her uniform make her look like a granny, well she would look hotter if she wore the same style as Houki. She operates the Blue Tears a sniper platform IS, not much for a melee, since she relies on her unit\'s drones to get close to an opponent.Rin (or Lin) Yin Fang - 3rd chica to come into the muchachos life, actually she\'s suppose to be the 2nd girl into his life since she happens to be the muchacho\'s  2nd childhood friend, she\'s rather petite, flat chested and wore her uniform like a whore, but she make up for being a good cook ( according to info) though in this anime she only presented the muchacho her sweet and sour pork dish and she can also be a handful for the muchacho when she\'s pissed or jealous. she has a medium melee or  frontal assult type of IS which is the Sheng Long, which aside from having Impact Cannon, it is also equipped  2 big meat cleavers when joint up it becomes a spear with 2 tips at opposite sides, I guess she\'s a kung-fu practitioner to have that kind of melee weapon.Charles or Charlotte Dunios - 4th chica to come by, at first she was able to fool the muchacho that she\'s a man (and so as everyone else), until he accidentally saw her naked while taking a shower, which by the way she\'s the 1st girl whom the muchacho has accidentally seen naked, twice, (being in the men\'s bath doesn\'t count, and Houki doesn\'t count either) and she the 2nd chica whom the latter slept with - in separated beds of course. Unlike other members of the muchacho\'s harem, she\'s more open minded and she\'s the only one whom the muchacho can related to . At first she wore a male uniform with a close turtle neck, then later on she sports a female school uniform, but the sneakers make her look like a middle schooler . Her IS is a mass produced 2nd generation unit called ""Rafale Revive"" which is a versatile multiple weapons platform, capable of sniping, assault and close quarter melee, and is probably be a formidable match to everyone else  except for Laura\'s IS. Later on she decided to come out clean and declared that she\'s a girl and not a boy to the disgust of everyone else towards the muchacho, so much so that he\'s about to be killed by a jaded Rin.Bodewig Laura - the 5th chica to come by and gave the muchacho a slap in the cheek ,  she\'s a genetically designed super soldier  (according to info) and has a VT system implanted in her. Her school uniform makes her look like a member of the Nazi since she did came from Germany, at first she dislike the muchacho because she blames him for her idol (Chifuyu) for leaving Germany, but after beating her in the tournament with help from Charles or Charlotte she warms up to the muchacho and even giving him his first kiss.  She also declared him to be her husband (though they are not even married yet) after saving him from a jaded Rin and she\'s the 2nd chica whom the muchacho saw her naked which she intended it or maybe she really does sleep naked, she\'s the 3rd chica whom the muchacho slept with... in the same bed this time and nothing happen between them. Her Schwarze Regen is a heavy artillery, assault and a close quarter type IS, which is equipped with an AIC that can be used as a defensive shield against an incoming assaults or attacks. She\'s also a member of Schwarzer Hase special forces in Germany whose members also wore ridiculous eye patches even if they have both their eyes.Orimura Chifuyu - Ichika\'s big sister and is also his homeroom teacher, she\'s also his first kendo instructor . She the muchacho\'s only immediate family, she\'s a highly skilled kendo and iaido practitioner, she competed in various Mondo Grosso tournament and won (why don\'t they just call it an IS tournament?) except in the finals where she had to drop out in order to save his brother. She has a Nazi like method when teaching, dealing and training her students and seem to have dominatrix attitude with the way she dress and the way she wore a bikini and probably the way she wore her lingerie.Yamada Maya - Ichika\'s other class instructor who looks too young to be one and seems to be the same age as a 3rd year student, but her big boobies and sweet character make up for her kiddie stature.Tabane Shinonono- Houki\'s big sister,  who sports rabbit ears and wore a granny dress, she has a voice of a girl from the 6th grade. She designed the exoskeleton unit called ""Infinite Stratos,"" she was able to exercise leverage against any nations who wanna use her design for war by implement an ""IS Treaty"" that regulates the used and distribution of the IS units.Others-.......well they are just trivial, so why such rating, co\'z I like the way the how the author designates  the roles and situations of the characters.Enjoyment: 7Well\' let\'s face it, what makes this anime enjoyable is the muchacho\'s way with his harem, which  get\'s him in a lot of cabeza del dolor (headaches). Also, the IS units who were duking out with one another, but the main piece de resistance is the ultimate battle with a drone and knowing as to who the main villain is. Which, by the way I\'m suspecting Tabane Shinonono since she designed the IS in the first place and she\'s the only who has a monopoly with the IS Core design so it\'s possible that she can make an IS capable of functioning without a human operator.Overall: 7Overall it\'s enjoyable and that\'s that. on the misadventures of the un-expecting Ichika the only muchacho who can operated an IS and with his harem, other genres are  trivial, but it\'s all good.Art- 6Artistically-wise, It\'s good, but the technicality bad.

Then we get to the real story, if you can even call it that.Instead of calling this the “story” section I would like it to be called the “content” section because there is only sort of a plot in the last 2 or 3 episodes....The plot presented in the end wasn’t even that good because there was hardly any build up to it. So for the most part we aren’t given a plot, which isn’t the problem because if done right a series with no plot could become really successful.  However, like many, it doesn’t do this right.  Each episode would focus on a character or two but the series didn’t even distribute the episodes evenly.  I think they gave maybe 5 episodes to Charlotte and maybe about 1 or 2 to each of the other characters.  However the things that happened in these episodes felt boring and it was just really another textbook Harem with the addition of ISs.The characters themselves weren’t even done too well.  Our male lead Ichika really is one of those weak, clueless harem leads, who does one nice thing for each female, getting them to all fall for him.  I really want to know the magic spell that makes all these useless male protagonists have endless amounts of females falling for them but I guess some things remain a mystery.  Why on Earth did the IS have to choose him!?The female characters are better but they still had problems. Perhaps it was because there were too many characters in the series and they weren’t given enough time to develop.  But I think the real problem was that some of their personality traits were unrealistic.  Some of the girls would get overly jealous when they saw Ichika with another girl and some characters would even have their whole personality change when they saw Ichika.  Another problem I found was that some girls would appear to be super powerful one week but when a new girl was introduced they would some how lose all that power.  The characters aren’t bad actually and the majority of them are likeable but they could’ve been better if they just toned down the jealousy a bit.The art was amazing though, the designs of the ISs were stunning and the battles themselves were really satisfying to watch.  The animation is up to par with most anime out there.Sound isn’t really something I pay attention to.  The opening and ending were catchy and the background music seemed alright (although I only listened to it sometimes) and the voice actors seemed to fit the character that they were playing.Although there were many things that I could think were wrong with the series, Infinite Stratos was actually something I wanted to watch every week.  Yes I did face palm quite a bit when watching this, but at the end of the day I did find this entertaining and it did make me laugh sometimes.At the end of the day I still felt that the final product of Infinite Stratos could’ve been much better.  It’s not bad but I was disappointed in the direction the series went.Thanks for reading :) The plot presented in the end wasn’t even that good because there was hardly any build up to it.

But no. IS turned out to be a project with great potential but no ambition.It's not like I don't like Ecchi and Harem. I like fan service a lot too. But watching Is I couldn't...help thinking that it could have been better.Let me tell you what I'm on about.Story: 1The story couldn't have been simpler. Orimura Ichika, a male student, is thrown into an academy, which trains it's students to pilot the IS weapon system. As it turns out, he is the only male in the ENTIRE school full of young girls looking for a boyfriend.Really? Come on man...Character: 2The only male character, Ichika, is an idiot and after intense training from elite students, has OK piloting skills. He is somehow entirely oblivious about the fact that every female in the academy loves him because there's no one else to fall in love to.And then there's the girls. There's the childhood friend (Houki), the prideful blond (Cecelia), the Loli (Lin), the shy girl (Charlotte), and genetically engineered super soldier (Laura), all trying desperately to get Ichika to love them. But Ichika obviously doesn't know that despite many obvious attempts.Overall: 2Overall, it's a huge let down from my expectations after the first 2 or 3 episodes. There were many copy and paste works and many events in the series were overused.In IS they tried to have a bit of everything. Romance, comedy, ecchi, harem, action, mecha, science fiction, the lot. But it just didn't work out. Maybe too many ingredients spoils the soup too.And the most frustrating thing was that, it could have been so much greater! The only redeeming point was the great artwork, soundtracks and the background music which, unlike the story and the characters, were quite outstanding. help thinking that it could have been better.Let me tell you what I'm on about.Story: 1The story couldn't have been simpler.

Quite often a somewhat gimmicky twist is tossed in that is supposed to refresh the watcher and make that anime rise above others of the same type. This anime doesn\'t break that mold, but it creates a great set of characters, and it\'ll keep you laughing.Story: The story is probably the biggest lacking factor of this show, it leaves you...wanting more story in a way that turns you off. It featured an annoying amount of plot holes, with somewhat crazy crap happening with no specific reason. If you are in the least bit versed in any anime of a similar kind, you will see ""twists"" a mile away. Even though the show features mech battles, they are quite infrequent, and are rarely long enough to satisfy mech enthusiasts.It does hit the typical ecchi anime bumps every ecchi anime hits, with the main lead always accidentally fall on the women around him and then as such, slaps him and gets incredibly mad (blah blah blah). It does have it\'s golden moments though, and when you finish it, you will be wanting more.Art: Genuinely surprised me. The mechs are throughly detailed, beautifully animated,and the mech battles appropriately flashy and very well done. The characters all have little details that are rarely forgotten when the characters are shown, even if for a brief moment. The varied use of colors makes it pleasing to the eyes, never sinking into territory too dark, light, or bland unless trying to give off that vibe, to which point it displays it well.Sound: The opening song is just the typical anime opening, nothing special but at least it\'s not grating or saccharine sweet like many others I\'ve seen. But when it comes down to matter of sound effects, voice acting, ambient noise, and non-opening music, it does it\'s job well, making the sound an important part of the show overall, as sound should.Character: Most characters are well fleshed out, and have a few traits to put them above the rest of the pack. I would have probably given it a 10 for characters if it weren\'t for how annoying they made the lead character. He is pretty much the ""Oh no! My friends are in danger, I\'ll go save them even if all my limbs are torn off and my body burned to ashes!"" Although that may be an exaggeration, the main character is painfully similar to so many others. I understand that how oblivious he is adds to some of the comedy, but it\'s just so predictable and painful to have such a character. He\'s probably not as bad as I portray him to most, but there is definitely a pattern. Like I said, all the other characters are well done, and are a breath of fresh air in the genre.Overall: I highly recommend you watch this if you are a fan of romantic comedy, ecchi, harem, high school life, and those who like mechs get a fair share of what they desire. As the show does typically forgo the action in turn of a perverted accident scene, mech-heads will enjoy the detail put into each mech and mech battle, no matter how few there are. The characters are typically wonderful and consistent. The show looks great. Although the story isn\'t the best I\'ve seen, it in no way hinders this fine show. It\'s sad how inconclusive they made the ending,  but it hints to another season when plot holes can be filled and we can be reintroduced to such great characters.9/10 Highly Recommended wanting more story in a way that turns you off.

Infinite Stratos was not what was advertised, I was expecting something completely different than what I got. And the answer is yes, this is not a good show. It will not be remembered in 10 years. The only way that will happen is if the light novels do something drastic. But if it was a bad show, why is my score so high?Infinite Stratos' story is simple enough, 5 girls all find out ways how to get in Ichika's pants. They...haven't really given another story for me to consider, which is expected as apparently the story in the light novels doesn't pick up until the 5th one. So right now, it is a generic harem with mechs. But these mechs aren’t any normal mechs; they can only be piloted by females. Or so the world thought until Ichika stumbled upon a personal IS. He is the first, and as of now, the only male able to pilot them. I can only guess that it has something to do with magic, as physically, males are much stronger than females. Another theory suggests that females can fit into an IS and males can't because females do not have a penis, and Ichika's is so small he is able to pilot one. The story is the shows weakest aspect and do not watch this if you are looking for a deep compelling plot.The second weakest aspect of this show is the characters. We have our dense protagonist, Ichika, who couldn't tell if a girl liked him even if she were sucking his dick. He is the definition of clueless and it is quite frustrating to watch him be completely oblivious to all of the girls around him. Then we have our harem members: Houki (Japan), Cecilia (Britain), Rin (China), Charlotte (France) and finally Laura (Germany). Houki doesn't really have any redeeming qualities, except for tits that can sink the titanic. I'm not sure what is up with Japanese girls having the biggest breasts out of any other girl in every anime, but Houki is no exception. Oh, and she's a tsudere... I guess. Cecilia is the stereotypical British snob who makes terrible food. That's the best summary I can give of her as I literally do not know what else to write. Rin is the smallest of all the girls, and never really got anywhere with Ichika. She has a short temper, I guess. But other than that she gets the least amount of screen time. Charlotte is by far the best and hottest character on the show. She has many redeeming qualities including boobs that can change size for the convenience of the plot, deep purple eyes and silky white skin. Not even Ichika, the gayest of the gay harem main characters can resist that... Or so I thought. She is the best character on the show in my opinion. Then we have Laura, the warmongering German who sneaks into Ichika's bed at night. She apparently isn't aware that sleeping in the same bed as a boy naked might give him the wrong (or right, depending how you look at it) impression. Aside from Charlotte, the show has no memorable characters.The animation and sound in this show is excellent. I typically don't like CG effects in anime but this show does it excellently. The mech fights are beautiful and fast paced. The way the camera moves during them makes you feel like you're part of the battle. The music during the battles is usually hit and miss, but the battles that have good music are noticeably better. The OP and ED are J-pop, so I wasn't a fan of them. There is also not one average looking girl in this show, they are all extremely hot.Despite this shows flaws, and it has a lot of flaws, I found myself thoroughly enjoyed and thoroughly annoyed at the same time. I am fully aware that this show is bad, but it's so bad it's good. If you want to sit back and watch some mindless entertainment, look no further as Infinite Stratos fits this bill perfectly. haven't really given another story for me to consider, which is expected as apparently the story in the light novels doesn't pick up until the 5th one.

That’s not to say that there isn't anything to enjoy in this school setting story... right?Every country gets one personalized IS machine and send their representative to the school where he is located for training. There are plenty of others that get the old run down machines essentially....Ichika, being the only male pilot, gets his own personal machine… That about sums up the uniqueness of our lead.

He being the second male IS pilot steals away Ichika from the other females as Ichika tries to bond with this new male presence in a sea of women.

It has its own originality and it was developed quite smoothly. The mecha stuffs were average as compared to other mecha shows. It is mainly because the story revolves around the love aspect. So its basically like a comedy-harem plot with an extra ""mecha"" aspect to simply prevent it to be like any typical harem animeArtThe visuals were standard as They focused more on the interactions between the characters . However the character designs were really great. As you can see from the poster, the character designs were above average and we can really pick off any emotions that characters try to hide, just from their facial expressions . And the character designs highlights every individual in the show and portray them more efficaciously .SoundThe OP and ed was catchy and worth listening to , However the sound effects were horrible. They did not stand out and left no impressions. The sound effects literally did nothing in the entire anime but fortunately there\'s the great art to back up for itCharacterThe worst aspect of the anime. In merely 12 episodes , Infinite Stratos have to micro manage and cover 6 main characters . Of course with the first episode as introduction being left out , 11 episodes to develop the characters were simply insufficient. Another of a harem member kept joining the crew and there\'s no time to stop ,and understand more about every single character. Almost all the characters were briefly introduced and we do know anything beyond that. At least the ""main"" main character ; Houki was at least more concisely introduced.Enjoyment + OverallEven though this anime has its flaws , i believe its worth your time . I really enjoyed it and i had fun watching all different personalites coming in at once.But dont ever watch this seriously , instead try to enjoy it because of its humour and its light-heartedness.Story-7Art-8Sound-5Character-5Enjoyment-7Overall-7 -a little bit of plot-hot chicks & TsundereSNot for people who wants- Seriousness- Two-sided romance- Super Intense Mech fight/battles- Deep plot- Smart and cool and op MC who understands everything- more than 2 teachers in the class.- Dual Gender Academy- yanderesThe StoryInfinite Stratos has a generally well-written story . It has its own originality and it was developed quite smoothly. The mecha stuffs were average as compared to other mecha shows. It is mainly because the story revolves around the love aspect. So its basically like a comedy-harem plot with an extra ""mecha"" aspect to simply prevent it to be like any typical harem animeArtThe visuals were standard as They focused more on the interactions between the characters . However the character designs were really great. As you can see from the poster, the character designs were above average and we can really pick off any emotions that characters try to hide, just from their facial expressions . And the character designs highlights every individual in the show and portray them more efficaciously .SoundThe OP and ed was catchy and worth listening to , However the sound effects were horrible. They did not stand out and left no impressions. The sound effects literally did nothing in the entire anime but fortunately there\'s the great art to back up for itCharacterThe worst aspect of the anime. In merely 12 episodes , Infinite Stratos have to micro manage and cover 6 main characters . Of course with the first episode as introduction being left out , 11 episodes to develop the characters were simply insufficient. Another of a harem member kept joining the crew and there\'s no time to stop ,and understand more about every single character. Almost all the characters were briefly introduced and we do know anything beyond that. At least the ""main"" main character ; Houki was at least more concisely introduced.Enjoyment + OverallEven though this anime has its flaws , i believe its worth your time . I really enjoyed it and i had fun watching all different personalites coming in at once.But dont ever watch this seriously , instead try to enjoy it because of its humour and its light-heartedness.Story-7Art-8Sound-5Character-5Enjoyment-7Overall-7', 'Japan engineered an armed exoskeleton weapon known as Infinite Stratos (IS for short) and it became the mainstream of weapons. However for some reason, only women are able to operate the IS and therefore, women are now favored in society over men. Orimura Ichika is a 15 year old boy and accidentally touches an IS placed in the IS pilot training school. He is found to be the first and only man who can operate IS and forced to enter the training school, which only consisted of girls. And so the tale goes on, of how Orimura Ichika’s life is surrounded by girls, has begun.-Review:...Firstly, as the synopsis states, IS is an armed exoskeleton weapon created by Japan. To some certain extend, it can only be operated by women. But one day, a boy named Orimura Ichika accidentally touches an IS placed in the IS training school, and it resonated with him and moved. Therefore, that makes Ichika, the only male to operate this mainstream weapon. Which also draws him a huge amount of publicity in this series’s universe because first and foremost, IS can only be operated by women. In addition to that, the IS is a mainstream weapon currently being the biggest hype of the Infinite Stratos universe. Imagine you being the only guy to operate this powerful weapon, which has the ability to destroy a few thousand missiles at once (mini spoiler). Certainly the world government, who was in opposition of the IS at first, will take an interest in this matter.But the strong points of this series does not lie mainly on the synopsis, in fact this series is highly focused on the daily highschool life of Orimura Ichika (protagonist) in an ALL GIRLS SCHOOL. You heard me, the ONLY guy in an ALL GIRLS SCHOOL. By all girls school, i’m referring to IS academy which is built solely to train women to resonate with the IS. Up to date, it is the only school that offers IS training in the world. So yes, our little protagonist is one heck of a lucky guy. As the series progresses, you will get to witness the cruelty of this world. By cruelty, i’m referring to the possible jealousy of fellow otaku’s as Ichika indulges his everyday life with physically, perfectly crafted girls. Yes, the main teaser of this series, is Ichika’s harem. Honestly if you think about it, this whole setup was for the sole purpose of Ichika’s harem.\u2028\u2028So Infinite Stratos girls? What’s the fun in that? Aren’t they just normal anime girls? Believe me, I had thought for a moment while looking that the illustration, that this was just going to be another comedy harem anime, with newly introduced big chested girls in each episode clinging and slutting all over Ichika after first sight. My part of my interpretation that was not entirely wrong, because the character developments in this series was just plain horrible and they certainly did, cling onto him at first sight. Despite knowing that after watching the first few episodes, I was still intrigued by this series, especially at the girls. Why?There was no particular reason actually. Although the first few phrases of character developments was just as mainstream as highschool DxD, I was gradually attracted to the characters after a few revolutionizing events in the series, and when the “fierce competition” between the girls over Ichika came to an understanding and there was actual development and progression between Ichika and one of the protagonist girls in his “harem”. After that phrase was over, the story will continue, after all that senseless ecchi.One of the main portfolios of this anime series, is the dynamic animation between battle scenes. The aerial camera views that were normally used in 3rd person flight simulation games, was flawlessly implemented into the dramatic battle scenes between the IS. In addition to that, the IS armors were well designed, compared to the original, manga design. Much more details and texture was added into the IS armor designs and these details were maintained throughout the anime series. In conjunction to the consistent animation between the IS battles, the frames in between these fights were also very smooth, there was very little “lag” during the IS battles which makes it extra enjoyable and boost the viewers expectations. \u2028\u2028However the animation was not throughly consistent throughout the whole anime series. The downside to the animation in this series was mainly during the slice of life events of Ichika. Time to time, the animation seems to slack between the conversation between characters and at other times, the characters facial expression are bluntly portrayed. In addition to the character animation, at times the color contrast on the characters are just plain dull.In all mecha related anime, sound is essential to lighten up the tension during a battle. Overall the sound was on an average level. The sound effects were good, it had variation according to each IS suit, and dynamics that were proportional to distance in aerial combat. The opening and ending theme songs were just so so, it was congruent with the opening and ending animation but they arn’t that catchy because of the inconsistent rhythm. However the main downside to the sound was it’s repetitive use of tracks which got boring after a while.But if I must say, the main downside of this whole series is infact, the generic stereotype theme of which the characters are adapted from.Overall, this is definitely a series worth investing your time into for all those mecha fans, because it brings a whole new battle viewing experience with the enhanced dynamical camera views. Aside from that, the relationship between Ichika and the girls are certainly something to look forward too while waiting for the 2nd season of Infinite Stratos to air.

With that said I am trying to keep this review as neutral as possible, because while I did have problems with Infinite Stratos, the show isn't all bad at all. I think Lantis did...a very good job with the Anime because they know their target audience, a demographic that people like me are rarely apart of.Story - 3/10If you've seen this Anime or read the MAL synopsis (which if you haven't, I don't know why you're reading this...) then you already know what the story is about so I'll forgo explaining it again. It's not hard to see that this particular story is aimed towards men/males. With the amount of female fan service and Action in it, any stereotypical male Anime fan would probably enjoy the story a lot. The story in itself is decent. Call it what you want, but on the surface it's your typical Mecha with the Harem genre thrown in. Okay, let me phrase that differently, because the Harem aspect of the Anime isn't just thrown in willy nilly. It's a main part of the story, which is one of the key contributing factor to why IS: Infinite Stratos is as popular as it is. As a female myself, this series could of been really, really good. Maybe it's the fact that the ladies of the IS: Infinite Stratos verse has this special power that no man in the world has, and that is what attracted me to the Anime... but beyond that, nada. This Anime had the chance to take a good plot point and turn it into something great (without getting rid of the fan service or the Harem genre I might add)... but it just fell flat. In the end that is why the story only got a 3/10 from me, because while it really did have so much potential, it just wasted it.Art - 5/10Compared to the rest of the Anime, the art in IS: Infinite Stratos wasn't THAT much of a bother to me, in this category, the pro's far out way the cons. From a female's point of view, the character designs were somewhat realistic. This Anime did play a lot on the size of the breasts of the main girls, and honestly it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I thought that they kind of toned it down considering I.S is a Harem/Mecha Anime aimed at guys. Apart from character designs, the art is quite good. The backgrounds that were used were quite nice, not amazing considering this anime is set in the future, but nice. The only problem I had with the art; that I know a lot of people have problems with too was the use of CGI. While the Mech scenes had great designs and some amazing backgrounds (see the whole fight in Episode 12), the scenes with CGI gave me huge headache to watch. The CG felt extremely out of place at times and a little bit over used. Maybe if it was consistent throughout the whole show it would have been okay. But it wasn't and I personally felt that the CGI didn't contribute in any way to the fight scenes... but well, that's up for interpretation.Sound - 6/10This is where I think IS: Infinite Stratos really strives. The Anime's OP is really nice as a whole and has some really enjoyable moments in it. At the start, the OP didn't hold any interest for me and I skipped it for the first seven or so episodes; but then it really started to grow on me around episode 9/10, and by the time I got around to watching the OVA I was really happy that they kept it in there. As for the OST, there weren't any memorable tracks on it that made me stop and go 'Wow, that's really great!’ It was just kind of there and I didn’t really have a problem with it. Now the reason that the sound category gets the highest rating of a '6' out of ten is because of the bloody ending. I don't really have much to say about it- no that's wrong, I have a lot to say about this ending. The only way I could describe my feelings towards it are 'catchy as fuck' and 'on par with the ending for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya' which is really saying a lot. I don't expect everybody to agree with me, but 'Super Stream' is currently playing on repeat while I write this review, and I don't think it's going to leave my head any time soon.Character - 2/10I don't even feel like talking about the characters, because that's how bad they are.Firstly we have our main character who is called Aichki or either Ikachi (I'm not actually sure). But for the purpose of this review, I am going to refer to his as 'Gary Stu'. Gary Stu, who is the main character of IS: Infinite Stratos is what I like to refer to as a 'Wish Fulfilment character'. More than anything else, I would love to be able to call him by his name... but I can't. Gary is the affection of every girl he comes into contact with (a fan boy's wet dream come true). He is the only existing male pilot of the IS, and oh, it seems he can do anything these woman can do, but ten times better. I will compliment Gary on not being a complete pervert though.Next we have the girls of this Anime. IS: Infinite Stratos presents us with: a tsundere, a childhood friend and another childhood friend, who guess what? Also happens to be tsundere. These three fight over Gary Stu like it's no one’s business, and of course our Gary is oblivious as ever, because that tends to be the norm in most Harem Anime's. This is where the rest of the characters pick up the slack to get this category up to 2/10. I don't mind Charlotte (Charles) and Laura in the slightest. Charlotte and Laura were the last two characters to be introduced, and I thought Charlotte got the most development (probably not as much as Houki, but she's the first girl introduced and Gary's 'first childhood friend'). I thought it was nice Charlotte didn't start off super and crazily in love with Gary but then progressed to like him as time went on; it was more believable that way. And finally, we have Laura who is my favourite girl of the series. Most of her interactions with Gary were really funny, and made me laugh for the only time in the Anime. I think it was great that she was really clueless about most things and called Gary her 'wife'.Enjoyment - 3/10Now before watching I.S, I watched other's people's reviews to this Anime on YouTube. And to say that I wasn't expecting much of anything when I started this Anime would be an understatement. I marathon'd this whole Anime in one day and It wasn't as horrible as I was expecting. Personally, the first half of this anime was cringe worthy at best. Around episode five, I.S had a score of 2/10 on my personal animelist, because the first half was quite bad. But then episode seven came around and it was lunch time and I had a nice cup of Ramen with me, and I don't know if it was the fact it was the first time that I had eaten that day and had food in my stomach, but I was starting to 'enjoy' the show. The second half is so much better than the first half and almost made me forget how horrible it was.While my review may be on the negative side, I am not saying in any that I don’t recommend this Anime. While I would not recommend it to any of my friends who are also girls, I do have guy friends who have recommended I.S to me. It is definitely enjoyable in some way or another, compared to anime’s like Angel Beats! which took me weeks to watch, when I was able to marathon this show in one day.And hey, season two of IS: Infinite Stratos is coming out soon, and will I watch it??? No probably not. a very good job with the Anime because they know their target audience, a demographic that people like me are rarely apart of.Story - 3/10If you've seen this Anime or read the MAL synopsis (which if you haven't, I don't know why you're reading this...) then you already know what the story is about so I'll forgo explaining it again.

Surprisingly unlike most harem anime that I've seen, this anime does not constantly bombard viewers with scenes upon scenes of huge misunderstandings and fan service within every minute or so which i found to be quite relieving as these types of scenes can easily get over repetitive.From listening to the opening and ending theme songs of Infinite Stratos i can...say that it is nothing new. it is what one would expect the theme songs of this kind of anime to actually be. In the same time the artwork is nothing special nor is it anything to complain about.The characters in this anime seem to be better than I originally anticipated this anime would have. For starters there is the childhood friend that have not met for 6 years and are both sharing the same room which seems quite cliche. However, i was originally expecting the main character to be some kind of Tsundere character which is slightly true as she can seem cold at times... There main character does not seem to completely match the stereotypical main character in harems that i've seen as he does not seem complete pervert or a complete good for nothing weakling... in some senses the main character does fit the description of a stereotypical male lead in a harem since he seem in some respects as someone who is lazy or an idiot... however even though i have been defending the last two characters to be not 'completely' stereotypical in every way... sadly in nearly just about nearly every harem anime there has to be a uptight chick that constantly looks down on people who happens to be Tsudere...So far i have enjoyed this anime and I would recommend anyone who wants to start watching a new anime to watch this... So far it seems that there is a large array of possiblities within this anime and even though many will blatantly say that it is just another harem anime, I would somewhat concur with these people from what I have seen in the first episode...

IT\'S A GUNDUMB!That is the best way I can sum up this show in one word. GUNDUMB. This anime is one that revolves around a main character named Ichika who can pilot a mobile suit called an IS, an Infinite Stratos. The twist is... wait for it... ONLY WOMEN CAN PILOT THEM! But for some reason so can this lone high school age boy. Why? Anime logic. So... naturally... this boy begins attending an all girls academy for IS training. I know what you are thinking ""How can a boy go to an all girls school?"" Well... anime logic. Thats how....This anime is lacking in every aspect... except the obscenely ample breasts that most of the characters have. How do these units work? Why can only women pilot them? How are the seemingly random abilities determined? Why does every girl in the school seemingly want to date this incredibly boring, incredibly dense, incredibly bland, incredibly uninteresting and unremarkable boy? These questions and many more are some that will never be answered. Anime logic.Now, I have come down harshly on this anime. You may think I didn\'t enjoy it. You would be wrong. I did like it. Certain aspects of it. Its just that I have experienced exceptional mech animes like Gundam Wing which set the bar for what a mech anime can do with the material. I liked Charles, I liked the dynamic they shared. I liked their bond, I thought that whole thing was rather enjoyable. I liked some of the fights... I liked the oversized boobs... I liked some of the mech designs... I liked the anime style... mostly. The battle scenes were amazing and the natural visuals were some of the best I have seen... but its just that I saw the potential they had and I felt it was wasted.If the main character had only had a character. He was so stupid and clueless that as a man it hurt me watching this at times. Heero Yuy, again for Gundam Wing, while not saying a word was more interesting and dynamic than this guy. Sheesh.Anyway... the anime was alright. Worth a once watch as a time waster. Nothing to write home about and nothing to hate on too much either. Virtus Signum gives this anime a very meh 5/10.

Since its really rare to see a mecha anime with harem, and honestly, i hate mecha anime but when i find Infinite Stratos i thought it was a good choice to start watching a mecha anime and its not really bad for the first mecha anime and honestly i enjoyed a bit....and based on what i see from this anime was the harem aspects is far more dominant than the mecha things.My problem with this anime was the ""Plothole"" and there is no actual strong story, for the plothole, the story was really ""jump-off"" , i have a big expectation for IS to expand the story to be much better for the last episode, but its doesnt happen. its like any harem anime which easy to predictable what happen next. as for next, the MAIN REAL PROBLEM with this anime was ""What this story about? what the purpose of all this scene?"" that words are quite hanging on my mind when i am watching this, since in this anime they didnt have any quite purpose or goals. so, basically is this anime is failed? No, i dont think so, since its quite enjoyable.After all the negative things i have said, lets see the positive side of this anime.+ Its quite original and rare to see a combination within Harem and Mecha. its a good start for the people who hates mecha anime (like me) to give a shot watching a mecha thing.+ As i said, the story was not quite strong but the fillers in this anime (like in the beach scenes ) was far more better than the ""main"" plot.  summary, Fillers> Story+ The battle scenes were epic, the effect and the movements of mecha was really smooth and the details for the mecha itself was really amazing. Its maybe the best parts for this anime.If you hate mecha anime and want to try some light mecha, IS or Infinite stratos its worth to try, but just dont have a big expectation on this anime. and based on what i see from this anime was the harem aspects is far more dominant than the mecha things.My problem with this anime was the ""Plothole"" and there is no actual strong story, for the plothole, the story was really ""jump-off"" , i have a big expectation for IS to expand the story to be much better for the last episode, but its doesnt happen. its like any harem anime which easy to predictable what happen next. as for next, the MAIN REAL PROBLEM with this anime was ""What this story about? what the purpose of all this scene?"" that words are quite hanging on my mind when i am watching this, since in this anime they didnt have any quite purpose or goals. so, basically is this anime is failed?

Possessing technology and combat capabilities far more advanced than any other weapon system, the IS threatens to destabilize the world. Faced with such an overwhelming weapon, the nations of the world enact the ""Alaska Treaty"", which simply says that IS will never be used for military combat and that existing IS technology must be equally spread to all nations, to prevent any one nation from dominating the others. The introduction of the IS does however have a key effect on society. As IS can only...be operated by women, the power balance between men and women is broken, with women coming to dominate society over men. Ten years after the first IS were introduced; the world has entered a new age of peace. That peace is destroyed, however, by an unexpected discovery. A 15 year old Japanese boy, named Ichika Orimura, is found to be able to operate an IS. Realizing his potential, Ichika is forced by the Japanese government to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy, an international academy where IS pilots from all over the world are trained. And so his busy school life surrounded by girls begins.Story and Characters (6/10)Guilty Pleasures. Out of everything that I enjoy, I always return to those series that I find to be guilty pleasures. These series are normally something that isn\'t truly exception, but at the same time are not exactly terrible either. They find a proper balance and appeal to us on a personal level that keeps us coming back for more, despite the fact that they may not be worth a revisit. This is the best way I can describe Infinite Stratos. A pure guilty pleasure and maybe just a little bit more.Infinite Stratos follows the life of Ichika Orimura, a young man who is the first known male that can pilot the legendary mecha-style exo-skeleton, Infinite Stratos (IS). These units, for unknown reasons, only respond to females. So, when Ichika activates one, you can image the shock. He then enrolls in the all girls school of IS academy. It\'s not hard to figure out that this series is going to take the harem route and wastes no time getting the characters established. We are first introduced to Houki Shinonono, childhood friend of Ichika and playing the part of the typical tsundere in the series. We are then introduced to the Cecilia Alcott, who immediately challenges Ichika to a duel to decide who should be class president and falls for him under the philosophy of ""He has bested me so now I automatically admire him for no real reason"". Shortly afterwards, Huang Lingyin, another childhood friend of Ichika, transfers in. This is followed by Charlotte Dunois, who disguises herself as a boy and then immediately drops the disguise for relatively no reason. Lastly we are rounded off with another tsundere, Laura Bodewig. Each character, while fairly stereotypical, is a welcomed addition to the show and brings a certain extra appeal to it.The series itself wastes no time gathering all the cast together and establishing the reasons for why each of the main female characters like Ichika. Hilarity and stereotypical antics ensue, along with two completely pointless filler episodes and a thrown-out-of-left-field serious turn for the ending. While IS maybe stereotypical in many areas, it does more than enough to break the mold. Ichika, while dense, is a likeable character. He generally misunderstands vague hints the girls give that they like him, enough to a level that the audience can understand and not brush it off as him just being a complete dunce. It also helps that he\'s a strong character that cares about his friends, helping to add more depth than what we normally see from most harem series. It also helps that each of the five ladies also have very different personalities and we get to know each of them rather well (or at least in comparison to most harem series), with the exception of Cecilia and Huang, who don\'t get nearly enough development compared to the rest. Aside from that, my only real issue is with Charlotte. They go through great depth to explain why she disguised herself and she forms a bond with Ichika over it. Yet, for some random reason, this is completely dropped in the next episode. So what was the point of even having this scene if the show immediately decides, ""Oh wait, I change my mind. I don\'t want to do this anymore"".One of the biggest issues I have with IS is that it doesn\'t know what it wants to do. The first five episodes do a great job introducing the cast and setting the stage for the final act, but then over half way through we\'re thrown two filler episodes that take place at a beach and an inn for no better reason than they simply do. While there was some plot established and progression was made, these episodes just get thrown in there and really do nothing to forward the series. While not nearly as bad as The Sacred Blacksmith, they also don\'t really help in this twelve episode run of the series. It makes it even more confusing because the series takes a fairly serious turn for the final episodes. While the series has generally had a light-hearted tone, I felt that these filler episodes made it even more of a noticeable change than had they not been introduced. Yet all the same, I enjoyed the short story that was told and wouldn\'t mind seeing more of it.Art (7/10)One of the things that really makes IS a treat is it\'s art. This is a beautiful series, there is no doubt about it. Characters are well animated and fairly far from static. Environments are beautiful and I really loved the studios decision to change the classroom to a more futuristic look instead of the traditional school scene from the manga. However, the true star of the show are the IS battles. These are, hands down, the best part of the show. Beautifully done, they provide plenty of detail and are far from simplistic. My only complaint was that there simply wasn\'t enough of them. However, there were more than enough to truly enjoy.While the art style itself isn\'t revolutionary, nor is it ground breaking, it does the job and it looks darn good doing that job too. This, in my opinion, is extremely exceptional artwork for a TV series.Sound (6/10)Sound is another department that, while well done, truly doesn\'t leave any outstanding impressions. The voice work was very well done, with Koki Uchiyama doing a wonderful job as Ichika Orimura. While not a diverse character, Mr. Uchiyama went above and beyond to give Ichika that extra bit of depth. Yoko Hikasa (Houki) , Yukana (Cecilia), Asami Shimoda (Huang), Kana Hanazawa (Charlotte) and Marina Inoue (Laura) all did a great job as well as the lead female characters, alongside Megumi Toyoguchi (she voiced Ichika\'s older sister Chifuyu, who is a legendary IS pilot and a teacher at the IS academy).Music itself fit each individual scene rather nicely and battle music was well constructed to give a rather epic and emotional feel to it, but honestly I didn\'t really notice the music too much until the final episodes. This is when the series sound design really shined for me. While nothing truly to write home about, it was well done and fitting for the series.Overall (6/10)Infinite Stratos (IS) is fairly stereotypical in many aspects. It also doesn\'t dive that deep into a plot during its twelve episode run. However, what it does do it does rather well. From the animation, to the well casted VAs, to the premises, IS is definitely above average in every aspect. While certainly not an legendary anime, it\'s certainly enough for me to consider it a guilty pleasure and recommend it for those that don\'t mind harem series. Bear in mind that IS flirts more with being mediocre than above average, but it is above average for a harem series.It\'s definitely one of my top ten guilty pleasures, even if it\'s stereotypical in so many manners.

Not to mention it has the most unintentionally hilarious scene I have ever viewed.', ""Infinite Stratos; Infinite Harem. My score is a little biased and 'bumped', due to the fact that I like the girls in his harem. I have no problem sitting here watching Charlotte Dunois doing perfectly nothing.Story: 6Anyhow, as far as the story goes, it's average. It's nothing too original, but it does stray from the customary harems. You have a world where girls have the power to control these mechas, and there's one special male who too is able to control them. ...The harem ensues. There hasn't been a real 'plot', it's your everyday 'school' life, and the comedy/'romance' surrounding. Each few episodes hold...their own little 'story'/'problem'.Art: 9It's definitely the work of a new Anime series; the art is great. Characters are well drawn, and the effects are spot-on too. Animation is smooth, and nothing looks cheesy or choppy. The OP is well done, though deceiving (the opening itself contains more action than the whole series so far), and the girls + Ichika are quite the beauties themselves.Sound: 7I'm not one to stick around to watch an OP or ED (though I may watch it once or twice if I like the song), so I can't make any judgment there. From the few seconds of what I do hear from ED though, it's not bad. I know I've sat through the OP at least once, and the song was good enough for me to not skip it instantly. The soundtrack is typical. Haven't heard anything super outstanding yet, and all the BG music sounds terribly cliche. For once there isn't a single character's voice who annoys me (well, still contemplating on the voice of Houki's sister), and the voices for all the characters seem to be suitable. Effects don't sound lame/incredibly fake, and it works for me.Character: 7There isn't much background stories given on any of the characters. It's all very vague, but I do like them. The characters follow the general harem archetype (tsunderes -- and a lot of them, quiet ones, intelligent ones, etc), but they don't follow it to an extreme; which is a relief. Ichika, the main character, is the lead male in a harem. Need I say more? We've all seen him before, the guy who tries hard and is extremely dense about the loving women around him. He is oblivious (to an extent) of the feelings of those around him, but I sure wish he would start some romance between himself and Charlotte! That being said, the characters remain pretty static, and the changes that do occur aren't really 'developed' -- they're pretty sudden. Regardless of a lack of character development, I've come to love most of them. ^^Enjoyment: 8I've been able to get some laughs here and there, and I'm a sucker for fan service. The women are beautiful, and there's quite a bit of fan service. Am I enjoying it? Hell to the yes. Episode 11, where I'm currently at, brings the humor to an end, and seriousness/drama kicks in. The fights are lame (to an extent), and the mid-battle conversations are expectantly cliche/stupid. Aside from that, IS: Infinite Stratos has maintained it's ability to satisfy my enjoyment levels.Overall: 8I wouldn't say it's a must watch, but I would recommend it if you're into harems and beautiful women.

IS machines are advanced weaponry made by the brilliant Japanese scientist, Houki Shinonono. Ichika finds out within the next few minutes that he is able to operate the IS machine and (so it is stated in the next few episodes from the first) begins to duel an instructor of a training academy which teaches high school students how to use IS weapons... the only problem is that Ichika is the only male in the entire world who can operate an IS -- the rest only respond to females.He finds himself forced into the training...academy, meeting up with many of his old friends and making many new ones...-STORY- (6/10)I give the story a 6/10 rating because, though easily understandable when the pitch was given, it was a bit scattered. The story seemed to be explained backwards -- what I mean by this is that they explained everything like George Lucas would have, they begin to explain and give detail with the story as the anime progresses, making it a bit hard to follow.None the less, I did enjoy the story once I got use to what the hell was going on... but even so, a lot of things were left out.""Where did he meet a few of his old friends?""""Who is this friend, she/he was never properly introduced?""-ART/SOUND- (8/10)I absolutely loved the art and sound of this anime. The character design was a perfect mixture between seriousness and cuteness. It wasn\'t too far to one side, if that makes sense. On top of that, the fight sequences between the IS battles were very smooth, and I could make out what was happening. Very rarely do you see this in some anime. I believe it was because they used some kind of 3D program, so instead of drawing out everything (which might be the cause of reduced FPS), they were able to just simulate it.The sound FX was clear cut, and it didn\'t have a lot of cheesy sound tracks added to it. I think the music was good aswell, though some might dislike the introductory soundtrack, I thought it was very nice. The music they embedded into the video during some battles also either gave the scene a more dramatic, suspensive aura or a more action-packed, ""KILL HIM GODDAMNIT!"" aura.-CHARACTER- (8/10)I\'d say I liked all of the characters, the way all of their personalities clashed with eachother to make a decent harem seemed to be put together quite well.On a personal level, I love how Ichiko seemed different from the average, run of the mill male character in this genre of anime. He doesn\'t make mistakes like tripping over a 1 centemeter wide pebble and land hand first on a big chested woman every episode, or not looking away and removing his hand after him and big-chested-woman-A exchange awkward looks... no, instead he seemed mature and there wasn\'t too much retardation and perversion.As for the rest of the females, I didn\'t give any one of them more attention than the other. They were all equally cared for, and hated by me at different times. In other words, they\'re the typical females in harem that are extremely pressed towards the main character -- though they get mad at him when he gives more attention to other girls.-ENJOYMENT/OVERALL- (9/10)Though the story might have been a bit confusing at times I\'d give enjoyment and overall rating a solid 9/10 because it had me smiling, feeling sad, or having atleast some kind of emotion other than boredom or annoyance which was directed to the anime itself (not the character\'s personalities). Some might say that this was a generic harem (but isn\'t all harem the same? A guy is surrounded by a group of girls that like said guy. That\'s why I watch it... because it\'s harem) or that it was poorly written.... and yeah, it may have been so, but at least it kept me entertained throughout the entire 12 episode series, and actually made me want to write this long review about it. A lot of times I stumble upon anime with great story and great detail, but it never keeps me entertained! But of course, to each his own. That\'s just my view on it. academy, meeting up with many of his old friends and making many new ones...-STORY- (6/10)I give the story a 6/10 rating because, though easily understandable when the pitch was given, it was a bit scattered.

In other words, they\'re the typical females in harem that are extremely pressed towards the main character -- though they get mad at him when he gives more attention to other girls.-ENJOYMENT/OVERALL- (9/10)Though the story might have been a bit confusing at times I\'d give enjoyment and overall rating a solid 9/10 because it had me smiling, feeling sad, or having atleast some kind of emotion other than boredom or annoyance which was directed to the anime itself (not the character\'s personalities). Some might say that this was a generic harem (but isn\'t all harem the same? A guy is surrounded by a group of girls that like said guy. That\'s why I watch it... because it\'s harem) or that it was poorly written.... and yeah, it may have been so, but at least it kept me entertained throughout the entire 12 episode series, and actually made me want to write this long review about it. A lot of times I stumble upon anime with great story and great detail, but it never keeps me entertained! But of course, to each his own. That\'s just my view on it.', 'Story - The idea is good, Female dominant world Female only mechs, and a guy that can use them, which leads to one of the only harems where the guy has a reason to be in a harem, instead of being a regular guy who gets one for no reason. Now if they backed this up semi well the story would have been at least a 7. It is extremely easy to pick apart the story when you focus on it, saying that the world is dominated by females because of these mechs (which let\'s be honest don\'t look like they are really so big...and bad) is a foolish claim when they proceed to say that the powerful ones are in quite a limited supply. Looking at the benefits to these over heavy artillery include maneuverability, shield, portability (you can bring it anywhere you walk.) flight and decent weapons. Now assuming that the entire world didn\'t lose their mind they probably have most of that technology in non mech form to at least the same degree, in fact currently in the real world we have lasers that are quite a bit more powerful than the guns they wield appear to be, so assuming they didn\'t lose their minds they have hover tanks with mounted lasers, leaving that alone, I highly doubt that anywhere in the world would it be accepted to have females so much more overpowered than males, but that can slide. I won\'t go into why only females can use them or why he can as the author really doesn\'t seem to plan to either. Next up is the school where people from around the world, their countries representatives no less, learn to pilot war machines, no, just no, What country do you know of that is willing to train it\'s adversaries how to use weapons that would likely be used in war (against them), or even their sport that they partake in (against them), just no. Also I feel that I\'m misunderstanding something as I have no idea why these barely trained children are ""representatives"" Other than this is a harem so no real story here.Art - About the only redeeming factor here, I rather like the art in this anime, moreso for the backgrounds than the jiggly bits, and definitely not too big a fan on the character art for the most part. The art is skillfully done with vibrant colours and great detail. I\'m a fan of the school uniform but the mechs... not so much, I will give it originality thoughSounds - SFX is meh throughout you don\'t really notice it throughout but most of the characters voices are annoying enough to have your finger on the mute button at all times. Exception Charles, Charles has a wonderful voice actor I\'m actually a Hanazawa Kana fan, and she is the only reason that sound gets above a 1.Character - Here comes the most fatal flaw in this anime, the characters are the most stale unoriginal and annoying characters I\'ve seen in a while.Ichika - He had a good thing going for him with the ""first male IS Pilot"" thing, but then he became the most typical harem character I\'ve ever seen, he is legitimately so typical that it is actually atypical to be as typical as he is. He\'s an idiot completely unaware of everything around him. He is far to easily surprised and should get an afro.Houki - Scratch that comment about Ichika being the most typical harem character Houki beats him by leagues and miles. Not only is she the too shy to say  my feelings but I\'ll act like I own you and get mad because you don\'t notice how I feel psychically (though if he wasn\'t such an idiot he probably would have) childhood friendCecilia - Read Houki except more tsundere and she isn\'t a childhood friend but instead from England.Fang - Read Houki except a Chinese loli this time.Maya - (the other teacher) It\'s been too much of a negative train here so how about something positive Maya is a neat character she\'s fairly moe and a teacher, yes that much is boring, but she\'s not useless, which was a big surprise to me generally moe teachers are completely useless 190% of the time but she can fight well and isn\'t as dumb as she looks, personally one of the only saving graces in the character department.Laura - She has serious problems, she starts of yandere and then just degenerates into a more forward and more shy version of Houki/Cecilia/Fang, admittedly at a speed I\'ve never seen before. her background seemed interesting for like 10 minutes but don\'t worry it gets completely discarded after a harem joke or two, luckily she has an eyepatch so you can tell the difference between her and the other three.Chifuyu - She\'s one of those people who thinks that love can only be showed through being a complete bitch 24/7 Apparently really powerful but she decided to retire because her career and the safety of her brother were colliding or something she is so far the oldest person in the anime at 24.Char - I lol\'d hard at her new nickname. She is the only real reason to watch this show, she is adorable and nice, she realizes that Ichika is an idiot and uses it to her advantage to get closer to him.Enjoyment - Not present, the only enjoyable time is when Char is on otherwise it\'s useless. Neat note: Ichika will most certainly end up with Houki, that\'s not a spoiler after watching this for two seconds you can come to that conclusion which is upsetting because Char deserves to win, however if he ends up with anyone else it will be effectively the same as an M Night Shyamalan movie and will actually be worse, what a twist.Overall - Don\'t watch this, just find the Charlotte parts on youtube or something that\'s all you really need. and bad) is a foolish claim when they proceed to say that the powerful ones are in quite a limited supply.

What a Lucky Guy!!Story 8/10Well the story is all about mechas and some family and childhood friend issues as well as fighting.

The Story is unique and it really...follows the genre.Art 9/10The IS are awesome well design the fights did really fit the styles of this anime. The Art really fits the story. The Character really put a good fight between his enemies. The quality of the anime is great and well constructed.Sound 9/10The voice actors really fit in every character they play.

They really put the great effort to it.Character 9/10The MC is not very strong just moderate,that MC needs to be train. The character is innocent and very funny for me.

Don't worry this anime has season 2 or more.Thats all people this is my Infinity Stratos review"", ""Infinite Stratos is a show that had a great setup but cant quite deliver where it has too because of a few problems. The main character Ichika Orimura is the only male in the world who can pilot an IS and because of this he is sent to a school where people learn to use them and due to the fact that he is the only guy there all the girls instantly love him, not exactly great but I can deal with it. and he has to learn how to pilot an IS with help from 5 girls who all are head over heels in...love with him but he cant seem to catch a hint.Story-6The Story revolves around unmanned IS attacking and they have to combat them, now this is where Ichika comes in because his attacks can go through shield and actually damage the IS which works as a great setup for why he should be the hero (since he is focused as the hero) but this fails because literally every time he is about to win any fight it gets interrupted or his shields run out which makes him look weak thats why I gave the story such a low score that and the fact that there really are no antagonist until the second season so there really is no place for a story unmanned IS can only go so far.Art-7The art in Infinite Stratos is good but there are notable changes when they get in the IS but overall the show looks nice.Sound-7The opening and outro songs fit the show very well but aside from them there's nothing really special about the music but it's still good(The outro is actually a really good song).Characters-10Now this is where Infinite Stratos real advantages shine the characters i this show are great but im not just talking about the main characters im talking about all of them even the characters who make appearances every 2-3 episodes for just a few moments are wonderful and add so much light to this show. The main 5 girls are very strong as well.Houki Shinonono who is his childhood friend and the first of his harem we are introduced to she also shares a room with ichika for a short while.Cecilia Alcott is the second addition to his harem and is the IS representative from England.Lingyin Huang who is actually ichikas second childhood friend and the 3rd member to join his harem she is the IS representative from china and is the only of the 5 to not be in his class.Charlotte Dunois is the 4th character added to his harem and is the IS representative from France she also shared a room with Ichika for a short time while everyone thought she was a boy.Laura Bodewig is the IS representative of Germany the fifth person added to his harem and a former student of Chifuyu Orimura.Other then them  Chifuyu Orimura who is Ichikas sister and arguably the best IS pilot in the world and too top it off their teacher, Maya Yamada who is the assistant teacher for Ichika a friends, and Tabane Shinonono who is the creator of the IS and is Houkis sister. All of these characters and the one that I didint mention make this show great to watch.Though Ichikas inability to catch a hint seems to leave many frustrated but I dont mind much and makes for some great momentsEnjoyment-8The character cast make this show fun to watch every second just because they are enjoyable and no matter who is on the screen you wont mind, plus Ichikas incredible hard headiness at certain scenes makes for some enjoyable times albeit you may find yourself yelling at the screen for him to catch a hint.Overall-6This show is fun to watch but they do miss some pretty important parts like the story and Ichikas inability to look strong since all of his fights are interrupted or he runs out of shields because he dosent realize how much he uses, the opening and outro are good and fit the show like they were made for it but the fact that 4 of the 5 main females are representative candidates from their selected country's they seem to weak I get that their young and all but still Ichika almost beats them very earlier and it makes their titles seem almost meaningless. Ill be honest I actually love this show it seems to hit all the notes i personally want from a show but I didint want my personal feelings to affect my scoring but to me it's an 8 or even 9 outta 10 but like I said thats just cause I love the show so much.If you like Harem based shows then id say it's a must watch if you like mech shows you could do worse and there's a nice amount of comedy in here to find every episode entertaining not to mention fanservice including 2-3 instances of nudity but its done in a classy sort of way or better yet as classy as it can be without seeming out of place but it is a show that id recommend seeing at least once. love with him but he cant seem to catch a hint.Story-6The Story revolves around unmanned IS attacking and they have to combat them, now this is where Ichika comes in because his attacks can go through shield and actually damage the IS which works as a great setup for why he should be the hero (since he is focused as the hero) but this fails because literally every time he is about to win any fight it gets interrupted or his shields run out which makes him look weak thats why I gave the story such a low score that and the fact that there really are no antagonist until the second season so there really is no place for a story unmanned IS can only go so far.Art-7The art in Infinite Stratos is good but there are notable changes when they get in the IS but overall the show looks nice.Sound-7The opening and outro songs fit the show very well but aside from them there's nothing really special about the music but it's still good(The outro is actually a really good song).Characters-10Now this is where Infinite Stratos real advantages shine the characters i this show are great but im not just talking about the main characters im talking about all of them even the characters who make appearances every 2-3 episodes for just a few moments are wonderful and add so much light to this show.

I would like to say that was just the beginning of the anime but it was the entire 12 episodes this was probably one of the worst animes I have watched in a LONG while. ', 'I usually don\'t review anime, unless I feel like I could really change someone\'s decision to watch the show. This is one of those cases, but not how you may think.Story:Infinite Stratos has an all around weak story, why? Because there really isn\'t much of one. Its a pretty run of the mill mecha/harem show. I\'m ok with both of those but I prefer a bit more substance. Here\'s a short story synopsis: ""Guy who can fly mechs for girls goes to all girls mech school, hilarity, action, and ecchi insue.""The story really doesn\'t explain much about the events that are not part of the...romance/harem plot and leaves a lot to be desired. simple explanation would have at least made the story average.3/10Art:The action scenes are really good, the animation is slick and the art direction is really good all around. And for the people who mainly would watch this for the harem and ecchi aspects, its good as well.8/10Sound:The sound is pretty average, the music is really nothing special, its not bad its just average. I watched the dub, because the accents are apparently hilarious, they are in a sort of endearing way, and overall the characters without accents are really well voiced and there really aren\'t any characters that stand out as downright bad.6/10Characters:I won\'t spoil the romance or the characters stories here, but overall I think the characters are good. The lead is annoying and overreacts at times but when he\'s fired up he becomes an all around good guy. Each girl also has a sort of backstory or previous relationship with the lead. All of these are underdeveloped and relegated to a single scene each. Other than that, each character develops at least a little bit by the end, and honestly there\'s nothing bad about the characters in my opinion. They are all just good but a bit stereotypical characters.6/10Enjoyment:Now, if it wasn\'t for the story and some poor choices regarding the characters this show could have been great. I saw that from the beginning, and I can say that I genuinely enjoyed the show as a mindless sort of show to just watch in my down time. Overall, I\'d say to watch the first few episodes and see if you can get into it, I did and enjoyed it, but its not for everyone.7/10Overall:Give it a try, it could surprise you.6.5/10 romance/harem plot and leaves a lot to be desired. simple explanation would have at least made the story average.3/10Art:The action scenes are really good, the animation is slick and the art direction is really good all around.

The anime I love but really, really, don\'t ever tell anyone about. Well. Unless they\'re already anime fans. Then I\'ll talk to them about it.

Not to mention, how often do you actually see characterized males in harem anime? Especially during the harem assembly phase.Despite the standard setup IS rose above it\'s material, making the old archetypes shine as fun and enjoyable characters, and the story\'s set up is a bit hackneyed, but looks great with it\'s refurbishment and fresh coat of paint.So if you\'re looking for something to compliment your reading of Anna Karenina that will let you switch to something complex and interesting but not so depressingly Russian you\'re barking up the wrong tree.

Same background: women are the only ones able to control mechas and, with just one man among them, feelings never shown before suddenly appear... Main difference is that Vandread occurs on space and IS, on Earth... Other thing was that Vandread had an incredible climax, based on a real enemy...One single man, surrounded by tons of girls... And just like on any other harem anime, the main character is just stupid enough to not realize the way others feel towards him... Well, this is what makes this kind of anime...funny... Plot may not hook you, but all those amazing mechas, with cool transformations and weapons, starring exciting and ultra quick battles, were enough to keep my attention...Seeing how Ichika is dumb and unable to return all the affection he receives from the other girls is the main attraction in here... Since there are no wars and ISs are made only for competitions, you can't expect an intense plot or epic battles against terribly evil and powerful foes... I noticed that a second season is ongoing right now, so who knows? Is there something really big coming up?We can also get an obvious cliche after Laura's appearance. All that stuff that Germany is mean and buys fight with others... This is demonstrated through provocations made by Laura to both Cecilia and Rin, these two representing the alliance between England and China during WWI... It's not like what happened in that time wasn't horrible, but this is 21th century... There's no reason keep arguing over that kind of thing anymore...Episode 8 has a totally unpredictable ending, surprised me completelly... Congrats on that! The real ending was a little disappointing... That forgiven since there's a sequel, so it couldn't end here as well... Animation was the main focus: battles are fast and explosive, transformations are incredible and those mechas (that look more like compact armoured suits) are unique, pretty original and well designed!This is an anime for chilling out and get some good laughing, no masterpiece... It's focused more on comedy than drama. Still, I've enjoyed it a lot and this is a nice recommendation for those who just want to have fun... funny...

IS is a story about the luckiest boy in the world. It\'s a guy, Ichika, who lands in a school of mecha-wielding girls who have raging hormones. It has it\'s funny times and the action isn\'t half bad. Plus, a few characters can provide a really good laugh in awkward situations.That\'s about all I could say though.Infinite Stratos wasn\'t the right name for this series. There were two better that I was thinking of:Infinite TsundereInfinite Fanservice...Allow me to go into detail.Infinite Tsundere:Every supporting girl\'s personality takes a dip in all parts of tsundere personality. One girl even goes from Tsuntsun to deredere in the span of two episodes. One goes the opposite direction in the same span. However, no one diverges from it. It\'s just a bunch of tsunderes piloting mechas and competing with each other for the love of a guy so clueless that he makes Kamijou Touma look like a genius.And I do mean clueless. Everyone else can immediately note what\'s going on except him. I\'m usually not one to mind the clueless main character role. At times, you could call me a fan of it actually. Ichika pushes boundaries though. Especially considering how every girl goes out of their way to accommodate him. But I\'ll get to that later.Infinite Fanservice:The fanservice essentially serves as the plot. If you want to see some compelling story, you won\'t. I mean that. There\'s not a moment where you can pick up on a plot until the very last episode.But there\'s plenty of shower scenes that border on the erotic while thinking about the main character. There\'s also plenty of boob-grabbing, boob-rubbing, partial nudity, ""accidental"" nudity, body-on-body and just all-around general flirting. Remember, this is a guy that has been thrust into an all-girl school. The girls all act like they\'ve never seen a boy before. I mean, almost every single one. Heck, even a teacher. I\'m fairly surprised that he hasn\'t been violated while he slept. Oh wait . . .--------But in the end, the problem with this series doesn\'t lie with the lack of plot, abundance of fanservice or the tsundere club.It lies with the main character.The world is centered around him.No really. This guy, through pure luck, lands into an all-girl school, immediately making him popular. He lucks out to grab the class with his sister, a renown pilot, teaching it, thus making him even more popular. He sees a friend who he hasn\'t seen in 6 years and she remembers everything about him and becomes the first member of his harem by default. He gets his own personal IS for ""data"" purposes and somehow, despite being weaker than everyone, he\'s constantly the key to winning.Then there\'s the fact that every single girl he knows is in love with him in some way. Of course, that\'s how harems work. But with Ichika, you just won\'t get it. He does nothing of importance or style to earn the harem. It just kinda . . . happens. And that alone is what drives the series. Girls are unreasonably drawn to him. That\'s your plot.Oh and danger is drawn to him as well. Though, there\'s a reason for that. To be honest, it\'s a bit underwhelming, though.Oh and the characters don\'t have a set personality or power level at all through this series. They will flip so hard, you forget who they are.The series has too much convenience and not enough plot to be considered something close to a masterpiece. But it is still good fun for the most part. Allow me to go into detail.Infinite Tsundere:Every supporting girl\'s personality takes a dip in all parts of tsundere personality. One girl even goes from Tsuntsun to deredere in the span of two episodes. One goes the opposite direction in the same span. However, no one diverges from it. It\'s just a bunch of tsunderes piloting mechas and competing with each other for the love of a guy so clueless that he makes Kamijou Touma look like a genius.And I do mean clueless. Everyone else can immediately note what\'s going on except him. I\'m usually not one to mind the clueless main character role. At times, you could call me a fan of it actually. Ichika pushes boundaries though. Especially considering how every girl goes out of their way to accommodate him. But I\'ll get to that later.Infinite Fanservice:The fanservice essentially serves as the plot. If you want to see some compelling story, you won\'t. I mean that. There\'s not a moment where you can pick up on a plot until the very last episode.But there\'s plenty of shower scenes that border on the erotic while thinking about the main character.

But to me, I thought it went well overall for the entire season.  Going into this, I had no idea what to expect since I only had a picture and the tags to go on and decided not to read the synopsis.  I feel like I should start doing that more often but anywho I liked this anime overall.Ecchiness.  Yup thats right, it has some of it in here.  I was glad to see the ecchiness to be...true since getting ecchi into a mecha anime is a bit hard but they pulled it off beautifully.  Only down side is the censorship...YET AGAIN!  I am not a big fan of censorship so of course I am going to watch this anime again once the uncensored version comes out.Though it is hard to tell, I can see some romance inside some of this anime.  But mainly it is a Harem.  Why is that? 1 guy, bunch of girls, that is why.  Romance side would be some of the stuff in the anime that make up something kind of like a date.  So there is some romance in it.If you have not noticed yet but this is a mecha anime.  I will let that soak in real quick..........Ok, if you hate mechas, you might not like this.  There are terms in here that could drive people crazy and seeing battles and stuff . . . not your thing, don't watch.  Mechas are my thing so I would reccommend this to anyone who does like mechas.  But if you do not like Harems, then yea, don't watch.  If you are a guy and you don't like harems then I will question your manhood just a tad.Overall I think this is a pretty good anime.  It holds up pretty well, has a story and ties in things well.  Censorship is a killer mainly because I hate censorship and it makes me angry for some reason.  If you hate censorship too then I would suggest waiting until the uncensored version comes fully out and watch it then. true since getting ecchi into a mecha anime is a bit hard but they pulled it off beautifully.

Backgrounds were detailed and characters were animated well. Even the extras were all physically different in some way. The battle scenes, even though there weren\'t many, were really smooth and exciting to watch.Characters (6/10)This category is where the anime suffers. First, you have the dense male harem lead, Orimura Ichika. At first glance, he looks like a regular teenage guy who gets the opportunity to enroll in an all-girls school. Many guys out there would give up everything just to be in his situation. However, because he is the typical, dense male harem lead, he is oblivious to...the feelings of the all the girls around him. This happens throughout the whole series so it is frustrating to watch sometimes. Understandably, since he is the only male, all the female characters want to befriend him. The main females come from different countries of the world so there\'s a bit of diversity in the characters. However, they all possess at least one of the typical harem traits (childhood friend, tsundere, ojou-sama, sadistic etc). With that being said, the characters\' interactions were not special. I guess with IS being a harem anime, I should not have expected character development. I didn\'t really have a ""favourite"" character because there wasn\'t a character that was interesting.tl;dr - Don\'t watch IS and expect the characters to be great.Sound (8/10)The OP and ED were very good. I found it nice that the seiyuu voicing the main female characters sang the ED. Both songs were upbeat and fit the general mood of the series. The BGM wasn\'t really memorable but it was not out of place.Story (6/10)It\'s hard to say that IS actually had a ""story"". A third of the episode was used just to introduce characters. The rest of the episodes (excluding 11 and 12) were mostly about the girls interacting (is that even the right word?) with Ichika. Episodes 11 and 12 wrapped up the so-called ""story"" with a battle scene. If I were to condense the story into a few points, here is what it would look like:- Teenage boy discovers he is the only male capable of piloting an IS- Main female characters are introduced- Male lead interacts with females- Final battleAs you can see, there aren\'t a lot of points. However, I understand that a harem anime is not watched for its story so I guess there\'s no helping it.Overall (7/10)Infinite Stratos met my expectations in general. I wouldn\'t mind having a second season sometime in the near future.

Where to start, hmm lets see, oh I know! All the girls, now i can understand the writters making the characters mostly girls and I've enjoyed anime like that, but IS takes it, everyone in it was a girl except for the main character, not only that but everyone in it was in love with him. Then the story seemed way too rushed, every episode would be...like 3 mashed together, towards the end so much is thrown in it makes it hard to even try to like it. The story is also soo predictable, as are the characters, they could've at least added some twists to the plot. I do have a few good things to say though since i hate being one of those all-animes-suck-these-days reviewer. The art really is good, the characters definately have more detail to them then in other animes. Finally i think IS tried have everything and failed at it, they changed up the location, tried to show growth as characters, and tried to have two fall in love (which nobody could really tell because they failed miserably at showing any progression in any relationship between any characters, they just kept adding more), it was one where everything was there, it was just unbalanced, an poorly thought out, but I will say thanks for trying, it's all anyone can really ask for. If you watch it you'll notice that they could've done soo much more with the characters than what they did which would've made IS pretty good, and thats what disappoints me, when so much potential was wasted.In case you're wondering, the plot is about mech suits tbat only females can operate but a guy finds out he can use one so now every girl at the IS training academy is in love with him, the rest is pretty much pridictable sorry to say. like 3 mashed together, towards the end so much is thrown in it makes it hard to even try to like it.

I\'m also going to say up front, this review will contain SPOILERS.Story:8: The story didn\'t bore me at all, or in other words, I wasn\'t dissatisfied with watching any of the episodes. The plot development wasn\'t very extensive but was played out very well. Although in...the beginning it seemed as if the harem theme was rushed at you a little too quickly, it smoothed out to a good pace for the rest of the episodes. When episodes were mainly focused on the development of the relationships between Ichika and the other main girls,the anime didn\'t stray far from the main goal and story plot. Looking back at the anime now, one can say that it is mainly based on ecchi and relationships, and the animators just added mechas that contributed to this factor, but one can also say that the way the anime went about incorporating this factor is very nice. What impressed me the most was when a typical scene appeared,too cliche in other words, but the resolution of the matter was taken in a different way I haven\'t seen before; that\'s something that stood out for me. I won\'t say that there were typical outcomes, that a dog could guess what was going to happen, I mean come on guys, it IS a harem based anime. But Infinite Stratos was a definite change in pace, now that I look at my recent, I\'ve watched too many of these similarly themed anime in row, but IS didn\'t fail to disappoint and follow in their shadow.Art7 and Sound10: The Art for a 2011 anime could have been done better, I\'ll say that the animations for combat and the equipping of the ISs could have been greatly improved on. The sound was IMO the same as all the anime I have watched so far, it complimented very well with the scenes that were presented.Characters 8: My favorite has to be the main character Ichika who\'s blind ignorance to the desperate girls around him, just put a smile on my face the whole time. His misunderstanding at their attempts were laughable (in a good way) and his personality was something different that I haven\'t seen yet in a good harem anime. Now for the other main characters, the girls. I won\'t describe them all but the way each one was introduced was unique in their own way, and I loved every bit of the plot twists that occurred around each one (in regards for their relationship progression with Ichika).Enjoyment and Overall (8&8): I didn\'t cheer with joy for this series, nor did I end it with a feeling of ""why did I watch this?"". I think I was completely satisfied because of the mediocre anime that came before this one on my watch list. I went into this anime, not expecting much, but left the first episode with a grin on my face. The harem aspect was done well IMO, comparable to Date a Live. The ecchi aspect...Well you don\'t really see much but it compliments the series when you do. I\'ll have to say it isn\'t shoved in your face for complete fan-service/ otaku fap time, but tastefully implemented with a clever cooperation. Overall this anime was Very good and is one of the few on my list so far that has passed the line of the overall score of 7.

'Cuz all the show is really about is every girl getting one guy.I thought 'Hey, a program about people using Mecha robot things and fighting in tournaments sounds pretty cool' So I started watching this anime thinking that I would enjoy it, honestly in some areas I did, and admittedly some areas even made me laugh. However...most the show was just all about girls loving a darn boy that's so stupid to not even realize anything.I gave this a overall 6 as the art style is very nice and how they did the fighting and the Mecha suits actually looked nice, the sound was decent and I did enjoy some areas of the anime. As for the story it was well thought of with the IS suits and the academy, however the story about the Harem areas where too overpowering for the anime and it wasn't at all decent in my opinion. Heck, even the character development was poor because of all the 'I have to love this one guy that's the only guy in my class' scenario.Sorry for pretty much all the hate, but this show could have been so much better if it stuck to it's original concept of the IS suits and that's it. Please no haters - this is MY opinion, Thank you.~ Canaan most the show was just all about girls loving a darn boy that's so stupid to not even realize anything.I gave this a overall 6 as the art style is very nice and how they did the fighting and the Mecha suits actually looked nice, the sound was decent and I did enjoy some areas of the anime.

Being a qualified IS operator, he enrolled to an IS school that has a population predominated by females  (actually I don\'t remember any other male character in that school). Being the only male student, naturally all the...girls are quite interested in him and so the harem begun. The series separates into different arcs, each focusing on a female character being introduced as transfer students from a different country, her back story examined and will have their own moments with the male lead. The series spends a good 2/3 of its episodes introducing the harem cast, but at the same time the series manage to introduce bits of elements to move the story forward. The finale is a bit of let down with its inconclusiveness, which may be a good thing for the viewers screaming for a season 2!The animation has more good than bad points. The environment is detailed enough, the characters are very cute and well designed as they are able to expressed their emotions very well,  more importantly the cast doesn\'t look generic, each are unique looking and easily recognizable. The mecha designs for the IS exoskeletons are also quite good and unique for every individuals. The visuals for the action scene is also well rendered. As for my minor complaints, there are times that the animation looks inconsistent with the characters looking awkward and scenes that is generally done of poor production quality. Also very noticeable is the inconsistency of the designs with many visuals just keeps on appearing and disappearing with each transition of scenes which sometimes could be annoying and sometimes amusing that it is laughable.The series is well covered by its different background music, I felt that the music played in any given scene is just about right and appropriate for the mood it is trying to convey. The OP and ED themes along with its accompanying animation sequence is good enough and feels appropriate for the series.IS has a fairly good cast of characters. As a harem series, the male lead does a good job and doesn\'t look annoying on how he is clueless to the feelings of all the lovestruck girls around him. The girls albeit stereotypes that is designed to appeal to its audience, each feels unique and has a personality that is quite different from each other. Each characters has a role to play and was their own moments as the series moves along. Voice acting is very good, the VA has done a fairly good job in portraying their respective characters, I enjoyed listening to everyone as they chat with each other.If I\'m going to summarize what I felt about this series, it will be ""Infinite Stratos is a harem series done right."" Despite having inconsistencies in both the plot and animation and a finale that lacks any real ending (season 2 please!), this is a series that I enjoyed all throughout, never a dull moment here.

The IS academy trains students in the use of Infinite Stratos, which are mechanized power armor suits capable of flight and extreme combat conditions that voided conventional weapons when they were introduced. One catch though...Only women could pilot them.Infinite Stratos is pretty much a straight comedy with a bit of drama mixed in. The antics surrounding being the only guy in an all-girl combat school is ripe with awkward moments and hilariously bad (read: so bad its great) humor. His complex...relationship with basically the entire student body (remember, they\'re all girls who\'re interested in the only guy to pilot an IS) can be a bit much sometimes, but there are at least a few moments of GOLD mixed into the seriesOf course most of the hilarious moments (and the creepy ones) belong with the main cast. Most of the conflict in the series is between the main cast over who gets Ichika. The main cast includes Houki (Ichika\'s old childhood friend), Cecilia (a British noblewoman going to the academy), Huang ""Rin"" (another childhood friend), Laura Bodewig (a strange student from Germany), and... Charles (it makes sense in context). The characters are pretty well developed for the short time we\'ve gotten to see them on screen. Among the cast are some genuinely nice characters, others are just a bit weird.This show has absolutely no shame about its plot or themes. It goes full-speed into the crazy and awkward with no regard for being ""normal"". From the copious amounts of fanservice, to the very-nearly-an-excuse-plot plot, to the ridiculous (and many times very violent) romantic subplots, this series never misses a chance to go over the top somehow.I also found that it was voice acted quite well (I only have a tenuous grasp on Japanese, but what I did hear was quite good). The majority of the cast have their characters and their quirks down well. The inflections were frequently spot on and nothing ever seems too overacted. Still, when the cast is required to be crazy, they certainly deliver.I\'ve gotta say though, sometimes you\'ve got to wonder if this show is going anywhere in particular. I realize that the plot isn\'t exactly a selling point but come on, is there anything else here? For nearly 14 episodes now (I\'ve seen the first two for season two) the question of why Ichika can use an IS hasn\'t really even been mentioned. I\'m hoping that season two starts picking up the slack on this one.Another painful one, there are so many awkward moments in this series. It just gets overwhelming. At least every other episode has one such moment played for laughs on Ichika (and is usually followed up by a girl kicking his ass, usually hilarious). This is fine for the episode-a-day crowd, but I was marathon\'ing this thing. relationship with basically the entire student body (remember, they\'re all girls who\'re interested in the only guy to pilot an IS) can be a bit much sometimes, but there are at least a few moments of GOLD mixed into the seriesOf course most of the hilarious moments (and the creepy ones) belong with the main cast.

This is literally the entire plot of the anime. The main character gets thrown slices or arcs of each female character(cause its a harem if you didn\'t notice yet) and is forced to deal with their hots for his tots.So the story doesn\'t hold up much but what about everything else?Art and Sound is fine, I mean what isn\'t these days, characters are kind of dull, main male character is obtuse, other characters are pretty stereotypical, and have the hick for his masculinity(dirty mind you got there).The last thing I want to get at before you leave is that there is a sense of racism in Infinite Stratos which is unsettling and distasteful. Like I pointed earlier, no other minorities but White and Asian exist in the future, as in even the background characters are all White or Asian and other minorities have no place in a UNIVERSAL school.

Well if your one of those people, it'd be best to stand clear, for this anime is not your type. Part of the anime industry are stuck on creating anime with an unclear plot, a plot that doesn't make sense, pointless harems, and too much fan service. But at the same time all of this entertains some people. There are some viewers who do like ecchi and harems, and that's okay, that's your personal preference. I wouldn't call IS a fail but a disappointment because it...did have some potential in it but no cigar. I decided to compare it to the anime Freezing and noticed they were aired almost exactly the same time, so it's possible they were competing with each other.To start it off, IS didn't really have a story to it, which was a major mistake. What the creators need to understand is that every anime needs a story. Its like building a house without a foundation. Without a story, the anime almost isn't going to be favored. Now there are some houses that are standing strong without a foundation, and there are also some anime that are still entertaining without a clear plot.The art in IS for the characters were good, but for the mecha part, the IS's they were piloting weren't well thought of. There were parts of it that was just floating...in the air. Nothing were attached to them or anything. They didn't really put much thought into the mecha part but mostly into the harem. The backgrounds on the other hand were pretty sweet though.The sound was alright, the opening and closing themes were pretty good, not bad at all. There were probably one or two songs they played during the action scenes that were just straight up horrible, but music choice shouldn't really affect how much you enjoy an anime.The characters weren't bad, but many people can't really like them if a harem is going on and there's not enough time for character development.But with only 12 episodes, a harem going on along with fan service there's not enough time to allow character development I guess. *scratches head*I have the enjoyment category a 9 because despite all the fan service, the harem, the absence of a plot (and I for one strongly prefer anime with good plots), I actually did enjoy IS. It was rather funny in my opinion, and I hope some of you do actually give it a try.IS wasn't all that bad. If they were truly competing against Freezing, then I can see where the creators were trying to get at but the didn't do such a great job, the anime could have possibly been rushed.Overall if you don't mind harems and fan service, try this one out.

I decided to write a review on the anime to enlighten others who haven't seen this anime.1 Boy. A gazillion girls. nuff said.... when I read the summary for Infinite Stratos i was Psyched. Note the capital P. It had the making of a great anime and a funny one to boot. I started watching and here my ratings for the anime Infinite Stratos:Story : 7I gave the anime an 7 due to the fact that I I honestly liked the whole comedy aspect of Orimura Ichika's...life. Each girl was introduced in a unique way, and each had their own appeal to boot. I felt guilty giving the anime's story a 7 due to the fact that I read the light novels and in all honesty they were some of the best I've read. If you don't mind spoiling the next season go ahead and read them as they are great.Art : 9All of the characters were well drawn and implemented. The IS's were awesome, the fight scenes were great and had a certain *cough* appeal to them when the girls were in them!Sound : 8The opening and ending of the anime were great. I still listen to them occasionally. The OST's were memorable and enjoyable. The only thing that didn't make the cut were the fight noises. It was Really annoying hearing the creak of the IS randomly when it moved. It sounded to surreal in my opinion.Character: 10As the only boy in the world able to use the IS robot's, Ichika has a great personality. He's not a shy main character who has to have his harem take care of him, nor is he to powerful to be thankful for their help. He's an all around great main character for the anime. Sadly I couldn't find myself relating to him. I mean come on, why can't my cute child hood friends have crushes on me huh?All of the girls have their own personality which adds a twist to the anime's comedy aspect. Houki and Cecilia are tsundere while Charlotte is a normal vanilla. Laura seems kind of yandere and lingyin is VERY protective of him. They make for a great crew and can't wait for them to add the two new girls next fall.Enjoyment and Overall: 8I found myself flinching at the more humiliating parts like when Ichika would be caught doing something at the wrong moment by one of the girls. All in all it was a good anime to watch and it deserves a second season.-Steller, Out life. Each girl was introduced in a unique way, and each had their own appeal to boot.

Even if I have watched some animes which had harem, none of them surprised me like this one (in a positive way).Why? It has those nice surprise moments when it left me several times with an open mouth.The story is good for such an anime. I enjoyed the different characters, each with a different personality. Even if it doesn't say that it's ecchi, the anime does give some fanservice.So if you're an harem/action type, it's worth to watch it. "", 'THE STORY: 5If you are wanting a show where plot continues, and characters develop , you aren\'t going to get it with Infinite Stratos. The plot is very simple. There was a mecha suit designed by a ""mad scientist"", Tabane Shinonono, and only women could pilot it, men could not. Until, Ichika Orimura, gets the ability to pilot one, thus he is sent to an all girls academy. A few more characters are introduced in season two, but they don\'t really do much but mention plot. Sure, Ichika has a sister, another sister, somebody tries to kill him, do we get explanation to that at...all? Nope. As you watch on you will see this as it goes, a bunch of story arcs get introduced, but then they just vanish. This is why things like FanFiction and doujshinshi come in. There are so many failed plotlines in this show that I\'m sure fourty percent of the people watching I.S don\'t like it, and feel like its shit because of its story, then the other ten percent watch it just for echii, and the rest watch it because they like it. I\'ve talked with so many people over on fanfiction, and what I get alot: I.S is great! I like to expand my own story upon it since it doesn\'t have such a big one to begin with! Do you see where I am going with the story? The very fact that its loathing in development, is all the more merrier for fans to expand upon it.THE ART:7I really do enjoy the art when it comes to the Infinite Stratos. For me, it kind of seems like a mix between Power Armor and Stormtrooper gear. I think the I.S looks cool, but thats my own opinion. As far as the animation goes, again, I love it. The fights are action packed, they deliver what you\'d expect from 8bit studios.THE SOUND(MUSIC): 10I will say I love the music. The instrumentals for the moments of romance, to the music and openings, you won\'t be disappointed. In fact, I highly recommend you head over to a place like Sound Cloud and listen to one of the piano tracks, or opening theme. It reminds me of Angel Beats.CHARACTERS: 6Going back to what I said about the story, the characters, they aren\'t as cliché as you may think, but some progress a lot more then others, but they shouldn\'t considering others get introduced earlier, and it basically just goes all over the place. One of the main characters or heroine, Houki, basically changed herself completely through another season! Overall, the characters are enjoyable, but I don\'t see becoming attached to one, unlike lots of others. The characters are where comedy comes in, heavy-set.ENJOYMENT: 9I really enjoyed this anime. It had great music, opening soundtracks I downloaded as many of my friends did, and the characters were laughable and it had all the...Echhi too. If you enjoy a series of plots that don\'t lead anywhere, but you like to create and expand your own, you will enjoy this even more then just the romantic comedy.OVERALL: 9I like this anime. It has a great setting, but it leads to so many different places, but then it stops. Thats the biggest problem! Considering FanFiction.net and Archive of Our Own still seek to keep the fanbase for this work alive, the more serious works there are way better when it comes to story. I highly suggest giving this show a watch, but as I mentioned above if you are looking to get into an anime as to where you LOVE the characters, sort of like watching Clannad, or Akame Ga Kill(two series in which the fans are intended to get emotionally attached), I don\'t suggest you watch it. This anime is great when you want to wind down, and watch a funny, romantic comedy. Or if you want to expand your own ideas, this show certainly has the setting to start you off. all? Nope. As you watch on you will see this as it goes, a bunch of story arcs get introduced, but then they just vanish. This is why things like FanFiction and doujshinshi come in. There are so many failed plotlines in this show that I\'m sure fourty percent of the people watching I.S don\'t like it, and feel like its shit because of its story, then the other ten percent watch it just for echii, and the rest watch it because they like it. I\'ve talked with so many people over on fanfiction, and what I get alot: I.S is great! I like to expand my own story upon it since it doesn\'t have such a big one to begin with! Do you see where I am going with the story? The very fact that its loathing in development, is all the more merrier for fans to expand upon it.THE ART:7I really do enjoy the art when it comes to the Infinite Stratos. For me, it kind of seems like a mix between Power Armor and Stormtrooper gear. I think the I.S looks cool, but thats my own opinion. As far as the animation goes, again, I love it. The fights are action packed, they deliver what you\'d expect from 8bit studios.THE SOUND(MUSIC): 10I will say I love the music. The instrumentals for the moments of romance, to the music and openings, you won\'t be disappointed. In fact, I highly recommend you head over to a place like Sound Cloud and listen to one of the piano tracks, or opening theme. It reminds me of Angel Beats.CHARACTERS: 6Going back to what I said about the story, the characters, they aren\'t as cliché as you may think, but some progress a lot more then others, but they shouldn\'t considering others get introduced earlier, and it basically just goes all over the place. One of the main characters or heroine, Houki, basically changed herself completely through another season! Overall, the characters are enjoyable, but I don\'t see becoming attached to one, unlike lots of others. The characters are where comedy comes in, heavy-set.ENJOYMENT: 9I really enjoyed this anime. It had great music, opening soundtracks I downloaded as many of my friends did, and the characters were laughable and it had all the...Echhi too. If you enjoy a series of plots that don\'t lead anywhere, but you like to create and expand your own, you will enjoy this even more then just the romantic comedy.OVERALL: 9I like this anime. It has a great setting, but it leads to so many different places, but then it stops. Thats the biggest problem! Considering FanFiction.net and Archive of Our Own still seek to keep the fanbase for this work alive, the more serious works there are way better when it comes to story. I highly suggest giving this show a watch, but as I mentioned above if you are looking to get into an anime as to where you LOVE the characters, sort of like watching Clannad, or Akame Ga Kill(two series in which the fans are intended to get emotionally attached), I don\'t suggest you watch it. This anime is great when you want to wind down, and watch a funny, romantic comedy. Or if you want to expand your own ideas, this show certainly has the setting to start you off.', ""Infinite Stratos... The premise seems promising. One guy. Lots of girls. Sci-fi setting. But in the end it was not a great anime, mainly because of the lack of story and character development.1/Story:Storywise, it seems promising, set in the future, a new type of weapons was created... and can only be maneuvered by girls. But wait, there is one guy that can do it too, and it's the main character. After that he's intagrated into the academy, and... it's quite fun to see his interactions with all those girls =D The main issue here is... there isn't really a storyline. We're just observing the main...character's interactions with the girls he's competing with to become the best IS pilot. Still fun to watch but lacks a bit of development.Verdict: 5/10. Too lacking.2/Art (Design, visuals, animation)Really good. The futurist design is quite good. Still an academy setting, but there are alot of details in there. The mecha (IS) are pretty well designed too. And best of all, the visuals (quality of the animation, backgrounds, action sequences) are REALLY good. If you watch this without scratching your head, then you will like, for what it is: a futurist harem with some good action scenes.Verdict: 9/103/Sound (Openings/endings, Music, Sound Effects, Seiyus)This is another part where this anime shines. The music is pretty good. Each sequence, be it romance, action, or serious story part, have good music fitting it. The opening theme is the anime in a nutshell: disconnect your brain and enjoy the ride =) (didn't like as much the ending theme though). As for the seiyus (Voice over actors), most of them were quite good. Special note goes to Charles Dunois. So cute ^_^Verditc: 9/104/ CharactersMmm, here is another part that is a bit lacking. There is some character development, but not so much. Characters are pretty much one-sided... This could have been better, especially if the main character (the hero) hadn't been as stupid as he is ^^ But, hey, it's part of the show, like in Love Hina, to enjoy all those interactions and get a good laugh of it =)Verdict: 7/105/ EnjoymentPretty good, pretty good. Despite some glaring flaws, which have been said in previous points, the anime still deserves to be watch. It's just 12 episodes + 1 OVA after all. If you need to get some entertainment, this is it ^_^ I had some good laughs out of this anime. Some soft- echi scenes as well, as this is a Harem -themed anime also. And the story, despite being a bit bland, was not so bad after all.Verdict: 8/106/ OverallQuite a good anime, but could have been really better. If you have some free time and don't know what to watch, enjoy harem animes with some futuristic and mecha features, then this could be the anime for you. I didn't expect much of it, but it was quite en enjoyment after all =)Charles Dunois saved this anime I guess ^_^This was my first review, I'm aware it's not perfect (quite far from it in fact), being from english gramatical errors and/or vocabulary, or in the form I choosed to employ, thus I'd gladly accept any well-formed criticizm.Thanks for reading. character's interactions with the girls he's competing with to become the best IS pilot.

Infinite Stratos, does this on a quite frequent basis.  (I didn\'t have anything planned for this opening statement.  Let\'s just get to the review.)Story (6.31/10):  The story of infinite stratos is about the school life of a boy named Orimura Ichika, who is able to polite something known as an IS, or Infinite Stratos.  The catch to this, is due to the fact that only women are able to pilot these things, so, a boy...being able to polite one is a pretty big deal.  It is then that we peer into his life as we see him surrounded by the hundreds and hundreds of girls that exist within the facility where they train IS pilots.Now, before we get into the nitty gritty I will give an explanation for what an IS is in case you haven\'t read or seen the series before.  An IS is essentially a tiny gundam, with the ability to fly and shoot stuff, or perhaps even wield a sword or two.  It\'s sort of like a mech that only armors the arms, legs, and partially the body and head, while having two giant floating whatever they are, on either side of the pilot.  This idea in and of itself is somewhat flawed, I feel.  The reason is due to the fact that the IS\'s use, is somewhat muddled.  On one hand, the series says that they\'re used for recreational purposes and for ""sport"", yet, the series shows us these machines as real genuine weapons, as intended by their primary use.  It\'s really confusing to think about when the idea is muddled with the actual plot.Aside from the obvious idiotic initial idea of a guy being placed in a world of girls, a flaw that  Infinite Stratos seemed to have, was a lack of a direct plot line or idea.  Every few episodes, the idea of the show changes into something that is completely different than the rest of the show.  I never felt like the show had a really cohesive plot line, rather than being stuck together through production means.On the other hand, the pacing was rather decent in terms of the fact that the series never seemed to rush as much as I have seen before.Overall, IS had quite a bit of problems in terms of is storyline, but everything did actually come together rather well in terms of what the creators were going for.  Sure, it wasn\'t the best, but it was somewhat decent to watch.Overview+  Watchable+  Decent pacing-  mashed different plot points together somewhat uncohesively-  confusing mech usageCharacters (5.95/10):  Orimura Ichika.  Just...wow.  Whenever a harem series comes into existence, the one thing, the ONE THING that is made every time they make a main character, is to make him more oblivious than the oblivious ability in pokemon.  Ichika follows this general time stream of having this same trait, but exponentially increased.  He possesses the general traits of a ""non-perverted"" harem lead by being the nice guy, being kind to girls, the whole enchilada.  With that, he has the most obvious trait of being the most oblivious guy ever, and it...is...frustrating...to...watch.  This trait made the some scenes somewhat unbearable to watch, especially due to the fact that the girls of this series give completely obvious signs that they like/love him.What I find interesting, is that fact that literally, just by looking at the girls\' hair, you can probably tell what their personality is.  Moving on to the girls, since they\'re for the most part, one-noters that only add to the fact that this is a harem series, most of them seem kind of forced.  At least 2 or 3 out of the entire harem seem somewhat forced in terms of liking the guy.  There was never any real sort of progression with some of the girls actually falling in love with him, and it somehow felt unnatural.  (Then again, a harem in and of itself is unnatural.)  Aside from having a huge crush on the main guy, Ichika, they all really feel like cardboard cutouts with a certain distinguishable trait, all except our main female Houki, of course because, main character status.For supporting cast, we have a load of characters that range in terms of screentime.  We have some that add to the plot and show overall very well, really, playing more of a part than most of the harem girls in the series, while others are just there for reasons unknown.Overall, the cast, except for a few choice members of the supporting cast, was quite bland in comparison.  Most of them were quite overused troupes and traits from series past, and there wasn\'t anything completely out of the ordinary or special.  (I do like Honne Nohotoke though.  She\'s an exception.)Overview+  Decent supporting cast members-   Densest...guy....ever....-   Bland and unoriginal harem girlsArt and Sound (7.64/10 and 7.22/10):  While the series has some flaws with its storyline and idea, the artwork has a decent thing going for it.  Created by Sentai Filmworks, the series has a thing for fight scenes with the mechs, which look surprisingly fluid and well...awesome.  The use of 3-D models in the series fits well with the flow of battle that the series uses, and the actual designs are nothing to shy away at either.To be frank, the art is a good thing to have come out of this series in general.On the topic of its soundtrack, IS has the problem that a great number of anime series have, and that is unmemorable tracks.  While the majority of the soundtrack did sound good enough to listen to it, with the OP actually fitting for the series it was in, it wasn\'t so good that you would remember it for days to come.  To put it frank, the sound was good, don\'t get me wrong, but there wasn\'t any track that stood out as something that I would like to listen to over and over again.Overview+  Decently good art+  Good mech designs+/-  Good soundtrack, not memorablePersonal Enjoyment (6.82/10):  As a personal fan of the harem genre, one thing that I always like trying to find, is a series where the idea of a harem goes beyond the general one guy surrounded by 5 girls, by giving the story and characters, some substance.  Essentially, what this series does differently than the normal template of a harem series.  Infinite Stratos didn\'t really succeed in that department.For me, nothing stood out as extraordinarily different or even remotely apart from the general formula of a harem series.  Apart from that, the obliviousness that Ichika has is positively ridiculous.  So ridiculous in fact, that I had an aneurysm after raging at my paused screen by the obvious hints (that weren\'t even hints), that this guy was given.While I won\'t lie that I enjoyed this series nonetheless on account of it being a harem, (I have low standards), IS doesn\'t really push itself apart from the norm of a harem series, is for the most part, was pretty standard in terms of plot.  The series isn\'t fabulous, but it was at least watchable to some extent.  Though personally, this wouldn\'t be the first choice for rewatching a harem series.Overall Score: 6.46/10 being able to polite one is a pretty big deal.  It is then that we peer into his life as we see him surrounded by the hundreds and hundreds of girls that exist within the facility where they train IS pilots.Now, before we get into the nitty gritty I will give an explanation for what an IS is in case you haven\'t read or seen the series before.

Acually, I enjoyed it, and I enjoyed how I would talk to myself on how stupid Ichika (Main Character) was toward the girls.STORY (7/10): The story was alright, I kinda liked how all of the girls had their own history and how they ended up there. Kinda ridiculous how one of the girls was Tsundere toward Ichika....The ending, easy to apprehend, too bad I won\'t be talking about that o_o spoilers bro.CHARACTER (6/10): Once again, I liked how the characters informed the viewer about their history and how they ended up in their scenario, but this is where the anime kind of suffers. Some of the other characters that are sometimes seen in the episodes are not well defined and placed in the anime as if they were supporting characters, leaving the viewer to think ""What happend to them?""Something that confuses me is that.. This is a Harem-Mecha. Sure okay, that worked in Full Metal Panic, but this defied realism on a certain scale. When flying through the air at maybe 200 km/h, is it possible your face keeps it\'s shape like its made out of metal? NO. That\'s what confuses me.

Of course, that is what I got. IS took a different route into making the mecha series work. Instead of a giant robot, they made a suit. Instead of a war being waged around the world with robots, they are used for sport. To get to the point, IS took a typical mecha idea and made it more intricate, which led to a surprisingly entertaining anime. The best part of the series, just as in any harem anime, is choosing a favorite [country based] female character....Making them fight over the main character just made things more interesting with robo suits. Since IS wasn't as long as most mecha series, it wasn't drawn out and boring, which worked well for its case. Overall, IS is a great anime with nice visuals and designs.

who the typical guy character you found in most harem anime who basically an idiot in class who cant understand the emotion of the people around him about himselffurthermore from watching the first 4 episode the ending can be seen and the story is pretty mediocre they got great things in the story why not make it more exciting like throwing some special events after meeting all the female character along the way before the end, or some story development on...the older sister i bet majority of the people that have seen this would think the same develop the character further dont give it a 12 episode series with everything rush up to the end, if they plans well enough it can make a 10 type 24 episode series that probably better.now to the character(female)Alcott, Ceciliayour basically over the top character that knows no embarrassment and where what you call slutty underwear but always ignore or left back from the rest and do outrages thing to get in front of the rest, ok the character ideal is good but there no special episode that show her doing the outrages things beyond what expected which is sad cause that make the story more interesting.Bodewig, Laurathe character you find in most shounen anime female character the one that starts as the major enemy that hates the main character guts then later after a event fall in love with the character most likely after her life is safe, pretty common and quite boring after watching tons of anime with that type of character but they change it to the type of character that's knows nothing about loves and does outrages thing mention by a friend who probably gets her information wrongly or in the anime case the friend is an otaku who basically give her advise in the ideal of otaku event scene which in the ideal is pretty funny and well develop.Fang, Lin Yinthis character is very hard to determined what type she is as she the childhood friend bu yet she ignore by the main character and she also possess a short temper which is related to her height, i think she added in to fit the needs of loli character fansShinonono, Houkiyes the childhood friend character thats hold deep feeling and gets more jealous than all the rest and also the first one that is close to the main character with some strange history, also she the tsundere type that wants to get close but fear people looking at her and the main character together despite having feeling for himDunois, Charlottethe ever-harem type character the type who has deep family issue but then falls in love with the main character and choose to live alive different from what the family wants, she is also the type that gets jealous and try to get closer to the main character more so then the rest with the added bonus of being the room-mate with the main character.overall i rated the show 8 I like the character quite a bit the art really good the sound as well and the story a bit out for me by still a good anime to watch when you got nothing to do. the older sister i bet majority of the people that have seen this would think the same develop the character further dont give it a 12 episode series with everything rush up to the end, if they

anime with that type of character but they change it to the type of character that's knows nothing about loves and does outrages thing mention by a friend who probably gets her information wrongly or in the anime case the friend is an otaku who basically give her advise in the ideal of otaku event scene which in the ideal is pretty funny and well develop.Fang, Lin Yinthis character is very hard to determined what type she is as she the childhood friend bu yet she ignore by the main character and she also possess a short temper which is related to her height, i think she added in to fit the needs of loli character fansShinonono, Houkiyes the childhood friend character thats hold deep feeling and gets more jealous than all the rest and also the first one that is close to the main character with some strange history, also she the tsundere type that wants to get close but fear people looking at her and the main character together despite having feeling for himDunois, Charlottethe ever-harem type character the type who has deep family issue but then falls in love with the main character and choose to live alive different from what the family wants, she is also the type that gets jealous and try to get closer to the main character more so then the rest with the added bonus of being the room-mate with the main character.overall i rated the show 8 I like the character quite a bit the art really good the sound as well and the story a bit out for me by still a good anime to watch when you got nothing to do."", ""I have said this before and I will say it again. Harem anime are my favorite. I really wasn't expecting much from this one, however. I'm glad to say I was seriously mistaken. How should I start? Well, I guess I should start with the characters.The MC is the only Male who can utilize the IS. Not even the creator of IS understands why. I personally believe it is because he wishes to protect everyone around him. Which would explain why he is so dense.He is surrounded by Girls who want to wait on his hand and foot and doesn't realize it at...all. You will want to bash your head into a wall over and over again. That is how moronic he is. And he also said he thought his sister was the hottest out of the group (Did I just say that?). Well, indirectly of course. Seriously, He is a moron.Have you ever been the one who is slowest, weakest, dumbest and the most inadequate of your family? That is our MC. Yet he only wants to protect those around him. He has died and come back to life. That is what he does best. Sacrificing his own life for others.If I continue any further I'm going to spoil the anime. Look, just make sure you watch this NEXT. It is awesome!!I really want a season 3! I loved season 1 just 5 minutes in. Season 2 was wonderful. Now I'm begging for a season 3. Anyone else wants to join in? all. You will want to bash your head into a wall over and over again. That is how moronic he is. And he also said he thought his sister was the hottest out of the group (Did I just say that?). Well, indirectly of course.

It is awesome!!I really want a season 3! I loved season 1 just 5 minutes in. Season 2 was wonderful. Now I'm begging for a season 3. Anyone else wants to join in?"", 'IS: Infinite Stratos is a terminally dull experience that, in the two days I spent struggling to binge watch it, taught me more than I ever thought I would know about the state of anime today. Even that makes it sound more interesting than it actually is.Now, just to get this out of the way, I\'m not a big anime guy. That being said, I understand to some extent how storytelling works, and this is why I feel qualified enough to tell you why you should not watch the anime in question unless you are REALLY thirsty.Our story is set in Japan in the near...future, at the prestigious IS Academy. In this future, genius scientist Tabane Shinonono has created a technology known as the Infinite Stratos, or IS. The IS are nothing more than mecha suits that, oddly, can only be operated by women, and the academy where the story takes place is where women from all over the world go to learn how to use the IS. Cool.Meet our main protagonist, Ichika Orimura. He\'s a fifteen-year old boy who is heading into his first year at the IS Academy. For mysterious reasons, he is the only man in the world who seems capable of operating the IS.A new viewer who was heading into the show with the above information might, reasonably enough, ask him or herself the following questions: How do the IS work? Why can only women operate them? What about Ichika is special, and why can he operate the IS? How is modern society affected by the IS? How have gender roles been affected? How have the IS been used by world leaders and political powers?Just as the show graciously did, I am not going to answer any of these questions, because fuck you, that\'s why. You thought this was a show about giant robots? So did I, when I decided to watch this. Boy, was that ever a gigantic fucking mistake.What IS: Infinite Stratos is actually about is the most oblivious, superficial, uninteresting male teenager ever to be born who, despite lacking any characteristics that might make him suitable for romancing, manages to collect an absurd number of girls who are all after his cock. Given that this show is entirely \'character\' driven, I am going to assign scores to the aspects neither I nor the writers care about.PLOT: 1/10, for nothing more than existing. There\'s no reason why the IS can\'t be operated by men, there\'s no reason why they\'ve been banned by the military (yes, this world-rending machine of absolute destruction has been prohibited from being used BY THE MILITARY. I said that.)Nothing in this show happens for a justifiable reason. Any time an action scene takes place, it doesn\'t make any sense, it simply happens. There\'s little that could have been done to worsen this anime\'s story short of making it contradict itself from episode to episode.ART: 5/10. Nothing noteworthy here. None of the character designs are memorable. The only features that visibly distinguish any of the characters are the length and colour of their hair, their height, and in the case of a few characters, specific items of clothing. The backgrounds are sufficiently well detailed, but the whole show has a distinctly orange-and-blue hue, as in the colour of the sunset contrasting with the colour of the sky or the ocean. By a long shot the most overused color palette in today\'s media.SOUND: 4/10. The most forgettable part of the show by far. So forgettable I actually forgot what it was like. The voice acting is at least solid, but the music? I honestly couldn\'t tell you if there even WAS any. (I\'m kidding, there was. But there could just as well have not been). A lot of the time, the music amps up--more than befits the scene, actually--and that only amplifies its genericness.Now. Ho-ho-ho-ho, hold on tight. Let\'s talk about the CHARACTER.2/10, solid. I\'ll explain why this isn\'t a 1 very shortly.Our main protagonist is, as I mentioned, oblvious. This wouldn\'t be a problem if he didn\'t frequently give the impression that he was being a prick to the girls on purpose. I can distinctly recall two exchanges (paraphrased):""Hey, Ichika, do you want to go out sometime?""""Sure.""""Really? Thank you!""""Yeah, just for some shopping, of course.""And, of course (note that this is a different girl):""I\'m really glad you asked me to come along for some shopping.""""Well, I did need to buy a few things, so might as well.""I\'m not even kidding. He is so incredibly dense, frustrating, and incapable of getting the hint that these girls like him that I started to wonder if HE was the mecha all along. My resolve broke about an episode and a half away from the ending, so if that is actually how it goes, then well fucking played. (That\'s not how it goes, by the way.)So, there\'s a harem. The character is lacklustre, so I suppose the dick must be out of this world, or perhaps the girls are just as brain-dead as he is. I\'ll list them off really quickly because there\'s nothing really worth talking about. There are more characters in the show and more are without a doubt introduced in the light novels and second season, but I won\'t include them because I don\'t care.Houki: she is the \'childhood friend\'. She\'s the typical girl who sets up an imaginary restraining order between the main character and any other person of the female form, and gets angry whenever he speaks to a girl who isn\'t her. Nothing really to talk about here. She gets mad at him. That\'s it. She\'s also the sister of the scientist who invented the IS, but I don\'t care.Cecilia: she is the \'posh foreigner\'. A so-called IS representative from the UK, she has been given a role by her country the meaning of which I will not give you because I neither know it nor care about it. This character has pretty much no reason to be part of the harem. She hates the protagonist, has a mecha battle with him, and realises she loves him. She has literally no reason to do so--she has not undergone any development, nor has any chemistry been shown between the two. She gets angry at him a lot, a bit like Houki. Exactly like Houki, actually. She\'s the same as Houki but more annoying.Rinin: she is the \'childhood friend\'. Again. She\'s the typical girl who sets up an imaginary restraining order between the main character and... you get where I\'m going with this, right? The IS representative from China, she is identical to Houki in every aspect other than the fact she\'s slightly less dislikable, and this is entirely due to the fact she is not around for the first episode or so. I don\'t remember exactly when she makes her appearance because I don\'t care.Charlotte Dunois: she is the \'shy girl\'. She is the IS representative from France, and I have graced her with remembering her surname, because she is the only girl who isn\'t a bitch. Hold it--that doesn\'t make her a well written character, far from it. She is still far behind the line of feeling like a real person, the standard any good character should be held to. However, she is the only one who did not annoy me while she was on screen, on top of having the best voice actor. She should and would be the girl for the protagonist to date if his programmers had taught him the meaning of the word.Laura: she is the \'emotionless girl\'. The IS representative from Germany, she is the girl who is all action. She hates the main character and attempts to have a few battles with him, at the end of which she gets defeated and realises she\'s in love with him while also being angry at him. Yes, precisely like the other girl. One of the other ones, take your pick. She has some backstory with the protagonist\'s sister, who I haven\'t mentioned thus far because I don\'t care.That\'s pretty much it. These are the girls who I don\'t care about and who are all irrevocably in love with a robotic apparition that was sent down by an extremely petty alien race to annoy me beyond belief. I would pity each of them if it was possible to pity cardboard.There are other characters in this show, but I actually don\'t care.ENJOYMENT: 3/10. This was not a torturous experience, believe it or not. There are dangerous shades of the \'so bat it\'s good\' effect here, but this is no M. Night Shyamalan\'s The Happening. The very few laughs this show managed to eke out of me were not so much because I was laughing at its incompetence, because it\'s truthfully not bad enough for that. It falls just below the worst place for a piece of entertainment to be, the point of being absolutely dull and boring in every way. This show occasionally managed to make me shake my head and laugh in desperation at what other cliché scene or character would be introduced the next episode.OVERALL: 3/10. Look, if you wanna watch a show about a lifeless android and five autistic girls who are obsessed with his cock, with a mecha plot that exists as nothing more than the vessel through which to introduce our male protagonist into a female-only setting, then be my guest. Enjoy the countless, hilarious scenes of Girl N walking in on Boy with Girl N+1 and getting angry at him, or perhaps the belly-laugh inducing scenes of Boy walking in on Girl N while she\'s changing/in the shower and getting beat up by her. Enjoy this show if you can, you\'ll do better than I did.If you, on the other hand, have even a passing interest in a believable romance, enjoyable characters, or a plot, avoid this show like you would the bubonic plague. future, at the prestigious IS Academy.

Considering I don\'t usually watch Mecha, this was a ""fresh"" experience.Story 4/10It was clear that the plot was lacking and I felt that could be seen as mediocre episodes were strung together. The mecha fights wasn\'t anything special either. Infinite Stratos\' story was, for the most part, flat.Art 8/10The art was indeed a sight for sore eyes and it was well executed. The art style was standard-fare but brought to life by the light, crisp feel which improved the mood of the series....Soundtrack 5/10The background music wasn\'t bad, and it mostly improved the ambience of the anime. However, some parts were poorly arranged and this led to awkward timing. The OST was decent, but nothing special.Character 6/10It is a challenge to develop the characters in a show with many main characters. There was an attempt to add depth to the characters but it was mostly in vain. The MC, Ichika, was your run-of-the-mill dense male lead and was frustrating to watch at times. However, I commend the fact that each character was unique and had distinctive qualities. I also enjoyed the mysterious air of Chifuyu Orimura\'s past that was foreshadowing much of the seriesEnjoyment 9/10I found myself conflicted at the end of the series. It was an extremely average show, yet I enjoyed it- a lot. From a critical standpoint, Infinite Stratos should be chucked into the burning pile of mediocrity. Despite that, I would definitely watch a continuation of this anime (Yes, I have watched IS:2 and enjoyed it).Overall 6/10I have mixed feelings about this show and it would definitely have scored better had they worked on refining the edges more. All in all, I would recommend this show. Soundtrack 5/10The background music wasn\'t bad, and it mostly improved the ambience of the anime.

All in all, I would recommend this show.', 'Alright here\'s my review as to season 1 of IS: (This is recommended for people who like romance action and a fun time not people looking for a very serious anime)Infinite Stratos: Is a Harem/ecchi/comedy/action series, about when a girl in japan decides to create a human functioned ""mecha warrior"" used for Olympic and sporting uses only. But with only one catch too it... only females can use them... until now. I wont ruin the story so figure out why yourself. So basically this guy Ichika is the only male able to use these robots so he gets put into an all girls school... and...of course the guy is clueless in the subject of girls... i\'m guessing you know how that goes. Below are my ratings:Story: 9. I gave it a nine because I really love how the story goes through with the initial thought process it doesn\'t go every which way like most harem anime do now a days it\'s very loyal too it\'s initial script. I would\'ve like a bit more romance to it and that the character wouldn\'t be so clueless but that would\'ve taken the fun away anyway.Art: 10. Nothing to complain about the artowrk this is top-notch best of the best the graphics were amazing absolutely loved the coloring and animations too it.Sound: 7. I loved the sound effects it had but it didn\'t have neraly enough unique distinctive sounds, I would\'ve put more into it and the sound quality was a bit off as well.Character: 9. I loved the way the characters were stereo-typical to there countries and how beautifully they were drawn, I did get mislead by some appearances though so i would\'ve fixed that but overall the character\'s story lines and their personal effects were amazing.Enjoyment: 10. This one of course is a personal one but I just couldn\'t stop laughing and crying in this series, it\'s one of those times when you just don\'t know what to do I absolutely loved the back to back action as long as romance! You don\'t normally get that... plus i\'m a sucker for an all male in all girls or vise-versa situation there\'s not many out there but this one hit the spot! Thanks for reading..

Enjoy!', 'This anime, in all honesty wasn\'t the worst anime I\'ve watched... Can\'t say it was the best by a long shot though. Pretty much, the synopsis does a decent job in setting the mood for what the whole anime is going to be on. ""Ichika\'s busy school life surrounded by girls has begun."" Yeah... sums up the whole anime real well.Story: 4Wait... there was a story? The story was essentially girls fighting over one guy. However, introducing the girls one at a time was pretty cool... You get to see all kinds of archetypes from the tsundere to the super attached girl to the best...girl. Whatever, the story was near nonexistent.Art: 8The art was actually good in this. The background was overall well drawn as were the characters. Fighting scenes looked cool and overall a bright style of art that sets the mood for the anime. Cheerful, carefree, and kinda funny.Sound: 7The OPs and the endings were all pretty good. They were cheerful music that went well with the anime. Once again, cheerful mood... The other sounds, such as the voices and background music etc., weren\'t that bad either. They essentially fit what the anime was trying to hit.Character: 6Hmmm.... What to say. Well, when the characters are first introduced, I had hope that they would have a little bit more dimension. The characters do all change... into girls obsessed with the main character. The main character does not change at all and remains a blockhead for the whole series. Some characters are hardly explained, which was annoying. However, the introduction to the characters were fine.Enjoyment: 7This was one of those animes where you chill and watch for the heck of it. Not really much of a story, traditional bathroom scenes, harem scenes, weird scenes? It\'s really light-hearted, so it shouldn\'t be taken too seriously. There were funny scenes which made the experience better though.Overall: 6This is one of those animes to could possibly have been good until it took a turn on the harem road and became a flat-out harem anime. It was funny with good art and overall likeable characters, but... no story... at all. I probably wouldn\'t recommend this unless the person asked for very specific criteria, i.e. mecha, harem. Other than that, there are better anime to watch for mecha, harem, slice of life, action, etc.Thanks for reading this review!

The guy is portrayed as the only guy that can run a mech besides ALL the girls in the universe. The amount of harem is huge within the anime. And often, there are ""fights"" between the girls and snarky comments for him. Its a big + for all the non-sense drama.The male lead while being special, treated specially and is literally the focus of all the pretty girls is among the biggest sack of bricks that I\'ve seen in...anime. He is that dumb and embarrassed. With that being said, my dilemma is if its accidental or intentional. That I may never find out, was it genius or madness that made this character so realistically stupid. A big also is that he is shown as ""weak"" male and that\'s what drives the anime -- all the OP girls in mechs want to protect this guy because he is too dumb for his own good.Either way throughout the length of the anime, there are ton of boob touching accidents and embarrassing scenes, often public. But there are no big ""omg"" moments besides a few kiss scenes. With that said, I\'m sure you will have a hilarious time watching this because of how stupid the male lead is. If you get the rage to punch his stupid face off, I understand that.The story is good though, because it sticks to the mech genre. It has a good plot direction, because everyone is fighting with mechs (there are no surprise evil villain characters that can use unknown magic of some sort).

There is no plot-twists, no big good-evil battles, just some good mecha fighting, some boobs, and love for Ichika. Ichika is some kind of special boy, who is able to use the mecha\'s (IS) that only can be operated by women. No, nothing special behind it. He just can. Thus, he is send to the IS Academy, an all women Academy. Yeah, pretty lovely...harem right? So don\'t expect anything story-wise. Actually, don\'t watch it for story, since there is none.

And one of the OSTS, Shiro Kishi, god it\'s one of the beautiful soundtracks I\'ve ever heard. And I\'m comparing it to Mushishi soundtracks.Characters: We have Ichika, as our main lead. 5 girls, all in-love with him. (in appearance order) A childhood friend, a rich princess, another childhood friend, another girl who was sent to collect Ichika\'s data and was disguised as a boy (accidently, ichika finds out and after some talk, she ignores her orders and go to school with her normal appearance, don\'t worry), and a girl from Germany. You\'ll hate her in the beginning, then love her. Actually, considering the generic harem shows, this is a pretty good set of girls.Some people hate Ichika\'s character, because of him being a dense dumb, still I find it quite natural. There has to be some field in Ichika\'s personality for the girls to make their moves. If Ichika was in-love with of the girls, then the rest wouldn\'t be able to advance, thus, wouldn\'t make it a harem show. So for this show, Ichika ""has"" to be dense in order to give girls some room to move. But still, f*ck you Ichika. I\'m so jealous of you.Enjoyment/Overall: Aside from being a harem show, there are pretty good mecha fights thrown in there. I mean, it\'s some good fighting. With boobs bouncing.

Well in Infinite Stratos that is the reality. A mega harem should you say filled with infinite possiblites and they throw mechas into the mix to keep your attention about it.Story 7/10I feel story wise a school that teaches students how to use mechas doesn't sound that original may disappoint you but this doesn't really focus on mechas all that much. It really focuses on Ichika and the huge harem on his shoulders. It sets...a very comedic tone to you just to sit back and enjoy women fighting over one guy. Very hilarious if you ask me but I still feel like they could of done more with the mechas instead of the usually fight with one mysterious mecha with somewhat great power bit.Art 9/10It has a very up to date art style and it looks very beautiful. The color schemes are very vibrant and IS machines themselves don't stand out and fit in nicely with the anime.Sound 9/10I really enjoyed the OP and ED quite frankly. Not much to note about but they don't feel very distinguished like I would remember them if I heard them again down the road.Characters 10/10The development of characters was okay but I really enjoyed the diversity in the characters associated. Lot of different kinds and Infinite Stratos presents them in a way you'll be rooting for which girl wins out over the others. They also made me laugh with about ever little bit presented in the anime it sort of reminded me of things like Angel Beats.Overall 9/10If like a harem with infinite possibilities this just may be something you need to check out. I know the Mecha genre is really all that popular anymore but the focus isn't really set on the IS Machines at all really. But if you were looking for a good Mecha anime, this is not the best example to show for the genre but it is a good series to start with if your just getting into it and I can't wait to watch the second season. a very comedic tone to you just to sit back and enjoy women fighting over one guy.

Well, that\'s pretty much IS: Infinite Stratos in a nutshell, as one might expect from a harem themed anime. And what better way to emphasise the shounen demographic than by including mechas?Now, before you begin watching this anime, you must be critically aware that it is, first and foremost, a harem anime. Those expecting the latest Evangelion evolution should probably reboot their...thriller cores, lest they find themselves disappointingly skulking back to their DVD boxsets. The basic premise is of course to replace all available characters with attractive female substitutes, usually within feasible dating age for the clueless main character. That is not to say by any means that the characters in IS are any more shallow, but simply a different spin on what a newcomer might be used to. So, without further ado, let\'s break into the meat of the review.Story: 5/10You might be shocked that an anime which I rank overall quite positively has such a low story score, but it is very prevalent once you watch the anime that it\'s riding on the back seat. The anime seems to have settled upon an uncomfortable medium between slice-of-life and action that resembles the often-dreaded ""filler"" episodes from long-running action anime - only this happens for each and every one of the twelve episodes. There is, however, quite clearly a progression of time and events (though it is rarely, if ever, mentioned) which is accompanied by typical intra-episode plots. These are quite often forgotten by the next episode, however, as what seems to be a major element in some overarching plot usually gets resolved in the last two minutes of screen time. The verdict? Enough plot to keep the anime from falling apart, but don\'t have any expectations of story flowing for more than two or three episodes.Art: 7.5/10The animation style is clean, and pretty typical of a well-budgeted modern anime. There\'s not really a lot to note as it is quite consistently good, however it does shine in a couple of areas. The balance of 3D animation is an often-trodden pitfall of newer anime, as too much 3D can really detract from the cartoon-like worlds we are used to. However, like any art style, when balanced appropriately it can be used to great effect, and this is done just right in IS - something I have only really seen before in Psycho Pass. The variety of female styles is also essential in a harem to differentiate the various archetypal women; a point that IS has clearly taken into account. Whether the suspiciously large breasts are of interest to you or not, the wide variation in character design will allow you to very easily distinguish the characteristics of each female - ensuring your all-important ships will be delightfully unique. The only part that lets the art down would have to be the design of Ichika, the male lead, as he resembles pretty much every generic male lead from harem and slice-of-life alike. Of course, this could be seen as a plus point, as his character should be as average as possible to allow viewers to paste themselves onto him; but the fact that there really is no individual style at all makes him yet another copy-paste shadow of a male. Overall, expect well-rounded production performance that appeals visually, but doesn\'t win out where originality is concerned.Sound: 6/10There isn\'t really a whole lot to comment on with the sound, because as far as the soundtrack goes it\'s as generic as the genre would suggest. The voice acting is generally good and the OP and ED songs are comfortable to listen to, but being so averagely good I won\'t say more as I haven\'t really got an opinion on them. In general, expect your ears to sit back and relax whilst the anime does it\'s thing.Character: 7/10I struggled long and hard with grading this particular point, as the characters are usually the most crucial elements of harem-themed shows. I eventually settled for a mildly-disappointing 7, because whilst every character showed great and true potential, there simply wasn\'t enough time in 4 hours to build up all 6 main characters plus entertain the notion of a mecha plot (which never happened anyway). As far as the male lead goes, the lacklustre back story  probably makes him the least interesting of the 6, though this would be expected of the harem genre. The other 5 girls that make up his main harem are all given very unique styles - ranging from upper-class and distinguished to militant and innocent. If each character is given roughly one episode of screen time, you would expect quite a significant amount of back-story and depth from each character. Sadly, the mecha action decides to kick in mid-way with most of these episodes, cutting precious time that could be used encouraging us to build our ships. The obligatory beach episode doesn\'t have a lot to offer either, though what it loses in story and character development it makes up for with copious fanservice. Which reminds me - despite the obvious fanservice that occurs every time a girl does something other than speak, the females rarely appear shallow - so the gratification of seeing your ship become even more realistic is slightly more emotional than if they were just breasts on sticks. As a side note, Ichika\'s older sister does seem someone focused on the ever-elusive plot and probably ends up getting the most depth despite rarely gaining screen time that isn\'t her frowning or ridiculing Ichika. Overall, squished between the fanservice/breasts and mecha action, there are some archetypal gems to be had, but they need a bit more polishing in the following series in order to become truly golden.Enjoyment: 10/10After all is said and done, this anime offers much in the way of gripping entertainment. I probably spend half of my time laughing out loud, groaning to myself, yelling at the characters on screen or pointing out the blatantly obvious - signs that I was completely engaged regardless of my judgement of the content. There would be at least one time per episode where a certain fanservice scene was just too much that I would declare it overkill, stop the video, and do something else for half an hour; only to come crawling back with my fists clenched, eagerly awaiting the next hilarious outbreak of ridiculousness. Try as I might, I could not run away from the show, and when I did it would be because my sleep schedule was completely messed up and I had to take a nap or real life intervened. It would be no exaggeration to say that I obsessed over this show, so you can be sure I will be watching the next series very promptly. As far as the enjoyable content goes, it really comes down to the almost parody-like switching from serious action to a girl\'s exposed body parts; or the romantic comedy of the girls fighting over Ichika, but instantly forming their harem bonds to protect him from some greater threat. To conclude, whilst there are flaws that appear on the larger scale, the moment-to-moment entertainment is top notch and keeps you glued to the screen, even when you feel like cringing or groaning.EDIT: original score was 8/10, but upon reflection I believe I was too generous (being hasty to submit my first review)The Final Verdict: 7/10My reasoning behind the overall score of 7 is based on this anime\'s potential for more content and the frequent higher quality performance that is seen on a per-episode basis. The biggest suffering that Infinite Stratos faces is the lack of episodes - 12 simply isn\'t enough when you are attempting to juggle harem and mecha/action at the same time. Given that there will be at least another series, we may see the plot improve in later episodes, however it cannot directly influence the individual score of this series. The imaginative potential, however, is vast for such a small show, as the characters are not simply shells but well-rounded archetypes and the mecha style is unique and promising. My biggest reason for pushing up the overall score comes from the sheer entertainment value that the anime provides - the fascination with the show, the quality of the relationships and hilarious comedy is really the unique selling point of this and indeed any harem anime.So why should you watch this anime, if you haven\'t already? Because it will give you the constant booster shots of instant gratification, whilst keeping your mind fixated on the relationship potential for each harem girl, to the point where the plot just isn\'t really important any more. Oh, and there are some giant robot suit things that I didn\'t even really mention, because they\'re cool but kinda irrelevant. So even if you are tired of watching endless teenage sexual frustration (and you call yourself an harem fan?!), there\'s something futuristic and metallic (that shoots lasers) around the corner waiting to be discovered... thriller cores, lest they find themselves disappointingly skulking back to their DVD boxsets. The basic premise is of course to replace all available characters with attractive female substitutes, usually within feasible dating age for the clueless main character. That is not to say by any means that the characters in IS are any more shallow, but simply a different spin on what a newcomer might be used to.

Try as I might, I could not run away from the show, and when I did it would be because my sleep schedule was completely messed up and I had to take a nap or real life intervened. It would be no exaggeration to say that I obsessed over this show, so you can be sure I will be watching the next series very promptly. As far as the enjoyable content goes, it really comes down to the almost parody-like switching from serious action to a girl\'s exposed body parts; or the romantic comedy of the girls fighting over Ichika, but instantly forming their harem bonds to protect him from some greater threat. To conclude, whilst there are flaws that appear on the larger scale, the moment-to-moment entertainment is top notch and keeps you glued to the screen, even when you feel like cringing or groaning.EDIT: original score was 8/10, but upon reflection I believe I was too generous (being hasty to submit my first review)The Final Verdict: 7/10My reasoning behind the overall score of 7 is based on this anime\'s potential for more content and the frequent higher quality performance that is seen on a per-episode basis. The biggest suffering that Infinite Stratos faces is the lack of episodes - 12 simply isn\'t enough when you are attempting to juggle harem and mecha/action at the same time. Given that there will be at least another series, we may see the plot improve in later episodes, however it cannot directly influence the individual score of this series. The imaginative potential, however, is vast for such a small show, as the characters are not simply shells but well-rounded archetypes and the mecha style is unique and promising. My biggest reason for pushing up the overall score comes from the sheer entertainment value that the anime provides - the fascination with the show, the quality of the relationships and hilarious comedy is really the unique selling point of this and indeed any harem anime.So why should you watch this anime, if you haven\'t already? Because it will give you the constant booster shots of instant gratification, whilst keeping your mind fixated on the relationship potential for each harem girl, to the point where the plot just isn\'t really important any more. Oh, and there are some giant robot suit things that I didn\'t even really mention, because they\'re cool but kinda irrelevant. So even if you are tired of watching endless teenage sexual frustration (and you call yourself an harem fan?!), there\'s something futuristic and metallic (that shoots lasers) around the corner waiting to be discovered...', ""Well it's sad to see that most of the people rate it low I dunno why... I can't tell this is a masterpiece but it's worth watching Infinite Stratos might be a rip-off Gundam series but I guess it's still a bit different though it's a harem but there's no fan-service in here(kinda disappointing though just kidding hehehe). Well let's get started with the review of IS Infinite StratosStory(7/10)I dunno if I give it a 7 coz the story is not really good for now coz it's only introducing other characters and after introducing they fight.. So it's not really great for that. It really...leaves me crave for more coz I heard there's a light novel of it and it is still on-going and the fight is Arena type like most brawling battle...Art(10/10)Well The art is fantastic and great coz it's well made combination of 2d and 3d so what can you ask for? It can even rival the art of the new releases to date. So I'm really thrilled about it.... Most especially the fight scene  in the end.. well spoiler* where they fight Silveria Gospel the one that is in the start of the anime..Sound(10/10)The Op theme and Ed theme is great and the BGM matches the scene so it's really great....Character(10/10)Well for the character I thought the characters are for fan-service but I've mistaken(too bad hehehe) but it's really great I'm really obsess with this German Character Laura Bodewig for unknown reasons. Well Laura and Ichika won't get well.. coz it's hinted in the last episode that oops spoiler... well it's great it has a well breed of character for a harem oneEnjoyment (10/10)Well I can't keep the Enjoyment of this anime coz of the fight scene it gives me a good laugh every time there's a funny scene you can't keep itOverall (9/10)It's a great anime I can't tell it's a masterpiece coz the story is bad...

It main purpose for me is to provide relaxation + laugh. If i want a good story i would look...for a different genre.So don't be fool by those bad reviews, this is a great anime as it provide lots of relaxing time for me, to escape the stressful from study and such. I personally wouldn't watch a anime with good story but give me further headache and cliff hanger.Anyway, watch it if you really into harem comedy and never get tired of it.If you don't like it, don't watch it and don't talk shit about it, because we all know harem anime are cliche and they don't have story for a different genre.So don't be fool by those bad reviews, this is a great anime as it provide lots of relaxing time for me, to escape the stressful from study and such.

Well, IS gave me that aura and feeling.Let\'s cut to the chase..Gundam Seed is one of the best mecca anime out there and I thought IS was its son; however, it was its close relative on Harem. SO.. what\'s so good about the story? I can\'t tell you exactly but it has its uniqueness. Apparantly, it has robots called the Infinite Stratos, which can only be used by women. On the one hand, Ichika came in to the all girls school for IS Training because he is the...only guy who could use it (spoiler alert). So.. the interesting plot ends here. Because in all episodes all I can say is ""Harem... HAREM EVERYWHERE"" which is the part that kind of disappoint me the most. I thought it was an action-packed anime but all the things that came in my way was new girl then fall in love with main guy then all of a sudden every girl want that guy. I hate it. It was like, the whole mecca genre was just a mascot of the series so that people will get interested so that\'s a perfect example of ""Don\'t judge the book by its cover"" UGH! If only they made it into a shounen anime with lots of action, comedy and villains. But everything turned out to be a shoujo anime for thirteen year old girls. I believe men would like this show because they can have all the naked women that they can watch. but anyway.. its good but not so much.Art is vibrant and modern. SO it is very good and splendid.I was interested by the opening but on the sound effects and the ending was just nothing to me. It didn\'t stand out so don\'t want to care about it anymore.Characters were just all the typical shoujo characters mixed up in one anime. They belong to different countries and links to Ichika for some Goddamn reason. And to put the cherry on top, the childhood friend gets closer to the main character at the end. (how pathetic and convincing) I think the characters were poorly executed not to mention Ichika\'s idiocy about Houki\'s feelings for him. I was sad because Uchiyama Kouki does not deserve this project (I\'m sorry) because he had a lot of magnificent roles; plus, he is my hero and my favorite seiyuu of all time.I didn\'t enjoy the most part. The inside jokes, ridiculous women trying to get closer to the main character. Cliche and repetitive moments. Everything seem so bold and naked.. I just liked the fact that only us (girls) can use robots. If they were real, I can shoot multiple weapons to ex boyfriends and ridiculously stupid enemies. (evil laugh) I just wished more action was inscribed here in this series then the art would have justice :)Overall, I place it between Mediocre and Good because of the animation and its minor creativity. If you want an anime which will make you throw tomatoes on your screen then why not? But seriously, this one is sucky so if want to watch this fine have it your way.. NOT. MY.

FAULT.', 'I have written reviews for both extremely good anime or extremely important anime, but I felt I lacked the one thing ever reviewer needs, a review of something really bad. Enter IS: Infinite Stratos, when I think ""I need to review something bad that I\'ve watched through completely and this was the first thing to spring to mind, sit back and hold on to your nipple hair folks, I\'m about to rip this anime a new asshole!Story -10/10: ...Wait, what do you mean I can\'t give it a negative score? You mean the lowest I can go is 1? God dammit.Story 1/10: The story of...IS is, like almost every other harem, a poorly thought-out excuse to have the main character surrounded by females. So basically here\'s how it is, it\'s the future (apparently) and we now have crazy exoskeleton mechs that can be magically summoned from watches or earrings (hell you could probably spawn one of these things from a tampon that\'s been rotting for ten years), and these mechs are so powerful the military said ""these things are to dangerous for combat, lets give them to students as a sports item!"" Now the thing is only females can use the IS mechs. Enter generic oblivious harem male lead #1364, hell this dude is so generic and lacking character dept he might as well be a lego brick (more on that later!) who is discovered to be the only male who can use the Infinite Gundam suits. What you\'re left with is 5% mech action and 95% lego brick being so stupid he can\'t figure out all the women around him are fighting over his cock. Like I said, this plot is nothing but a pitiful excuse to have a guy surrounded by chicks, and don\'t even get me started on the plot holes! For example, if the future is so advanced we have magical power armor bikini\'s we can summon out our assholes at any given time why does everything look the same, seriously, there isn\'t even so much as a flying car. And how in the hell does Charles *spoiler alert, although it\'s a spoiler you\'ll figure out within about 20 seconds of first seeing the character* manage to hide her breasts in a skin tight male version of a two piece when her breasts are that goddamn big, bandages only go so far.Art 6/10: Something IS doesn\'t completely fail at? Blasphemy! IS uses your generic character templates for all the characters, I don\'t know who start these templates but people really should learn to make unique looking characters. And when the characters aren\'t duking it out they move so little they look like cardboard cutouts with moving lips. The mech fight however are kinda well done (as little as they are) and so it gets a better score in this category then it would normally deserve.Sound 3/10: The music in IS is... Wait... I\'m trying to remember a few songs from this show... I can\'t seem to remember any, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MEMORABLE ONES!!! The music in IS is incredibly generic, and yes I know I\'ve been using that world a lot, but that\'s because this entire anime is in every sense of the word generic. As for the voice acting, want accents so fake they\'ll make you want to punch yourself in the nuts? Watch the dub. Want something where the acting might be bad but at least you won\'t be able to tell because you\'ll be too busy reading the subtitles to pay attention to the sound? Watch the sub.Character 1/10: I have made it no secret that I feel nothing but pure homicidal rage towards almost all harem male leads. The reason for this is because they\'re all the same in terms of stupidity! But our Lego brick here, he\'s something special, he somehow manages to be even stupider and more oblivious then almost every other one. We\'re talking about the kind of guy where a chick could strip down completely naked, crawl into his bed, and say ""I want you to have sex with me"" and he still wouldn\'t realize she wants his cock (this isn\'t an exaggeration, this exact scenario actually happens in the show). Oh and apparently he has incest-y feelings towards his sister when he sees her in a bikini but has absolutely no impure thoughts while he\'s giving her a full body massage, fuck logic, fuck it in the ass until it bleeds! As for the other characters, it seems the show has decide that rather then making all the characters your stereotypical harem female arch-type characters (the childhood friend, the big sister, the tsundere, ext...) it would just make a bunch of characters, and give basically everyone of them all these traits, cut out the middle man, have several characters with different personalities is so yesterday, time to make all our characters as Lego brick-ish as the main lead! (would someone please come to my house and stab me in the throat?)Enjoyment 3/10: What enjoyment? I would have had a better time scraping my head against a concrete wall for two hours then watch this crap. Okay fine, some of the mech fights were okay but that\'s about it!Overall 2/10: Do not watch this shit, honestly, this show will kill your brain cells the same way staring at the sun will kill your eyes, but at least the feeling of going blind while your eyes slowly boil in your eye sockets is far more pleasant then watching this. You do not need to see it and you do not want to see it, avoid this thing like it\'s a rat carrying the bubonic plague.

I was excited for an action packed anime with very unique mecha suits and filled with intense battle sequences. However, sadly, overall, this anime was a disappointment to me.Once I found out that the male lead was surrounded by all women, I grew more hesitant exactly where this anime was going. Although I will admit, I was able to successfully watch the entire series without stopping midway. However, there were multiple occasions where I grew extremely irritated with the character's dependency off of Ichika, as...well as the harsh change in personality with some of the girls. One minute they utterly despise him, the next they are swooning over him, and that sort of thing annoys me greatly.Also, I was very disappointed with the lack of action throughout the series. They had a chance to take it one of two ways. A more romantic comedy themed anime, or a more serious, action filled anime. Instead they struggled to find the medium between the two, and to attempt to capture this in 12 episodes is nearly impossible. It lacked character development for some characters that really could have shined, such as Ichika's sister.Out of the five 'winter' animes I watched (I think they were considered winter animes) this was definitely my least favorite, but, still, nonetheless, it was somewhat decent. I enjoyed some episodes, but I also cringed during others. If you like a fun, light-hearted anime but with some decent action scenes every few episodes, then you will probably enjoy this one. well as the harsh change in personality with some of the girls.

The IS suits are fantastic, basically humanoid body armor that gives the person a unique power set depending on either potential. That really cool. The OST soundtrack for this is great and the animation/fights are well choreographed. The characters are all fun and very well designed. The dub is my personal favorite, not only is the MC played by the King of Harem Scott Freeman who has been in everything from Highschool DxD to Date A Live. But the main heroin is voiced by my favorite VA Monica...Rial. Its also a nice touch that the girls from France, England, and German all have accents. I highly recommend this series place go and check it out Rial. Its also a nice touch that the girls from France, England, and German all have accents.

Because of this, I was both disappointed and pleased at the same time, which is weird.The story is as cliche as it gets for an anime in this genre, but there were aspects of the story where I was pleasantly surprised. The trope ""only guy in an all-girl school"" isn\'t used as much as it should, so I\'m always happy to see it be used. The story is there but isn\'t really used unless absolutely necessary. The obvious main focus of this anime is the harem aspect, which is done...unnecessarily well. This anime switches aspects extremely well, switching from your typical harem ecchi experience, to your action mecha experience, and it does this extremely smoothly and seamlessly.The characters are all cliche with a twist. The MC is what you\'d expect from an anime like this, all dense and badass (at times) and extremely lucky. The female characters are what you\'d expect from a harem, but the quality of them is increased tenfold. A good bunch of characters, who work off of each other pretty well, but don\'t really stand on their own well enough.The animation is as standard as it gets. There is the use of CGI in this anime, but it is reserved for fighting scenes with the mechs. The CGI is surprisingly good, but it\'s also nothing to write home about. Overall, the animation quality is passable enough to enjoy mindlessly.Overall, a good anime (surprisingly). In the beginning, I was reluctant in watching this anime, as it seemed as cliche as it gets, and in many ways it is. However, it did become interesting enough to gain my attention. I definitely would recommend this anime to pass the time. This anime is obviously not meant for everyone, so only watch if you are interested. unnecessarily well.

However, I feel that this series in its entirety (of season 1) manages to use every cliche trick in the overused-anime-elements-book to make a story line. In this series we have: a tsundere, beach scene, duel scenes, random enemy attacks academy scene, accumulative harem (characters introduced are only introduced to add numbers in the MC's harem), boy in an all girls school etc. For a series in 2011, it definitely became a pushover in the anime community...because of it, as can be seen in the MAL rating (6.89 as of Apr 8 2020) I will now be giving my review despite these mechanics hehe.Story:The narrative revolves around a high-school aged boy that has the power to control mechanized humanoid robots (known as IS or Infinite Stratos) that are only available for women to pilot. This allows him to join the girls-only IS training facility that powerful female pilots come from around the work seeking education... Itsuka (MC) manages to fit in as like 4 or 5 exchange students that despised him became part of his harem... I found the initial idea of this series attractive until I saw that Itsuka only goes hard unintentionally which were twice out of the 12 episodes (the first duel with Cecilia and the last in the last episode with the unmanned IS) That made this series go from a straight 7/8 to a 6/7 out of 10. The rest of the series were full of fan service that didn't really contribute to the narrative (or so, I think they're trying to stretch it out for the sequels) For this I'll be rating this series a 6/10 for its story.Art & Sound:If you'd ask me what year this series was made in by looking at a snippet (without any context either) I would have guessed it to be made within the past few years. The animation style and detail holds up very well for an almost 10 year old series - That being said, I feel they were being more resourceful by not making every single episode full of quick-paced action (which would require more attention to detail = more budget) but no qualms about the animation style or detail from me. 7/10VA were pretty good as well, but it was pretty obnoxious having one of the harem characters screaming whether it be Houki's scream against Itsuka because she was getting undressed or any of the other characters. I still see the effort put into their VA so 7/10 from me :)Character:Character development is almost non-existent in this series unless you mention the initial character introduction per episode basis - how characters randomly transferred one by one into the IS training facility. That is pretty much the only solid evidence I saw of character development, that and a few flashbacks Itsuka had with Houki and his initial reaction to the IS (that made him able to control them in the first place) but other than that very scarce. 6/10Enjoyment:I would have personally enjoyed this more if Itsuka wasn't a beta male and defeated all the unmanned IS without being K.O'd by them or protected by his harem. It made for an underwhelming viewing experience but hopefully he becomes OPMC in the next season.7/10. because of it, as can be seen in the MAL rating (6.89 as of Apr 8 2020) I will now be giving my review despite these mechanics hehe.Story:The narrative revolves around a high-school aged boy that has the power to control mechanized humanoid robots (known as IS or Infinite Stratos) that are only available for women to pilot.

(Not that there actually is a lot to spoil)I´ll assume that everyone who reads this alredy knows the premise, so I won´t go over all of that again, but basically, in this world, there are mechas called ""Infinite Stratos"" (IS for short), and only woman can pilot them, but our MC, Ichika, is for some reason the only man who is able to pilot them, so he goes to attend a school that teaches you how to use them and is therefore the only guy there.Story (2/10)Well, I don´t really now what to write here, because there is very little...of what you could call story. 90% of this show is just our MC adding new members to his harem, lots of stupid ecchi scenes, and the harem members getting jealous at each other and fighting over MC-kun. Then there are some for the most part totally unnecessary fight scenes with the mechas between the students. They get attacked like two times by unmanned mechas, that pose somewhat of a threat, but that´s it. Nothing else of any importance happens.And also, nothing in this anime makes any sense, and no questions get answered. I cant talk about every plot hole and every scene that didn´t make sense here, because this would get way to long but to name a few things that never got adressed in the anime. Why is the MC the only male who can pilot the mechas? Why can they only be used by woman in the first place? They were built by humans, so why make it like that? Why build these things anyway? They said that it´s forbidden to use them for military purposes, they apparently have a treaty that prohibits that. So what are they for? And then why make a school that trains pilots? Are they for sports then? But why create such a dangerous weapon just for sports? Someone is gonna misuse them at some point. And why has our MC to learn how to pilot them, he didn´t seem to be there out of free will? But if it´s not for military purposes, why would the government force him to learn this?I could go on and on about things that don´t make sense in this anime, but I hope you get the idea. in the end the ""only girls can pilot the mechs"" only exists so the MC can go to a school full of girls who all want to bang him.Also, the teachers at this school seem to have the urge to let the students die. There was an unmanned mech rioting at one point, that had to be stopped. So now who do you think had to do this dangerous task? Correct, the students, not the teachers or anything, noo. And again, let me remind you, this is apparently not a school that´s supposed to prepare them for fighting for the military, but.. for something else, I don´t know what. So there is no reason why it would be their job to stop this thing. There were more scenes like this, were the teachers should have doen something but ... just didn´t.So yeah, story hardly exists, and what little story does exist doesn´t make any sense.Characters (3/10)The characters aren´t much better. A bad story could have been forgiven if the characters were interesting and good, but... yeah, no, they aren´tLets start with the MC, Orimura Ichika:I don´t have a lot to say about him, he is as generic as it gets. He doesn´t really have a personality. He is a nice guy, wants to protect his friends, and is, of course, very good at piloting the mechs for no reason. He almost beat one of the best students in his class while it was only his second time piloting one of these things. And the first time wasn´t him practicing or anything, that was only when he proved that he was able to use them. So it´s totally unrealistic that he is that good at piloting them. We saw the practice of the class one time (after the battle) and the other students were literally practicing to walk, while he was flying trough the sky, doging missiles, attacking etc. during the battle.Also, his sisters works as a teacher at the school , she´s his homeroom teacher. She´s just the cool teacher character basically.Next, Shinonono Houki:She is his childhood friend, she is, of course, in love with him, and is generally the serious, violent type of girl. She is the character who was probably the closest to getting something like character development when she fucked up, Ichika got wounded and she was like ""I´m never going to pilot one of these things again"". She was sad for a little while, than another character said three sentences to her and then she got better again. She´s the sister of the woman who invented the mechs.Cecilia Alcot:She´s basically the spoiled girl who is very full of herself. Well, at least she was for like an episode until Ichika almost beat her in a battle, she fell in love with him and then her main character trait was basically that she was in love with him. Like every other character.Hunang Lingyin:She´s... also Ichikas childhood friend. (They probably ran out of stereotypes, so they were like ""eh, let´s do another childhood friend) She´s basically the confident loli character. And she is in love with Ichika. That´s it.Charlotte Dunois:She´s probably my favorite character (or rather my least least-favorite one). She´s basically just the very nice and kind of shy girl, but, in contrast to the other girls she actually acted kind of cute and was not annoying like everyone else. She originally had to dress as a boy, because her father wanted her to get a lot of attention as the second boy who is able to pilot a mech, and she was supposed to gather information about Ichika. That actually kinda made sense under these circumstances. Still not a great character, but better than the rest in my opinion.Laura Bodewig:She was actually intruduced as some sort of villain. Well, not really, but she was very serious, proud and agressive, she almost killed to other characters. So I  assumed she would be the villain, but of course not, what kind of show did I think this was? It took one episode for her to fall in love with Ichika. He saved her, and then she wanted to marry him. And after that she completly lost what little character she had. She turned from the serious, aggressive girl to someone who ran off embarassed because the MC said she looks cute in her swimsuit (ah, yes, there is a beach episode by the way if you were wondering).There are some more characters, but these are the main ones, and I don´t really have to say a lot about the rest. Everyone is generic, that´s it.Sound (5/10):Now to the sound. The soundtrack wasn´t anything special. It wasn´t very good or memorable, if you would play any track of this soundtrack to me, I doubt that I woud be able to recognize that it is from this show, but it also wasn´t bad. The tracks fit to the scenes they are used in, and they don´t sound horrible. The OP and ending themes are the same, nothing special, but also not horrible.The voice acting was pretty good for the most part. The only character who´s voice I didn´t like was the MC. But I don´t think it´s the fault of the VA, I looked at some of his other roles and there were some characters who´s voice acting I really liked, I guess it´s just like that because of the shitty character. Or he just got that much better over the years, this show is from 2012 after all.But they actually also had some really good voice actors in the cast. Charlotte Dunois was voiced by Hanazawa Kana and I think her voice was the only thing that kept me from going insane while watching the show. And Laura Bodewig was voiced by Marina Inoue, who is another voice actor I really really like (She voiced Oikura Sodachi in the Monogatari Series, that´s my favorite VA performance of any show I´ve seen). So their voices made this whole experience much more bearable for me.Art & Animation (5/10)The animation was..okay, i guess. It wasn´t horrrible but it could have been better. The fight animation was pretty much completely CG. Most of the time it was actually all right, sometimes it looked kinda weird, but it was passable. Aside from that, the artstyle was very generic, but most of the character designs were pretty alright. Well aside from the MC, who looks like every other generic MC ever.Enjoyment (2/10)It couldn´t have been much worse. I was constantly cluching my head because everything that happende was so stupid. The character interaction were not enjoyable, because the girls were either fighting over the MC, or the MC was saying something stupid and was showing what a nice guy he is. The anime had not a single original idea, aside from maybe the mechs who can only be piloted by woman (altough I feel like i´ve seen something similar before), but this was a stupid idea, so that doesn´t count as something positive. Everything that happened was predictable, there were episodes were literally nothing happened, for example the beach episode and the things that happened that you could mistake as a story were either never brought up again, or resolved pretty easiily. There was this unmanned mech that was rioting that I was talking about. That was the last conflict of the show (or rather the only one). I assumed that there was some big bad guy who was manipulating them, and well , I was kind of right, only that it wasn´t  bad guy, but the sister of Shinonono Houki (the woman who invented the mechs) who manipulated it to riot, so that her sister could defeat it and ... get famous, basically.So yeah, what I´m trying to say is, it was absolutely infuriating to watch. And I know that there is another season, they will probably introduce some bad guy there, but here it was like the writer gave up on something like a plot half way trough, then there were like three episodes were not a single one of the mechs was used but then at some point he remembered them, wrote some fight as a ""climactic"" ending and that´s it.My overall score is: 3/10Now, do I recommend this series? Well, if you like watching shitty shows to make fun of them afterwards, sure go for it.And for people who just started watching anime and who like harem action self insert shows, you might unironically enjoy it. If you haven´t seen many show, you won´t notice, that this show is a compilation of like every trope ever.If you´ve read this far, thanks for listening to me complaining about this show. Well, I´ll probably go and torture myself with Season 2 now.By the way, this was the first review I ever wrote, so I hope I was able to express my thoughts well enough. of what you could call story. 90% of this show is just our MC adding new members to his harem, lots of stupid ecchi scenes, and the harem members getting jealous at each other and fighting over MC-kun.

Well, I´ll probably go and torture myself with Season 2 now.By the way, this was the first review I ever wrote, so I hope I was able to express my thoughts well enough.', 'Why is it so insurmountable a task for series to avoid genre shifting? Honestly, if I wanted a dramatic turn of events with tears, shitty ""twists,"" and overwhelming boredom I\'d just go marathon a few hours of fart porn while eating yogurt and listening to Sabaton.The setup here is great. It\'s nothing new, exciting, or particularly interesting, but it\'s *entertaining* and that matters the most in my book. A guy in an all-girls school surrounded by man-starved lolis with half-mechas and co-ed dormitory hijinks. I don\'t really care if something is groundbreaking, only if I find it enjoyable to experience and can do so without...my eyes rolling so far back that they\'re greasing my butthole. And yeah, IS did that for half a dozen episodes.Aaaaaaand then it decided to toss off all the amusing scenarios with a Le Ebin Dramatic Series of Events where any notion of comedy is recycled into something so utterly dull I actually had to lock my cat out because she was getting agitated by my growing irritation. But I forced myself to finish because leaving things half done feels like eating glass tacos.Anyway, is it worth your time? Fucking no. Just like 95% of animes I watch, IS decides halfway through to become something else. I truly do not understand why writers and producers think this is fun or enjoyable, because it\'s god damn not. It\'s even more insulting to my time because everything leading up to the 180 was actually pretty good--especially some cool city/backdrop designs. my eyes rolling so far back that they\'re greasing my butthole.

It\'s even more insulting to my time because everything leading up to the 180 was actually pretty good--especially some cool city/backdrop designs.', ""Oh boy. Where do I begin with this mess.PLOT:Well, the first thing I want to address is that there's no plot. At all. In all 12 episodes, the characters go from fight to fight and problem to problem with no real connection between them until the very end. So, if you're looking for a plot that even exists, then don't bother, but very few harems have plots anyway.PROTAGONIST:The second biggest issue is the protagonist. Ichika is quite literally, the densest harem protagonist of them all. Every 5 seconds he's confused about either a concept he's learning in school or a hint one of the...many girls are trying to get through to him. He continuously misses it all, and it got frustrating after the first few times. This running gag must have went on for a few times every episode. At least. Let's also not forget that he's generic as all hell on top of that, and doesn't have any distinguishing qualities from the many bland harem protagonists out there.One point about Ichika's density that's important to mention is that the light novels later on point out that Ichika is doing this all on purpose so he doesn't get killed by the girls he doesn't choose. By playing dumb, it gives him a buffer. However, I see this as nothing more than a retcon. There are plenty of points where we can hear his thoughts and they clearly displayed Ichika being confused and not understanding the situation at all. If you've seen this point brought up in defense of this garbage show, don't listen to it. The retcon is sloppily done.Another point I don't understand is why all of the girls are into Ichika. Harem anime are usually choked to the brim with power fantasy, with the male MC showing off his power for the women so that they fawn over him. However, Ichika is generally not that powerful and doesn't have the 'stupid but powerful' trope that is commonly used. I'd say that this is what I appreciate the most about IS, that it doesn't give in to ALL of the common self insert tropes that these shows follow, but that just leads to other issues. The girls shouldn't be into Ichika at all, aside from Houki and Rin, who were both his childhood friends. Still, once they experience his density first hand, that old desire should disappear quickly.SECONDARY CHARACTERS:The harem isn't as bad as the protagonist, but it's still pretty damn bad. Most of the girls are basically all the same character after their introduction. They're from different countries and they all are hopelessly in love with Ichika. I also think their designs are all pretty damn generic except for the main girl, Houki. Something about her is a cut above the rest. That isn't to say that Houki's personality isn't as annoying as the rest of them, but at least she's the most appealing to look at.As I mentioned earlier, the entire harem shouldn't have any interest in Ichika. The power fantasy makes up for this gaping hole, but without it, the idea makes even less sense. I mean, I understand that these shows are designed for self insert, but it's still really lazy.IMPLICATIONS:There's an idea that this anime puts forward. Women are the only ones that can plot the IS, with Ichika being the only man in the world that can do so as well. Women are basically the ones who take control of the world because of this, and the anime never addresses this. What does it do with this concept? Puts a male in an all girls school and they all fall over him every second. That's what I call a lost opportunity.CONCLUSION:This anime takes a concept that could have had something to say and turned it into generic harem trash. There's no real plot and what happens in episode to episode are events we've seen in other anime a billion times over. many girls are trying to get through to him. He continuously misses it all, and it got frustrating after the first few times. This running gag must have went on for a few times every episode. At least. Let's also not forget that he's generic as all hell on top of that, and doesn't have any distinguishing qualities from the many bland harem protagonists out there.One point about Ichika's density that's important to mention is that the light novels later on point out that Ichika is doing this all on purpose so he doesn't get killed by the girls he doesn't choose. By playing dumb, it gives him a buffer. However, I see this as nothing more than a retcon. There are plenty of points where we can hear his thoughts and they clearly displayed Ichika being confused and not understanding the situation at all. If you've seen this point brought up in defense of this garbage show, don't listen to it. The retcon is sloppily done.Another point I don't understand is why all of the girls are into Ichika. Harem anime are usually choked to the brim with power fantasy, with the male MC showing off his power for the women so that they fawn over him. However, Ichika is generally not that powerful and doesn't have the 'stupid but powerful' trope that is commonly used. I'd say that this is what I appreciate the most about IS, that it doesn't give in to ALL of the common self insert tropes that these shows follow, but that just leads to other issues. The girls shouldn't be into Ichika at all, aside from Houki and Rin, who were both his childhood friends.

The long way to analyze this series however takes a little bit more ridicule. A convoluted and sporadic plot had different conflicts being introduced frequently and with a lack of an overall storyline that nearly begins to get on track but then falls off the rails into another unexplained sub story. Unfortunately, this anime also follows the widely known trope of a harem consisted of literally anyone that meets the main character, which again contributes to a confusing overall story as it pulls away from needed time to explain and...develop a cohesive plot. As for the main character himself, no real character development is ever truly accomplished. The Ichika from the beginning of the series is the same dense, overpowered, and self insert trope by the end of it. As for the art and animation, its average, nothing special to be said besides its extensive use of 3d models paired with 2d animation, which depending on the viewer can change ones perception of the show overall. Sound design and soundtrack are about the same as well, although the first season's opening was quite good. Ultimately, this show feels like a repeat of archetypes and characters that have been used time and time again across the genre and isn't a series necessary or worthy of your time to add to your watch history. develop a cohesive plot.

It\'s good so see some original content that brings the watcher into the anime to find out more about it. We get one genius (potentially a sexist too) who has created an exo-skeleton suit called IS (Infinite Stratos) that can only be piloted by woman, and thus split the world into two with women who are now the dominate gender, and the males who are classified as feeble, weak etc. And so enters our dense harem lead Ichika Orimura who...can for no reason at all pilot an IS and is forced to attend an IS Academy filled with girls to fill in the harem and ""one man, limitless girls"" quota that this anime brings to the table. The plot doesn\'t even try to touch on the subject of bringing equality back to the world, but focuses purely on one boy and his life around girls who are head over heels for him just because he\'s a boy.The characters, oh boy the characters of this anime are so cliche and generic. Our main boy and girls is a dense harem MC, a childhood friend, the boastful princess-type, the second childhood friend, the sweet and likable one and lastly the girl with no common sense. While I\'m on the subject, let me get the character Dub/Sub voices off my chest. The Sub is 100x better than the Dub. Why? The Subs sound more natural and doesn\'t seem to sound a bit racist. While in the Dubs, they have fake and poorly voiced accents for the main five harem girls, while the behind-the-scene characters such as the unnamed students are awfully voiced. They sound bland and emotionless without any true effort put into them. For example, one student in episode 2 sounded like a hippie. It\'s that awful.Moving on, the art and music are without a doubt really good with smooth 3D animations during IS screen time and return to the 2D animation afterwards. The opening and ending of this anime are cheerful, sung by female J-pop bands.In all, the anime can be enjoyed if you\'re a fan of mecha, harem, cliche comedy and really don\'t care about the characters. can for no reason at all pilot an IS and is forced to attend an IS Academy filled with girls to fill in the harem and ""one man, limitless girls"" quota that this anime brings to the table.

One can definitely see the appeal of girls doing silly antics over the boy they like while also fighting terrorist threats in very form-fitting mech suits. Unfortunately, that\'s just about all the appeal most people will find because as far as harem anime go, ""Infinite Stratos"" really is a cliche, and never manages to be any more than decent.Story (5.5/10):The series is set in the not-too-distant future, where women are now the dominant...gender i.e. the most powerful and influential people in the world are all women. The reason for this shift in power is the titular Infinite Stratos (IS for short) an extremely powerful mech suit that almost resulted in a nuclear war upon being created and, for some reason, can only be piloted by women. To manage this new weapon, a prestigious, multicultural school known as IS Academy has been set up in order to train girls who are most qualified to wield it. That\'s where the main character comes in in the form of Ichika Orimura, a 15-year-old everyman who, as fate would have it, is the first and only male able to pilot the machines, and has to attend the academy for his own protection.Okay, now, I say the world is women-dominated, but throughout the series, we\'re given very little evidence that this is actually the case. No authority figures are ever shown in the series and there\'s a really noticeable lack of world-building, as we never get to see much of the world outside the academy, so we\'re not given any real insight as to what this women-dominated society is actually like. We only have the characters\' word, and even that\'s only mentioned within a few minutes of the first episode and never brought up again. This is what it looks like when a series puts forward an interesting idea then does absolutely nothing with it. It\'s as though the writer just thought of the concept when he started writing the series but then conveniently abandoned it in the rest of the story, and that\'s a real shame.However, even beyond the wasted premise, there really isn\'t anything about this series that we haven\'t seen a hundred times. Pretty much any harem cliche that you can think of, chances are you\'ll find it. Don\'t get me wrong, though. There are some parts where good storytelling shines through, the World Purge-hen OVA being a notable example. The problem is that these parts are few and far between, and overall the story is something you should definitely take with a grain of salt.Art & Animation (8.5/10):Visually, ""Infinite Stratos"" doesn\'t look anything special on the surface. The characters are well-drawn but they don\'t really look better than anything else that came out around the same time. What looks brilliant, however, is the mech fights, which are really well-animated. Seriously, if there\'s one thing this series does right, it\'s knowing how to animate a good fight. There is plenty of CGI involved, but it\'s very well done and only serves to enhance the quality of the fights rather than diminish it.Sound & Dialogue (8/10):The music definitely isn\'t anything to write home about. It fits the series but there aren\'t many memorable tracks and they mostly just blend in. The openings are nice, though, and I will admit I found the time to listen to them rather than skip them. As far as the voice acting goes, the dub is noteworthy in that it has each of the foreign characters use their respective accents. The results are... mixed. Shannon Emerick and Tiffany Grant do great jobs as the French Charlotte and German Laura, but Brittney Karbowski doing the British Cecilia is not great, and easily rivals Black Star as one of her weakest performances. The Japanese characters are generally well-voiced, especially Houki, which is unsurprising given that it\'s Monica Rial.Characters (7/10):There isn\'t an awful lot to say about Ichika. As I said before, he\'s very much an everyman, being your typical nice guy who attracts the feelings of multiple girls. He\'s also very dense and makes some really bone-headed decisions. At the same time, though, he\'s not without redeeming moments and his determination is certainly nothing to scoff at. There are also hints that he\'s not as oblivious as he seems, with some even speculating that he\'s doing it on purpose, which is understandable given his situation. Ultimately, he gave me no real reason to love him but no real reason to hate him either. Instead, I was more-or-less neutral. If I were to pick a favourite character, it would have to be Houki Shinonono. Now, never mind the fact that she sets off two MAJOR cliche alarms (tsundere and childhood friend). While she does start off as quite a bitch, she mellows out completely by about halfway through the first season, and from then on only hits Ichika when he makes her really angry (which happens less often than you\'d think) or is about to do something really stupid i.e. she does what one does in any mech series. Additionally, through her past we see clearly that she\'s far from the most emotionally stable person you\'ll ever meet, so her tsundere nature is more justified than most. The ""World-Purge"" OVA sealed the deal for me, however, as through the girls\' fantasies we clearly see that regardless of how Houki may treat Ichika at times, she\'s clearly the best fit for him.Another noteworthy character is Charlotte Dunois, a transfer student from France. She is notable in that she is the kindest of the girls, with her main goal being to ensure Ichika\'s happiness instead of winning him over, though ironically she calls him a pervert more than any other girl, to the point that it\'s practically her catchphrase. While I didn\'t like her quite as much as Houki, she does come pretty damn close and the series would definitely be a lot worse without her in it. There\'s also Laura Bodewig, a very skilled IS pilot who was trained as a soldier her entire life and so has no social skills, to the point that she often says ridiculous things with a completely straight face- basically, she\'s like a female Sousuke Sagara, which makes her highly entertaining to listen to.If there\'s a character I didn\'t care for, it\'s Cecilia Alcott. Not only is her voice rather annoying, but she embodies pretty much every British stereotype you can think of- she\'s snooty, egotistical, has serious daddy issues and is terrible at cooking (there\'s even a scene early on when Ichika asks her how many times England has one the \'National Worst Cuisine Award\'). Another character I wasn\'t a fan of is Huang Lingyin, or Rin as everyone calls her, Ichika\'s second childhood friend who is even more violent than Houki, to the point of being a Yandere, something no-one seems to care about or even comment on. Even worse is that unlike Houki, she doesn\'t even have a reason for acting the way she does. Thankfully, both Rin and Cecilia decrease in prominence as time goes on, and by the second season have been demoted to ""those two girls"". Taking their places is the Sarashiki siblings, Tatenashi and Kanzashi, though the latter doesn\'t get introduced until halfway through the season, which is a shame as I found her to be the more interesting of the two.Enjoyment (7/10):In addition to being brilliantly animated, the mech battles are also highly entertaining... when they happen. Unfortunately, there are a few episodes that are dedicated to nothing but tasteless fanservice that add absolutely nothing to the series. There is plenty of comedy, but a lot of it is pretty mundane and repetitive, though there are some really funny moments to be found.Overall:Great mech fights notwithstanding, ""Infinite Stratos"" is average in almost every way. The story is forgettable and underdeveloped, the characters are likeable but not anything special and the sound is good but not fantastic. If you\'re one of those people who enjoys harem anime with all the typical cliches, or just really like awesome mech fights, then by all means jump right in. However, if you prefer anime with an actually good story or some form of originality, then this is a series that\'s best saved for a rainy day.Score:5.5+8.5+8+7+7=36/50=7.2/10 gender i.e. the most powerful and influential people in the world are all women.

Now, its certainly not the best one I have watched, but the amount of enjoyment I got out of it was unbelievable despite that. The whole series generally has a happy, jokey kinda mood, and all the characters are great, if not all that believable.Warning: Some spoilers may be contained belowStory:7The one thing IS was truly lacking in was a good story plot. While most animes spends maybe 7 or 8 eight episodes before letting you know who the series enemy was, IS didn't show the actual villains of the series until the second season....They also used rather predictable methods to add in new characters to the plot, and 1 or 2 predictable mini plot lines. However, at the same time, you didn't see some of the things coming too you, and the story generally made you laugh due to its craziness and predictableness, making up for its short comings.Art: 10If there was one thing IS excelled in, it was their art. Everything in the show looked amazing, from the mechs to the school, to the nature itself. Everything had time and effort put into it, and looked great because of it.Sound: 9IS had a great sound track, simply put. The music matched the show wonderfully for all scenes. The only problem was, I fell there was almost too much of it. But because it was very good choices for each scene, it was not too much of an issue. Also, the opening theme song of IS is great.Character: 8Now, I did character as an 8 for 1 purpose: Itcha, the main protagonist. The reason? He may just be mentally retarded. While I loved every other character in the story thoroughly, Itcha drove me mad on several occasions due tot the fact that he doesn't notice ANYTHING. literally. There is at least one instance an episode where he misses something huge, and its generally involving one of the girls being in love with him. Also, another small problem the plot had was 2 of the characters didn't actually have a backstory too them. While they did most of the characters rather well, they just happened to ignore 2 of them.Enjoyment: 10Despite all IS's short comings, I loved this show religiously. I loved all the humor, I loved how it looked, I loved all the quirky characters, I loved how it sounded, and I loved how it played out. And the mechs just made it all better. It was one of my all time favourite watches.Overall: 9Overall, Is was a very good anime to me. It had a rather nice plot, but didn't develop massively until season 2. It looked and sounded great. It had a large inventory of lovable characters, if some annoying at times. And finally, it was enjoyable. Massively. All in all, I recommend this anime to ANY harem or mecha fan. And if you love both, perfect! They also used rather predictable methods to add in new characters to the plot, and 1 or 2 predictable mini plot lines. However, at the same time, you didn't see some of the things coming too you, and the story generally made you laugh due to its craziness and predictableness, making up for its short comings.Art: 10If there was one thing IS excelled in, it was their art. Everything in the show looked amazing, from the mechs to the school, to the nature itself. Everything had time and effort put into it, and looked great because of it.Sound: 9IS had a great sound track, simply put. The music matched the show wonderfully for all scenes. The only problem was, I fell there was almost too much of it. But because it was very good choices for each scene, it was not too much of an issue. Also, the opening theme song of IS is great.Character: 8Now, I did character as an 8 for 1 purpose: Itcha, the main protagonist. The reason? He may just be mentally retarded. While I loved every other character in the story thoroughly, Itcha drove me mad on several occasions due tot the fact that he doesn't notice ANYTHING. literally. There is at least one instance an episode where he misses something huge, and its generally involving one of the girls being in love with him. Also, another small problem the plot had was 2 of the characters didn't actually have a backstory too them. While they did most of the characters rather well, they just happened to ignore 2 of them.Enjoyment: 10Despite all IS's short comings, I loved this show religiously. I loved all the humor, I loved how it looked, I loved all the quirky characters, I loved how it sounded, and I loved how it played out. And the mechs just made it all better.

Flying through the skies with a customized bot, along with tons of action and fanservice... how could it not be enjoyable? It most certainly has a Strike Witches-esque feel to it. And its English dub in particular was absolutely stellar with consideration when it was made (it was produced before Sentai Filmworks got good). I love the regional accents Sentai used for Cecilia, Laura and Charlotte.But there\'s one thing that absolutely bugged the living hell out of me. I\'m sure many of you would agree. It\'s the fact that Chifuyu called Ichika by HIS LAST NAME. Uh,...excuse me? They\'re siblings. No, not ""Cadet Orimura"" or anything similar like that (I probably wouldn\'t even be writing this if they incorporated that instead); JUST ORIMURA. Yeah, I get that Chifuyu\'s supposed to be strict and stuff, but what point is she trying to make here? Also, isn\'t she essentially referring to HERSELF? I mean, she\'s Orimura, too. It\'s absolutely dumb. It makes more sense if she called the others by their last name (which she did), but it makes ZERO sense for her to have done the same to Ichika, especially with consideration that she forfeited the second IS championship to save her brother from kidnappers. Actually, scratch that - if you\'re family, you use first names only. It irritates me even more when Chifuyu calls Laura by her first name, BUT NOT ICHIKA?! This is one thing that should have never been carried over to the dub. I mean, if the original JP is retarded, don\'t be retarded like them.It\'s also ludicrous that other people would refer to Ichika by his last name too, besides Chifuyu. I believe kid Hoki\'s speech quite practically echoes my thoughts here: ""Everyone here is called Shinonono; that\'s why it\'s confusing if you don\'t call me by my name!"" For whatever reason, did the function of first names completely fly over the characters\' heads? For the record, I wouldn\'t even be ranting about this IF Ichika is only addressed by first name (it really, really should have been that way). If there\'s one thing that\'s preventing me from enjoying the dub completely, it\'s what I\'ve just said. It\'s a damn shame, really. The acting is done so well...Overall rating: 6/10 (4 points deducted from carrying over retarded elements) excuse me? They\'re siblings.

But im the type of guy who likes this stuff but overdoing and implying it into a mecha driven storyline = you have one big mess. Thats what Infinite Statos was trying to achieve by giving the viewers fan service while keeping the mecha IS system, but failed ultimately in the end.If the author came at it with only mecha and a light heart fan service then I think this anime would have gone...far. But in reality they threw too much and the mecha mechanics went down the drain. Don't get me wrong, the mecha fights are still enjoyable but I found it lacking as the story progress and the story switches to which girl the guy chooses.

A not-too-distant future with mecha that can (mostly) only be piloted by women? The male protagonist has to face the difficulties that being the first male pilot thereof bring, while surrounded by attractive women? Sign me up, man. Unfortunately, Infinite Stratos is, in application, less concerned with the initial premise, and more concerned with crafting various scenarios that allow the ""harem"" aspect to really be shown. This is not necessarily damning in and of itself, but a few other problems prevent IS from being the series I think it had the potential...to be.The first fact is something that most viewers will find hard to deny: with a few notable exceptions, the vast majority of IS is fairly generic. Most of the girls who keep appearing to follow Ichika around fall into this category as well, having little characterization and undergoing strange personality shifts from their initial appearance. Some are hit by this harder than others, and one is actually fairly interesting and innovative (I thought her few episodes were probably the highlight of the show), but overall the setup is rather clichéd. Not bad, in and of itself, but definitely not new or developed to its full potential.Another problem I thought this series had was the (in my opinion) strange shift in tone that happened towards the end of the show. The ending, in my opinion, didn\'t really ""jive"" with the rest of the series and kind of sticks out as...not quite the same as the rest. It kind of seemed like the writers were trying to create a ""big finish"" for the season and the characters, but honestly I think something with less grandeur would have been okay if it pieced together better with the other 10 or so episodes.So, ordinarily I\'d give a show like Infinite Stratos something like a 6, for an overused scenario and (IMO) strange ending. However, the series was helped by many of its base aspects (nice art, great sound, a couple of interesting characters amid the mostly flat ones), and given that there were a couple of episode I really did enjoy, my final verdict is a 7, for ""incomplete overall, but with some attractive aspects"". If you\'re looking for a series that is going to draw you in with its complex plots and deep characters, Infinite Stratos isn\'t really going to suit you.

I stumbled upon it after googling Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, a manga which I find intriguing, fan fiction. I found the only entry was Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei: Infinite Stratos style. Now being the curious soul that I am, I typed it in to the search bar and clicked on the manga. After that I immediately watched the anime, which is in my opinion, a lot more clear and enjoyable than the manga. But now to the point, the review.Story-6The basis of the story is this: IS stands for Infinite Stratos and is a mecha like suit that...is employed for battle, and only women can operate it, except for Ichika Orimura. Now while this concept interested me, I quickly found out it was a harem manga, therefore eliminating most of my interest, as I have read and watched too many to be still entertained. The story is typical, it drags its feet at times but the battle scenes and small dilemmas kept me reading.Art and Sound-8Now I'm coming out with this right now, I am no expert when it comes to art design or sound quality. The art, I think, is quite beautiful, nothing completely amazing, but better than most. The sound also, particularly the voice acting, is great. Except if I had to take a shot for every time Cecilia and Charles broke accent, I wouldn't last 5 minutes.Character-7Ichika is a likable enough main character, he's straight forward, kind, and oblivious to the point of retardation (necessary for harem). Not really much else to say here other than a weird tendency to get misunderstood for liking his sister. The other characters are lackluster and quite typical: tsundere childhood friend, arrogant English woman, another tsundere childhood friend, and an awkward German lacking social skills. Now the only reason this did not plunge to a 2 is for one very cute French girl: Charlotte. She might as well have cut out my heart and ran away with it. I have never, ever, been so captivated with a character in all the manga and anime I have ever watched/read. I won't spoil anything, but some moments she and Ichika share are just too cute.Enjoyment-9I don't know why, (or maybe I do) but I have been engrossed with this anime. Sure the story and characters could use some work, but just some of the moments in the anime make it quite enjoyable to watch.Overall-7Mediocre story and characters (except for one), great art and sound, and overall quite enjoyable, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to just enjoy anime and this short series. is employed for battle, and only women can operate it, except for Ichika Orimura. Now while this concept interested me, I quickly found out it was a harem manga, therefore eliminating most of my interest, as I have read and watched too many to be still entertained. The story is typical, it drags its feet at times but the battle scenes and small dilemmas kept me reading.Art and Sound-8Now I'm coming out with this right now, I am no expert when it comes to art design or sound quality. The art, I think, is quite beautiful, nothing completely amazing, but better than most. The sound also, particularly the voice acting, is great. Except if I had to take a shot for every time Cecilia and Charles broke accent, I wouldn't last 5 minutes.Character-7Ichika is a likable enough main character, he's straight forward, kind, and oblivious to the point of retardation (necessary for harem). Not really much else to say here other than a weird tendency to get misunderstood for liking his sister. The other characters are lackluster and quite typical: tsundere childhood friend, arrogant English woman, another tsundere childhood friend, and an awkward German lacking social skills.

When i first saw this anime, I was thinking of the traditional harem (just from the cover of the OVA) ..But then I watched it...It felt like.. WOW.. A whole new world of shounen anime has opened up before me. Everything was good. The character, the plot, the overall art is just outstanding. Everything is all in place, and the girls' appearances are just enough to make Houki envious of them. This is one of my most favorite animes. But then, even a very good masterpiece also has major flaws, that I wish, would be included in season 2. Like, when...Rin and Ichika were being attacked by an unmanned IS. Who have sent that? I wish some people would have known, but then, there are some things that are meant to be a secret and then be revealed later in season 2. But then again, this show is just so good. Oh, and I wonder why didn;t Laura win? Also, this is one of the animes that had the unnoticed girl win, and not the best girl. (Too bad for me,though) Rin and Ichika were being attacked by an unmanned IS. Who have sent that?

(Too bad for me,though)"", ""Warning possible SpoilersInfinite Stratos is that harem that is kinda in the middle for me mainly because there are about the same amount things I like and don't like about it, at least for a Mecha it was alright.The story begins with Ichika Orimura who has been discovered as the only male to pilot an IS so he goes to the Infinite Stratos Academy to learn how to use one and while he's there he meets all kinds of interesting female IS pilots.Now for the first series there isn't really much of a story other than Ichika learning about the IS and introducing the main...female characters so that the harem can be created, but what was interesting with the characters in this show is that they actually included different countries like Britain, Germany, France and China alongside Japan and I have to give a bit of credit for the dub actors trying to personalise these accents even though it can be a bit cringy, but it was a good effort nonetheless.It was pretty interesting how the IS units worked and that they can be only used in combat until the shields run out along with the different variety of IS units that other countries have been making so they can out compete each other and along with Ichika and the others training with the IS units too which were always mixed results of either failure or improvement.Considering this is a Harem too the female characters always argue with each other, but it they do start to become more friendly rivals rather than trying to kill each other over the course of the series and some of their moments trying to out do each other were pretty funny sometimes.Now there is a large selection of characters, but the characters in this show were really mixed for me since there were some I liked and some I disliked.Ichika is definitely the most dense Harem Protagonist I've seen because even though he tries his absolute best to protect the girls whenever they try to make a move on him or flirt with he just doesn't get the picture and it always annoyed the hell out of me, surprisingly though he isn't the worst harem protagonist I've seen.Houki Shinonono is the first female MC and out of all the girls in this show she is the worst, now usually I can tolerate Tsunderes, but Houki was pretty much whining most of the time and seemed like she was always in a bad mood unless she was alone with Ichika and even then she was still pretty annoying.Cecillia Alcott is the second female MC and she is the Brit of the group and despite being a rich girl who thinks she's superior to the others she can have a sweet side making her slightly more likeable than Houki at least, however she is a bad cook and even if you try her sandwiches you'll somehow die.Lingyin Huang or Lin for short is the third female MC and she is the Chinese representative of the group, she is a more hyper Tsundere and can be almost as annoying as Houki sometimes, but thanks to her hyper nature she isn't and settles for second worst, she like Houki is one of Ichika's childhood friends.Charlotte Dunois is the fourth main female MC and the French representative of the group, she is actually more sweeter and kinder compared to the other girls making her very likeable, but when she was introduced she had to pretend to be a boy because of family issues until Ichika discovered her secret.Laura Bodewig the fifth and final member of the harem is the German representative of the group, Laura was friggin awesome despite starting out hating Ichika because his sister Chifuyu trained her a couple of years ago she wanted to beat him to impress Chifuyu until her IS malfunctioned and Ichika had to save her, after that she became a more friendly person to the other girls, but because she was a military girl she didn't really understand a lot of the things in Japan and whenever she tried to get closer with Ichika she mainly blushed making her an adorable badass.The artstyle was ok I liked the design of the IS units and how each was different for the female characters as they varied in size, armaments and even colour, the IS academy looked pretty cool definitely a place I would like to go to so I can train in a Mecha suit and the uniforms aren't too bad either as they can also be different depending on the persons style.I thought the action was alright not amazing, but it got the job done even though most of the time it's the girls and Ichika fighting each other along with a few robot IS suits attacking them, it was interesting seeing the girls and Ichika using their IS unit's weapons and abilities to outsmart their opponent.The comedy was actually funny sometimes, although whenever the girls fought each other over Ichika is was always mixed because sometimes it felt annoying whereas other times it was actually funny.There is bit's and pieces of fanservice too even though there isn't an Ecchi tag there definitely should be especially if you're going to show your female characters in the shower or showing off their swim suits at the beach which definitely requires the use of an Ecchi tag.Overall this wasn't a pretty ok Mecha/Harem anime and compared to other Harems I've seen it's definitely one of the more likeable ones so if you're interested in seeing girls from different countries fighting over a dense protagonist in mecha suits then you might enjoy this. female

friggin MC is more dense than uranium and more oblivious than a slowpoke that it actually makes it hilarious to watch. The show can be so predictable with it\'s tropes and stereotypes; at times I found myself literally saying the characters\' lines right before they\'d say them. Don\'t get me wrong though, that\'s why it\'s such a fun watch.Depending on which kind of a person you are, you\'ll do one of two things while watching this show.1. Turn the show off and get away from the frustration that this MC can evoke from deep within your very soul; leaving your face bleeding from the...numerous atomic facepalms you will endure.2. Make you die of laughter from the sheer stupidity of the plot, characters and dialogue. (That\'s me.)As for the actual reasoning behind my score, the characters and plot are like an unsalvageable burning trainwreck due to their one dimensional depth and their aforementioned predictability. The animation, sound design and music are all fairly par for the course, with the exception of the CG surprisingly working out fairly well in my opinion.That leaves the fan-service which isn\'t gratuitous in terms of what you get to see; however it is made up for in the variously sexually suggestive acts that the girls attempt. Speaking of the girls, they\'re all pretty much stereotypes that fall in love with the MC for a convoluted reason that is ultimately insignificant. Otherwise, you\'ve got plenty of stereotypes to chose from the ""best-girl bin"" so you should be fine.Truth be told though, the best way to enjoy this show is that you should absolutely, under no circumstances, take this show with any seriousness. In doing this you will enjoy playing spot-the-trope bingo and elevate your powers of prediction to an unforseen level. If you can\'t do this then I\'m afraid you will not enjoy the clueless MC that\'s more thick than an anime mother\'s thighs cooking porridge. Hope you enjoy! numerous atomic facepalms you will endure.2. Make you die of laughter from the sheer stupidity of the plot, characters and dialogue.

Hope you enjoy!', 'Infinite Stratos is based on a Light Novel series with a same name. It tried to hook in viewers by its promising premise.Which in the end, it delivers. Kinda.Story - 6/10The plot revolves around a robot-suit-weapon thingy they call Infinite Stratos, or just IS. The catch is, only women can pilot them. Which resulted a change of gender roles in society.The story starts with Orimura Ichika, a boy who somehow can make an IS move. He was then forced to transfer into IS Academy, the place where they train future IS pilots.Because of the previous catch, all of his schoolmates are girls. So yeah. You...know where this is going.If you come to watch this in hope for some kind of Action-packed Mecha story with School Life thrown in the middle, thus creating a balanced story,... you\'re wrong. Dead wrong.Most of the things that happens onscreen are pure Harem material. Bad Harem materials too, at that. When there is some Mecha action, it\'s usually just a student tournament or some unexplained anonymous hostile robot that went haywire.Also the fanservice. It\'s so much, it annoys me.Oh, and they also tried their hands on the comedy aspect. It didn\'t go wellAnd the Finale still have some unanswered questions. Which I\'m not gonna list because it\'ll be a bit spoiler-yOverall, it could have been betterArt - 7/10There\'s nothing much to comment on the art style. Not too shabby, but not too fancy too.But what catches the eyes most are the ISes\' 3D models, which are well done. They fit into the background without looking out of place.The battle scenes a quite good too. There are a few recycled scenes, but they never really bugged me.Sound - 6/10The sound is on the average side. Nothing much to note.Character - 4/10This is one of the flaws of this series. THEM CHARACTERS!!Ichika is your official, by the book, clueless nice Harem protagonist. What\'s out of the book about him, is his level of by-the-book-ness.Seriously, this guy is so bland and clueless, it almost hurts. He somehow doesn\'t notice that the girls like him.Even though one of them kissed him the other day and was on bed with him, (nothing R-rated though) he was still acting without any kind of self-awareness, to the point where i was like ""is he gay or something?""But really, if he was gay, they might as well as change the whole cast into guys and it would make much more watchable series.And now the girls...Houki is the childhood friend. And a typical Tsundere. Nothing much to say about her.Cecilia is the Princess-type. She\'s initially annoyed by Ichika, but grew to like him quickly. Nothing much too.""Oh you know what\'s better than a childhood friend?! TWO childhood friends!"" That\'s probably what the author was thinkingThen there\'s Ling or Rin, i don\'t know, the sub differs form episode to another. She\'s this second childhood friend, also a bit Tsundere. But she is mostly overshadowed by Houki, because she appeared first.Then there\'s Charlotte. She attended the Academy as a guy. Which was of course, found out immediately by Ichika. So she\'s the Reverse-TrapAnd finally, Laura. She\'s actually interesting. But as time goes, she turned into a bland character.Most of the supporting characters are really forgettable. Like the glasses teacher with big boobs, i forgot her name. And Chifuyu, Ichika\'s older sister.Overall - 6/10Infinite Stratos is a generic School Life Harem story masked with the face of Action premise. Whether you love or hate this, depends on your initial hope when you started watchingIf you didn\'t expect much, you\'ll probably be satisfiedBut if you\'re one of those poor souls, like me, who expects many action, you\'ll be thoroughly dissapointed know where this is going.If you come to watch this in hope for some kind of Action-packed Mecha story with School Life thrown in the middle, thus creating a balanced story,... you\'re wrong.

What does it mean? Simple - think of the most stereotypical stereotype of harem anime and this is it. Single male protagonist surrounded by nothing but cute girls, a dumb protagonist (and not just oblivious, I mean literally dumb), childhood friends, it\'s all here. Though at the same time the show is actually quite pleasant, if forgettable.The protagonist, Ichika, is the sole male in an all female environment and, obviously, all the girls (I mean 100% of them) have the hots for him. Obviously, he\'s utterly and completely oblivious to this. He\'s also a...dumbass and not really that OP in the end. So your best bet is to block him out and focus on the rest of the cast.And it is a quite nice and likeable cast, albeit typical. You got one bushi tsun childhood friend, you got an oujousama (with an oddly high pitched voice for this type of character - actually a good choice for some reason), you got another childhood friend with a Chinese restaurant (because that\'s all the Chinese ever do, obviously), an uptight German (one that they couldn\'t decide if they were making a loli or not at that), and so on. There\'s also a bunch of support characters (the ditzy busty teacher, the strict Ichika\'s older sister, Rin\'s sister etc) but the main focus is on the leading 5 girls (yes, 5, I omitted one to avoid spoilers for thr sake of avoiding spoilers because you see that one a mile away). Obviously they are bickering and trying to get in Ichika\'s pants for reasons I can\'t comprehend (did I mention he\'s a dumbass?) but at least they are good on the eyes and stuff. Especially in the obligatory swimsuits, hyeh hyeh.As a mecha anime there is some combat but not a lot and not particularly impressive. To be honest, the opening battle (which is a spoiler btw and is expanded upon later in the show) is the most exciting of all. They\'re fine, but you won\'t be biting your nails in excitement. There isn\'t really all that much fighting as the series focuses more on characters and interactions rather than mechas and combat. Good news is there isn\'t all that much fanservice either. Of course there\'re some bath or beach scenes but nowhere near the obnoxious T&A shots of other shows, which is actually a nice change.Visuals-wise the anime is okay. I liked the art style and character designs so I enjoyed looking at it as well as watching. A pinch of your typical ""meh"" CGI here and there.The opening theme is fine but unimpressive. The ending theme is quite catchy and I liked the credits animation with Ichika & Co just running. At least until the addition of Laura in her Wehrmacht pants. The rest of the sound track is ""there"" and I recall none of it despite having watched the series just recently, which means it\'s unmemorable. Voice acting is fine as well, nothing extraordinary in either positive or negative.So it\'s pretty clear by now, considering the abundance of ""okay"" and ""fine"", that this is a pretty mediocre anime. Nothing that will knock your socks off. But when you see it for what it is, a typical harem anime with some mechas, you just might enjoy it. I know I did, thus I will give it a 7/10, which might be a bit generous but I don\'t consider my time spent with it totally wasted. dumbass and not really that OP in the end.

There are some times I\'ll give it to him where he saves someone and I\'m like ""Oh that was cool I guess"" but almost ALL the time he\'s completely blind to the surroundings he\'s in. His lack of sense for the females as he goes as well is like looking at a 10 year trying to get his first kiss on the playground surrounded by a group of people egging him on.

In fact, if you really try shut your brain and watch it, Infinite Stratos is kidda okay and decent anime which most moment are laughable. Main character is mediocre Ichika Orimura good looking and good in sociable with woman and good in house work which very difficult apply in off from realistic . He being allow into their IS pilot academy for some circumstances and despite all are girls. Overseas  also able to apply IS pilot academy there. I think...one of the best character is Charlotte Dunois which is a french girl which showing her french style and I like both japanese and english dub for her character. Others female kidda simple and predictable, Chifuyu Orimura as a most responsible elder sister, Cecilia Alcott as a attention seeker, Houki Shinonono as a strong woman and care for Inchika Orimura and Huang Lingyin as a childhood friend of main male charater and others...Story is mediocre and predictable towards the end and there is nothing much except you can laugh if it it funny. I mean relationship of character over shine or more important than IS pilot, art style is decent, sound is really mediocre. The only I really enjoy is about each female unique characteristic, no less no more. Overall I think is still a fun anime to watch if your expectation is low or shut your brain have a good time to enjoy.

The production is a surprisingly brisk and a refreshing take on the harem genre. Before watching this series, I thought this sub-category had outstayed its welcome in the industry and had done everything that it could possibly do, in the two decades that it was prevalent (1990 to 2010); but, alas, I underestimated...the power of Japan\'s ardor for mechanized, power armor!⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersBefore watching this series, I thought to myself ""is this series just going to have a cast full of tired bishōjo archetypes?"" Nope! Every character is quirky and interesting, in their own way, and one of the most interesting parts of the plot is actually the protagonist! Typically harem protagonists are meek-milled, too kind-hearted, or just wants to sleep with ALL of the women vying for his attention—this isn\'t the case with Ichika. The fact of the matter is, he\'s just plain stupid. And it\'s really funny, a lot of the humor is played off of him being earnest, but implausibly dense!From all of the harem series that I\'ve seen, I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a character that was written to be purposely slow-witted! Ichika\'s seiyū, Kōki Uchiyama, is so good at making his empty-headedness, both, hilarious and endearing! One of my favorite scenes in the series, is in either the last episode or the second to last episode, while Ichika is in a trippy, dream realm. Characters are usually scared and stolid in this situation, but Ichika lets out the most stupid-sounding ""huh"" and I nearly cried from laughter! Such a priceless character—move over, Kazuma Satō (""Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku o!""), Ichika\'s performance in the first season of Infinite Stratos is a feat of comedic genius!With that aside, all the girls are incredibly likable and have an extra layer of dimension to their personalities: the ""childhood friend"" is more than another Akari Kamigishi (""To Heart""), the ""Chinese childhood friend"" is more than another Meiling Li (""Cardcaptor Sakura""), the ""※mysterious, exchange student"" is more than another Karen Kujō (""Kiniro Mosaic""), the ""ojō-sama"" is more than another Saki Tenjōin (""To LOVEる""), the ""militaristic kūdere"" is more than another MISAKA 10032 (""Toaru Majutsu no Index""), etc! Each girl have a few layers, that get peeled back, upon their reveal. Character traits that seem like they would jump out of the panels of a Tenchi Muyō, often are later blindsided by one of the girl\'s traits, that has nothing to do with their object of affection!※Madoka☆Magica also subverted the ""mysterious, exchange student"" archetype. Weirdly enough, they both aired in 2011!There is an amount of intrigue: both with the past of Ichika\'s hard-ass, older sister... as well as Hōki\'s eccentric, genius scientist of an onee-san! The power gauges of their mechanized exoskeletons are brought into a climactic peak, in the series, when the question is broached: could these machines with infinite capabilities, also be utilized to destabilize the world? I also found it it interesting that the story incorporated students of all different nationalities, to represent the fact that only a certain amount of machines are allotted to each country! The stereotype of male mecha pilots is also subverted, in a futuristic setting where only females can pilot the exoskeletons! I grew up with a lot of Yoshiyuki Tomino\'s shows and the earlier ones echo the sentiment that women are unable to properly pilot a Gundam (see the original ""Kidō Senshi Gundam"" for examples of this); so, seeing that trope flipped on its head was a breath of fresh air! Ichika is essentially in a ""※Vandread""-like situation, with all of his potential girlfriends!※In the world of ""Vandread,"" men and women are completely segregated, so the protagonist is in a blunder, when he is then trapped onboard a ship full of all females!The character writing is comparable to Kimetsu no Yaiba, none of the cast has subdued psychological tics or deep inflictions that they\'re struggling with; all of them are just well-established characters, who know who they are and what they want. And I don\'t think there\'s anything wrong with that! It\'s not for everyone, but I find the simplicity to be attractive; especially, as someone who has a parabolic way of thinking and often gets trapped in their own thoughts! The characters are all charming and funny, there are cool mecha-suits... sometimes, something like that (coupled with a large stroke of craftsmanship), is all I need.Now for the coverage of the OVA, ""Koi ni Kogareru Rokujūsō""! This is the summer episode; no, not the beach-special with every girl in a bikini! No, no, no! This one is actually a wholesome one, where Hōki and Ichika go to study at Cecilia\'s house, during their summer vacation in an intense amount of sweltering heat—angry sparks are flying between the two girls and Ichika is, of course, completely oblivious to it. The episode ends with Hōki and Ichika having a romantic reminiscence, during a fireworks festival. Really basic, but the characters were still wonderful, and the ending was genuinely heart-warming!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Yasuhito Kikuchi (director, storyboard), notable works:* Busō Shinki* Comet Lucifer* El Hazard: The Alternative World* Kachō-Ōji (""Black Heaven"") ✅* Kage (OVA)* Kurogane Communication* Macross Frontier (eps 1 and 2) ✅* Saint Seiya ✅* Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken (""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"")Commentary: Amazing director—the visual iconography in Kachō-Ōji, Macross Frontier, and Saint Seiya were all lush and visually appealing! I have heard splendid things about Kurogane Connection, too! Despite this anime being a harem (with an academic setting), Mr. Kikuchi was able to make every scene memorable, exciting, and equally as captivating as some of his other series! Exceptional director, without him and some of the other staff, I\'m sure this series wouldn\'t have been as impactful!I must add that this series had THREE sound directors working on it: Tōru Kanegae, Masafumi Mima, and Toshihiko Nakajima. As you could have guessed, the sound effect were very crisp and clean, they were often awesome aides during the comedic moments, as well as realistic-sounding audio work, during the mecha-suit battles!Tomoyasu Kurashima (storyboard, character design), notable works:* Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu (""Sky of Iriya, Summer of UFO"")* Kakyūsei 2: Hitomi no Naka no Shōjo-tachi* Mizuiro (2003)Commentary: Mr. Kurashima is mostly known for doing designs for visual novel adaptations, but I really appreciated his sense of style in this series! The character appearances fit really with the flow of the animation! Wonderful job; he needs more work!Takeshi Takakura (mechanical design), notable works:* .hack//Quantum* Abenobashi Mahō☆Shōtengai ✅* Appleseed: Ex Machina* Aquarion Evol* Astro Boy (2003) ✅* Bubuki Buranki (""BBK/BRNK"")* Captain Earth ✅* ※Chōjikū Robo Meguru* eX-Driver* Galaxy Angel ✅* Geneshaft* Heat Guy J* Macross Frontier ✅* Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyō no Alderamin (""Alderamin on the Sky"") ✅* Neppū Kairiku Bushi Road (""Burning Wind Ocean Earth Samurai Lord"")* Nihon Animator Mihonichi (""Japan Animator Expo,"" ep 35) ✅* Norn9* Planetes ✅* Samurai Gun ✅* Sōsei no Aquarion ✅* Tactical Roar※Someone please acquire this OVA and translate it. A Brain\'s Base animation, with Marina Inōe and Kana Asumi in the voicing roles, and Keiji Gotō (the director of ""Kiddy Grade"")! Not to mention that Shōji Yonemura (a legendary script writer—penned the screenplays for HeartCatch PreCure and the 2011 version of Hunter x Hunter)! We need this as much as we need ufotable\'s 東方Project anime!Commentary: Mr. Takakura is prolific mechanical designer. For a long time, I have really liked the visual aesthetic of a human wearing a suit of armor, rather than actually ""piloting"" it. Examples of this are things like ""Rideback"" and ""Busō Shinki,"" even series like ""KanColle"" convey elements of a human merged with a machine! I especially loved his mechanical designs in ""Macross Frontier"" and ""Planetes""!Kōki Uchiyama as Ichika Orimura, notable roles:* Seiya Kanie, Amagi Brilliant Park ✅* Kagura Demuri, Aquarion Evol* Takumi Harada, Battery* Tōmura Shigaraki, Boku no Hero Academia ✅* Dio Weinberg Junyō, Buddy Complex ✅* Kimimaro Yoga, C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control* Yū Otosaka, Charlotte ✅* Akira Fudō, Devilman: Crybaby ✅* Shin, Evil or Live* Shirō Kotomine (""The Master of Red Assassin""), Fate/Aprocrypha ✅* Ikuya Kirishima, Free! ✅* Momo Sakaki, Fukumenkei Noise (""Anonymous Noise"")* Kei Tsukishima, Haikyū!! ✅* Izumi Miyamura, Horimiya* Gin, Hotarubi no Mori e ✅* Meruem, Hunter x Hunter (2011) ✅* Takashi Andō, Ikebukuro West Gate Park* Ulgar Zweig, Kanata no Astra (""Astra Lost in Space"") ✅* Rui, Kimetsu no Yaiba ✅* Yūta Asaba, Kimi to Boku.* Takumi Sakagami, Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda.

His voice is so versatile, depending on which character he plays, he can be a harebrained protagonist one second and a psychotic killer the next! His role as Ichika was very funny, it brings to mind his role as Seiya Kanie (""Amagi Brilliant Park""). Mr. Uchiyama makes Ichika\'s brainlessness come across as earnest, but also cues the audience in on how truly thoughtless the character is! It\'s great, the performance made me burst out laughing a few times!Yōko Hikasa as Hōki Shinonono, notable roles:* Hana Suguruno, 7 Seeds* Hibiki Tenshō, Aikatsu Friends!: Kagayaki no Jewel* Nanako Saeki, Aku no Hana ✅* Tio Clarce, Arifureta Shokugyō de Sekai Saikyō (""Arifureta: From Commonplace to World\'s Strongest"")* Tomoe Udagawa, BanG Dream ✅* Farnese de Vandimion, Berserk ✅* Fighter, Bikini Warriors* Erica Blandelli, Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō ✅* Kiyono Amahara, Chu-Bra!!* Ayano Kōsaka, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Sakura Sakurakōji, Code:Breaker* Kyōko Kirigiri, Danganronpa ✅* Sakie Satō, Demi-chan wa Kataritai (""Interviews With Monster Girls"") ✅* Brioche d\'Arquien, Dog Days* Hina Tachibana, Domestic no Kanojo* Freya, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅* Ao Gennai, Frame Arms Girl* Kei Kugimiya, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Aya Akabane, Gokujo* Miu Osawa, Hagure Yūsha no Aesthetica* Kurumi, Hal* Emi Yusa, Hataraku Maō-sama!

While the foil typically plays nothing but perfect, pure characters... Ms. Hikasa plays more than a handful of evil characters, demons, and even Satan herself! Her characters are typically more on the mature or sultry side, but despite this, Yōko Hikasa can still pull off a hell of a straightforward, childhood friend character!

Ms. Inōe was great at illustrating Laura\'s internal struggles and making the character have dual sides of her personality!

Chifuyu is no different—she\'s the big-breasted homeroom teacher, as well as Ichika\'s 24-year-old sister! She is said to be the strongest ""IS"" pilot to have ever lived, and is as much of a stoic badass, like Solid Snake in the Metal Gear franchise. Ms. Toyoguchi employs a mixture of her Sei Satō (""Maria-sama ga Miteru"") and Ellen Kurokawa (""Suite PreCure♪"") voices, to create a character that is a force to be reckoned with! Great work!Other notable seiyū talents: Makoto Yasumura (Johnny Beppu in ""Aikatsu""), Mai Kadowaki (Illyasviel von Einzbern in ""Fate/stay night""), and Yukari Tamura (Suzuha Amane in ""Steins;Gate"").Infinite Stratos isn\'t for everyone, but there are those who do really like it, and will buy the figure of their best ""waifu"" to mount on their shelf. Your level of enjoyment depends on if you\'re looking for something serious/deep, or just a carefree gander with cool fight scenes. I would recommend the Japanese dub of the show, because it has an all-star cast, and I fear some of the appeal might get lost in translation. For me, Infinite Stratos was such a pleasurable experience, so much so, that I will rate it a 7/10! Good stuff! Haven\'t seen the second season yet—I hope the quality doesn\'t decline, like with the second TV series of Rō-Kyū-Bu!Rankings:IS: Infinite Stratos (Season One) ★★★★☆IS: Infinite Stratos Encore ""Koi ni Kogareru Rokujūsō"" (OVA) is a ★★★★☆ the power of Japan\'s ardor for mechanized, power armor!⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersBefore watching this series, I thought to myself ""is this series just going to have a cast full of tired bishōjo archetypes?"" Nope! Every character is quirky and interesting, in their own way, and one of the most interesting parts of the plot is actually the protagonist! Typically harem protagonists are meek-milled, too kind-hearted, or just wants to sleep with ALL of the women vying for his attention—this isn\'t the case with Ichika. The fact of the matter is, he\'s just plain stupid. And it\'s really funny, a lot of the humor is played off of him being earnest, but implausibly dense!From all of the harem series that I\'ve seen, I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a character that was written to be purposely slow-witted! Ichika\'s seiyū, Kōki Uchiyama, is so good at making his empty-headedness, both, hilarious and endearing! One of my favorite scenes in the series, is in either the last episode or the second to last episode, while Ichika is in a trippy, dream realm. Characters are usually scared and stolid in this situation, but Ichika lets out the most stupid-sounding ""huh"" and I nearly cried from laughter! Such a priceless character—move over, Kazuma Satō (""Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku o!""), Ichika\'s performance in the first season of Infinite Stratos is a feat of comedic genius!With that aside, all the girls are incredibly likable and have an extra layer of dimension to their personalities: the ""childhood friend"" is more than another Akari Kamigishi (""To Heart""), the ""Chinese childhood friend"" is more than another Meiling Li (""Cardcaptor Sakura""), the ""※mysterious, exchange student"" is more than another Karen Kujō (""Kiniro Mosaic""), the ""ojō-sama"" is more than another Saki Tenjōin (""To LOVEる""), the ""militaristic kūdere"" is more than another MISAKA 10032 (""Toaru Majutsu no Index""), etc! Each girl have a few layers, that get peeled back, upon their reveal. Character traits that seem like they would jump out of the panels of a Tenchi Muyō, often are later blindsided by one of the girl\'s traits, that has nothing to do with their object of affection!※Madoka☆Magica also subverted the ""mysterious, exchange student"" archetype. Weirdly enough, they both aired in 2011!There is an amount of intrigue: both with the past of Ichika\'s hard-ass, older sister... as well as Hōki\'s eccentric, genius scientist of an onee-san! The power gauges of their mechanized exoskeletons are brought into a climactic peak, in the series, when the question is broached: could these machines with infinite capabilities, also be utilized to destabilize the world? I also found it it interesting that the story incorporated students of all different nationalities, to represent the fact that only a certain amount of machines are allotted to each country! The stereotype of male mecha pilots is also subverted, in a futuristic setting where only females can pilot the exoskeletons! I grew up with a lot of Yoshiyuki Tomino\'s shows and the earlier ones echo the sentiment that women are unable to properly pilot a Gundam (see the original ""Kidō Senshi Gundam"" for examples of this); so, seeing that trope flipped on its head was a breath of fresh air! Ichika is essentially in a ""※Vandread""-like situation, with all of his potential girlfriends!※In the world of ""Vandread,"" men and women are completely segregated, so the protagonist is in a blunder, when he is then trapped onboard a ship full of all females!The character writing is comparable to Kimetsu no Yaiba, none of the cast has subdued psychological tics or deep inflictions that they\'re struggling with; all of them are just well-established characters, who know who they are and what they want. And I don\'t think there\'s anything wrong with that! It\'s not for everyone, but I find the simplicity to be attractive; especially, as someone who has a parabolic way of thinking and often gets trapped in their own thoughts! The characters are all charming and funny, there are cool mecha-suits... sometimes, something like that (coupled with a large stroke of craftsmanship), is all I need.Now for the coverage of the OVA, ""Koi ni Kogareru Rokujūsō""! This is the summer episode; no, not the beach-special with every girl in a bikini! No, no, no! This one is actually a wholesome one, where Hōki and Ichika go to study at Cecilia\'s house, during their summer vacation in an intense amount of sweltering heat—angry sparks are flying between the two girls and Ichika is, of course, completely oblivious to it. The episode ends with Hōki and Ichika having a romantic reminiscence, during a fireworks festival. Really basic, but the characters were still wonderful, and the ending was genuinely heart-warming!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Yasuhito Kikuchi (director, storyboard), notable works:* Busō Shinki* Comet Lucifer* El Hazard: The Alternative World* Kachō-Ōji (""Black Heaven"") ✅* Kage (OVA)* Kurogane Communication* Macross Frontier (eps 1 and 2) ✅* Saint Seiya ✅* Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken (""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"")Commentary: Amazing director—the visual iconography in Kachō-Ōji, Macross Frontier, and Saint Seiya were all lush and visually appealing! I have heard splendid things about Kurogane Connection, too! Despite this anime being a harem (with an academic setting), Mr. Kikuchi was able to make every scene memorable, exciting, and equally as captivating as some of his other series! Exceptional director, without him and some of the other staff, I\'m sure this series wouldn\'t have been as impactful!I must add that this series had THREE sound directors working on it: Tōru Kanegae, Masafumi Mima, and Toshihiko Nakajima. As you could have guessed, the sound effect were very crisp and clean, they were often awesome aides during the comedic moments, as well as realistic-sounding audio work, during the mecha-suit battles!Tomoyasu Kurashima (storyboard, character design), notable works:* Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu (""Sky of Iriya, Summer of UFO"")* Kakyūsei 2: Hitomi no Naka no Shōjo-tachi* Mizuiro (2003)Commentary: Mr. Kurashima is mostly known for doing designs for visual novel adaptations, but I really appreciated his sense of style in this series! The character appearances fit really with the flow of the animation! Wonderful job; he needs more work!Takeshi Takakura (mechanical design), notable works:* .hack//Quantum* Abenobashi Mahō☆Shōtengai ✅* Appleseed: Ex Machina* Aquarion Evol* Astro Boy (2003) ✅* Bubuki Buranki (""BBK/BRNK"")* Captain Earth ✅* ※Chōjikū Robo Meguru* eX-Driver* Galaxy Angel ✅* Geneshaft* Heat Guy J* Macross Frontier ✅* Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyō no Alderamin (""Alderamin on the Sky"") ✅* Neppū Kairiku Bushi Road (""Burning Wind Ocean Earth Samurai Lord"")* Nihon Animator Mihonichi (""Japan Animator Expo,"" ep 35) ✅* Norn9* Planetes ✅* Samurai Gun ✅* Sōsei no Aquarion ✅* Tactical Roar※Someone please acquire this OVA and translate it. A Brain\'s Base animation, with Marina Inōe and Kana Asumi in the voicing roles, and Keiji Gotō (the director of ""Kiddy Grade"")! Not to mention that Shōji Yonemura (a legendary script writer—penned the screenplays for HeartCatch PreCure and the 2011 version of Hunter x Hunter)! We need this as much as we need ufotable\'s 東方Project anime!Commentary: Mr. Takakura is prolific mechanical designer. For a long time, I have really liked the visual aesthetic of a human wearing a suit of armor, rather than actually ""piloting"" it. Examples of this are things like ""Rideback"" and ""Busō Shinki,"" even series like ""KanColle"" convey elements of a human merged with a machine! I especially loved his mechanical designs in ""Macross Frontier"" and ""Planetes""!Kōki Uchiyama as Ichika Orimura, notable roles:* Seiya Kanie, Amagi Brilliant Park ✅* Kagura Demuri, Aquarion Evol* Takumi Harada, Battery* Tōmura Shigaraki, Boku no Hero Academia ✅* Dio Weinberg Junyō, Buddy Complex ✅* Kimimaro Yoga, C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control* Yū Otosaka, Charlotte ✅* Akira Fudō, Devilman: Crybaby ✅* Shin, Evil or Live* Shirō Kotomine (""The Master of Red Assassin""), Fate/Aprocrypha ✅* Ikuya Kirishima, Free! ✅* Momo Sakaki, Fukumenkei Noise (""Anonymous Noise"")* Kei Tsukishima, Haikyū!! ✅* Izumi Miyamura, Horimiya* Gin, Hotarubi no Mori e ✅* Meruem, Hunter x Hunter (2011) ✅* Takashi Andō, Ikebukuro West Gate Park* Ulgar Zweig, Kanata no Astra (""Astra Lost in Space"") ✅* Rui, Kimetsu no Yaiba ✅* Yūta Asaba, Kimi to Boku.* Takumi Sakagami, Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda.

His voice is so versatile, depending on which character he plays, he can be a harebrained protagonist one second and a psychotic killer the next! His role as Ichika was very funny, it brings to mind his role as Seiya Kanie (""Amagi Brilliant Park""). Mr. Uchiyama makes Ichika\'s brainlessness come across as earnest, but also cues the audience in on how truly thoughtless the character is! It\'s great, the performance made me burst out laughing a few times!Yōko Hikasa as Hōki Shinonono, notable roles:* Hana Suguruno, 7 Seeds* Hibiki Tenshō, Aikatsu Friends!: Kagayaki no Jewel* Nanako Saeki, Aku no Hana ✅* Tio Clarce, Arifureta Shokugyō de Sekai Saikyō (""Arifureta: From Commonplace to World\'s Strongest"")* Tomoe Udagawa, BanG Dream ✅* Farnese de Vandimion, Berserk ✅* Fighter, Bikini Warriors* Erica Blandelli, Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō ✅* Kiyono Amahara, Chu-Bra!!* Ayano Kōsaka, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Sakura Sakurakōji, Code:Breaker* Kyōko Kirigiri, Danganronpa ✅* Sakie Satō, Demi-chan wa Kataritai (""Interviews With Monster Girls"") ✅* Brioche d\'Arquien, Dog Days* Hina Tachibana, Domestic no Kanojo* Freya, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅* Ao Gennai, Frame Arms Girl* Kei Kugimiya, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Aya Akabane, Gokujo* Miu Osawa, Hagure Yūsha no Aesthetica* Kurumi, Hal* Emi Yusa, Hataraku Maō-sama!

While the foil typically plays nothing but perfect, pure characters... Ms. Hikasa plays more than a handful of evil characters, demons, and even Satan herself! Her characters are typically more on the mature or sultry side, but despite this, Yōko Hikasa can still pull off a hell of a straightforward, childhood friend character! Like Akane Tenjō from Ranma ½, Hōki packs a mean punch, but at the end of the day is kind-hearted, hard-working, and dignified!Kana Hanazawa as Charlotte Dunois, notable roles:* Tōko Amano, ""Bungaku Shōjo""* Sakuya, .hack//Quantum* Hinata Kawamoto, 3-Gatsu no Lion ✅* Ichika Nakano, 5-tōbun no Hanayome* Kanade Tachibana, Angel Beats! ✅* Zessica Wong, Aquarion Evol* Aoi Futaba, Asobi ni Ikuyo! ✅* Ichiko Sakura, Binbōgami ga! ✅* Mato Kuroi (""Black★Rock Shooter""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅* Yuki, Cencoroll ✅* Aoi Fukasaka, Coppelion* Honey Kisaragi, Cutie Honey Universe ✅* Roka Shibasaki, D-Frag!* Chiaki Nanami, Danganronpa 3 ✅* Suō Pavlichenko, Darker than Black: Ryūsei no Gemini* Shiro, Deadman Wonderland ✅* Anri Sonohara, Durarara!! ✅* Nessa, Fractale* Rana Linchen, Freezing* Raphiel Shiraha Ainsworth, Gabriel DropOut ✅* Kuzuha Dōmoto, Hagure Yūsha no Aesthetica* Satō Matsuzaka, Happy Sugar Life ✅* Sekkekkyū AE3803, Hataraku Saibō* Charlotte Dunois, IS: Infinite Stratos ✅* Akane Sakurada, Jōkamachi no Dandelion ✅* Ezekiel, Junketsu no Maria* Zange, Kannagi* Miyu, Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows* Kobato Hanato, Kobato. ✅* Misaki Takasaki, Koi to Uso* Yuriko Mifune, Kotōra-san ✅* Tsukimi Kurashita, Kuragehime ✅* Vanabelle, Kūtei Dragons* Katrielle Layton, Layton Mystery Tanteisha: Katri no Nazotoki File* Mayumi Saegusa, Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei  ✅* Mari Kozakura, Mekakucity Actors* Nadeko Sengoku, Monogatari (series) ✅* Chiaki Kurihara, Mōretsu Pirates* Shiika Anmoto, Mushi-Uta ✅* Manaka Mukaido, Nagi no Asu kara ✅* Kosaki Onodera, Nisekoi ✅* Minori Nakazawa, Nōrin ✅* Naho Takamiya, Orange* Ruri Gokō, Ore no Imōto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai* Susukihotaru, Otome Yōkai Zakuro ✅* Sharon Rainsworth, Pandora Hearts* Marie, Persona 4* Potemayo, Potemayo ✅* Akane Tsunemori, Psycho-Pass ✅* Kagari, Rewrite ✅* Tomoka Minato, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅* Kuro Matsumi, Saki Achiga-hen: Episode of Side-A* Misora Haruki, Sakurada Reset* Kagami Yagami, Sasami-san@Ganbaranai ✅* Natalia Vasylchenko, Sekai Seifuku: Bōryaku no Zvezda ✅* Kusano, Sekirei* Ieyasu Tokugawa, Sengoku Collection* Nanako Yukishiro, Senryū Shōjo* Maria Akizuki, Shinsekai yori ✅* Yūka Kobayakawa, Shōjo-tachi wa Kōya wo Mezasu* Yuki Shōmetsu Toshi* Sora Kajiwara, Sketchbook: Full Color\'s* Shirase Kobuchizawa, Sora yori mo Tōi Basho* Mayuri Shiina, Steins;Gate ✅* Marimo Bandō, Teekyū ✅* Mikan Yūki, TO LOVEる ✅* Natsume Tsuchimikado, Tokyo Ravens* Rumi Yokoi, Tonari no Seki-kun* Yuki Minagawa, Tsurezure Children* Momo Hanasaki, Uchi Tama?!

Ms. Inōe was great at illustrating Laura\'s internal struggles and making the character have dual sides of her personality!

She is said to be the strongest ""IS"" pilot to have ever lived, and is as much of a stoic badass, like Solid Snake in the Metal Gear franchise. Ms. Toyoguchi employs a mixture of her Sei Satō (""Maria-sama ga Miteru"") and Ellen Kurokawa (""Suite PreCure♪"") voices, to create a character that is a force to be reckoned with! Great work!Other notable seiyū talents: Makoto Yasumura (Johnny Beppu in ""Aikatsu""), Mai Kadowaki (Illyasviel von Einzbern in ""Fate/stay night""), and Yukari Tamura (Suzuha Amane in ""Steins;Gate"").Infinite Stratos isn\'t for everyone, but there are those who do really like it, and will buy the figure of their best ""waifu"" to mount on their shelf. Your level of enjoyment depends on if you\'re looking for something serious/deep, or just a carefree gander with cool fight scenes. I would recommend the Japanese dub of the show, because it has an all-star cast, and I fear some of the appeal might get lost in translation.

Also, I don\'t like the fact that it is never explained as to why he is the only guy who can control the IS. it\'s constantly mentioned, ""OMG he\'s the guy that can pilot the IS."" but it never...goes deeper than that.If any of you want to watch an anime with a similar concept, I highly recommend Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle.

Much prefer if the robots/machines were animated in 2d, no one would mind minor errors here and there. Other than that the art style is OK at best.Soundtrack is meh.Main character is 3/10 because it is, you guessed it, a...generic dense MC thats probably even more dense and predictable than other harem MCs.Other characters are generic, boring and add absolutely no value.Too many questions left unasked in this series, but doesn't matter since the first few eps already show how boring and predictable the rest of this anime can get.Typical Tsundere girls with overused tsundere phrases, there is almost nothing original with this series in terms of dialogue and story- does it even exist? Who knows. If anything it's more like a ripoff of Date a Live/High School DxD, but much worse.Summary:It's bad. Hard to find this enjoyable, had to stop watching halfway since I lost interest in it.If you haven't watched yet any harem anime, then you should watch this to get a taste of the genre. Not terrible but not good either.

Infinite Stratos is the premier mecha anime of the year 2011 and it´s combination of mecha, comedy and fan service looked like something that would suit me, so I gave the first season a go.Story – 5/10My god, what an absolute car crash this plot is. Imagine every single high school cliche packed into a single school. This show has it all: Insane fan service, beach episodes, our main character literally has to share a dorm with...like 1000 Girls at this school. The sci-fi mecha aspect was clearly not the main focus of this show. This is more like a ecchi, harem comedy set in a school WITH mechs in it. There has been absolutely zero plot progression so far. There are fights, but besides the final fight in episode 11/12, they all lack a certain emotional weight. The comedy is, to be fair, pretty funny and I just really like the world, but you can´t deny that all the sci-fi and mecha concepts are just a facade to carry the comedy and fan service aspect. I have absolutely zero issues with something like that but even a veeery simple story would have worked to carry this setting instead of the lacklustre mess we got.Art – 8/10Well, this is maybe the shows biggest strength. This came out in 2011 and still looks good. I mean, reeeeally good. The camerawork is great during the fight scenes and I personally like the mech designs a lot. The characters all look fantastic and different (except the male ones, of course) and the movement is really crisp and fluent.For the mechs, they decided to go for a kind of 50/50 approach, and constantly switch between 2D and 3D which can look horrifyingly bad if done wrong. This show however managed to nail this aspect. I still prefer 2D mechs over everything else, but I think this approach also has it´s merits.Sound – 8/10The OP of this show is amazing with great visuals and a fantastic song that fits the atmosphere of the world perfectly. However, the main thing that I would like to talk about for this category  is the ED. My god, they did not have to go that hard. This is an instant hood classic. All of the female voice actors came together and created one of the catchiest anime endings ever. This actually could have inspired later ecchi shows like “Highschool DxD” to do the same. The voice actors even toured Japan and sang the ED in front of live audiences. Fantastic stuff here.Characters – 7/10Well, this is a typical harem setup of characters. Our main character is just absolutely dreadful. No personality, dense and clearly of the overthinking type. The female characters were a little bit better. This show is set in an international boarding school, so every girl has a different national background. We have a Japanese, British, French, Chinese and a German girl here, all with different mechs, looks and personalities. The quality of depth in their characters is inconsistent, but they are all likeable and fun to watch. If the main character wasn´t such an irredeemable idiot, there would actually be a lot of potential here, but I cannot give this category a higher score at the momentEnjoyment – 7/10Well, I have to admit that I like these kinds of trashy comedies from time to time and this is just another big entry in the gerne. Although the story is a mess and I hate the main character, I will absolutely watch season two. This is just great entertainment, something to watch during lunch or in the subway on the way to university. If you like shows like “Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry”, “Highschool DxD” or “The Irregular of Magic Highschool”, this show is for you.- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 7/10 like 1000 Girls at this school.

They never explained about Laura german army base was something like that but first season was just dumb.

As expected this may seem cliche and a little fan service but as to be expected of a harem anime, the only male that can man the deadly machines is the male protagonist Ichika. He is soon enrolled into the elite High School that dedicated itself to training the world's future IS Pilots which is entirely all female until the male protagonist...comes in, harem time!Although the story and the plot development is terrible, mass destruction capable mechas manned by highly trained overly confident female anime girls?

However, i invented the alternative equation: density equals whoever the fuck is the protagonist of Infinite Stratos (yes I did not remember his name).Density is okay. Density can be funny. Density can be character development.Density was not okay. Density was not funny. Density was not helpful in anyway whatsoever.I am usually okay with the dense harem protagonist. However, this anime destroyed that. Okay, but if you add some interesting characters and plot?Nope, didn’t get it.I’m going to be brief:I dropped in the middle of episode 4. I didn’t get to the point...where I believe the story/goal/mission will be explained. Can’t say anything for that. The events that occurred so far are mundane and cliched. I am usually okay with cliched events if they presented it nicely. This was not presented nicely. This was presented in the most disgustingly mind numbing way it could. I had multiple “why the fuck am I watching this” moments because of this.The art is mediocre. The CGI could have improvement. The presentation is simple. Nothing more to be said.The sound is decent. Very very decent. Like, nothing sticks out. To me, the sound didn’t make much of a difference in any way. I kind of notice it, and say “oh, the music is playing” and not pay any attention to the music. You are supposed to pay attention to the music though! How else will it make a battle more epic or a sad scene more somber? The sound was so decent that it barely made a difference.Characters are poor. The main character is boring and dense. The side characters all outshine him tons. I only made it to episode 4 thanks to the side characters. Actually, most of the side characters are also poor, except a few. Those few were decent. Never have I ever rooted against an MC so much. I wanted someone to break the MC’s face, someone to top him, someone to change him. The interactions can be okay, but most make me frustrated, due to the MC. I want to make a statement here: I’d rather watch ants slowly crawling around, picking up leaves, building a nest and shit than watch the MC’s mind numbing interactions.It was dreadful. It felt like my intelligence was being insulted. The only thing I can say is pretty okay would be the action and fights. But even then, it’s not that good. I can’t offer any praise whatsoever about this anime. To me, it is simple generic fodder used to recalibrate our reviewing standards, to know that there is still complete utter shit that comes out with other great shows.Usually, I’m okay with harem shows. I’m also good with Mecha. Infinite Stratos does the action decently, but everything else is a flop. The romance is bad, the characters are bad, and I am willing to wager that the story itself is bad.Can I recommend this? No. Will I ever recommend this? No. Should anyone ever watch this?

The soundtrack is not remorable (i always skipped it), the voices actors did their job like expected.The characters are quite decent, the main protagonist is as stupid as a overcooked potato, in fact i often thougt about how stupid a human can be before he looses the ability to keep up the motoric abilitiies that is keeping him alive... well hes the answer.The side characters are somehow...enjoyable, they are not logical nor do they have any kind of personality. Just a bunch of teenage girls that puberty is hitting worse than an 500 pounds bomb.Some characters are enjoyable because they seem kinda cute which makes them have a reason to be acting like bakas.Overall the anime is not really funny or it is because i am german and we dont have any humour and are always dead serious. The jokes are lame and the story of everyone is... well there is actually a background story for everyone but you feel like you just listened to what they ate for breakfast.One of the very little list of good aspects that the anime has is that you dont have to think at any moment of it..With that said i hope you dont make the decision to watch this anime enjoyable, they are not logical nor do they have any kind of personality.

That was just laziness on my part.*SPOILERS, BUT YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T CARE*So...uhhhhh...where do I even begin? Well, this show was painfully bad, there's no denying that. Strangely enough, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen; go figure. In this world, these large pseudo mechas, called IS's or Infinite Stratos are used as weapons for the Japanese military. And also a few other countries. Only women can pilot the IS's, AND NO ONE ELSE! Enter cookie cutter, boilerplate, light novel protagonist #756 Ichika Orimura. He's so suave and dreamy for no apparent reason. What a...fucking hunk of man. He is the only male in the world who can pilot the IS's. Which is perfect for him, because it gives him the perfect opportunity to start the inevitable harem. That's right, Infinite Stratos is a Mecha, Harem, Action, Horror. I'm only adding that last one because it was an absolute horror to watch.Despite everything I've said about Ichika, he's quite special within the universe of Stratos. Being the only male out of billions to pilot the IS's is pretty extraordinary. And doing absolutely nothing to capture the hearts of literally every girl is also extraordinary. He's transferred to a special training academy where they accept normal high school students and mold them into elite pilots. His hottie with a body sister Chifuyu Orimura is his teacher, who is a famous IS pilot. She's the [ INSERT ANY FAMOUS FEMALE ATHLETE HERE ] of this world. Ichika quickly runs into his old childhood friend, Houki Shinonono. Jesus, that name. I'd like to buy a vowel, please. Ichika and Houki have known each other for many years and she's talented at kendo or some shit. Overtime there's a British girl introduced, then a loli, then a French girl, and then a German girl. They all instantly fall in love with him.Honestly, I'm not even all that mad. There's no point in getting angry with a show like this. Infinite Stratos' biggest problem is how it uses anime tropes to tread it's story along. All of it is just painfully forced anime clichés put into a series of events that we've all seen before. Like the new girl of the harem ending up in Ichika's bed after they fall for him or how Ichika is just unaware of the girls' romantic advances towards him, female characters falling on top of Ichika and somehow have their ass in his face when they fell forward. I can go on and on. I completely lost my shit when the German girl, who's entire purpose was to kill Ichika and drag his sister back to Germany, immediately falls in love with him after losing to him in a battle.MY POINT: The script is awful. It's nothing but overused tropes that you, yes you, dear reader, have already seen in any other trashy anime like this.Granted, the original source material is a light novel, so my expectations were pretty low. I didn't even research that part, I just guessed based on what I was watching. I don't even know if this really is based off of a light novel, but I get the feeling that I don't need to check. No effort at all. No real effort was put into this show's writing at all, and that's what killed it for me. That is pretty mean-spirited, but that's how I feel. To the ugly character designs, to the overdone mecha designs that look like something from that other bad mecha show RaXephon, to the not-so-good CGI, to the poorly written characters, to the stale animation, to the story which you shouldn't care about. It doesn't amount to anything. Even the OP and ED feel uninspired. The ED especially, which is just anime running from Ichika and the slowly amassed harem. In reality, I would give a show like this a score somewhere between a 2 and a 4, but not today. I'm going to get in my boat, I'm going to go up river, and I'm going to kick that son of a bitch Ichika's ass so hard, that the next light novel protag is gonna feel it! I hate this show with every fiber of my being, and I'm going to forget about the whole thing by next week. What makes me upset is that this show didn't need to exist, but it did. 1 out of 10.

And well...alot of pretty girls, and a handsome boy. Alot of harem I can tell. But besides of that there is not really a great story in it. There is no main goal what thoses girls and boys have. The only goal I can imagine...well the girls want this boy to...love him. But yeah....Not the best story in this serie.ART: Well its nice to see its not full mecha.

I admit I didn\'t watch the full series and I only watched the first 5 or so episodes, so I decided to go watch it again and refresh my memories about it. I\'ve heard that IS hasn\'t really aged that well compared to other harem shows, so I\'m here to see if that claim is true or it\'s just that other harem shows are still onboard the hype train. So, let\'s get this show on the road.Spoiler alert!StoryInfinite Stratos is the name of a...cybernetic suit of armor that combines aspect of an Iron Man armor and a mobile suit from Gundam and, for some reason, can only be used by weapon. And yet, for some reason, our protagonist Ichika is the only male in the world capable of using an IS and that means he gets enrolled in the prestigious IS Academy; where he unexpectedly becomes a celebrity for his rare status and, yes, he gets a harem.Much like other harem shows, Infinite Stratos wastes no time in introducing ladies for the main character\'s harem (I get to that later), but at the same time, it devotes a fair amount of time in exploring the titular weapons\' powers and abilities. That said, I would have appreciated a bit more world-building in this series. The world outside the IS Academy practically doesn\'t exist and we\'re only told, not shown, that the IS changed the nature of warfare. Of course, a war featuring the titular weapons would distract from life at the IS Academy, so it\'s not like we were gonna get a full explanation of what\'s happening out there, unless it directly affects the main characters. (6/10)CharactersCharacters are the lifeblood of a story. You can have as many fight scenes, wonderful scenery and world-building as you want, but those things won\'t matter if your story doesn\'t have characters your audience can sympathize with and get behind. I\'ve said this before and I\'m sure I\'ll say it again.Ichika doesn\'t have much personality beyond your typical harem everyman. He is just a blank slate for viewers to picture themselves as him and facilitate immersion into the story. The only real defining aspect of Ichika is that he is clueless about other girls\' affections and the show just treats it a funny quirk of is, even when the other girls might as well be carrying big neon signs that say ""I love you.""That said, it\'s not like the other girls have... believable reasons to fall in love with Ichika. Well, at least some of them. Houki, the first female character we\'re introduced to, and the closest thing the show has to a deuteragonist (essentially the second most important character in the story) has history with Ichika. They\'ve known each other since they were kids. Unfortunately, events transpired that caused her to become emotionally withdrawn and distant from Ichika and she has trouble expressing that she is in love with him and often relies on ridiculous ploys like winning a tournament instead, well, asking him out on a date.The other childhood friend, Rin, is a lot more straightforward in her affections towards Ichika, but she lacks Houki\'s depths. Cecilia, the high and mighty aristocrat from England, falls in love with Ichika because... uh, reasons. No, seriously, why does she fall in love with him again? Because he almost beat her in a fight? Okay, then. Laura, the German soldier, also has no reason to fall in love with Ichika and only does so because of plot convenience.The only other believable relationship Ichika has in the show, aside from Houki, is with Charlotte, who pretends to be a boy in an elaborate ploy from her father to gain secrets about the titular weapon. Once that plot goes FUBAR, Ichika and Charlotte get closer and as a result, the progression of their relationship feels more natural, at least compared to the other relationships in the show.Aside, from the main harem, there\'s also Chifuyu, Ichika\'s older sister and world-renowned IS champion. She is strict and professional most of the time, but in her very rare of moments of leisure, she likes teasing the other girls about the time she likes spending with Ichika (not that we see that time on-screen of course). Oh, and there\'s also Houki\'s sister, who invented the IS in the first place and there might be to her than meets the eye, but the show only hints that in the few moments of the final episode.Infinite Stratos is all over the place with its cast of characters, and I have certain grievances with them, such as lacking character development or being just there to fill out the cast list, but for the most part, the characters do more right than they do wrong. (7/8)ArtIf there\'s one thing I can find no fault with in Infinite Stratos is the blend between CGI and hand-drawn animation. For the most part, everything is hand-drawn, especially the human characters; but the the titular weapons themselves CG-rendered and the show carefully frames its shots to avoid depicting the characters as CG models when an action scene breaks out, so I can\'t fault it for playing smart with its aesthetics, either. Honestly, I did enjoy how dynamic and fast-paced the action scenes where and how the characters switch places and fly and skate around the battlefield, further highlighting the titular weapon\'s mobility; so if nothing else, you can enjoy Infinite Stratos as a good action show. (8/10)SoundsThe OP and ED songs were kinda catchy when I first listened to them and I remember listening to the OP over and over again, back when I first obsessed with the show. With my obsession gone, I don\'t plan on listenting to the OP anytime soon but still, credit goes to the artist for making it in the first place.The soundtrack used for the fight scenes were incredible. Some were a bit repetitive, like during Ichika\'s fights with Cecilia and Rin, but others were genuinely haunting and gave me a genuine sense of dread, like the big battle with the Gospel.As for the vocal performances, well, I did watch the show in Japanese; but since I only watched a few scenes of that version; I will only focus on the English version. It\'s always a pleasure to listen to the talented voices of Josh Grelle (Ichika) Monica Rial (Houki), Brittney Karbowski (Cecilia) and even Luci Christian (Chifuyu). Also, I think this is my first time listening to Shannon Emerick (Charlotte) in a major role and, while I do like her performance, I do find it to be a bit boyish, especially when Charlotte\'s gender is revealed, so it stands no reason for Emerick to use that tone for her character. I also liked the German accent of Tiffany Grant (Laura) and she actually makes it sound convincing; so really, we can\'t fault the VAs for wanting viewers to further immerse themselves into the story by putting on accents. (8/10)ConclusionI wouldn\'t call Infinite Stratos a masterpiece, but then again, it never to be such in order to be enjoyable. Just so you know, this TV show wasn\'t the first major show of the harem genre but it did bring so many known tropes and conventions of the genre into the forefront. Yeah, watching this show in 2021 alongside the parade of other harem shows does make it look dated, but the characters and the action scenes are more than enough to carry it. Infinite Stratos does more right than it does wrong and I do recommend it for fans of the harem genre.

The main character is a good example of a cliche male anime character who is so dumb to even notice or read someone when it comes to feeling. What makes it even worst is that his reaction is like a kindergartener who totally has no idea of a male and female relationship. Even Dunois had pointed out that she is wondering if he did it by purpose as he is so unrealistically dense when reacting to someone who clearly gave a clear sign of indirect love confession. And Houki, Cecilia...and Rin are one of the example cliche female anime characters who abused the main characters mostly for no good reason other than being selfish... The story could have gone better is the romance part is omitted as it is poorly executed. Somehow I like Dunois the most. She is the most proper decent girl in this series so far.

For absolutely nothing, it is the same stupid fantasy of empowerment with an escapist message. At least Overlord and Shield Hero try to be their own thing, but this anime does not even try.Creativity is more important than originality. But this anime does not have any.The protagonist is your typical Gary sty self-insert without personality. He don't...have a defined characterization so it can act in the way that the script says without contradicting anything, because there is nothing to contradict.He lacks an opinion of his own and is reactive to everything. The story revolves around him but he does not move it, the other characters are the ones who do it.I don't care about the history failure of this thing, the mere fact that the prota is OP (and that this isn't comedy), already makes the story and the protagonist softer and not interesting at all.The first caps are spent masturbating to the protagonist self-insert, or rather, to the viewer that is OP, isn't arrogant and did not ask anything of that so you do not feel bad about you are OP. He's better than everyone of the same age, is better than everyone else, get the beautiful girls, is raised by the greatest heroes, etc. How can you have tension with such a character?By the way, is not it curious how he says to keep all his memories of his past life but acts like an ignorant who does not even know how to buy?. Plot holes~ (Remember everything except how he died although that is not really important)It is even more stupid as it is he did not know that kings and heroes lived with him. Perhaps he never asked them: Who were they? o What do they do in their day to day?And that shitty comedy with exaggerated faces and screaming people is not funny, well, maybe for someone 13 years old. It's like going back 10 years ago where comedy was very bad.The rest of the characters are just one-dimensional archetypes just as empty as the protagonist.The animation and the soundtrack is mediocre.A recommendation? Literally, almost any other anime is more entertaining and creative than this one.That is all.-----Este es uno de los trabajos más desinspirados que he visto en mi vida.Todo cliché de novela ligera que se te pueda ocurrir ocurre aquí.Hay cientos de Isekais con un protagonista Overpower, ¿De qué se diferencia este anime de esos otros? Por absolutamente nada, es la misma estúpida fantasía de empoderamiento con un mensaje escapista. Al menos Overlord y Shield Hero intentan ser su propia cosa, pero este anime ni siquiera lo intenta.La creatividad es más importante que la originalidad. Pero este anime ni tiene ninguna.El protagonista es tu típico Gary sty autoinsertable sin personalidad. No tiene una caracterización definida por lo que puede actuar de la forma que el guión diga sin contradecir nada, porque no hay nada que contradecir.Carece de una opinión propia y es reactivo a todo. La historia gira alrededor de él, pero él no la mueve, los otros personajes son los que lo hacen.No me importa la historia de esta cosa, el mero hecho de que el prota sea OP y esto no sea comedia ya lo hace menos interesante. Los primeros caps se la pasan masturbando al protagonista autoinsertable, o mejor dicho, al espectador de que es OP, no es arrogante y no pidió nada de eso para que no te sientas mal de que eres Op.Es mejor que todos los de su misma edad, consigue a las chicas lindas, es criado por los más grandes héroes, puede hacer cualquier cosa, etc. ¿Cómo puede tener tensión con un personaje así?Por cierto, ¿No es curiosos como dice conservar todos sus recuerdos de su vida pasada pero actúa como un ignorante que ni siquiera sabe comprar?. Plot holes~ (Recuerda todo menos como murió aunque eso no es importante realmente)Es incluso más estúpido como es él no sabía que reyes y héroes vivían con él, acaso nunca les pregunto ¿Quienes eran? o ¿Qué es lo que hacen en su día a día?Y esa comedia pedorra con caras exageradas y gente gritando no es graciosa, bueno tal vez para alguien de 13 años. Es como volver hace 10 años atrás donde la comedia era muy mala.El resto de personajes son solo arquetipos unidimensionales igual de vacíos que el protagonista.La animación y la banda sonora es mediocre.¿Una recomendación? Literalmente, casi cualquier otro anime es más entretenido y creativo que este.Eso es todo. have a defined characterization so it can act in the way that the script says without contradicting anything, because there is nothing to contradict.He lacks an opinion of his own and is reactive to everything.

He's better than everyone of the same age, is better than everyone else, get the beautiful girls, is raised by the greatest heroes, etc. How can you have tension with such a character?By the way, is not it curious how he says to keep all his memories of his past life but acts like an ignorant who does not even know how to buy?. Plot holes~ (Remember everything except how he died although that is not really important)It is even more stupid as it is he did not know that kings and heroes lived with him. Perhaps he never asked them: Who were they? o What do they do in their day to day?And that shitty comedy with exaggerated faces and screaming people is not funny, well, maybe for someone 13 years old. It's like going back 10 years ago where comedy was very bad.The rest of the characters are just one-dimensional archetypes just as empty as the protagonist.The animation and the soundtrack is mediocre.A recommendation? Literally, almost any other anime is more entertaining and creative than this one.That is all.-----Este es uno de los trabajos más desinspirados que he visto en mi vida.Todo cliché de novela ligera que se te pueda ocurrir ocurre aquí.Hay cientos de Isekais con un protagonista Overpower, ¿De qué se diferencia este anime de esos otros? Por absolutamente nada, es la misma estúpida fantasía de empoderamiento con un mensaje escapista. Al menos Overlord y Shield Hero intentan ser su propia cosa, pero este anime ni siquiera lo intenta.La creatividad es más importante que la originalidad. Pero este anime ni tiene ninguna.El protagonista es tu típico Gary sty autoinsertable sin personalidad. No tiene una caracterización definida por lo que puede actuar de la forma que el guión diga sin contradecir nada, porque no hay nada que contradecir.Carece de una opinión propia y es reactivo a todo. La historia gira alrededor de él, pero él no la mueve, los otros personajes son los que lo hacen.No me importa la historia de esta cosa, el mero hecho de que el prota sea OP y esto no sea comedia ya lo hace menos interesante. Los primeros caps se la pasan masturbando al protagonista autoinsertable, o mejor dicho, al espectador de que es OP, no es arrogante y no pidió nada de eso para que no te sientas mal de que eres Op.Es mejor que todos los de su misma edad, consigue a las chicas lindas, es criado por los más grandes héroes, puede hacer cualquier cosa, etc. ¿Cómo puede tener tensión con un personaje así?Por cierto, ¿No es curiosos como dice conservar todos sus recuerdos de su vida pasada pero actúa como un ignorante que ni siquiera sabe comprar?. Plot holes~ (Recuerda todo menos como murió aunque eso no es importante realmente)Es incluso más estúpido como es él no sabía que reyes y héroes vivían con él, acaso nunca les pregunto ¿Quienes eran? o ¿Qué es lo que hacen en su día a día?Y esa comedia pedorra con caras exageradas y gente gritando no es graciosa, bueno tal vez para alguien de 13 años. Es como volver hace 10 años atrás donde la comedia era muy mala.El resto de personajes son solo arquetipos unidimensionales igual de vacíos que el protagonista.La animación y la banda sonora es mediocre.¿Una recomendación? Literalmente, casi cualquier otro anime es más entretenido y creativo que este.Eso es todo."", '""Oh boy!

While I personally enjoy these types of anime, I understand why the majority of weebs out there are sick of this non-unique and generic concept with only slight differences in the story. I\'ll say upfront that if you are one of the people that...despises isekais, then this is without a doubt not the anime for you.The art for this anime is pretty generic and there isn\'t really anything in particular that stands out, as far as the art style goes. I don\'t really mind it, but I know that other people out there will believe the contrary.The soundtrack isn\'t anything special either and the characters are as generic as an isekai anime could get.Even with all these flaws, I for some reason really enjoy watching Kenja no Mago, and while I must admit that I have a ""shit-taste"" in anime, I believe that Kenja no Mago is a good anime.Overall, I\'m giving this anime a solid 7/10. <3 despises isekais, then this is without a doubt not the anime for you.The art for this anime is pretty generic and there isn\'t really anything in particular that stands out, as far as the art style goes.

Do not come into this anime expecting for a complex plot with heavily fleshed out characters.  This show was designed to fool you into thinking that it follows the usual anime tropes but suddenly it pulls out something totally unconventional.  It's not exactly...a parody of the isekai genre, to me it's better than that.

This is bad. This is real bad.Problem 1, The Gary Stu:Usually when you write a story there are certain pitfalls you want to avoid. One of them is the Mary Sue, alternatively called Gary Stu for males. A gary Stu is a character that doesn't have any flaws and is really strong or talented at whatever you have to be talented in in their specific story in order to be successful. When you write a Gary Stu character it's hard to make people empathize with him as he never has to struggle for anything. On top of that as there is never anything...at stake, no tension is ever built up and nothing dramatic that is exciting to watch can ever happen.This is actually quite an easy pitfall to avoid and is basically character writing 101: just make your character not be good at absolutely everything. This story absolutely ignores that and makes our dear MC super OP. He's a genius magician whos just naturally talented at magic, in the world he lives in magic is power and someone who is good at magic can become anything they want in life, he's also good looking and charms 2 women simultaneously in the first episode by beating up a bunch of generic bad guys (nice another generic harem isekai). He's also super positive, loved by everyone and has no mental issues or trauma despite literally being ran over and killed in his past life. TL;DR? He's a Gary Stu whos good at everything and has never struggled in his entire life. Seriously, this is such an easy thing to avoid even, One Punch Man, a dude who can literally one-shot anything, isn't a Gary Stu!Problem 2, Silver spoons:There is wrong with wealthy characters. Bruce Wayne is wealthy and he is one of the most iconic superheroes of all time. Growing up with a silverspoon shoved up your *** can obviously make for interesting characters as well, however. When a life of wealth, social and economic, is combined with Gary Stu-ism you get what might probably be the most boring and unwatchable character in human history. That is exactly what the MC of this anime Shin Walford is. Not only is he naturally talented at everything, he was also raised by the lands greatest hero, his partner, the literal king of the country he lives in, a famous knight and others! This is absurd! All this of course results in Shin being the most boring, uninteresting and unwatchable MC of all time as he has 0 problems in life.Supporting cast and setting are also trash:We have a generic magic-school setting where student are ranked based on their capabilities as magicians (wow, never seen that before). We have two girls who are literally introduced as damsels in distress that shin (the MC) has too swoop in and save, one of them immediately falls in love with him. A Draco Malfoy type character that literally fills no other purpose then further showing how strong Shin is and setting up the villain slightly(not saying Malfoy is a bad character, i’m saying that the character filling the same role in this anime is bad).Lastly, we have a villain. Man he's boring, so boring. You know what i hate? Villains who are evil just for the sake of it. No rhyme or reason, no philosophy guiding them, no event which molded them. I hate villains who are just evil for the sake of being evil. This is because there is nothing for me to relate to, no way for me to understand them or become invested.They're just there because the MC needs an antagonist. Also, this guy is not intimidating or anything in the least. He gets hurt by Shin (the MC) and struggles against him in their first encounter. He's unrelatable, uninteresting and intimidating at the same time.Last words:There’s nothing left to say, Shin just swoops in with his overpowered magic everywhere and succeeds at everything he tries, this is not fun too watch. If the MC and main story of a show is this bad then it doesn't matter what merits the rest of the show have to stand on, which are none, btw. This is just a generic and uninspired magic-school anime. There is no point in addressing specific plotpoints in the anime although there are many which further illustrate why this show is so bad. This is because the fundamental aspects of the show (characters, story and setting for example) all fail and are so mediocre and overdone that the show collapses on a foundational level.

After watching its first four episodes, I can already tell that Kenja no Mago, in spite of the show being a mediocre, is trying hard to be something in the realm of the isekai genre but still indeed entertaining to watch.The first episodes of Kenja no Mago has demonstrated the capabilities of the protagonist, Shin Walford, and how broken and overpowered he is—a cheap trick to hype up the viewers but can be seen as dull and uninteresting by many. He is...surrounded with peers which are inferior to him that shows high regards to his prowess, only making him look more powerful, yet ironically lacks common sense. These kind of concept has become way too overused, mostly in the isekai genre, which can be questioned for its ingenuity. Heck, even how the protagonist has died in the accident as shown in the first episode is so cliché to the point that it has become iconic to the anime community.But what makes Kenja no Mago still worthy to watch is how enjoyable the show is. Its generic plot aside, thinking of Shin as yourself, dying in an accident and getting reincarnated into another world and then becoming an overpowered protagonist, is a pretty cool thing for me. The concept of escapism which has got nothing to do with the anime itself is what making me enjoy watching Kenja no Mago—putting yourself in the shoes of the protagonist where you are capable of being anything you want to be with your own power in the new world no matter how repetitious this idea becomes.Kenja no Mago is not for everyone who does not like the repetitiveness of the concept of an overpowered protagonist and generic plot. I do suggest, though, to watch the show and at least give it a try (three episode rule) to see if it comes within your liking.To sum up the quality of the show:Story - 5Some of the scenes are not narrated well and cliché.Art - 6Art style seems average and the animations are not even that good enough for an action anime.Sound - 6Soundtracks are quite average as well.Character - 6Generic characterization; inferior supporting characters that makes the main character look more powerful.Enjoyment - 10Although with its quality, the show itself is enjoyable for my part. No further explanation needed.Overall - 7 surrounded with peers which are inferior to him that shows high regards to his prowess, only making him look more powerful, yet ironically lacks common sense.

It is also a problem that more often or not ruins the industry image from outsiders as many people from other mediums would say that the anime medium is vapid shit that has no substance base on the self insert/waifu pandering that were shown by various Isekai anime.Wise Man\'s Grandchild is the embodiment of this as it\'s not only a horrendously made anime that is void of passion and creativity it also shamelessly represents everything that is wrong with this genre.The plot...centres around a self insert Gary Sue named Shin Walford who is reincarnated as a baby in a fantasy world after getting ran over and killed by truck kun in his previous life. He is soon adopted by an old wander named Merlin Walford and soaked up Merlin\'s teachings, earning him some shocking powers and abilities; however when he turned 15 Merlin realised that he forgot to teach him quote ""Common sense and social skills\'. Unquote. I wish I joking.Anyway with the help of Merlin\'s friend Shin enrols into Shin into a prestigious magic academy where he can not only socialise with people but to also hone his skills and abilities. Thus he\'s adventures begin.If I had to describe the story in one world is lazy. You know when you have that one 12 year old in class that constantly shares their bad anime fanfics to you.That\'s what this show is. It\'s a collection of generic anime cliches and fantasy isekai story elements that don\'t mesh well together thanks to the shows vomit including writing which I will get to in a bit.There are no stakes whatsoever as the protagonist would overpowered the villains at any time. The setting is a generic boring setting before. There\'s no world-building to speak as the show rather spends it\'s time on sick self insert pandering.It wouldn\'t be so bad if the writing was so trash. You cannot watch a single episode of Wise Man\'s Grandchild\xa0without face slamming your head on a iron table.This is only enhanced by the 12-year-old tier fan fiction dialogue which was downright painful to watch on screen.The worst thing about Wise Man Grandchild is how lazy it is. I know I just described the story as lazy but this is only the thick of it as it not only rips off plots from other isekai/fantasy anime it also reuses locations with little to no changes.My favourite being Kazuma\'s Mansion as despite being slighting brighter as well-having adding and removing a couple of outdoor mansion decoration the mansion is the bloody same. I understand that drawing hundreds of backgrounds for an anime is hard, especially on a tight deadline and budget but nobody has been stupid enough to recuse background scenery from other isekai animes as plan B. It\'s like I\'m watching a anime equivalent of a asset flip of steam.The asset flip and poorly written story is made worse with the soulless characters are a void of personality.Shin is a boring Gary Sue who is overpowered and has no flaws.He has a personality of a brick and he has no motivations other to project his friends and city because plot reasons.The supporting characters are just a collection of bland anime stereotypes that you have all seen before.You have the shy blue hair girl with big boobs, the tsundere red hard girl, the yellow hair kindhearted best friend boy and couple of old farts. How lazy and uninspired can you get.Finally we have villains and to be honest the less I speak about them the better because you can tell what type of villains they are going to be based on the amateur hour poster that was done in Photoshop.The presentation is a mixed bag. While the animation is subpar and fight choreography at times is laughable the character designs, background scenery and lightning were pretty solid minus the stock images.The soundtrack had as much passion as the plot and characters. It uses various generic fantasy tracks that don\'t keep the viewer interested due to how bland they are.This is only made worse by poor direction as various times it doesn\'t know how to properly place it\'s own tracks to create tension to the fights and narrative.Both the opening and ending themes are generic pop songs with meaningless lyrics.The voice acting for both languages is alright but nothing too special.Wise Man\'s Grandchild.exe has stopped working.Wise Man\'s Grandchild is what happens when you have no creativity and passion. It is an infuriating garbage fire that relays on cliches and tropes just to please the lowest common denominator of anime fans with it\'s cringely dialogue and fan fiction writing.Wise Man\'s Grandchild may decent production values and voice acting but it ultimately don\'t matter if your plot and characters were at the bottom of the barrel.The only thing that you should do as Wise Man\'s Grandchild is concerned is to stay as far away from it as possible as this is just another Isekai anime that has no soul and passion.Avoid the series like the plague and watch That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime or Konosuba instead. centres around a self insert Gary Sue named Shin Walford who is reincarnated as a baby in a fantasy world after getting ran over and killed by truck kun in his previous life.

They may not understand the term ‘isekai’ at first, but they know what trash is. It’s a shame for me to say this because Kenja no Mago could have been an actual hit, something special even. What it ended up instead is garbage that I doubt even a 5 year old can enjoy.Without jumping too far ahead, the isekai genre often consists of several ways to set up for is main story. The protagonist usually gets transported to an alternate world. In some...cases, they meet their tragic deaths at the hands of Truck-kun. They gain some sort of RPG-like power by some mysterious entity. From there on, the protagonist lives in their new lifestyle while making new friends, enemies, lovers, etc. Oh and before I forget, isekai usually loves to go with harem involving female characters who wants to get into the main guy’s pants. It’s the sort of dead horse ideas that makes many isekai shows as blend as they are today. Kenja no Mago has a protagonist named Shin Walford who used to be a hardworking man in the real world. He gets killed by Truck-kun, reincarnated in a fantasy world, and grew up to be a strong person. This sound sort of familiar now? Oh wait, I forgot to mention that Shin is ungodly powerful for someone of his age. Make no mistake, Shin is an overpowered protagonist who shows little vulnerability. He’s like the Hulk Hogan of the early 1980s and isn’t going to put over anyone.Watching the story start off this way already set offs some red flags. Honestly, Shin isn’t much of an appealing protagonist to begin with. The show makes it clear that he lacks social skills and this is thanks to being raised in the wilderness. My first impression of Shin is that he is a young man trapped in a toddler’s body. Except here, Shin is stupidly powerful. His first encounter with the timid Sicily girl is laughably awkward. It’s one of those ‘love at first sight’ moments as both characters fall for each other. To put it bluntly, it seems the creator didn’t want to build on their relationship together. It’s just handing it over. It doesn’t help that she is extremely shy who often puts on her embarrassing face whenever getting close to her knight in shining armor. This isn’t a ‘will they or won’t they’ scenario type of story. This is just Shin and Sicily destined to be lovers like it’s some sort of fake Cinderella tale. I wish it was much more than that.Thankfully, the show contains more than these two lovebirds. From the main cast, there’s August von Earshide, Maria von Messina, May von Earsheid, Alice Corner, Lyn Hughes, Yuri Carlton, Oliver Schtrom, and among others. If you guessed it, then yes, some of these characters came from noble families. Because in fantasy worlds, there are what people call ‘status’. Shin is enrolled in a prestigious school to develop his social skills. What does that really mean? Well, it means this show is saturated with goofy moments and absurd amount of comedy. Honestly, I wonder what this anime tries to even be sometimes. A parody? I don’t think so since it doesn’t truly satirize the isekai genre. Konosuba did that with fantastic results. Then, it got me wondering if the anime is trying to bring something fresh to the audience. That can’t be yet either since the amount of ideas listed can be fit with any isekai shows nowadays. So what the hell is this show trying to be?Then, I realized something. The real problem with Kenja no Mago is it’s just plainly stupid. That’s the simplest way to describe it. It tries so hard to be funny that it loses its focus. Even with the serious storytelling on occasions, the comedy immediately puts the anime back to square one. Character such as Oliver Schtrom had my interest at first but after seeing him fall in despair and his true intentions, he became nothing more than archetype villain; not the creative type either. In fact, a 5 year old could make up a villain about as interesting as Oliver. The rest of the cast are hardly interesting with August’s casualness or Maria’s outspoken personality and fangirling over others. Characters such as Alice or May display childishness that gets in the way of others. And of course, there is Silciy and Yuri. The show seeks to make both of them look as attractive as possible. For Silcily’s case, it’s to make her look like a lovely doll with the elegance of a stereotypical young lady. In Yuri’s case, the show gives her cleavage as Ms. Fanservice. Almost every shot I see her in the show makes it seem like the camera is flirting with her. When you get a main cast like this, there’s little room for creativity. The adults are even less interesting with their formal ways of speaking. Trust me, it’s like listening your least favorite music on repeat.With Silver Link in charge, I had to lower my expectations a bit before the anime started. The promos and visual content reveals a generic style for its character designs. Even the battle segments in the show gets tedious fast because you can almost guess who will win. The character expressions are too cartoonish to be taken for laughs. It’s like the Disney type of humor aimed for children if that’s the target audience. In the meantime, I can’t even give much praise to the voice acting. With characters like Shin with a lack of social skills, the lines also sound laughably absurd. Creatively speaking, there’s some room for world building as it sticks to its core fantasy elements. At the same time, I do want to give some praise to its magical content as well. There’s a diverse range of magic in the show that makes an isekai be what it is.Oh Kenja no Mago. This is not a show I would recommend people unless you’re under 12 years old. It’s the type of anime that anyone could’ve written with no creative thought. To be honest, you can watch this anime at 2x times the speed and feel like you won’t miss much in the end. If Nobunaga-sensei no Osanazuma is the worst show of the year so far, it looks like it has some competition. cases, they meet their tragic deaths at the hands of Truck-kun. They gain some sort of RPG-like power by some mysterious entity. From there on, the protagonist lives in their new lifestyle while making new friends, enemies, lovers, etc. Oh and before I forget, isekai usually loves to go with harem involving female characters who wants to get into the main guy’s pants. It’s the sort of dead horse ideas that makes many isekai shows as blend as they are today. Kenja no Mago has a protagonist named Shin Walford who used to be a hardworking man in the real world. He gets killed by Truck-kun, reincarnated in a fantasy world, and grew up to be a strong person. This sound sort of familiar now? Oh wait, I forgot to mention that Shin is ungodly powerful for someone of his age. Make no mistake, Shin is an overpowered protagonist who shows little vulnerability. He’s like the Hulk Hogan of the early 1980s and isn’t going to put over anyone.Watching the story start off this way already set offs some red flags. Honestly, Shin isn’t much of an appealing protagonist to begin with. The show makes it clear that he lacks social skills and this is thanks to being raised in the wilderness. My first impression of Shin is that he is a young man trapped in a toddler’s body. Except here, Shin is stupidly powerful. His first encounter with the timid Sicily girl is laughably awkward. It’s one of those ‘love at first sight’ moments as both characters fall for each other. To put it bluntly, it seems the creator didn’t want to build on their relationship together. It’s just handing it over. It doesn’t help that she is extremely shy who often puts on her embarrassing face whenever getting close to her knight in shining armor. This isn’t a ‘will they or won’t they’ scenario type of story. This is just Shin and Sicily destined to be lovers like it’s some sort of fake Cinderella tale. I wish it was much more than that.Thankfully, the show contains more than these two lovebirds. From the main cast, there’s August von Earshide, Maria von Messina, May von Earsheid, Alice Corner, Lyn Hughes, Yuri Carlton, Oliver Schtrom, and among others. If you guessed it, then yes, some of these characters came from noble families. Because in fantasy worlds, there are what people call ‘status’. Shin is enrolled in a prestigious school to develop his social skills. What does that really mean? Well, it means this show is saturated with goofy moments and absurd amount of comedy. Honestly, I wonder what this anime tries to even be sometimes. A parody? I don’t think so since it doesn’t truly satirize the isekai genre. Konosuba did that with fantastic results.

I\'ve made it through Sword Art Online, Vampire Knight, Eromanga-sensei, and even fucking King\'s Game, and this is the one that broke me. I smiled 2 times, and they were both at parts that weren\'t trying to be funny. There\'s nothing good about this show at all. I\'m writing this review at episode 8 because that\'s the farthest I\'m letting myself get to; for my own sake, I can\'t continue.Story (1/10)The story is 100% cliches. You can genuinely predict every single thing that happens before it happens. The relationship between Kiri2 and GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000...has 2 steps:1. ""Ummmmm it\'s not like I like GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000 or anything....""2. ENGAGEMENTSure, there\'s some other storyline with some bad guy doing bad stuff but that stuff is genuinely relevant for about 7% of the entire show from ep1-8. Some guy does something bad so that Kiri2 can fix it and become the hero that everyone loves. Then every so often in an episode, they\'re like ""oh right, there\'s that villain who\'s still alive,"" so they show a minute of him doing Evil Nefarious Plotting, and then it\'s back to the least likable characters existing in random places.Art (3/10)The facial features are never in the same spot, and I swear to god GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000 has bigger eyes in every consecutive shot she appears in. They spent 90% of the budget on 2 second explosions and then the rest of the rest of the environments can be summed up as such:SKY LAYERMOUNTAIN LAYERSTONE GROUND LAYERThis isn\'t even mentioning the one episode where they decided to have maybe the most hilariously awful CGI vocaloid music videos I\'ve ever seen, and I\'ve seen Ayano\'s Theory of Happiness\'s anime CGI video. A girl hops around while whacky and zaney effects pop around screen, she gives some half-hearted dabs (not a joke), and then it\'s over. I was stunned. I didn\'t know what to do with myself. I was still for so long that my muscles began to atrophy and the doctors weren\'t sure I was gonna make it.Sound (3/10)I did actually get a little bit into episode 9, and one of the things that made me start to break was when there was an explosion noise and I recognized it. I had heard it from either some 2014 youtube video or unity game, and it is maybe the worst sound known to man. It was like nails on a chalk board. The opening is fine at best, and the same can be said about the ending. Every single background song in the OST has 2 instruments. I can\'t remember a single song because every song is just like if you took an ""item get"" jingle from a game and then made it 2 minutes long.Character (1/10)Every character has 1 personality trait. Kiri2 is dumb as a post but good at magic. GENERIC-GIRL-CHAN-5000 loves Kiri2 and has a HUMAN GENTLE SOUL. Red hair girl is a tsundere but to like everyone??? God it actually hurts to fucking think about these terrible characters, the entire show is the equivalent of eating cardboard as entertainment while watching paint dry.Enjoyment (0.1/10)The thing about the anime that I listed at the start of this review is that they all are at least either good in concept, funny because of how bad they are, have good production quality, or at least have good songs (and maybe a combo of some of these), but the simple truth is that Wise Man\'s Grandson has absolutely 0 redeeming qualities. It\'s not even so bad that I can laugh at it. Everything is cliched; nothing is original. My brain hurts just thinking about it because it\'s just so mind numbingly boring that the cells in my brain just start to turn off entirely so as to not be used for thinking about something so wholly terrible.Overall (0/10)I\'d give this a negative score if I was able to. This has a better score than fucking Boogiepop. I\'m genuinely afraid that some countries will begin to use this show as a torture tactic. That\'s the type of experience you\'re in for if you have a lapse in judgment for a long enough duration of time that you press play on Wise Man\'s Grandson.

IMO it falls into the same category as ""Isekai wa smartphone"" and ""Death March to the parallel World"", so if you could bring yourselves to like these then you\'ll probably like this one as well.Story: 1The premise is a generic cliche at best. The MC is an adult who gets ran over by our good ol\' friend ""truck-kun"" and then gets reincarnated in another world as a baby.Now the ""cringy"" part is that the MC, even as a child, retains...his memories as an adult-- and while this serves as the secret ability behind his rapid growth and eventual recognition as ""Child Prodigy"", it keeps rubbing me the wrong way whenever he interacts with his peers.All the girls are flocking to him, powerful wizards are astonished by his skill at such a young age, because none of them are aware of the fact he\'s an adult in a kid\'s body. I don\'t even want to touch the ""flirting"" part, considering those girls are actual teens while he\'s a full grown adult in a teen\'s body. Yeah...Art: 5It\'s not entirely bad, but it\'s rushed and that becomes apparent in frequent sequences. I\'d say it\'s your standard isekai anime quality.Sound: 390% of the times the tracks that start playing don\'t fit the scene at all. It\'s so weird it makes one wonder what the studio was even thinking when implementing those soundtracks. I\'ve seen much worse though.Character: 1I\'ll start with the MC. He\'s your generic, OP, Gary-Stu, likable by everyone child prodigy that can just resolve any issue with a finger-snap. The one issue the MC cannot fix is that there\'s no one who can really challenge him. He\'s ridiculously broken to the point even the villain-mastermind in the early episodes runs away in fear of the MC\'s latent potential. That can play out either way, I guess. You can either like an MC who can just fart his problems away or you can just feel bored by his power-farts.As for the rest of the cast about everyone is 1-dimensional, much like the MC. They don\'t feel real and there\'s nothing likable, memorable or interesting about them. They feel like meat-puppets created for the sole purpose of reacting to the MC\'s dialogue without having a personality of their own.This becomes more apparent on episode 3, where the MC decapitates a demonized fellow student and the first thing everyone is concerned about is the dust on the MC\'s shirt. Nobody seems to care or even notice their dead classmate\'s headless corpse that\'s lying right next to them. On that particular scene I remember asking myself what the hell was wrong with those kids, not even reacting to a fellow classmate\'s death, but then I just remembered they were 1-dimensional puppets created for the purpose of worshiping the MC and nothing else. Their characters are so bland and superficial that honestly Goblin-Slayer feels like a multi-dimensional character compared to them.Enjoyment: 1Like I said, it can go either way. Personally I can\'t seem to get any enjoyment out of this show due to reasons I already mentioned. It just feels bland and empty in uncomfortably many ways.Overall: 2There\'s a ton of isekais out there that did the ""OP MC"" part right. Take Overlord or Slime for example. IMO Kenja no Mago failed at delivering that premise and instead turned out with a senselessly powerful MC that just needs to flex in order to make the world a better place.TL;DR you should just avoid this one. his memories as an adult-- and while this serves as the secret ability behind his rapid growth and eventual recognition as ""Child Prodigy"", it keeps rubbing me the wrong way whenever he interacts with his peers.All the girls are flocking to him, powerful wizards are astonished by his skill at such a young age, because none of them are aware of the fact he\'s an adult in a kid\'s body.

I want to almost believe it\'s a parody because it\'s so badly cliche. It\'s like an off-brand generic copy of a name brand show.Every instance is so predictable and cliche that it\'s almost embarrassing to watch, I actually physically cringed for the first time ever watching this show  at some of the scenes; one of the scenes was so obviously predictable that when it happened, I almost clicked out of the...show to drop it. It was like a line of predictable scenes and every time I predicted something I just got so disappointed.I do typically like how these types of stories go but this show is so stereotypical and bad that it lacks any character and depth to the story.I\'m not saying the story type is bad, because I typically enjoy these types of stories actually, but even the lines in the anime felt rushed and boring and the way the show has rushed through these episodes to barely make an effort to be unique or tell the story in a more engaging way really turns me off. It\'s like they took the most generic, basic bits of any Isekai and just put it in one show, this is basically what you would get.I want to also say I don\'t make reviews because I don\'t see the purpose in anyone really valuing my opinion, but the show was so bad that I was 100% positive it would have been rated nothing higher than a 5 or 6 on MAL but it turns out it wasn\'t surprisingly somehow a mid to high 7.

It\'s like they took the most generic, basic bits of any Isekai and just put it in one show, this is basically what you would get.I want to also say I don\'t make reviews because I don\'t see the purpose in anyone really valuing my opinion, but the show was so bad that I was 100% positive it would have been rated nothing higher than a 5 or 6 on MAL but it turns out it wasn\'t surprisingly somehow a mid to high 7.

Personally I had high hopes for this anime and only watched the latest episode in hopes that it would improve. I don't write reviews often but I felt I had to for this one. There is no story so far and you can forget about character development. The story seems like some poor self insert fan-faction. The character seem to lack inelegance and have no flaws not to mention the poor pacing of the show. There are many pointless scenes, and no show/anime will ever be perfect...I had high hopes for this and while it may be bad I did enjoy the first episode and I still hope they make improvements but as of now every time I watch        a new episode I just get reminded of why I don't want to keep watching Kenja no Mago.

While the combination does persist, it seems more of a gimmick to highlight how broken of a character the MC is. The characters also lack interesting personalities, instead following typical tropes and existing either to be a damsel in distress, or praise how amazing the MC is.If you're new to anime or the isekai genre this might be enjoyable but so far the story, setting and character all seem like a setup to have the MC as an audience stand-in for wish fulfilment, which...we've seen too many times.

Additionally, I watched the first 4 episodes of Kenja no Mago and then put it on hold. I thought it was kinda boring and cliche, but yesterday I told myself I was gonna finish it and I am glad I did. Kenja no Mago is not the best isekai, but still enjoyable for someone interested in the genre or just looking for something kinda fun with bits of seriousness sprinkled in every few episodes.The story is similar, if not almost identical, to many isekai anime. Guy dies and...is reincarnated in another world where he is super super powerful and has to save the world. However, the characters and their quirky personalities make the anime stand out a little bit. The art style and animation are very nice and easy to follow.

There are moments of seriousness, but they are rare, and it could not be noted for its extreme creativity.Art 7/10Nothing crazy here either, there are moments when the animation definitely lacks, but there are some cool details in other areas that even it out a little.Sound 8/10The OP was not good whatsoever, copy and paste Japanese idol culture, meaningless song meant for mindless enjoyment. The second song was actually pretty good to me, the lyrics were...lacking, and the 3D performance of the virtual idol in the sixth episode was terrible, but I don’t think either of these things were really on the makers of the show, it was mostly marketing for this new Japanese virtual idol they were basically plugging in their show. However, it redeems itself with some really great guitar riffs, and noticeably good drums as well. Overall the soundtrack of the show during emotional moments was nothing special, they added a little tingle of emotion here and there, but the ED put it up an extra notch.Characters 8/10Actually pretty decent characters. The trope of “lack of social skills” is not overdone, and used to pretty good comedic value without being corny. The cast of surrounding characters was also pretty good, some stereotypes were used but none overly so, the romantic interest is cute but also independent to an extent, instead of the ridiculous over dependence usually seen. The main characters friends are all pretty enjoyable, and the female cast aren’t all attracted to him as they usually would be. There is a little fan service, but mostly for comedic value, or alternatively to show the good character traits of the MC, who isn’t just ok with it like is shown often in the isekai genre.Enjoyment 10/10This more than anything is the redeeming quality of the show. It fits the stereotypes that are usually used, but not overly so as to be annoying, and the MC is actually a decent human being. The main enjoyment factor is how funny the show is. I was genuinely laughing for a good portion of this show. The humor isn’t too terribly shallow, but it’s pretty mindless. A guilty pleasure maybe, but this show was very enjoyable for me.Overall this show pokes a little fun at itself and is pretty lighthearted, even in the darker story driven moments, which are few and far between.

I’m really not sure why people don’t like it much. I mean, perhaps there are better, more interesting isekais out there, but if you let this one sit by itself, it’s a pretty darn enjoyable series.Why is it enjoyable? It doesn’t take itself to seriously, it flows like a slice-of-life, and the character chemistry is enjoyable and it’s easy to watch.Are there issues? Sure. Him being from Earth originally isn’t really mentioned later on in the story. They kind of glaze over this part, but in the beginning of the first episode we see...that he's a scientist or just some other very intelligent dude. Because of his intellect and the fact that he lived on Earth is what has given him a greater understanding of magic, and therefore how to utilize it. Once you understand this, it’s less of that “generic MC is OP for no reason” trope.I really enjoyed the character chemistry even though it doesn’t have tremendous depth. Frankly, this show, so far, doesn’t have much depth either. To be honest, the first season really just felt like an origin story for the group of magicians the MC makes and it really felt like the plot was starting to get moving by the end.In dark times when your watch list is full of intense serious anime, or plain trope-filled comedic anime, this one kind of stands alone. It’s especially easy to watch after a busy day at work.Another thing I personally enjoyed was the progression of the MC romance. In itself, the romance is very shounen, but it actually moves along and evolves as the series progresses, which you rarely see in a lot of these anime.But seriously, don’t compare it the other isekai stories out there, and just enjoy it for what it is.

"", ""As one reviewer says that this was tiring, well, he was very much right, cu'z this was just too much of the usual as any isekai themed anime except of Tate no Yuusha, like the usual, we have a guy with a previous life from his world and upon death he gets reborn to another world and becomes this very all to mighty magician who grew up to a family of well known magic users and was train under their supervision and not only that the main character Shin Walford was also trained by various  other nobles that the main character's step parents knew...and from there the guys goes to school and starts to show off that attracted  too many attention from there he begins to have some sort of following where he forms the Ultimate Magician....... But ya know what makes this anime a let down was that after them so called Ultimate Magicians duke out with them demoniod hordes and then facing off with a powerful demoniod chick m they suddenly fell hopeless against her , that's until Shin Walford arrives to deal with her, but instead of killing her, she basically bails out and that's the let down as much as I hate to say it but studio Silver Link should have allowed that powerful demoniod chick to die in the hands of Shin Walford. Then again for Shin Walford to have a love interest with  von Claude, Sicily was the only silver lining that original creator .Yoshioka, Tsuyoshi did, also for the main character to have his own army of friends was another silver lining for this anime  to be able to see Schrom's backstory was another silver lining .

That was BAD. No, correction, that was beyond BAD. The words unworldly uninspired, cliché and generic are not enough to describe this sad attempt of show called Kenja no Mago (aka. Wise Man´s Grandchild). My eyes hurt after all the eyerolling I been doing, and I believe I dumbed down several notches due to loss of braincells just sitting through this crap. I would have dropped it if I had not added it on my “Anime Watching Challenge 2019” - list. I´m seldom this harsh on any show, but I will walk you through why I dump so much frustrations on it. I had...absolutely zero expectations going into this show, since fanservicey isekai directed to teenage boys usually isn´t what I go for. But even with the non-existing expectations I was amazed how completely empty and uninspired an anime 2019 can get.Isekai has been a theme for a long time in storytelling, and actually have endless possibilities. C. S. Lewis used it in his famous Narina chronicles, and it has been present in anime since the 90´s and early 2000´s with well-known shows like Escaflowne, and The Twelve Kingdoms. But in later years the genre seems to be completely absorbed by stories about geeky men (young and old) with boring and empty lives who get transported to another world where they get super epic powers, and all the other men want to be them and all the girls want to bang them. There seems to be at least one of this type of isekai anime coming out each season the last couple of years, and there only seems be an increase of these self-insert wish fulfilment stories in the LN universe. So, of course with that, some very typical and generic tropes have formed for this particular part of the genre and are used in different ways and combinations in the existing works. Which with the degree of imagination from the author could be more or less appreciated by the readers/audience.Well, it seems like the author of KnM just took the most basic and simplest generic tropes, characters and story direction from the manual and put it together in the most uninspired way possible. More like, he cut them out from mentioned manual, than pasted them together, and then happily nodded to himself for good days work and went for a beer. He probably had a mental check list going something like this:\uf0e8\tGeeky man with boring life gets hit by a car and dies – check\uf0e8\tIs reborn as the most powerful and talented magician EVER in another world – check\uf0e8\tMake the MC so naturally talented so his super powerful and famous grandparents have a hard time to keep up with him and fawn over how he can invent sooooo many new things that no one else in this magical world had ever thought of before such as transport portals – check\uf0e8\tWhy not have a magical school? Where the MC basically could be the highest professor since he so good at magic – check\uf0e8\tWhy not add a school study group which the teacher begs the MC to lead so the rest of the class can be super impressed 5 times an episode over how AMAZING the MC is – check\uf0e8\tHave the MC save a big breasted chick with blushing issues and a meek voice and personality in episode one (and then again and again in later episodes) – check\uf0e8\tHave all the high school girls dressed as sluts (the young men just love that)– check\uf0e8\tI probably can squeeze in a hot spring episode where some of the girls can group each other (because that´s was girls do at hot springs) – check\uf0e8\tAnd why not a beach episode, I bet I can squeeze in one of those as well, who doesn’t love busty anime girls in bikini - check\uf0e8\tNo need to give the characters actual personalities, just give them some quirks, different hair colours, titles and give some of the girl’s big tits that can be zoomed in here and there, that should be enough – check\uf0e8\tMake every other character so extremely less powerful, intelligent and significant compared to the MC so there is absolutely no doubt who´s boss – check\uf0e8\tThe kids like romance now days, right? Let´s have a super constipated and forced romance between two teenagers that barely can hold hands without stammering and blushing to death – check\uf0e8\tMmm, and of course the story needs a villain, all the other isekai has one. Let’s get one with the most generic reasons so the story don´t get to complicated for the youngsters - check\uf0e8\tOh, and yeah, let it be clear early in the story that the evil guy has shitload of respect for the MC´s powers, it would be awkward if anyone doubted that the MC had the slightest threat - check\uf0e8\tAm I forgetting anything… Hmmm.. Oh yeah! A magical training camp where the MC can be the cool trainer, and everyone can live together so some grouping moments can come to pass – checkOr something like that.KnM actually doesn´t even need to be an isekai, so little is referenced to the main characters past in the other world which was like the two first minutes of the show. He even got reborn and would logically have no memories of his past life, but since he is a special baby, he remembers his past life. The first episode actually gave me some hope that this could be a fun parody of the genre, but unfortunately it really tries to be a fun, easy going but legit isekai, which it in my eyes fails in every aspect. The comedy is dumb at best and is only amusing if you think a grandma yelling at someone, or friend tease you for your crush is funny. The magic system barely exists and are so poorly explored that it basically only exists so the MC can do cool stuff. The main conflict (if you even can call it main since the kids is off somewhere and goofing around for the most time), bare no tension or stronger emotions at all, its just there so the MC can be the hero and have people fawning over him. The dialogue is so stereotypical and generic that it almost gets comedic, especially the conversations between the good and evil guys, which could go along the lines;Good guy: “Why are you doing these evil things?”Bad guy: “Because I was treated badly, and now I got power so I want to destroy the whole world, mohahaha”Good guy: “Then I have to stop you with my much stronger magic, which the MC teached me!”I actually laughed in those situations, but for all the wrong reasons. I will tell you though, at this point I was totally on the bad guys side and wanted them to crush the MC and his little fan club. Because that is what all the side characters are – the MC´s fan club. There are other listed as mains but in reality, they are just the groupie and fan club leader.The art and animation are barely decent, with some very generic character designs and lazy drawn backgrounds. The animation and “fight” scenes are lacklustre at best and bad at worst. Shows like Fairy Tail can get away with that, since it´s already established and is a long running show but short shows like KnM has no excuses. If the budget is that bad, don´t even bother in the first place thanks.I don´t even remember the music, must have been so bland or overshadowed by the death of my braincells that it completely escaped my mind. The OP I remember on the other hand, and it’s quite fitting. It is ridiculous and super-duper silly, so it actually fits the show pretty well.This turned out to be a 1000+ word rant about how bad I thought the show was, but hopefully you got the gist of it and if this is something in your taste or not. I do have one positive thing to say about KnM though, at least it wasn´t a harem. absolutely zero expectations going into this show, since fanservicey isekai directed to teenage boys usually isn´t what I go for. But even with the non-existing expectations I was amazed how completely empty and uninspired an anime 2019 can get.Isekai has been a theme for a long time in storytelling, and actually have endless possibilities.

More like, he cut them out from mentioned manual, than pasted them together, and then happily nodded to himself for good days work and went for a beer. He probably had a mental check list going something like this:\uf0e8\tGeeky man with boring life gets hit by a car and dies – check\uf0e8\tIs reborn as the most powerful and talented magician EVER in another world – check\uf0e8\tMake the MC so naturally talented so his super powerful and famous grandparents have a hard time to keep up with him and fawn over how he can invent sooooo many new things that no one else in this magical world had ever thought of before such as transport portals – check\uf0e8\tWhy not have a magical school? Where the MC basically could be the highest professor since he so good at magic – check\uf0e8\tWhy not add a school study group which the teacher begs the MC to lead so the rest of the class can be super impressed 5 times an episode over how AMAZING the MC is – check\uf0e8\tHave the MC save a big breasted chick with blushing issues and a meek voice and personality in episode one (and then again and again in later episodes) – check\uf0e8\tHave all the high school girls dressed as sluts (the young men just love that)– check\uf0e8\tI probably can squeeze in a hot spring episode where some of the girls can group each other (because that´s was girls do at hot springs) – check\uf0e8\tAnd why not a beach episode, I bet I can squeeze in one of those as well, who doesn’t love busty anime girls in bikini - check\uf0e8\tNo need to give the characters actual personalities, just give them some quirks, different hair colours, titles and give some of the girl’s big tits that can be zoomed in here and there, that should be enough – check\uf0e8\tMake every other character so extremely less powerful, intelligent and significant compared to the MC so there is absolutely no doubt who´s boss – check\uf0e8\tThe kids like romance now days, right? Let´s have a super constipated and forced romance between two teenagers that barely can hold hands without stammering and blushing to death – check\uf0e8\tMmm, and of course the story needs a villain, all the other isekai has one. Let’s get one with the most generic reasons so the story don´t get to complicated for the youngsters - check\uf0e8\tOh, and yeah, let it be clear early in the story that the evil guy has shitload of respect for the MC´s powers, it would be awkward if anyone doubted that the MC had the slightest threat - check\uf0e8\tAm I forgetting anything… Hmmm.. Oh yeah! A magical training camp where the MC can be the cool trainer, and everyone can live together so some grouping moments can come to pass – checkOr something like that.KnM actually doesn´t even need to be an isekai, so little is referenced to the main characters past in the other world which was like the two first minutes of the show. He even got reborn and would logically have no memories of his past life, but since he is a special baby, he remembers his past life. The first episode actually gave me some hope that this could be a fun parody of the genre, but unfortunately it really tries to be a fun, easy going but legit isekai, which it in my eyes fails in every aspect. The comedy is dumb at best and is only amusing if you think a grandma yelling at someone, or friend tease you for your crush is funny. The magic system barely exists and are so poorly explored that it basically only exists so the MC can do cool stuff. The main conflict (if you even can call it main since the kids is off somewhere and goofing around for the most time), bare no tension or stronger emotions at all, its just there so the MC can be the hero and have people fawning over him. The dialogue is so stereotypical and generic that it almost gets comedic, especially the conversations between the good and evil guys, which could go along the lines;Good guy: “Why are you doing these evil things?”Bad guy: “Because I was treated badly, and now I got power so I want to destroy the whole world, mohahaha”Good guy: “Then I have to stop you with my much stronger magic, which the MC teached me!”I actually laughed in those situations, but for all the wrong reasons. I will tell you though, at this point I was totally on the bad guys side and wanted them to crush the MC and his little fan club. Because that is what all the side characters are – the MC´s fan club. There are other listed as mains but in reality, they are just the groupie and fan club leader.The art and animation are barely decent, with some very generic character designs and lazy drawn backgrounds. The animation and “fight” scenes are lacklustre at best and bad at worst. Shows like Fairy Tail can get away with that, since it´s already established and is a long running show but short shows like KnM has no excuses. If the budget is that bad, don´t even bother in the first place thanks.I don´t even remember the music, must have been so bland or overshadowed by the death of my braincells that it completely escaped my mind. The OP I remember on the other hand, and it’s quite fitting. It is ridiculous and super-duper silly, so it actually fits the show pretty well.This turned out to be a 1000+ word rant about how bad I thought the show was, but hopefully you got the gist of it and if this is something in your taste or not. I do have one positive thing to say about KnM though, at least it wasn´t a harem.', 'Utter garbage. Watching this was fucking painful. Terrible in almost every single way, I have to wonder why I didn’t have the heart to drop it. I should have known it wouldn’t get any better and yet I kept putting myself through this torture.Characters - Oh, the tropes! They’re everywhere. It’s completely mind boggling how little substance each character has. The villain had more personality than any of them combined.Plot - Not memorable (I literally had to refresh my memory every time a new episode came around because there was such little lasting impact in every episode)Art and Animation - They put more effort into...animating Sicily’s boobs than literally anything else in the showThe action is forgettable, and there are no parameters for anyone’s power potential or anything, the characters just shoot out random energy balls made out of one of the following : fire, ice, water, wind, electricity, or blue light. The minor villains, aka Demonoids, are so weak and underwhelming that they cannot properly set up for the impending final fight. Maybe this was the point, though. To show how Shin outclasses everyone around him and tries to save the kingdom by making “strong” magic accessible(?)Honestly I don’t even know what the point of the show is. Basically, MC shows up in kingdom after being secluded for his entire life (nobody knows why) at the same time that evil Demonoids (evil zombie minions) appear. A magic corps of high school students is created and then they fight the Demonoids. Does that not sound like the most underdeveloped plot to you? It’s unfathomable how this level of absolute mediocrity is acceptable anymore. What even is this show, if it’s not a cash-grab capitalizing on the trashy Isekai-loving degenerates out there? (I act like I’m not one of them)And don’t get me started on the goddamn ROMANCE. This “damsel in distress being saved by the OP Gary Stu” technique has been overdone and I don’t know why people actually watch this shit. The sexual tension? Painful. The confession? Painful. The egging on by grandma and grandpa and the gang™? Painful.Voice acting wasn’t bad, probably the best you could do for a series this caliber, so I don’t blame the VAs.Not a 1 because the yellow haired girl and the glasses girl were badass. Also, the series had at least a little self-awareness with the repeated references to cringey magic chanting and cliches.Just don’t watch it. It’s a waste of time. If you couldn’t tell, my review is disjointed because I feel mentally and spiritually maimed after having watched this. animating Sicily’s boobs than literally anything else in the showThe action is forgettable, and there are no parameters for anyone’s power potential or anything, the characters just shoot out random energy balls made out of one of the following : fire, ice, water, wind, electricity, or blue light.

Yes, it\'s rather run of the mill and ""safe"", but that doesn\'t make it bad. It\'s still very much enjoyable. Objectively speaking, the only area where it\'s truly lacking is the animation. At times it\'s very easy to tell that this one didn\'t get a big budget.Without spoiling much, a former chemistry/physics professor becomes an archmage in a world where magic mostly abides the rule of physics - this right here is the key part which makes it somewhat captivating.

First off, this anime is really bad and everything in this anime is bad. From the story, characters and animation you could tell the studio half-ass produced it. This anime is really terrible to the point where it is as if the studio produced it just so that it can attract a large audience as it is an isekai anime (which paid off as it is currently the 4th most watched in MAL) and mainly to get easy money. Just because the ‘isekai genre’...is so popular and has produce many above average/good and popular anime such as re:zero, slime, shield hero and etc does not mean studios can have the excUse to produce shitty anime just because it has a main character being hit by a fucking truck.Furthermore, this anime Can’t really be categorize as an ‘isekai anime’ as the main character being hit by a truck literally only contributed to his overpowered magic powers. To me this is just your underwhelming fantasy anime with an overpowered main character that gets the spotlight due to his bacKground and his abilities. The incident where he was hit by a truck was just so this anime can be put as an ‘isekai anime’ and gain a larger audience.The story in this anime is really generic , below mediocre and has no unique element at all in it.You might think the plot was written by a 15 year old teenager that has too much free time.  There is really no in depth details on the events that occur in it that leaves no significant impact to the viewer which made this show really lackluster. The characters in the anime are the worst of all, every character has a Personality of a blank paper that really makes you forget them .To make matter worse, there is so many  side characters that just popped up left and right throughout the anime.

The main appeals of KnM would be similar to shows such as Misfit of DK Academy and similar where he...outclasses everyone by a longshot, and gets the girl he wants (wish more anime would let the MC have the girl but yk). How it differs from the shows it mimics / shares a lot with is that the focus is less on his individual power and progression, and moreso on him bringing up the people around him whilst striking everyone with awe. Kenja no Mago should not be anyones favourite show as it seems its made specifically to be a guilty pleasure. Its very rewatchable (if you could not tell from my watchcount being like 34 atm I believe) and its a good show to watch when waiting for other shows to air or if you cannot find anything else. If you are expecting a masterpiece you have not found it, but if you are looking for a show worth sinking the 3-4 hours of its runtime into you have hit the mark. The first few episodes specifically are what keeps drawing me back to the show time and time again and the first watch (assuming you have not seen clips) of the first few episodes makes you super excited for whats to come.TLDR:Kenja no Mago is a mediocre show which uses overused tropes especially for isekai and makes them fun again, the main characters interactions with others are funny and its a perfect guilty pleasure / time waster. outclasses everyone by a longshot, and gets the girl he wants (wish more anime would let the MC have the girl but yk).

Because surely, someone, anyone in the production line of this series must have realised that they were creating the definition of generic (hated) isekai. Honestly what is the goal of this series, it\'s not going to sell merch, it\'s going to become a joke at best. It is the 100% literal definition of ""OOH FLASHY MAGIC MAKE GOOD ANIME ""Really nice animation on some of those spells though, good fluidity here and there and great colour use,...shame it\'s such a waste. shame it\'s such a waste.', ""Idk how can this be overall 7 or how to make a review without mention the anime, cause that's what you are doing, ofc you are gonna spoil cause you are speaking of the anime.It quickly starts with him being a loner, nothing new just random excuse to be from a world to other, but hey now you have another truck kill to put in a sad AMV or something.

The story is simply a bare-bones isekai, if you\'ve watched enough isekai (read...as ""over 3-4 isekai titles"") then you pretty much know the whole plot. A guy dies, reincarnated in anther world, there are demons and stuff, protagonist blasts everything out of the way, yada yada yada. The twist they\'ve added in their iteration of isekai is MC going to school. The characters cover all the tropes needed for school anime.  You can call it a isekai\'ed Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei.Having read till here if you think that there\'s nothing for you to watch then its okay, but if you feel the need for a simple no-brainer show you can watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon then give it  a try.Despite being a generic show, it delivers itself well enough that although not reaching the levels of Overlord and Slime it\'s much more enjoyable than Death March and Smartphone tomo ni. Having read it\'s manga too (yeah I had nothing better to do), I believe that if the producers work it out well, it would be a 7-7.5 for most people.Coming to the ratings:Story: 6.5/10Like I said it\'s pretty generic so don\'t expect muchArt: 7.5/10Its pretty good, I won\'t complaint about it, It doesn\'t have flashy scenes or breathtaking CGI but whatever they\'ve done is done decently enough.Sound: 7/10Again, not amazing but well enough that I can\'t complaint.Characters: 6/10Generic characters, don\'t expect muchEnjoyment: 7.5/10Maybe because I watched it without any expectations but I enjoyed it enough to check out it\'s manga (which is the main goal of such anime adaptations)-------------Overall: 7.5/10If I were to nitpick then I sure would find many flaws but that\'s not the point of this. Every title isn\'t out there to take down One Piece, it\'s a pretty watchable show so give it a try.

Fortunately for my attempts at a review, everything but the art in this show is beyond horrid.STORY: What story? Ok, so there is a hint of a story, sometimes, occasionally. Human demons making a country somewhere in the background, political intrigue hinted at but never shown, given depth, or even more than mentioned by a character once or twice. If I could give a lower score than a 1 for the story, I would...do so.ART: The art is the best thing about the show. That isn't saying much, however as the art is the bare minimum of what a show should have to still be considered a proper anime and not a bunch of unfunny comedy shorts. 5.SOUND: Where to begin. As I said, in most cases, I don't care about the sound. As long as the voices are different enough I can tell who is talking that's normally enough for me. For this anime, however, Silver Link decided that they were going to not vet how well a VA could do their character before signing their contracts for this show. The worst example of this is the prince's little sister who seems to be a 50-year-old woman pretending to be a 10-year-old, and poorly at that. Other than the main character and the love interest, everyone else's VAs seem like they either are untrained, unskilled, or really just didn't care.CHARACTER: What character? This time I'm not going to qualify that statement. The 'characters' aren't actually that. they are robots who pretend to have emotions and because of that never change or go past their 1-dimensional self. Their personalities are so straight forward you could classify them each with a single word. For the more fleshed out characters, those words would have to be hyphenated words, but still single words. 0. I don't care anymore that I can't actually choose 0, I'm doing it anyway.ENJOYMENT: 3, and only because I enjoy cringe from time to time.

I'd give it a 6/10 so far. I'm not a fan of the overpowered MC with a harem in an isekai world plot line. Spoilers ahead.The anime exceeds expectations by at least trying to do a decent job in the animation itself. The magic is all very fluid and colourful. Likewise, the world itself is designed fairly well. background characters are not CGI polygons moving like stiff robots. Even the world-design has some decent thought put into it. I was surprised to see...at one point that this world has advertisements and posters on the wall, for instance. The design is consistent. I was also pleasantly surprised to see some level of consistency in the design of the magic system. It's shown that Shin has superb control of magic because he has trained himself to have very precise control of his magic power and he can use the science of his past life to change the way he visualizes magic phenomenon. This gives him an edge. This is a far cry from other Isekai characters, who are powerful just because.Even the character of Shin isn't terrible. The kid has not been taught the common sense of the world and has a skewed perception of what a strong magician is. This is not by itself a problem. In fact, it's nice to see that his success doesn't get to his head. He is also smart during battle. He takes decisions well. When one of his enemies secretly escapes, he doesn't immediately assume that he's vanquished him. He gives it thought and lets the prince know that the enemy might be alive. That is solid work in my book.But the basic problem of the story is still Cecily. I wish Shin had been given a chance to explore this world himself and make relations by himself. As it is, he falls in love at first sight and volunteers to guard her from her stalker just to be near to her. From then on, with very little explanation for why the romance subplot is valuable or meaningful, we barrel headfirst into it. Everyone seems to support this weird love between Cecily and Shin. But Cecily herself seems bashful and reluctant to say she likes him. Unlike most of the other characters, Cecily doesn't appear to have some ambition, or some sense of her own morals and ideals, or some role she wishes to take in her society. She is pretty much defined as the MCs girl. Unlike her, Maria is a far more interesting character. The prince also seems to genuinely enjoy being friends with him because he likes interacting with someone who doesn't alter his behaviour toward royalty. Cecily alone is this paper moon, floating above a cardboard sea. I won't be surprised if she becomes a damsel in distress in the near future.The threat towards the kingdom and Shin's family is not yet clear. We know it includes demons. But the fact that this opponent can face Shin head-on despite his OP nature is reassuring. Not every anime can pull off the One-Punch Man effect well.You won't miss much if you forego this anime. There's certainly not much to this that's likely to change the way you see the world, or truly create a memorable, audio-visual experience. The story isn't fantastic.

The isekai genre has been flooded with content over the last couple years and leading to many people being dissatisfied with the state the genre is in. And perhaps that is Kenjas' weakness being in this genre, if it had the plain fantasy tag with a little less fan service it likely wouldn't of had such a rough time.The story revolves around Shin being reincarnated in a new world after dying on Earth. Unfortunately this is very sudden and nearly irrelevant to what plot does exist, we...have nearly no insight on who he is other than generic Japanese salary man. While in this other world he is adopted by Merlin (a wizard, who would have thought) that raises him and trains him in magic. And people complain often about overpowered protaganists that break a series, but when you are dealing with a 12 episode series it is tempting to bypass progression. The main plot of this series is no weaker than any other harem/isekai suffering from rushed villains, short acts, and fan service filler. There are plenty of busty and flat breasted jokes being put front and center. However even though the story is perhaps sub par there is some touching dialogue between Shin and Merlin especially even if it is a little superficial.Art is perhaps where the series is strongest, it is able to present magic in a visually appealing way. Explosions are cool looking and not fuzzy, grainy, or streaky. There is the odd cut to chibi style artwork sometimes when characters are making fun of one another which is not the best. If it is not better than some current releases it is atleast on par with quality.The characters in an isekai will always be the weakest. The lead Shin is not particularilly interesting aside from his overwhelming power. His character is what is called flat or static, he remains the same through the whole series without buidling growth. The side characters are mostlly just as weak being either forgettable or uninteresting. Mostly the backups just exist to tell jokes and prevent empty air time. Shins' adoptive grandparents are also just as barren of development and remain static the whole time as just comic relief. The relationship between Shin and Sizillen is actually refreshing for an isekai, even though he develops a harem there is no romantic interest. Usually the lead is just bombarded with women who love him but in this case only one does. It really pushes away from the norm where the women are just flaunting on the lead to be swatted away for some other lady. Unfortunately the lucky harem ladies are mostly for fan service but not to the extent of Picking up Girls in a Dungeon. Its mostly tasteful with only two egregious breast groping scenes, and the outfits were for the most part not revealing. Fanservice wise it is actually quite tame.Now whether or not you would enjoy this is up to you. For the everyday isekai viewer this would be a necessity to add to your viewing collection. But as I saw from plenty of other reviews this series use of standard cliches and common tropes along with a generally weak story will be off putting for the casual and critic alike. This series while not amazing by any means is able to provide a decent laugh and enough action to be worth killing time.TLDR a generic isekai with weak character development and lackluster story doesn't have much to differentiate it from a prolific market, but manages to present a overall enjoyable way to burn a couple hours. have nearly no insight on who he is other than generic Japanese salary man.

Kenja no Mago is this seasons isekai trash dump. Every season needs a punching bag to make you realize most of the anime airing ain’t that bad and Kenja No Mago fills that slot.Kenja No Mago likes to pass itself off as something different amongst the sea of endless copy and paste isekai shows. So what makes Kenja No Mago stand out from its competition? The main character has no common sense. So what does that mean? It means that our MC is an overpowered dense cookie cutter hero like every other isekai you have ever seen, but wait...it gets better. Unlike all the other dense isekai main characters who need a university professor to explain to them how body language works, our MC actually figures out the main girl has feelings for him albeit with some help. That’s right, our MC has actually mastered understanding a girls feelings putting the pairing into one of the most forced romances of the year. I’m a guy that likes when my romance makes sense and has natural progression. I’m not a fan of romance between two wet napkins that has the natural progression of an impromptu Las Vegas wedding.Besides our boring as cardboard MC there are so many other characters that make up the world of Kenja No Mago. We have the big bad villain that looks like a major threat to our hero and the world who is defeated within the first three episodes pretty easily. Nice going having your endgame villain be defeated early on so that I have no worries about him actually being a problem for the main hero later. Man, I wish more series would have the stones to completely deflate all kinds of suspense early on so that we don’t have to worry about our hero being in danger. Sarcasm aside the series throws another possible villain at us. We’ll call him Draco Malfoy for all you Harry Potter fans out there who goes from being a jealous antagonist, to a rival, and finally the MC’s friend all in the span of a few episodes because who cares about natural progression of anything. It gets better though because the MC doesn’t even acknowledge him as his friend. I mean he will say he is his friend but every time Draco talks to him it’s like he’s talking to a brick wall. There are other characters that make up our MC’s posse but they are pretty much irrelevant and I would be shocked if anyone knew their names.Art and animation is pretty standard which is about what I would expect from a copy and paste isekai show. Music is also pretty standard, however I must point out the ED, specifically the ending credit sequence for episode 6 because oh boy was it something. Last season the anime community was treated to a visual spectacle when Kaguya-Sama Love Is War dazzled everyone with their groundbreaking use of animation to create a gorgeous one off ED. Kenja No Mago saw the craze and told A-1 Pictures to “hold my beer” and took a stab at their own one off ED because how hard could it be. Simply put, it was an embarrassment that everyone involved with the making of Kenja No Mago should be ashamed for letting it see the light of day. Even if they may not have been directly responsible for the animation based on various reports, they still green lit it. It’s been a while since I had a good unexpected cringe. Honestly though it was the highlight of the entire series for better or for worse.“They are who we thought they were”. This quote perfectly describes Kenja No Mago. It’s pure Isekai trash and nothing more. If that’s your thing take the dumpster dive as I have or if it’s not then keep on walking, nothing to see here. it gets better.

What else? He is smart, powerful, and handsome.This anime is, indeed, not very original or mind-blowing like the commedable Death Note, but it does have some strong points.Fortunately, to begin with, the main character is not your dense, retarded boy. He knows his shit. He likes big breasts, cute girls, and he does not get easily deceived.Story [6/10]: The story is about the adventures of the main character. There is not much stuff going on. The main character is obviously going to...win all his fights and kill all the bad guys.Needless to say, this 2019 anime has relatively enjoyable art and sound. It is just as expected. The characters looked fine; the fight scenes, surprisingly, were very well done. And lastly, the opening and ending themes were also fine.The characters were all basically the same, except for the main character, of course, and the main villain. Honestly, I thought the anime was composed of two types of characters only: the main character/villain and all the bots. By bots I infer those types of characters who show no different identity. Those who are all weaklings, stupid, and always get surprised by the main character\'s skills. By the way, if you didn\'t know, literally every girl from this anime likes the MC.Now, onto some ranting, what I really did not understand was why the anime had begun with a reincarnation. Could it be to target the male working audience in Japan? I have no idea, but it was futile.In addition, this anime should have more progression and less pointless talking. For real, all the characters do is talk about how strong the MC is, and there is no useful discussion. I really hoped for a romantic progression, but until now, all the two of them do is blush and talk nonsense. How can they tell each other stuff like ""I will protect you"", ""Trust me!"", ""You are mine"", but they cannot even hold hands?This anime has some annoying points, but it is definitely not a shitty one. It could be boring and clichè to some veteran anime users.

The MC is OP to the point where there are no stakes. Of course, there's an antagonist and a clear threat that the main characters have to face off against but the main cast can easily breeze through it to the point where it becomes boring.The characters are pretty one note, they are either there...to be impressed by the MC's feats and/or there for fanservice. The romance is boring because they spend too much time doing nothing but blushing around each other.The animation, voice acting and overall sound are all perfectly fine, not spectacular but fine.In general, if you want something simple and dumb to watch, this is fine. to be impressed by the MC's feats and/or there for fanservice.

Yes, the story is generic and there really isn't anything else to say about it. So why give it a 6?

It was quite an interesting idea of making an op character more op than the op parents to flex with his op-ness. This however is not used because shin has noone to compare himself with as he defies set laws of this...world and does what none can even dream of accomplishing.

First of all i'm sorry for text quality but English is not my first language. I don't want to make you lose too much time so i'll just go straight to the point and say that you should only be watching this if you're looking for some lighthearted magic romcom with nice and light comedy and some really sweet and lovey-dovey moments without Harem-like settings like most other romcom shows. Basically you should watch it for the fun of it and...not for finding some deep meaning to life, as to why a person should die and be reincarnated in a OP MC in a world in danger of extinction in order to save it. It's really a light and fun ride if you want to enjoy some time just watching anime without forcing yourself too much.Really, this anime doesn't take itself too seriously and I wouldnt want to spend too much time explaining why I think the creators of this well-thinked romcon were quite smart in pulling it off without spending too much screen time on the story and more on the comedy part of it.Please keep in mind,This is a PG-13 Show so if you're 18yo or more and already gave up on the child that resides inside of you and think highly of yourself, probably you shouldn't even be here in the first place. That being said,I really think this should be enough for you to decide if you should watch this or not without spoiling any further. Still, I'll try to explain,without really spoiling main plot points, the aspects of this show that I saw as very clever given the type of anime it is and why I think is really worth watching (Once again, if this it the kind of show you're looking for). To easy the reading on those of you kind enough to still be here, I'll make a list:-- ROMANCE : this is what i enjoyed the most about this show. The way it's made is definitely not original nor makes it better than other romance anime but given the type and genre of this show it's very worth noticing it even gets to show some really lovey-dovey stuff in the first place.Like most rom-coms of this kind, the MC is thick from the start BUT he's, at one point, able to step forward (with all the comedic moments that come along) and actually do something love related, unlike most MC. This is something worth praising since it's unexplicably quite difficult to find anime that get to show some kind of real development so early in the story.Some would probably argue that's due to poor story telling but, once again, this is a romcom and we all know how most shows (even very good ones) never got, and never will, a second season so that you'll never see your favorite heroine even hold hands with Mc and, in harem-like settings , you wont even know if she was chosen or not.This anime gets rid of half of these gimmicks and you get to see some love development at the very least. This itself makes for a 8/10 in the romcom scenery.-- Mc dies and get isekaied in a new world without any further explanation as to why: this could be seen as a bad thing to new viewers of the genre but as i've said before, if you unsterstand that this is basically a romantic comedy(which i was looking for) i felt relieved that they didnt deprived me of an entire episode just to entroduce a god-like being that for some reason had to choose this very ordinary guy that happens to be our MC to be the savior of the day. Instead we find this very normal guy to die and be reborn as a baby in this new world and not just teleported with OP abilities. It's stated that he still has memories of his past life which felt the only bad part to me but this gimmic it's what keeps everything working and also the very base to what his  NOT SO OP power really comes from. I suggest you bare with it because i think this is really what someone wouldnt get from this anime and dislike it for.  Also people should always remind themself that fantasy as well as fairy tales and legends need extraordinary settings to happen, that's why most MC in this genre are so vague and lack of originality. In this particular case this is exactly why any human with his circumstances would problably have shared his same path to glory.-- as a baby he's found and  taken in by (one of) the most powerful magician in this world and raised by him, his also very powerful ex wife and a bunch of others important characters. I wont spoil anything for you, but this again was quite clever to me cause it's the very root as to why the mc gets too be powerful as he is. Being raised and trained by these famous people also will make it easy to set his future relationships so, again, we don't have to lose that much viewing time for useless developments of characters that we already know are needed for comic relief since this is, yet again,a rom-com isekai and not a ReZero-like isekai.-- The world-saving story itself doesnt get too much screentime. As a matter of fact, that's why we don't really need for a reason as to why the mc got isekaied in the first place, why he didnt get extraordinary power from a Higher being and why there seems to be no big conspiracy nor a Maou-sama trying to destroy the world. The Mc was reborn in this new magic world and growing up he got so powerful just because they tried to give a meaning to magic itself as a if it was really linked to science.People from this world can use magic but know little about physics and science in general so they use magic in the usual way we are accustomed to in other animes. Our MC though still has knowledge from being a human in our world (i think high school knowledge would be enough for this but he also probably went to college, not really important anyway) this effects his way of understanding and using magic hence his strenght, this memory stuff is also used for comedic relief along the way.--> thats why MC is special and powerful yes, but not really this super OP god-tier being. As of matter of fact this makes it possible for him to teach and make his group of peers strong enough to not just sit on the bench but gets them on the comedy-trunk. This can be the very reason for him to get isekaied and as to why you needed a generic character in the first place, cause anyone in the same circumstances could have problably got the same level.In the end, I really want to make people understand that this is not a show good for its story, well written mc, background conspiracies or a big evil plan. You should really just sit back and enjoy it for the fun interactions between characters and the sweet love story that for once is taken forward. It is a lighthearted ride but its fun and enjoyable if you really understand what kind of show you're watching instead of putting yourself on a pedestal thinking you're some kind of art critic and this is some kind of ReZero-wannabe show (which definetely is not).For those of you that got here, thank you for reading and i'm really sorry both for my english and this kind of analysis which really shouldn't even be done since this show its not really about that, yet the story is not half as bad as it is being described.I really enjoyed watching this show and that's why I tried to give  readers a different point of view,cause i think a lot of people would like this show too but are compelled to not take it up by 1-2 rated unobjective reviews. Opinions are all fair but rating 1-2 any show (not only this) in most cases means that you were not part of the audience ment for it. So you're unrightly just ruining someone elses work.  People, if you're reading this,please, be careful when judging something and know when probably you shouldnt even be doing it in the first place. not for finding some deep meaning to life, as to why a person should die and be reincarnated in a OP MC in a world in danger of extinction in order to save it.

As of matter of fact this makes it possible for him to teach and make his group of peers strong enough to not just sit on the bench but gets them on the comedy-trunk. This can be the very reason for him to get isekaied and as to why you needed a generic character in the first place, cause anyone in the same circumstances could have problably got the same level.In the end, I really want to make people understand that this is not a show good for its story, well written mc, background conspiracies or a big evil plan. You should really just sit back and enjoy it for the fun interactions between characters and the sweet love story that for once is taken forward. It is a lighthearted ride but its fun and enjoyable if you really understand what kind of show you're watching instead of putting yourself on a pedestal thinking you're some kind of art critic and this is some kind of ReZero-wannabe show (which definetely is not).For those of you that got here, thank you for reading and i'm really sorry both for my english and this kind of analysis which really shouldn't even be done since this show its not really about that, yet the story is not half as bad as it is being described.I really enjoyed watching this show and that's why I tried to give  readers a different point of view,cause i think a lot of people would like this show too but are compelled to not take it up by 1-2 rated unobjective reviews. Opinions are all fair but rating 1-2 any show (not only this) in most cases means that you were not part of the audience ment for it. So you're unrightly just ruining someone elses work.  People, if you're reading this,please, be careful when judging something and know when probably you shouldnt even be doing it in the first place."", ""This is a spoiler free review!!If you are fan of overpowered/isekai anime like Overlord and don't even care how bad the story/writing is, then this anime is for you OR if you are new to anime mabye you would give this anime 10/10.I dropped this anime because of the character development, the main protagonist tries to be bad-ass but failed at it. I give 6 for art because it's the only thing stands out in the anime. Actions/fights seems good. The main protagonist doesn't even have any REAL OBJECTIVE like want to be stronger or anything, because he's already overpowered. So he's just doing what...overpowered characters do, like defeating any bad people that is threat to any of his friends/family/kingdom, being bad-ass, getting famous.So this anime is actually enjoyable if you run out of other animes, but this anime doesn't really worth the time if you watch it for real. overpowered characters do, like defeating any bad people that is threat to any of his friends/family/kingdom, being bad-ass, getting famous.So this anime is actually enjoyable if you run out of other animes, but this anime doesn't really worth the time if you watch it for real."", ""Before we begin, I wish to point out this is my first review!To start I personally enjoyed the Anime thus far and would love to see a renewal for a second season!The anime is a fun one to watch, the characters are simple and easy to like, the world is very well put together as well as the sound quality and voice acting.Many may disagree with this statement but when I personally watch an Anime I tend to not dig too deep into the specifics, the show is enjoyable and that is what I believe should make a great Anime!I absolutely love the comedy...in the show, it is simple. fun and cheesy. It could be more thought out but I believe the Anime does fine on that point. The romantic aspect is also nice it is an fast moving relationship the characters have with one another! Although it does take a few episodes to get there.The plot is very nice and easy to grasp the concept of what is going on as well which is always a good thing for a show that I watched for just a time passer!Throughout the Anime you see many characters grow and get stronger as it progresses which is always nice.In the end, the Anime is very fun and enjoyable to watch as long as you don't delve too deep into the specifics of each little detail. Sure, it isn't perfect, nothing is but as a Show to watch to pass time it is an amazing show to watch and very enjoyable! I would recommend anyone who enjoys shows such as Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, Shield Hero or really any anime like those to watch this!

It's full of clichés and you've probably seen so many different types of work (not even necessarily anime) exactly like this. Seriously. This show is nothing new and follows a very standard plot with standard tropes (fanservice, way too overpowered MC, etc.).That being said it was still enjoyable. I enjoyed seeing the progression between the MC and his love interest. So anyone who likes romance would probably like this. The plot was engaging enough where you could start in up and be hooked from episode 1 onward. The music was also good.Overall, if you want a...quick action/romance anime to enjoy without it being particularly memorable this is a good bet. Just don't expect this show to be like Hunter X Hunter or anything. quick action/romance anime to enjoy without it being particularly memorable this is a good bet.

I went on ahead writing this review because I think the anime didn\'t do the manga, at least, any justice. I\'m aware of its light novel but I prefer reading manga because I\'m not a fan of reading through a lot of text. Anyway, I enjoyed reading the manga even though people say it\'s kinda generic and all. And when they announced that there will be an anime version of this, I got really excited and decided to read the manga up to its latest chapter first before watching the anime. And after watching a few episodes...of the anime, I was quite disappointed how... bland it was. *sigh*The anime completely skipped a lot of good parts or just skimmed over it. There were also scenes that didn\'t align very well with the manga, at least, which destroyed the mood for me like ""Oh boy! This is where the part where he\'s gonna..."" and BAM!!!, ""not quite I was expecting"" kind of thing. The pacing was just too fast it ruins everything like the story, character\'s interactions. And don\'t get me started with the excessive use of powerpoint slide transitions. I don\'t want to nitpick too much but yeah that\'s about it for me.The only thing I find it quite good in this anime was its art. I personally liked it than the manga but other than that, there\'s not much more to it.TL;DR: So yeah, I recommend you to just read the manga if you\'re interested.

I don\'t feel bad about giving things away as in my opinion this was trash, but if you are planning to watch it, this might give some stuff away. Don\'t worry though, it can\'t give too much away because nothing unexpected happens the entire show.Oh boy was this a boring show. I had pretty low expectations going into it and they were still let down. I\'ll start with the perks:1) Pretty great animation actually. the magic was super well done, looked very cool and the characters were decently pretty to look at. Major redeeming point of the show. Only reason...it deserved even 1 star.2) The romance of the show is at least not more of the wishy-washy bull**** that normally goes down in anime, with the MC being a complete loser who couldn\'t make up his mind about what to eat for breakfast. It was refreshing to see an actual choice made by an MC and not just an extremely generic harem anime again.3) I guess I didn\'t hate the MC? At least he didn\'t make me want to gouge my eyes out. See point #2.OK welp positives over. Onwards to the negatives.1) The writers even managed to make the decisive, actually-made-a-choice romance of the anime boring as all hell. The heroine of the anime was so bland as that they could\'ve replaced her with an actual horse and the story would have been pretty much unchanged. She\'s a walking stereotype of the genre- a simpering ""oh maybe he doesn\'t like me even though we\'ve been eye banging eachother for the past 7 episodes"" type. Her emotional development is nonexistent. If not for the intervention of other characters in the show, I\'m 100% sure they would\'ve been trapped in the harem hell of indecision even with no one else to challenge her, just cause she\'s such a complete pansy.2) Man was this show predictable. I\'m pretty sure I could\'ve sat down and wrote the entire series start to finish in one day... back when I was in second grade. The main character is super overpowered? OK, thats cool, at least he will have some internal struggles and setbacks he can\'t overcome even with his powers right? Wrong. In the first 3 episodes he literally kills a man and it looks like those internal struggles might crop up. Nope, he\'s completely over it about 5 seconds later. They could\'ve had his friends be at least a tiny bit worried about these events. Maybe just like a hey we just watched that guy butcher someone and have apparently no emotional reaction to it, isn\'t that scary? Nah, they\'re totally cool with it too.OK well fast forward a bit, they have all predictably had a training montage and are now also super powered (of course not as OP as he is though). Now it\'s time for Scooby and the Gang to go to war against other superpowered demons that have virtually wiped a nation from the face of the earth, presumably killing hundreds of thousands of people. Finally, some fights that won\'t be boringly one-sided for them! Again, completely wrong. MC and pals completely wipe the floor with these demonic killing machines, barely taking even a scratch. But wait! There is one coming now that is obviously (for unspecified reasons) even more of a badass demon than the others! Surely there will be some serious consequences for our heroes now? Hahaha no you idiot. The evil boss does even manage to down some of them- but they are all perfectly OK afterwards. End score- a hundred or so super powerful demons dead, our heroes might have gotten a few bruises, or even broken a nail.

The ""Isekai"" element is barely there, since it\'s just a Japanese guy we see for all of 10 seconds in the first episode getting reincarnated in a fantasy world for no reason, and he only retains a few fragments of memory from our world; and he just has every possible advantage you could imagine, being adopted and trained by the greatest magician...in the world while simultaneously receiving martial training from the greatest swordsman in the kingdom, and also having ridiculous, off-the-charts natural magical talent even beyond that for no clear reason (they hint multiple times that snippets of modern-day science he remembers from his previous light help him to invent new, powerful spells, but he does way too much for that alone to really explain it). In no respect do any of the obstacles or adversaries he faces throughout the series come even close to giving him a real challenge; they try to build up the impression of stakes at a couple points, but I never believed there was a chance that the heroes could lose or even suffer a serious setback. So, the entire show is almost entirely devoid of conflict and stakes because you never feel like the protagonist or any of his friends are ever in any real danger. His personality is just nice and somewhat socially awkward in a banal way, and all of the supporting cast is similarly generic and bland, although a few of them are are least somewhat more interesting than our MC. The art is serviceable but unremarkable.I\'m not saying that this series is absolute garbage; it has some decent action scenes, and some OK humor here and there. I will applaud it for mostly avoiding the kinds of perverted humor and exploitative fanservice of female characters that so many anime suffer from. I was also pleasantly surprised with how it ditches the typical shonen protagonist harem or love triangle in favor of a straightforward, believable, monogamous, and kind of sweet romance between him and one of his female classmates, that actually gets acknowledged and developed within the story. Most of all, the fluffy, low-conflict story makes it a pretty relaxing watch, something that can be kind of enjoyable to just turn your brain off and soak in for a bit, especially if you enjoy the kind of power-fantasy wish-fulfillment that the protagonist here offers. That was the main reason I actually ended up watching this all the way through to the end, despite having all these criticisms from the beginning; and I have to admit that I don\'t really regret the time I spent watching it, but I don\'t expect I\'ll ever re-watch it, and it\'s not a series I\'d really recommend to anyone over checking out any of the million other shows coming out nowadays. in the world while simultaneously receiving martial training from the greatest swordsman in the kingdom, and also having ridiculous, off-the-charts natural magical talent even beyond that for no clear reason (they hint multiple times that snippets of modern-day science he remembers from his previous light help him to invent new, powerful spells, but he does way too much for that alone to really explain it). In no respect do any of the obstacles or adversaries he faces throughout the series come even close to giving him a real challenge; they try to build up the impression of stakes at a couple points, but I never believed there was a chance that the heroes could lose or even suffer a serious setback. So, the entire show is almost entirely devoid of conflict and stakes because you never feel like the protagonist or any of his friends are ever in any real danger. His personality is just nice and somewhat socially awkward in a banal way, and all of the supporting cast is similarly generic and bland, although a few of them are are least somewhat more interesting than our MC. The art is serviceable but unremarkable.I\'m not saying that this series is absolute garbage; it has some decent action scenes, and some OK humor here and there. I will applaud it for mostly avoiding the kinds of perverted humor and exploitative fanservice of female characters that so many anime suffer from.

It also still manages to be enjoyable with likable characters, but let us not kid around it is still generic as all hell.

Shin is...your perfect Gary Stu.  Once Shin is a teenager, his adoptive grandmother wants to rectify this insufficiency by getting him out of the woods to interact with his peers. So she sends him to what is essentially high school but for training magicians and knights. There he makes friends and is alerted to the treats of demonified humans, which he and his friend group battle through the rest of the season. The comedy for the show is that Shin is so powerful he does things defy common sense and elicit comedic reactions from his friends and guardians. It works sometimes, but other times it gets overplayed.If I had to place another flaw, it would be that the friend group in WMG is too big for me to care about all of them. What I find to be WMG's, saving grace is its romance bit.  Shin and Cecily don't beat around the bush about their feelings for each other. In this way, WMG differentiates from other typical shows in this genre who like to drag their feet on romance.All that being said, WMG is not all that creative and is comparable to junk food tasty but nutritionally deficient.

In Konosuba, Kazuma drags Aqua with him as pay...back for making fun of him for dying, And Rimaru from Isekai Slime was turned into a Slime because of how he died.Shin how ever is just in another world because reasons. The show tries to justify he's greatness because he applies science to magic.

What\'s more they\'ve cut quite a lot of content that was present in the manga, and that.... resulted in a very odd experience where you can\'t help but think that everybody is fooling around and nothing about the situation is serious. Add to that uninteresting characters, production values that seems to keep decreasing with every episode and the end result ends up being disappointing.Story: 4/10.Quite dull, and somehow...manages to be a step-down from the manga.

I don\'t really care for the concept of transportation into another world, I just really like seeing the limits of another world. After seeing the first episode of Wise Man\'s Grandchild, I was easily hooked because this story doesn\'t foot around the issue that the MC is NUTS OP, and the plot revolves around that entire idea.However, when we get into his teenage life, then the series really drags on and contradicts itself. A big plot point of the beginning was to make sure that our MC doesn\'t get militarized because...his power level is akin to literal god status. Yet, we get 6 episodes in, and he\'s literally made a focus group that can be militarized into battle. Wait? What?!So, Earlshide (the setting\'s country) metaphorically has multiple students who are walking NUCLEAR BOMBS to help fend against Humanoids who can also be created, never gets explained well, and are similar to walking NUCLEAR BOMBS.Now, that sounds exciting, but the fights don\'t even last longer than 10 seconds a pop. The only things viewers get are a few moments where some of the cast are squaring off with Humanoids, but cast a couple of spells and they\'re all dead. The longest fight is about 1/2 an episode long, but most of it is filled with exposition like, ""I DON\'T WANNA HURT HIM... but... I have to hurt him! But, he\'s not a bad guy. What happened to him?""Dribble that shouldn\'t get praise because it\'s nothing, but empty calories on a diet consisting of sugar and CGI magic particles.If I haven\'t made it clear, I don\'t think this show is good.

I will update it to an in-depth review by the time the series ends.""1 Arc in, and yup it\'s definitely your generic OP Main Character isekai""Think of every cliche in the OP MC isekai troupe, fit them in 1 bag and you get Kenja no Mago. Almost every aspect of this anime is generic in someway, everything that you see happen, you have seen elsewhere, multiple times at that. From the generic loner dying only to be reborn as a...OP MC in an isekai world to saving heroines in a back alley from thugs. If you\'re a seasoned anime watcher, just from the first episode alone, the amount of cringe might put you off. But then why, you might ask, did i rate it a 7 as it is.The answer is quite simply, the execution. While the story is an embarrassing 4/10 the way it is brought to life on screen deserves recognition (8/10 imo), from the angle and camera movement, sharp movements and vivid animations. There is a feeling that everything happening on screen, especially during fight scenes or ""feat of strength"" scenes, are trying to impress you and not waste your time.

But then why, you might ask, did i rate it a 7 as it is.The answer is quite simply, the execution. While the story is an embarrassing 4/10 the way it is brought to life on screen deserves recognition (8/10 imo), from the angle and camera movement, sharp movements and vivid animations. There is a feeling that everything happening on screen, especially during fight scenes or ""feat of strength"" scenes, are trying to impress you and not waste your time.

I wasn't asking for much. Just a pleasant relaxing watch. You know, a normal trash Isekai that I could secretly enjoy. Hell, I actually really liked the manga. Was it anything special, orignial or insipired? Hell no. But it was fine.This though... Jesus Christ where do I begin?The animation is just embaressing. Seriously, I wasn't expecting much but dear lord how souless were the animation staff when they made this. It barely has any movement, the show in general or even the bloody OP.Then we get to the voice acting which is passable at best and at worst- I'm looking at you princess-...it is so bad that it pulled me out of the show so hard it was like I got hit by Truck-kun. I mean dear lord that VA in particular was so awful.The story was fine. I mean yeah I didn't especially like it- the manga was still better- but it was the usual isekai fair. Nothing great but nothing terrible.Look, anime is meant to be manga that moves but this didn't have any movement and was worse than the manga by a fucking mile. I know this was supposed to be based off of the light novel so maybe that was the problem but seriously, if you think that this is even okay then I beg you to read the manga.I know that a lot of people only watch anime and don't read manga- seroiusly I am with you. Until recently I was one of you. But when it comes to something like this where the manga could even be described as good whilst the anime is just apalling... do yourselves a favour and read the manga instead.

If garbage could be animated and published in the anime medium – I’m fairly certain that this would be it.Isekai as a genre isn’t bad per se, it’s these types of titles that make isekai the equivalent of a burning dumpster fire. Throughout the years, we’ve encountered a number of different isekai titles that are similar to each other. Similar as in being a dumpster fire of a show. We have seen the infamous smartphone isekai, and some have even seen two smartphone isekais – one worse than the other. We’ve seen self-inserts get killed by...a truck and reincarnated in another world, in fact that’s almost a must if you want your title to be classified as an isekai. We’ve seen all the tropes, we’re familiar and accustomed to them. For some god darned reason, the isekai genre is stuck with them and has been for quite a while.Kenja no Mago is by no means groundbreaking, innovative or revolutionary – it still follows most of the isekai tropes but decides to do some things in a different manner. However, the core concept of what makes a modern isekai title is included in Kenja no Mago. The core concept of what makes an isekai can nowadays be defined with the following: overpowered protagonist, a forced love interest or 12, dogshit villain and a story that amounts to nothing in the end.Moreover, I believe this to be the eternal curse of the isekai genre and that most of it succumbs to lazy, hack-ish writing that inspires other writers to follow the same formulaic style of writing to create a mediocre narrative. It isn’t a secret that most isekai titles often have their protagonist be of the self-insert nature.Enter Kenja no Mago. Kenja no Mago, like many other stories, follows almost all the aforementioned tropes and has no defined or distinguishable style, doesn’t have any decent or likable characters and has one dogshit of a villain.Now, I could go to various lengths to call Kenja no Mago garbage, mediocre, dumpster fire, and so on but I won’t. Mainly because there isn’t even a notion or any semblance of what one could call a story. They’re not even attempting at creating an interesting or immersive narrative. Half of the times, it feels like they have a checklist of isekai tropes that they must include or else someone will die or something. Kenja no Mago doesn’t even try to be in the slightest bit authentic, except for maybe a forced and superficial relationship between two characters.The isekai genre, is however, my guilty pleasure. I like me some decent isekai, but not this. This is the equivalent of shooting yourself in the head with a 12 gauge double barrel shotgun and somehow surviving for 4 more hours before finally dying.The music was garbage. The animation made me lose 90% of my vision due to that episode 6 ending. I usually don’t pay enough attention to openings or endings of shows. But I must say this, after that episode 6 ED, I felt completely violated. The animation in general is complete and utter garbage. It’s generic. What’s worse is: it’s lazy. I have not noticed any CGI monstrosities but this show is a monstrosity of its own. I wish there was something even remotely likable in this show, but alas, there is nothing.To briefly summarize this show for those who are interested, here I describe the show as follows: Gary Stu is overpowered to the point of being God, hunts for demons, joins some magical high school, fights a generic and shitty villain, beach episode, gets engaged with a girl among other things. That list is in chronological order and there is no depth to any of the events that take place. It never even attempts to challenge the audience with anything more serious than “look, MC is overpowered” for the 48th billion time in the show.Of course, there is no character development, no growth or anything particularly interesting about any of the characters. The protagonist is actually the worst offender of this show. Not only did the author decide to make him overpowered to the point of questioning God’s existence in that world, but he also made him good at everything else except for the social parts. The protagonist can just asspull a new spell to impress his classmates and they’ll all go on a circlejerk about how powerful the protagonist is. It’s rather unfortunate but this happens on an episode basis.In conclusion, if you want to watch dogshit for 4 hours straight, be my guest. Watching this show will never challenge you in any sort of way – you will be numb to what’s happening because there is no tension, there are no stakes and there is no sense of urgency. There’s nothing in this show. I think that watching a dog lick his left ball would frankly be more entertaining than watching Kenja no Mago. a truck and reincarnated in another world, in fact that’s almost a must if you want your title to be classified as an isekai.

I personally don’t feel like I have to watch a mindblowing masterpiece every time I watch an anime, sometimes you just want to relax and simply enjoy an anime. I laughed, I was surprised, I felt cringy, I shipped couples, and I finished it with a big smile on my face, for me that’s a good enjoyable anime, even though it’s not popular or cult and hipster. Just don’t expect to be watching an award winning show, but it’s definitely a warm and enjoyable...one.What’s funny is that this anime makes fun of it’s own clichés and at the same time has very ‘unclichéd’ aspects. The main character is actually smart, speaks his mind about his thanks and feelings and is a really nice person that can actually kill when necessary. Almost all of this story’s cast are all good-natured nobles and privileged, also not really that common. The characters are not just filler background people, their personalities are quite unique and charismatic and smoothly evolve throughout the series, which is rare, and the villain has an actual plausible and decent backstory, he’s not justified but I don’t even blame him. I really feel like decent romantic action/adventure animes are a rare species, and this one was pretty nice and satisfactory, if you’re into romance there’re more than one established couples and relationships to enjoy, also rare on this genre.If I had to resume I’d say this is a very enjoyable ordinary over-fanserviced romcom action anime that gets better with each episode. Watch at least 3 episodes before you decide to drop it. The score I'd give is really 7.5. I do believe the light novel must be a lot better, the adaptation I think made it a lot more mediocre than it should have been because the story is actually interesting and the characters have a decent amount of substance. The animation though is above average throughout the whole show, especially on the action scenes and special effects, which actually surprised me. The soundtrack is also good.Of course this is all my opinion, but I'd say I'm a pretty ordinary, sane and romantic person, just so you can have an idea of who wrote this. I try to make my reviews brief (actually briefer than this one), focusing on answering these three questions:- IS THE ENDING GOOD?- DOES THE MAIN COUPLE END TOGETHER?- IS IT WORTH MY TIME?***If you don't want to know the answers to these 3 questions you should stop reading right now.***If you're like me who just want to know if the story is worth your time, go ahead. So with no further ado:Is the ending good? YESDoes the main couple end up together? YESIs it worth my time?

I think the anime would of been a lot better if it choose its audience better if the anime was for kids why include the lackluster romance and the fan service and if its targeted to teens why make the...plot so childish. plot so childish."", 'Cliche? CheckRandomly warped to another world? CheckHarem? NopeKenja no Mago, for much a terrible show that if you watched it you should feel ashamed for it, but is it really this trash as people make it looks like? The real answer is not really. BUt why then, why is it so bad-talked? This can me summed up in one word: ""Expectative"". The expectative that we finally get another good-writen isekai show, which we\'ve been absent of one since Hai to Gensou no Grimgar aired, mind you. But what dows this have to do with anything at all? Well, it\'s simple, it\'s entirely like how some...people go watch Violet Evergarden expecting action and find it boring instead, much like so, people went watching Kenja no Mago expecting the new Re:zero or the new Overlord.Which is completely wrong, since in any point at all KnM stablished itself as as a Good-Written or original show. With this in mind, I\'ll start with which are the real problems of this show.First of all, being an isekai. This should never ever be considered a problem or negative point, but for Kenja, it is. Think about it, it\'s completely unnecessary for Shin to be transported into another world, since he starts as a baby anyways. What\'s the real point of it being an isekai show aside from commercial and popularity values? There isn\'t any at all, he could have very well been just a normal citizen of the world, he\'s the grandson of the most powerful character in the show at the beggining, nothing would have changed at all.Secondly, TOO MANY CHARACTERS. KnM has way too much relevant characters, which that if they would get any development, the entire 12 episodes would have to be dedicated to each one, which obviously didn\'t happen at all, and ironically, the villain is the one to get an entire episode on his story and the only to get some ""development""(if you can count that as development lol)And third, the is no plot nor an objective until we get to episode 10 and 12 respectivelly. Which is really ironic, because one of the only advantages of writing an isekai is that you always can use the cheap objective of the MC wanting to return home or know why he was transported into this world. But like I said, it\'s isekai just for having an easier time into getting popular :v, and the show instead focuses on showing us the Slice of Life of Shin and the training of the other 11 friends.With all this negative points, is there even anything good on this show? Well, there is, it isn\'t the biggest relevant stuff, but it\'s something that at least puts it above other isekais like Smartphone or Valkyria.First of, KnM isn\'t a Harem, this is weirdly a big plus to me, even tough I like harem, and it also does not use the infamous ""dere"" copy-paste personalities that almost all other isekais do use, which in itself is also a Double-Edged Sword, as since the author opted for not using a copy-paste personality, he didn\'t create a remarkable personality at all for a bunch of the characters. But why is this a positive point? This leave the author free to develop those said characters in the future(at least in the Light Novel, as I know there isn\'t gonna be a second season).Second, Shin is not the only overpowered character, unlike ALL other isekai(except Grimgar), which characters exist only for being romantic pairs, harem members or comedy fodders. Which means that the author can show the training and the development of said characters, fact which becomes evident in the last two episodes, where they use their team-work(which for the first time in generic isekais, was actually shown them practicing, in fact, until episode 9 almost all we get are their everyday lives and training), and if Shin is, for example, the equivalent of ""Jiren"", his friends are ""Goku Super Saiyan Blue"", where even tough Shin is the strongest, his friends aren\'t just rescue fodder for shin, and rather companions. And this opens up the possibility of the author doing better and better fights in the future.Kenja also has an interesting, but not much explored Magic System, which sometimes are shown shin applying formulaes that he knew from past life into his magics, as example on the flying magic were he manipulated the gravity.The animation, well, it\'s not my strongest point to judge this, but it\'s not bad. It has a bright and colorful color palette that did translate well the overall mood of the show, it had decent action scenes and the most important, the magic effects were explendid, which since this is a magic anime, this should be an important aspect, right?Soundtrack wasnt too shabby either, nothing remarkably, but I enjoyed the OP, which was very creative to me.In a final evalutation. Kenja failed in being something new, and was a good example of ""More of the Same"", in an isekai meter of evalutation, this gets a 7, it was infinitely better than Smartphone and Valkyria, but it isn\'t anything new either, and cant compete with Re:Zero. In an overall anime rating I give it a 5, as an anime it was right in the middle, wasn\'t trash as people forced it to be, but isn\'t the greated thing ever. Summing it up and taking the medium, it gets to the 6 grade. Which summed with my personal taste modifier gets it a 7, which is the value that will be on my profile. people go watch Violet Evergarden expecting action and find it boring instead, much like so, people went watching Kenja no Mago expecting the new Re:zero or the new Overlord.Which is completely wrong, since in any point at all KnM stablished itself as as a Good-Written or original show.

While I went in with extremely low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised and ultimately found Wise Man\'s Grandchild pretty entertaining.---Story: 1/5 (Terrible)The plot is without a doubt the least interesting aspect of Kenja no Mago. It follows the typical shounen/isekai formula: a normal person is born into another world as an incredibly powerful prodigy, defeating powerful enemies and leaving the inhabitants of the fantastical realm in awe. This structure is not deviated from in the slightest...-- the show includes all the tropes of the isekai genre, and fails to offer much more than that in terms of narrative. This is especially frustrating when the show\'s entire premise is considered. It would have been far more interesting to see the typical isekai formula derailed due to the main character\'s total lack of common sense.---Art: 3/5 (Good)Though there is nothing extraordinary about Kenja no Mago\'s visuals, it is never terribly ugly, and there are multiple action sequences that are impressively animated. Unfortunately, not all is good in this department; the only unique and interesting character designs were those of Schtrom and Miria, neither of which manages to be more than just decent. The rest of the cast sports painfully bland and unmemorable designs which are nearly as generic as the plot.---Sound: 2/5 (Bad)The voice acting in Kenja no Mago is not bad at all, but is unfortunately paired with an awful soundtrack. The music is boring and forgettable, and often times does not seem to fit the scene during which it is playing. This leads to a number of scenes not feeling right, such as victory celebrations that aren\'t quite jubilant enough. This further drags down the story, making an already predictable story lack any sort of punch.---Characters: 2/5 (Bad)Although most of the characters, like their designs, are quite generic, there are a couple that stand out as slightly entertaining. The first of these is the titular wise man\'s grandson, Shin Wolford. Isekai anime often end up being a bore due to their insanely overpowered main characters who are all but guaranteed to win every fight. Kenja no Mago cleverly takes this trope and runs with it, turning it into a funny gag and the premise of the series. The ramifications of a character being ridiculously strong are explored, resulting in both humor and interesting political and sociological dilemmas. Additionally, the lack of common sense that Shin has helps explain one of the most annoying cliches among anime protagonists -- being insanely dense romantically. This makes it more bearable (though it is still frustrating at times). The one other character given a sufficient backstory is the primary antagonist, Schtrom. While his motivations are somewhat cliched, an interesting problem is posed by his demonic transformation. From just one bout of rage, he went from a kind, noble sorcerer to a cruel, revenge-driven monster. A strong hero could quickly turn into an equally strong enemy, which is a very intriguing concept.---Enjoyment: 4/5 (Great)Despite the bland story, Kenjo no Mago still managed to be fun to watch on account of its comedy. The ""no common-sense"" joke is hilarious, from Merlin somehow forgetting to teach basic practices to Merlin to the various situations that arise as a result. There are a slew of running gags, most of which manage to consistently funny, and I laughed just about every episode.---Overall: 3/5 (Good)Kenjo no Mago is certainly not the show for you if what you are looking for is a well-thought out, original, and serious narrative. But it does, however, succeed at being a humorous spin on the shounen and isekai genres and their associated tropes, and I\'d whole-heartedly recommend it to a fan of either. -- the show includes all the tropes of the isekai genre, and fails to offer much more than that in terms of narrative.

However, this isn't done without reason, and isn't for the reason of making a fantasy world more relatable to the audience. Instead, it is done to formulate the very unique nature of the main character's existence.Shin, our protagonist, dies on his way home from his job, and is reborn in a fantasy world as an infant. As he ages he realizes that he remembers things from his past life, however, that which he remembers seems limited to knowledge of the world he came...from, and does not include many factors of his personal life, including how he died. These are all very important factors that shape shin's character, and to keep in mind while you watch this show.Merlin, a master magician and a national hero, raised Shin as his grandchild. Merlin taught him magic, and two of merlin's friends taught shin combat skills and enchantments. Obviously, the protagonist is shaping-up to be quite OP, however, Merlin (overly focused on developing his grandchild into a powerful magician) completely overlooks the bare-essentials like teaching him how to shop, interact with others, and the like. Potentially, the biggest reason for this is Shin's way of understanding magic. Unlike most of the people in this world who focus on the end goal when using magic, Shin thinks about the process in which it is created. This is important, because that is how science works in our world, and if it wasn't for Shin's knowledge of his past life, and the differences between that world and our world then it would be incredibly unlikely that Shin would be as talented as he is. One example is Shin's 'gate' spell which connects two places in space. This uses the concept Einstein founded that space could be folded on top of itself to connect two points in space that would otherwise be very far apart.My biggest complaint towards this show was one that I lost after I realized it. Early on, shin enters the classic scenario of ugly men harassing women, and steps in to save the day. While overdone, it happens in the real world, so I'll let it slide. But, after saving the girls, the audience gets a clean shot of one of the girl's cleavage. I was less than amused, until it hit me ... Shin had never met anyone his age by this point in the story, and he definitely hadn't met anyone he had been physically attracted too before, and in my honest opinion, we couldn't have received a more honest reaction from Shin. While this was the thing that initially stuck out to me, there are certainly a fair number of issues with this anime. A point of praise, was Shin's character, and while I did find Merlin, shin's cousin, and shin's uncle to be rather enjoyable characters, the rest of the cast managed were pretty lackluster.This is a show that you will have to be willing to look a little deeper into in order to see how it uses what you may believe to be overdone to its benefit.

Eventually he goes to school where he is so overpowered it is absolutely ridiculous. He not...only can out do everyone he meets at a young age, he could if made a villain take over the world or destroy it. By using knowledge of his old world (our one) he is able to use spells that he thinks in his head to produce the needed elements to make them more powerful. But I don’t mean oh he can make fire a little more powerful I mean snap his fingers and he could burn down London powerful. Ultimately, he teams up after a misunderstanding with people who originally saw his power as a way to progress in society. (All students are nobles in some sense). He then has the girl fall for him from a prestigious family and they train to become a team of heroes who have protective clothing to make them even harder to hurt. They cut through most enemies with ease, although the majority of the series is about them training at a school summer camp lets all get on better fan service style method. In the end we have a very generic story with a very generic cast of characters with the expectation that the main character is perhaps level 1000 and most of the demonoid villains he faces are level 150 type gap. His teammates are more even (that’s a lie). The main villain is perhaps close but still a long way from him in power.ART:The art style used is quite nice, if not average for the industry. It doesn’t do anything spectacular but isn’t an eyesore in any sense. It seems to have a lot of bright vibrance about it even in the darkest places which takes away from the enemy when seen in their lair. The OP and ED are both a bit silly, the OP being worse with the start having our main character’s (obviously ripped) shirt being torn away.SOUND:The sound again like the art is average for the type of series we are watching, the songs are good, but the OP and ED are a bit generic sounding. The ending song is at least something you could listen to at the gym.CHARACTER:The main character development from the bat goes from hero to superhero, which is fine, but he is perhaps just way to powerful too quickly. I mean he can teleport about using doors he creates, something no one else can do before he arrived. The main character is not completely blind to a girl’s affection like Infinite Stratos, but you do get a lot of inner thoughts and no action until eventually it happens with everyone being involved in a way that is just meh.Other characters are generic in development, the girls often worry about being single forever if they are already single and have a slight anger at couples. Some are worried about their chests and how guys view that. The ones in relationships are more content but show modesty. The guys in the series much the same but for male tropes instead. The development of them otherwise is from good students to suddenly ridiculous in a matter of no time particularly.ENJOYMENT:The series despite what has been said isn’t entirely unenjoyable. If you like this sort of thing then go for it. I do usually and I absolutely loved In another world with my smartphone because at least the over powered lead had issues and they had the harem thing going on in a funny way with lots of meeting of new people. This however is just about the main character becoming who he is, it is almost like they want it to push into a slice of life for an overpowered hero who gets everything he could ask for with no effort genre. I have to admit from episode 8 onwards I really have struggled to watch it. I always finish what I start however, but this is just a pain. When finally, as you expect we get to the climax episodes we just see oh the enemy fall like fire taking hold of a dry leaf and our hero and his team get a minor scratch. The final episode needs to have some major develops that makes up for a lot.OVERALL:In the end, it is a very generic series that is enjoyable to some but not all. It needed to have some more weakness or developments in characters that didn’t just turbo charge them all suddenly. Also needs love where people don’t just go hey, lets get married stranger and everyone just acts like it is beautiful.I would be very surprised after this if it was renewed, and if it is renewed it needs to make major efforts towards changing itself. It is not unenjoyable like said but it has a long way to go to make itself something different for the right reasons.---------------*This review has been done to give as little away as possible by not referring to characters actual names to avoid spoiling the series.*Other anime mentioned in the review is because they are worth watching and make great examples. only can out do everyone he meets at a young age, he could if made a villain take over the world or destroy it.

Since this is the case most isekai try to find a selling point or something that makes it stand out among the rest. For example, the main appeal of konosuba is that it is funny and defies the tropes of other isekais. Another great example is an isekai that aired last season ""Rising of the shield hero"" which subverts the tropes by having the main character that has been framed for a crime he didn\'t commit.So what does Kenja no Mago do differently to stand out? Absolutely nothing. It is as...generic as an isekai can be. The main character dies and reincarnates into a fantasy world with unimaginable power. Along with a generic love interest. The cast is as cliche as it can get. But for some reason I can\'t find myself hating this anime. I found myself liking it even though it is so generic and cliche. In fact I enjoy it more than most isekai with an original idea.The reason is it\'s just a fun anime. It wasn\'t made to wow people with its original idea or anything like that. This anime is made to be a balls to the wall generic isekai. It was obviously just made to be a guilty pleasure anime. Something that was not made to be dissected or analyzed, but just made to be fun to watch.This anime is not for everyone. If you can\'t stand to watch a generic as can be anime and like to watch something more emotional or impactful and masterfully made then stay away from this anime. This anime is for people who just like mindless fun.Conclusion:This is a generic anime. The plot is basic (the main character has to fight an evil person to save the kingdom), the art is not bad but not great either, the sound effect is okay and the character is just every anime character trope ever.

They asked themselves: Why should we use ONE cliche, when we can use ALL the cliches? And so we got Ketchup no Mayo. An Isekai with an overpowered, nice-guy protagonist in a fantasy high school setting with an ever growing harem.Now don't get me wrong, cliches are cliched for a reason,...and used properly they aren't a problem. Ketchup no Mayo does not do this properly. It's not that it's bad per se, it's just outstandingly mediocre. But first, let's talk about it's strong points.The art, animation, and sound design is all pretty good, though I'm no professional. The character designs are decent, and they at least all stand out from each other. I enjoy the fantasy world setting, but then I enjoy ALL fantasy world settings, and this one doesn't stand out from the rest in any way.  There's also a public bath scene in episode 7, so yeah. On to the bad.I wanted to like this show. Even though we have had a ton of Isekais recently, I still really enjoy the genre, and a magic high school setting like Harry Potter would be right up my alley. I still think I would have enjoyed this show, if not for the characters, the protagonist in particular. He's just SO bland. He has no character flaws, he's your standard Lawful-Good protagonist, and he's utterly overpowered. I'm not sure that he has ANY character motivation, other than maybe the blue haired chick? His only goal seems to be to do good in the world. A noble calling perhaps, but not an interesting story. He's undergone no character development so far, and I doubt he ever will.As for the side characters, I could care less. Some of them are mildly amusing, Aug seems kinda interesting, and the blue haired one is useless. Of course the love interest has large breasts and is the healer.The story is decent, again doesn't really stand out. If this show had any redeeming quality, this wouldn't be an issue. But there is no redeeming quality. Perhaps the part I like the least about it all are the fight scenes. Shin is so op that there is no tension. I guess we're supposed to be awed or impressed by how easily he defeats his foes, but I'd much rather watch a team take out a superior enemy through teamwork and planning than watch shin shoot a big explosion and finish it all in one shot. Like, I'd LOVE to see him come up against an equal, but (SPOILER) he defeats the main villain early on in the show. (END SPOILER)All in all, it's just a boring show. Depending on how bored I am, I may continue to watch, but I certainly won't be eagerly awaiting the release of each episode. and used properly they aren't a problem.

I guess we're supposed to be awed or impressed by how easily he defeats his foes, but I'd much rather watch a team take out a superior enemy through teamwork and planning than watch shin shoot a big explosion and finish it all in one shot. Like, I'd LOVE to see him come up against an equal, but (SPOILER) he defeats the main villain early on in the show. (END SPOILER)All in all, it's just a boring show. Depending on how bored I am, I may continue to watch, but I certainly won't be eagerly awaiting the release of each episode."", ""This show is not bashful about having an overpowered protagonist, and while we do know it can be done well because of shows like One Punch Man and Kenshin... that isn't the case here.There is very little story, fight scenes are lazily done, music hints at depth that doesn't exist, and everything always goes Shin's way.The story is weak and transparent, there is no world building, and all of the characters are shallow and pointless.I can't justify putting more effort into my review than the writers did their show, so take what I've written for what it is. "", 'Yes its similar to like 20 other isekai, yes the MC is just Satoru Gojo in this universe, but yet it was still entertaining and light and I enjoyed watching it in one evening.As with so many isekai ,they spend less than a minute in his home world. It could have used a little more development that way just because they call back to real world inventions that Shin ""invents"".The romance is cheesy, the interplay between the characters is silly but realistic banter, the story is unoriginal, but like with OPM and JJK it can be fun to see a completely overpowered MC at work.Its...fun, it\'s short, a good watch. 7/10 fun, it\'s short, a good watch. 7/10', 'The only reason I signed up to MyAnimeList after four years was so I could write up a review criticising this trash anime.This anime sucks - it\'s like a parody of an isekai if the parody suddenly lost self-awareness and began thinking it was a real isekai. It\'s awful.Let me start with the main character, Shin. Shin is basically the most powerful character in the universe - he can literally just do everything with magic. This is because he was raised by a couple of the most powerful wizards in the realm, for some reason. Here\'s the thing - his alleged weakness is that he...has \'no social skills\'.This could be a good flaw, if it ever became apparent that his social skills were bad, or impacted him negatively in the story. If, say, he was unable to empathise, or said stupid things that made people view him badly, maybe, just maybe this flaw could reasonably manifest. However, this never actually crops up as more than a throwaway line - leading me to my next point, which is the blatantly awful side characters.The side characters are some of the most one-note, one-dimensional, characters I\'ve ever seen in an anime. None of them have a character beyond what flavour of \'verbally jerking off Shin\' they represent. The only side characters with actual character beyond \'I worship the toilet Shin shits in\' are the adult royals, who are consumed with political matters, and Shin\'s guardian wizard and witch, who basically show up so they can also be jerked off by a cadre of badly-written side characters.I mean, seriously, the circlejerk about how great Shin is almost becomes repulsive. One of the moments I remember about this anime (of which there are very little) is when Shin goes to his magic school, and he hears about clubs.""Oh,"" the teacher says, ""You need X amount of people to start a club.""""Wow,"" I thought. ""Maybe this is an opportunity for his lack of social skills to show, and reveal itself as a character flaw. Or maybe, there\'s a montage of his social skills failing. Or anything. Please. This is a perfect opportunity to display the character\'s weaknesses, in any way, at all. The bar is low, anime writers. Please.""Classically, that did not occur. Shin begins to worry about joining a club (not sure why this is, since everything falls into his lap without any self-actualisation on his part), and one of his lackeys (or friends, if you\'d rather call their parasocial relationship a friendship) recommends Shin start a club.As soon as this is mentioned, every character in a 1-kilometre vicinity begs to be in Shin\'s club, even though he hasn\'t agreed to create one yet. ""Oh, I don\'t know,"" says Shin, ""We\'d need a teacher to approve it, or whatever (paraphrased).""Conveniently for him, every person he meets is willing to crawl naked through broken glass just for one opportunity to worship him, and a teacher offers instantly. A whole entire character arc finished in about a minute, because every side character instantly wants to help him in any way possible. It\'s just... badly written.My god, I can keep going. After about Episode 2, the formula of the anime becomes apparent, which goes something like this:[Issue appears -> Everybody cries about it -> Shin shows up and solves the problem with literally no character growth or struggle at all, beyond being surprised at how overpowered he is -> Problem solved]There were no stakes for the entirety of the season, probably because if the Big Bad ever showed up Shin would wipe him off the face of the earth using his immense magical power. The only problem this anime ever faces is if Shin isn\'t there at the site of an issue. He\'s like One-Punch Man with none of the subtlety. At one point the Big Bad shows up and fights Shin, and has to run away because he almost gets his ass kicked. This is not how you develop a threatening villain.What\'s more, every single character problem seems to revolve around the character either hating Shin, or not being enough like Shin. Basically, the moral of the story is you should be raised into a fortuitous background with parents who teach you magic from a young age, so that when you grow up you can become an obtuse, irritating main character with a black and white sense of morality, who just does what he\'s told with little to no categorical values or ideals of your own.Anyway, I hate this anime. It\'s a trash isekai that\'s somehow worse than most other similarly trash isekais. As I said before, my vitriol towards this series actually lead to me making a MyAnimeList account. In essence - do not watch this anime if you want to enjoy watching something.

And that question is: ""Why do I do this to myself?"" I cannot fathom why I ever bother to push through these kinds of anime. I\'ve seen a few isekai, but nothing I\'ve seen has been as soulless, as devoid of any passion or creative drive, as much of a cash grab as Wise Man\'s Grandchild. Every time I say this show\'s name all my energy gets sapped.STORY: 1.8/10The story is dreadful. Not only is it generic, it also has horrible writing. The main villain is really stupid, and his backstory...is just an illogical sob story. All the situations the main villain forces the protagonist into are really dumb. There is no logic behind any of the events that happen here. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this garbage. It\'s clearly just there because a story needs to have a story, go figure.ART: 5/10The art makes me shudder. I hate it so much that I can\'t stand it. It\'s not horrible art on its own but everything else about this anime makes me hate it that much more. The art looks and feels super generic, like everything else about this garbage. The resemblance My Next Life as a Villainess had to this anime made me like it less too, even though these two are completely unrelated. Keep in mind that this isn\'t the art\'s fault and rather the fault of everything else.SOUND: 5/10I cannot remember any piece of music from Wise Man\'s Grandchild so I\'ll just give this a 5 and move on.CHARACTER: 1/10These characters have got to be the most generic characters I\'ve seen so far. Nobody has a personality, and a lot of them are really stupid. The protagonist is overpowered but he has no personality whatsoever. He\'s just really good at magic. He was just a random office worker in his previous life but then he died and reincarnated into this world for no reason, either. And they rarely ever bring this up. The reincarnation thing is only there so the protagonist can remember the events of his old life so that he can be overpowered (quick explanation: spells can only be cast by visualizing them, and spells will get stronger with better visualization. the way the protagonist visualizes things is unlike others because modern science does not exist in the world even though tuxedos do. the protagonist visualizes things being created instead of visualizing the thing after it\'s completely done. this allows him to be much more powerful than others when it comes to a magicka battle). Every other character has nothing going for them. The main love interest is clearly just supposed to be a marketable waifu, and it is extremely annoying. She\'s shy, kind, and gets flustered when interacting with the protagonist. The main villain is completely idiotic and over-the-top evil for no good reason. His backstory is just a sob story that you can\'t feel bad for, and all of his lackeys are just really evil, really loyal, and really stupid. There is nothing that guides his actions anymore. He\'s just killing and fighting for the sake of that, and nothing more.ENJOYMENT: 1/10I\'m sure I don\'t need to say much here, because I\'ve already talked quite a bit about why I do not like Wise Man\'s Grandchild. It\'s soulless and devoid of any and all passion and creative spirit. It\'s just a cash grab and nothing else.

As much as I enjoy anime like this, very rough around the edges, and is based off of ideas that are not strong on their own but have potential, they need to clean up their act and come in strong the next season or this will die. so each of the characters back story they tried to make more complex they didn't do every well on the main antagonist, until the last few seconds of the after credits of the last episode, but the other side characters they did this almost seamlessly.

To be honest, you could even just do away with the entire isekai premise, and it would be the exact same show. Now, the story does explain that the reason Shin is so powerful is due to his different...way of processing magic, which I guess is based on his previous life. However, this explanation really only serves as a reason for keeping it in the isekai genre, whereas it should have just stayed in the fantasy genre.The plot is as formulaic as it comes, and moves at such a strange pace where we don't have the opportunity to explore this fantasy world or even the figures which inhabit it. The only real character development, if you can even call it that, is given to Sizilien, who, in all fairness, is really just a retread of the generic quiet female love interest found in many fantasy outings.The one saving grace of this anime is the fact that it passes the time in between other, more plot-heavy isekai shows, and makes for good popcorn material. It feels like an older show, so it also has a nostalgic feel to it, especially noteworthy in its animation. So I guess it does have some purpose.If you liked Sword Art Online but always wanted the characters to have, well, less character, and a mediocre plot that jumps around as much as a kid on Halloween, then Kenja no Mago is the show for you. way of processing magic, which I guess is based on his previous life.

So the fun of anime is precisely to follow Shin's abnormal magic, who thinks of magic differently and creates many new uses for her, something that scares even the most powerful wizards of that society.Anyway the program also focuses on the protagonist's academic life, surrounding him with new allies and friends, as well as people who envy his power. From there, several clichés of the genre are explored without any shame, which included a very...forced novel and the evolution of the characters that occurs in the most anticipated way possible.With no narrative news and basic cliché characters, anime was expected to make up for in the action scenes, but neither is it. The animation is generic as a whole and the battle scenes only stand out even for the use of decent and beautiful magic. Of course, there are exceptions, and some battles are more neat in character movement and camera fluidity, but overall it is the spells and spells that steal the scene and mask the action.Despite being another isekai among so many better ones, Kenja no Mage surrenders to all the formulas of the genre and doesn't take himself seriously. Because of this, the audience ends up easily embracing the attraction and the light and relaxed humor yields good moments of entertainment.

Yes, it’s an isekai power-trip anime where the MC is OP. It’s about as generic as it comes when it’s put like that.However, in my opinion, what made this show actually surprisingly enjoyable were the characters. I don’t think any tropes were blown put of proportion (except for the MC being OP), but as far as anything else goes, it’s pretty well balanced.Usually with an OP MC, you’d think he’d have a harem, but no, there’s one clear set relationship and it’s quite...mutual, with the MC not being as dense as with most other shows, which always slows down any aspect of of a story that has any romance elements.There’s pretty good comedy, the characters do well to complement each other, and honestly, it’s a good watch. It’s not deep or anything, sure, but it definitely doesn’t deserve all the disparaging hate and throwaway aspects that others are trying to say about the show.Of course, a lot of ppl have too much time on their hands and try to say they watch shows with depth and sophistication or whatever other bs, but hey, it was enjoyable.

The idea that literally 1 person in this civilization has ever thought that maybe increasing your ability to control larger amounts of magic in order to use larger amounts of magic is outright silly.The art also left something to be desired at times, but considering the action sequences nearly every episode I can kind of understand that the budget may be stretched.

It sucks, but it looks good whilst it does; and sometimes that is enough.From there i think the only interesting question to ask is how self aware, if at all, the show really is about itself and how it seemingly shamelessly exploits the lowest common denominators in story telling for points. If we can assign some intelligence to the premise we can lend some credence to the show as a cultural artifact despite its obvious literary flaws (TL;DR spoiler: for the most part, we can\'t). Because certainly the show does make several...references as to how dumb and absurd the protagonist is as a character. It\'s no One Punch Man, the ultimate meta, a show making fun of its own medium, but it doesn\'t take itself seriously either. So, is the primary complaint that we all know is coming, is the protagonist, Shin Wolford, a Gary Stu (Mary Sue) a valid criticism when that is part of the point of the character; we know and the show knows that he\'s absurd and a lot of the comedy hinges on that fact. It\'s on purpose.Certainly the show offers nothing in the way of originality, using tropes as tired as age itself. Some of these tropes are so corny you might be forgiven for thinking they\'re retro and back in style or ironically edgy. Like a bad dad joke whose success is not measured by the procurement of laughter, but the groans of those who hear it, nodding in understanding, sort of wishing they didn\'t.Also, though the show isn\'t explicit in this concept, it does make frequent hints that the protagonist exploits his knowledge of his previous life in a scientifically literate society in this apparently scientifically stunted one. Using his knowledge of atomic theory, gravity theory, quantum theory and other various scientific laws to tune his paranormal powers. This is very cool and reminded me of scenes from both No-Game No-Life and Gate where the main characters flex on the ""lesser"" developed cultures, but this is unfortunately not explored as much as it could have been. You kinda just have to pick it up as you notice it and understand the reference (like when he focuses the suns rays into an offensive energy beam by creating artificial lenses in the sky by manipulating the pressure of the air; you kinda need to already have an understanding of what\'s happening to appreciate it).If you can take the show at face value, it is effectively raw mental masturbation with some humour to take the edge off the guilt you feel for liking it. It has a purpose/goal and it serves it very well. Servicing all the primal fantasies a geek could ever hold. Wielding all the raw physical prowess, mental prowess, technical prowess, he gets all the right friends, all the good girls, never loses, is never able to be deceived and has a 4th wall level of sensing threats. His guardians were ""war"" hero\'s, his family friend is a king who\'s best warrior trained him from an infant. His only apparent flaw being how poorly socially adjusted he is, but even then it\'s a lite version of social awkwardness which only manifests in him not really knowing the value of money or having a sense of context for his god-like abilities.The art is above board, the action is pretty spot on, the humour is there.

Although he is the typical protagonist in the sense that he was the typical businessman that gets killed off in the beginning and then gets reincarnated as an OP character, his way of thinking is unique to me. He makes fun of the stereotypical tropes such as typical over-exaggerated magic incantations. I...love his way of making spells and whatnot which is different from all of the characters in the series and from other series regarding the magic and isekai genre.

The first one would be the fact that the character dies and gets reborn as a newborn child, in other shows like konosuba/TenSuru/ or even Re:zero the main character just stayed himself instead  of ""getting younger""?, maybe i have seen just too few isekais\' to spot one that starts the same...as this one, but for me it was pretty innovative. Another thing which i don\'t see many of in animes like this, would be the ""will you marry me"" thing, or just the main hero getting together with the heroine. It is damn rare to see a situation like this  in a 12 episode isekais. Okay so let\'s pinpoint its flaws, character development, the animation sometimes being a bit chunky, and the voices badly combined with the characters appearance, but as i said, it is not a fate, or a fricking monogatari series, but only a 12 episode fantasy/comedy/romance with a small budget made only to promote the light novel(which we should not review since this is about the anime version). Despite its flaws i really enjoyed watching it, the comedy part was pretty funny but its just my type of humor, so it depends on the person watching.So, in my opinion this show is good if you just want to sit and chill out, there is no heavy story or hidden message that you have to get deeply into, there are no sad moments which would make you cry, it is just a  ""nobrainer"" which you watch and forget about after 2 weeks. For me, the 4,5 hours watch time of ""Kenja no Mago""  was a well spent time which i enjoyed.When i see how bad are the other reviews and how much ""hatred"" there is in them i just cannot stop laughing, seeing a random noname from the internet writing an essay about a cartoon that he did not like just makes me smile, my only comment to them would be ""tldr"".Which means ""too long didn\'t read"" for anyone who does not know.My score is 6/10 which is pretty fair in my opinion.

But, I relented and tried it out and I genuinely enjoyed it!So, I have to do my part in defending this because it deserves a fair shot.The ""Konosuba"" evidence:1- Notice how there\'s only like, three to four screenshots that circle around in saying that it\'s a clone. Most of it being background assets, that is assumed to be just a stock model they downloaded online or handed out with shared rights.2- The main heroine\'s hair is long...and blue like Aqua. Guys, this is anime. Aside from hairstyle choice and the ability to heal, the two are nothing alike.So, the actual review (with limited spoilers).The cons: -----1- The main character is meant to be OP, due to his foreknowledge of his past life similar to Tanya the Evil, coupled with having the circumstances of having legends as his tutors early on. So, don\'t expect much character development from him.2- As stated in the defense earlier, they paid little attention to backgrounds and minor prop assets but unless you\'re actually looking for them, you\'d likely not even notice.3- A few ecchi scenes/questionable angles for female characters even in combat scenarios, but what do you expect? Still a bit disappointed it had to stoop to that.4- The goons aside from the Big Bad are fairly uninteresting. They\'re just there, being bad dudes.5- Some of the voice acting seem a bit off when a new character is starting out. As if they\'re still figuring out the actual voice for it.The pros: ------1- Fluid animation with decent grasp on movement and recoil. Also, lots of explosions which is a plus in magic fantasies.2- Good use and engagement of side characters. Although they do end up getting kicked around or slow down the main hero, you can still see their progress and they actually help with the plot and combat, rather than stand around, waiting to stroke the hero\'s ego.3- NO HAREM!!! Like, damn, this man had his heart set from the beginning. There\'s no messy side pieces or annoying vying for his attention. And I am glad for it because that B plot has been so overused, and badly executed.4- No annoying grope/perverted miscommunication scenes. Just fluff.5- A genuine fun time.

It\'s too bad the protagonist guy (that they worshiped a bit too much) didn\'t teach the people from the world science stuff cause that would\'ve been too practical as a teaching method. The way people studied magic in this world before this protagonist guy showed up is like how heaps of people study maths these days -- with an emphasis on unmindful memorization.I remember another generic type Isekai ""Isekai Cheat Magician"" at least dabbled in the...science whatnot instead of keeping his science to himself with maintaining this science stuff to himself. I\'d say it\'s best to skip this anime or check and see if the manga is good or something -- cause IDK the show is a bit bland.I\'m happy this show exists though, it just needs a lot of plot/character adjusting.

Well, First let's talk about what Isekai mean. When we talk about an Isekai Anime we are referring the protagonist living in real world and then got transported to a whole new world, And this anime is about that. HOWEVER, there is one major problem , The protagonist does not know anything about his past life and does not have memories of his past life which make this not a Isekai anime but more like a Regular fantasy anime. Cause what is the point of a Isekai if you dont use your previous knowledge in the real world right ? Example of recent Iseaki...are Overlord , Slime , etc. and all of those Iseaki have their previous memories and knowledge and that is an important part of a Isekai, and this anime does not have it...Story 6/10: When I saw the first episode, I thought this anime would have great potential, but the more episode I watched it proved me wrong. It is just about a Overpowered Main character who has the cliched type of girl who falls in love with him just because he saved her once. Some anime know how to make a good story with a Overpowered MC, and this anime is not one of them.Art 6/10 : Maybe if this anime was released 5 years ago It would have been a beautifil anime, But for today standars I see this anime as a low budget anime, the art just do not deliver.Sound 7/10 : There are some good ost and ok op and ending that it is. Nothing memorable.Characters 6/10  : Big boobies characters is a must in any Isekai Anime, but they just does not seem memorable. There are just too many characters, like to many extra characters and it is only been 4 episodes there is not a lot of characters development, so they are REALLY forgetable and the MC is just not likeable.Overall 7/10 : If you want you can watch more episode it only have been 4 episodes. At first I have great expectations for this anime, MAYBE later on the anime shows more potential, we just have to be patient, who knows?

The cliched overpowered main character is probably the greatest shortcoming of this anime, but given the backstory of being raised and trained by characters of prestigious positions as well as retaining his scientific knowledge of his previous life in japan it does kind of make sense and doesn't feel too out of place to be completely unbelievable.The character and scenery art is slightly above...average, the visuals of magic are well done and there is no stupidly obvious 3d effects from what i could tell to make it look and feel cheap. The girls are cute and the humor at times was enough to make me burst out in laughter.I do not go out of my way to watch every isekai, and therefor i'm not really at the point of hating the genre just because its so familiar in present day anime. If this anime had come out earlier before the genre was so oversaturated i'm sure it would have a higher rating than it does now.

It could have done without the Isekai beginning portion and would have just done fine as a standard fantasy anime. I assume it's placed in there to highlight why he has scientific knowledge to augment his abilities. It's certainly nothing phenomenal, but worth the watch. I'm generous and give it a 7/10 overall. If it manages to get another season I'd watch it for sure. Good anime for kids and for adults that like Isekai. "", ""Man, this anime is missing all the panty shots that the manga had, loads of them. Would've given a 9 ...The anime was fair in all standards exception of the story and how they portray it, skipping scenes and even more details that would've provided more backup to support the meaning behind things so more viewers could probably understand it a bit more.Also comparing it a bit to the manga loads of small bits was skipped and just only displayed big events which is alright. It's an alright watch in my opinion at least, don't let others opinions stop you from watching this series or...any other just watch it for a bit, come up whether you like it or not ... any other just watch it for a bit, come up whether you like it or not ..."", ""Kenja no Mago was the generic isekai of the season aka the junkfood of anime.

The main problem with this show that i personally do not like is that the show is making every character overpowered, even side characters. There is a major flaw in this idea. I would not want to watch a show where the all the characters are always more powerful than the antagonists. It basically gives off the feeling that the main character is going to win too easily. Although this is the same for most overpowered isekai fantasy shows, the suspense of the process of defeating the antagonist is almost...non-existent making this a rather boring show that is not enjoyable.

The point in which it was asked if the main character was not just being used to get stronger is made into friendship, what bullshit is this.

I love all of the characters in their own way there is something unique about them and as a group dynamic the different relationships, the romance, the high tier waifus.  The animation and visuals are solid especially the magic. Sizilien is amazing, one of my favorite anime girls. The world-building is good, we get to see a few different nations and the different ways they run their countries with politics and stuff. It goes even deeper further in the manga but we haven't gotten that far in the anime yet.The science based magic...system is great, I hate when anime just has character's pulling abilities out of nowhere for no reason or explanation. This has been a problem in shield hero, at the beginning it was good we got to see the progression and what monsters gave him which abilities but lately Naofumi has just been pulling up new abilities unexplained. In kenja, they explain the abilities and how shin comes up with them through science like light convergence, wormhole theory etc. So Shin isn't just op for no reason or because it's a game and their character is op or because of genetics etc. like many other op characters.The main antagonist had a really good backstory and an explanation for his motives which is rare especially in isekai. I like the villain group too, definitely the best villain group out of any isekai anime.Aside from that it is just a really good self-insert anime. I like the way shin handles himself and the way he thinks, he's logical and not indecisive, good choice in women, always looking to improve himself and help his friends. The way he has completely altered this new world with his knowledge from ours is just awesome.

Reincarnated into a Slime (or whatever the title is) has no challenge and no goal. The only challenge he faces is that his friends cause trouble for him and he has to clean up and protect them. The same thing can be said about Wise Man\'s Grandchild. There is no challenge, therefore there is no drama, therefore there...is no story.It\'s an Isekai where MC-kun gets hit by a car (I hate this cliche because even if the car is going over 40mph, you\'ll at worst wind up with some broken ribs, over 50, wind up in the hospital with maybe some internal bleeding, but I digress.) he wakes up as a baby and Merlin, yes, that Merlin, but not THAT Merlin rescues him. He now lives with Merlin and learns magic, but because he\'s an adult in a child\'s body he suddenly discovers new and insane ways to use magic. It also turns out that his Grandpa\'s friends are actually all legendary people from the kingdom who trained him to do really awesome stuff since he was a boy! Also, he\'s super awesome at EVERYTHING! Did I forget to mention that he is so awesome that he surpasses all his teachers?! What? Did I just describe seven different other animes? Probably.He\'s overpowered, he has no challenge to him, and therefore his story is dull and without any real sense of drama or action. There is no threat, there is no tampering with strange things. Just like in Slime, you simply follow a dull romp through the forming of a superhero team to fight off demons. If it weren\'t for the fact that there was no drama or challenge to the characters I might say that this is a different take on Overlord (his challenge is from his interaction with other nations, which this anime SORT OF tries to make into a dramatic point, but fails). Sadly though, even when they try to add drama and action into the story, it is IMMEDIATELY overcome in the SAME EPISODE!There is no goal for the main character. In the first episode, he\'s asked what he wants to do with his life and he says ""travel to the next town"" then before he can come up with an answer to the question of ""and after that?"" he is basically told, like a child, ""Oh, you\'re going to the magical academy"". Boom, he goes to the magical academy, zero complaints or arguments. Then what? Is his goal to be the best student at the Magic Academy? To become a world-famous Magic User? To become a demon slayer? The main character doesn\'t even know what he wants in life, so how can the audience even begin to cheer him on let alone watch him go about life?I don\'t even know what to say when the villain is strangely a much more compelling and interesting character than the MC (who I couldn\'t be bothered to even remember the name of) and has a backstory I actually care about BECAUSE HE HAS A GOAL!WHEN YOUR VILLAIN IS MUCH MORE AGREEABLE AND ENTERTAINING THAN THE MAIN CHARACTER YOU ARE WRITING THE WRONG STORY!Worse yet, the writer (or whoever decided the sequence of this anime) has no clue on what the story is. It starts off like a normal ""Magical Highschool Isekai"" then it becomes ""Sword Art Online Awesome Guy Show"" then turns into ""Magical Girl Team Building"". There is no basic progression of plot, they just leave the Big Bad Evil Guy to just sit and do what he wants without any apparent resistance. It is annoying if not infuriating, but the worst part is that they don\'t show any improvement for the characters, no training montages, no idea of what kind of work they needed to do to get to where they are, it\'s just BOOM YOU\'RE A BADASS NOW!There\'s a romantic subplot that just appears. Out of thin air, with zero idea of some deeper romantic interest, they just throw in some awkward love-dovey romance. Typically, in shows like this, you see a Harem theme sprout and that\'s okay. Instead, MC-kun has to basically be told ""oh, by the way, you like this girl"", suddenly, he goes from ""I\'m buying her a ring to enchant to protect her"" to ""I guess we should get married"". It\'s like MC-kun has zero fucking ambition or drive or personality and is just waiting on someone to tell him what to do or feel!SOMEONE PAID MONEY FOR THIS STORY TO BE MADE INTO AN ANIME!!The voice acting is okay, the music is fine, and the art is just meh (the special effects are decent). All of these things don\'t cover up the fact that you could watch any other Isekai and probably find the exact same story with much better characters. The Characters are okay because at least there is a variety to them and they have some sort of relatability. Shitty characters, shitty writing, and halfway through the season they have a very shitty dancing 3d model that someone decided was some work of art they had to share with the world.If you want Isekai that you can have on in the background for noise while you play videogames, this is probably a great choice.

By getting reincarnated in a different world, with the memories of his past life, there\'s nothing he can do but to live a new life again. Having the ability stronger than others, the privileges he had having experienced ones around him, and childhood full of training, he will start his school life in a magic academy and started gaining friends he doesn\'t have from the day he was reborn.Though he is too powerful in comparison...from his friends or even military powers on their place, it will never be the case. It all equals out if their enemies are the same. The preparations or trainings they\'ve made, as well as their plans makes it exciting to watch.Characters:I really love anime with this kind of genre and is not harem. It\'s gold, it\'s love. Shin falling inlove with one woman and confessing his feelings made him different from the rest. Sizilien, the woman he loves, though most of the time is dependent on him, shows her will eventually. She\'s girly and except for being cute, she\'s kind of annoying (or maybe on girl\'s perspective only), but her existence on his life is what makes him great. While Shin is skillful, experienced in fight and resourceful, his friends is the opposite of him and that\'s what makes the story going. What I also find interesting on this story is the character of the prince, Aug. Since most of the royal characters in an adventure story is imbecile, cruel and even an antagonist, it\'s rare to find such highness being fair and honest. His character is one of the most significant role on the series, not only because he is Shin\'s friend, but also, he plays a bigger role on the political side.Sound and Animation:I love the eyes and hair of the characters. The eyes of the characters are dazzling, while the hair is so cool, especially the character of the wise man and guru. They\'re on different level. Above all else, the action scenes are great, best example will be the fight between Shin and the military soldiers who harassed Sizilien. The animation of this series is really something but there are times when it occurs very bad. One example is the hands of Shin when he is handling the cuplike thing on the Prince\'s little sister. Apart from that, it really is great. The emotions written on their faces, in particular, when their in rage or sad, reminded me of Bungo Stray Dogs. It was well expressed, and even if the emotion is too negative, it is still so beautiful to see.Enjoyment:Finished it in one night, that\'s how I enjoyed it. I love adventure and action genres and it will be lovely if I will find another anime with the same genre, but not Harem. It\'s nice to see character who\'s overpowered but still uses his brain, not only for himself but to help others grow, at the same time he does.Ending:That girl is really good. The way the anime ended with enemies they can\'t defeat is a good cliffhanger. That means adventure, that means leveling up or more strategies. It\'s good that there are enemies that can be a threat to them. Maybe there\'s more to them? Maybe one of them came from the same world as Shin? We\'ll see in the next chapters.

It dives face first into pretty much every pitfall of the genre with reckless abandon, but there\'s no payoff. There\'s no punchline. There\'s no knowing wink at the audience. Nothing.If it\'s not a terrible parody, then my next best guess is that the creator read a thorough criticism of the isekai genre and mistook it for a how-to guide. The main character is a complete Mary Sue with prodigious talents beyond that of the world\'s greatest magical talents, who keep popping up to remind us how awesome the...protagonist is. In fact, that\'s about the only reason any other characters exist: to make sure we\'re appropriately impressed by how absolutely splendid he is at everything. His ""social awkwardness"" amounts to little more than being the only person in the entire world who doesn\'t fully appreciate just how amazing he is. The protagonist is basically a void of personality and his only ""personality trait"" is being really good at everything.There\'s nothing wrong with ridiculously overpowered protagonists per se, but you have to give the audience a reason to like them and you have to give them conflicts that can\'t be solved just by being ridiculously overpowered. This doesn\'t happen here, or at least there was no hint of it happening before I dropped the series. Magical prowess seems to be the only thing that will be used to solve any problems.My normal policy is that if I find the first episode tolerable, I\'ll watch an entire season just to make sure I give it a fair shake and to see if it goes anywhere. In this case though, the series abused the leeway I gave the first episode to build into something, only doubling down on its flaws with every subsequent episode.

With the millions of isekai animes that come out nowadays, the goal seems to now be centered towards hooked the viewer early above all else. I was all for the generic love interests and overpowered MC, and the grandparents were both funny and insightful. But once we watch the fight with main villain, I just began to not care what happened after. The training got mundane, the personalities wore off, and the ending was as forgettable as it gets. The art, sound, and characters were...never anything to boast about, so once the story became a mess my enjoyment plummeted. I think back to this show and get angry, because it hooked a bunch of people to it, including myself, but failed to deliver. But that will not stop me from dumpster diving once again for gold. never anything to boast about, so once the story became a mess my enjoyment plummeted.

But that will not stop me from dumpster diving once again for gold.', 'I\'ve been on somewhat of an isekai binge lately, and this was my latest addition. Only light spoilers ahead, meaning I\'ll only say things you probably already knew would happen beforehand.Again, we have an OP protag (par for the isekai course) kicking a$$ everywhere all the time. Now, I\'m not a huge fan of an MC being so ludicrously OP that they\'re inventing all kinds of new stuff all the time that no one\'s ever thought of, BUT it is kind of amusing, and this show does not do it too badly (especially compared to other isekais/fantasies I\'ve seen lately).There are some interesting differences...with this show that I liked. First, the MC\'s parents (actually everyone who raised him) are bigshots, and are pretty cool, even playing a decent role in the plot (though I wish it could have been much larger) - a rarity in anime. Second, there is no harem (actually not even any ecchi really), which is a mainstay of isekai. In fact there is a single main grill right from the start. Third, progress is made with the main grill (spoilers?!?! well, no, not really, considering the opening song...). Fourth, the MC actually trains a whole team with his ""techniques"", which I thought was cool - I wish more bg on them could have been added. Fifth, the villain was interesting - he gets a bit of back-story, he actually succeeds (in a certain sense) and then has to kind of grow as a villain, etc... Not perfect, hey, but interesting.Also, I want to note that the visual and animation quality in this show is pretty high (relative to other isekais), and the action scenes are well-made (though, sadly, the best fights involving the MC fighting people able to stand up to him are both rare and quite short-lived).One thing I\'ll note is that the knowledge from their past life play a rather implicit role in this show. Though he does invent a few things obviously based on his prior knowledge, the main use of it is in how Shin uses magic. I do wish they had done more with this... while the MC mentions chemical names once in a while, it\'s used very little. E.g., there is a part where the MC heals someone and (seemingly) uses some physiological knowledge from the old world... but it would have been cool if there had been more explicit explaining of the process. All in all, the MCs life prior to truck-kun is used very little.In summary, expect an absurdly OP MC, lots of decently animated action, cool albeit a bit shallow characters, and a little of romance and comedy, in a somewhat generic isekai plot in a somewhat generic (but still fun) fantasy world.Categorically:- Moe: Sicily and a couple others lead me to give this a moderate- Comedy: present and decent, albeit repetitive- Drama: none- Action: plenty- Romance: present- Harem: none- Ecchi: little to none with this show that I liked.

I want to keep it simple and honest so here it goes:Kenja no Mago isn't an outstanding or terribly original anime, compared to most other isekai animes out there. However, if you want something well animated, enjoyable, lighthearted, with surprisingly good action and even some sweet romance... this one gets my vote, for sure!The OP protagonist is done very well, with many funny moments of semi-self awareness of how OP he actually is as he enters society after growing up very secluded in his reincarnated life in this new world.Not much fan service, which is fine as...they can't ALL be like that. Even I, a big fan of such things, need a break now and then. ;)Borderline wholesome, I'd say. Which, again, is nice. :D they can't ALL be like that. Even I, a big fan of such things, need a break now and then. ;)Borderline wholesome, I'd say. Which, again, is nice. :D"", ""“Wise Man's Grandchild” is what happens when You let the most basic story about an OP hero marinade in cliche sauce.The main plot is painfully generic. A background NPC of a salary man gets killed in a dumb way by truck-kun (and this time is really stupid, not saving anyone, the dude just got lost in thought and walked on a red light, on a crossing) and isekai’d to a fantasy world. After being reborn he’s found among the corpses of his family by a powerful mage who decides to adopt him. What follows is a vanilla story about an OP AF teenage mage, who...could basically solo the whole world but is too much of a goody two shoes to do anything that would require a real ambition or personality. He becomes a hero, gets a fiance and creates an elite unit of other OP mages who he trains. Basically the most generic shit You could think of. The only way this could be worse is if he had a harem. I guess one must be grateful for small mercies.Normally I would write something about the main cast but all of them are a waste of space. All represent a poorly executed archetype and… that’s all. None of them have any kind of personality outside of their archetype. You won’t see anything that could make You think this was written by someone who actually knows what he's doing. So I’ll just  bring You closer to our main MC.Shin Wolford - Once a salary man NPC, now an OP magic user. I guess death becomes him. Thanks to having retained some memories of his former world and science in it he’s capable of using magic in ways that no one else thought of in his new world. Basically the dude creates a magical version of a hydrogen bomb and death star like beam of awesome destruction. This being a shitty isekai he doesn’t really have flaws, maybe apart from one, but we’ll get to that, and doesn’t make mistakes that would carry any serious repercussions for him or anyone in his coterie. Even when making something dumb, irresponsible or dangerous he comes out on top in the first try solidifying him as someone who has absolutely no stakes in his story. The only thing that comes close to a flaw, and thanks to that to a personality trait, is that he can get really angry and aggressive when faced with the sight of his comrades or innocent people in danger. Unfortunately the writer does absolutely jack shit with this. Even in this state he keeps his composure just with a shaking hand. As far as isekai OP MCs go… he’s exactly like everyone else. You saw him a million times in a million anime. He’s so bland that You forget about him as soon as the show ends.Things aren’t really better when it comes to the plot. It starts generic and ends in a cliche. There isn’t a single original scene or thought in the whole show. There are 3 small, lukewarm arcs in the show… and one of them is a training arc done so bad that it makes the training arc in “Twin Star Exorcist” seem like a masterpiece of writing in comparison.The show also has one of the most lazy fight choreography I have ever seen in… anything to be honest. Apart from the first and last fight on the show everything boils down to making hand gestures and letting the magic destroy everything in the general direction the caster is facing. It’s… bad. Really bad. The only one who has choreography, and I use that term loosely, is Miria. Her fights are actually entertaining to the point that You might think that someone who knows what he’s doing was hired just for her.I really would like to say something positive about the show but I have nothing. It’s just another show with an OP AF MC who is basically a god… with no ambition, character, personality and even hobbies.I guess You can watch it but don’t expect anything that will be memorable. It’s just a middle of the road shit that doesn’t even have any original ideas and hopes You never saw an isekai in Your life to keep Your attention. could basically solo the whole world but is too much of a goody two shoes to do anything that would require a real ambition or personality.

Really rough. The story starts off somewhat interesting and then gets super slow all of the sudden until around episode 8... and then it turns into the best thing ever. I can say for sure that this is not well written, there\'s too much stop and go until the final arc and I ended up skipping over a lot of the foundation scenes, there are just too many.I did actually like all of the characters quite a bit, the protagonists were all pretty cool and the villains were very understandable. I don\'t really...have any complaints about how they\'re written since there\'s nothing to really complain about, they\'re just your standard group of anime protags and villains. The animation and sound are also very passable (I didn\'t really like the OP but I\'m gonna assume that\'s just a personal thing).The story is what really holds this show back. It starts off by showing us how our protagonist, Shin Wolford, was killed and reincarnated to the magic world. What I found interesting was that he was reborn as a child who was adopted by the ""Wise Man"" instead of just being brought into the world still as a teenager, I don\'t think something like that has been done before. The arcs this anime seems to adapt are not connected well, and there\'s just too much buildup for the final arc of the season, though I will admit that arc was really good. I don\'t know if this just wasn\'t adapted well or if it\'s just written that way intentionally, but it just too long and boring to sit through regardless, and it looks like all of the reviewers agree, as many of them drop the show before it gets good since they just can\'t sit through it.In conclusion, this is not a bad anime, and not good either. If your patient enough to sit through 7 episodes of buildup and poorly implemented fanservice like me, then go ahead and watch, if not, just watch some other anime (IDK lol). have any complaints about how they\'re written since there\'s nothing to really complain about, they\'re just your standard group of anime protags and villains.

Though there were easily some memorable times it will shock you the direction the show chooses to take in comparison to what you would expect.The best part of this show was it made sense. Its logic for why things are the way they...are was very good including the sole reason for why the MC is so OP. It wasn't because he was the chosen one or just because he was the grandson of a legend, but rather there was more to it than just belief in magic that there was depth to the magic that he understood.It was quite refreshing to see leveled headed characters with actual brains. The adults in the show are great, his grandparents are fun to be with, the other characters actually think and try, and even MC figures things out on his own.So why do I not give this show a higher score? Once you get to the second half of the season it takes an odd turn. Mainly the show overextends itself from having a massive amount of characters and tries pushing more serious tones of a story, while at the same time keeping it comedic and lighthearted in a sense which did not work having both. It loses the charm it began with that I mentioned above and instead falls flat with almost normal cliches you would expect it to end with.The romance also wasn't that great as the show barely goes much into the characters that when things happen between them it doesn't have as much of an impact. Though I did enjoy that the romance existed anyways.Overall, if you like OP MC's you will like this show. I enjoyed it for the most part specifically the first half of the season and have fond memories, but it could have been better. It is really just a lighthearted comedic show in the end. are was very good including the sole reason for why the MC is so OP.

However, it has one big problem: the show simply forgot that it was an isekai to begin with and just became a regular fantasy. If you're going to put an isekai element in, make sure to keep reminding the viewer about the fact that the MC came from a different world. Wise Man's Grandchild failed to do that and the isekai element became...completely irrelevant.Art and Animation: 9/10The art style and animation was visually appealing and the battle scenes in particular were very well done. However, the fight scene with the demon bear in the first episode was the only major fault in the art & animation that I can think of, and having a badly animated fight in the first episode didn't make a very good first impression. Thankfully the fights after that had excellent animation.Sound: 9/10The sound design was great. Magic casting and the explosions in particular were satisfying to hear. The soundtrack was also very good.Character: 6/10The characters, specifically the supporting cast, were well fleshed out and likeable. However, the fact that show ignored the fact that the MC was isekai'd drops this score to a 6/10. We knew very little about Shin's life on Earth and it ultimately didn't matter anyway since the isekai element became completely irrelevant.Enjoyment: 8/10If you enjoy anime in the fantasy genre and lots of action, you're going to have good time watching this.Overall: 7/10I would honestly give this an 8/10 if it were just a regular fantasy anime with no isekai element. However, the fact that it is an isekai drops the overall down a point because the isekai element is completely irrelevant. Failing to keep the isekai element relevant is one of the biggest reasons why shows like Wise Man's Grandchild are separated from the pack of excellent isekai. completely irrelevant.Art and Animation: 9/10The art style and animation was visually appealing and the battle scenes in particular were very well done.

DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME. IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. It sucks so much and makes all the same terrible mistakes that every other generic isekai anime makes. The fact that in 2019 there\'s people that STILL write this garbage is insulting and just goes to show that people don\'t watch anime for artistic integrity but for pandering repetitive garbage that is so disposable that you\'d lose NOTHING if it never existed. Now that I got that out of the way, here\'s why the show is bad.First of all,...it\'s BARELY an isekai. The main character gets hit by a truck in the first couple minutes of episode one, they NEVER go back to that scene in any of the other episodes or explain who the character was or how it relates to his current character in the other world. Maybe when Season Two comes out, it\'ll make this point outdated but in the long run you can remove the first few minutes and it wouldn\'t even be an isekai anymore. It\'d just be a generic fantasy anime with an overpowered male protagonist which brings me to my next problem, the main character.Shin is completely unlikable and has little to NO personality. The plot summary states that he lacks common sense on simple things, but the script doesn\'t follow through with that. It seems like the main character has SOME flaws regarding to his ""personality"" but after a couple episodes they end up getting resolved quite quickly. He doesn\'t go through any kind of arc throughout the show, especially when he kills the generic bully character turned Demonoid (yes they\'re called Demonoids, I know it\'s the dumbest name ever) and has the slightest bit of shock that he killed a human for the first time but ends up getting over it in the next episode. That was quick, I wonder if it had something to do with the bad writing.All the other characters aren\'t up to much either. Sizilien was easily by far the WORST of them not just because her voice acting was so atrocious it made me wanna gouge my eardrums out with a tablespoon but because she has absolutely NO purpose in the anime whatsoever aside from being the main character\'s generic love interest. She doesn\'t go through ANY kind of character development and is genuinely annoying in every scene she\'s in. Even for a generic love interest, she\'s an awful choice cause her personality lacks ANY kind of originality or standout role that helps influence the main character in ANY kind of way. In fact, it\'s even proven that she can be easily overlooked due to the main character only liking her cause he thinks she\'s cute. What a terrible reason for two characters to become a couple.Going back to what I was saying about the other characters, none of them have any presence in the show either. And one of the key reasons why is simply because there\'s too many of them. And it only got worse in episodes 7 and 8 where the show/manga decided to add EVEN MORE CHARACTERS THAT NOBODY ASKED FOR to the group which included the Fiance of the MC\'s best friend and his little sister May who easily outdid Sizilien in being the WORST character in the entire show thus far and purely exists only to be a generic lolicon to get those anime nerds to think about in bed or in the shower. The villain of the show also sucks, he\'s given nothing to work with and the script doesn\'t realize it until episode nine where the plot comes to a screeching halt to explain to us why the villain wanted to take over the country. Basically his backstory is that the people in power were jealous of him and decided to trick the people he helped into thinking he\'s actually a terrible person. And because the plot needs to work for this terrible script, the townspeople are dumb enough to believe them and killed the villain\'s wife and that\'s why he became a bad guy. Basically the villain\'s motivation is generic and insulting to anyone with a brain and the villain himself is extremely bland and is one of the biggest offenders of generic villains in anime history. But the biggest offender in this show when it comes to the characters is the old wise man himself, Merlin. He\'s made out to be this logical passive old man who\'s knowledgeable and is willing to do everything he can to keep Shin in check, but the show breaks his character by making him whine and cry a lot for the sole purposes of getting cheap laughs from the viewers of this fecal matter.Which brings me to the main problem I have with this show, the comedy. Had it not been for the comedy the show would of actually been a halfway decent watch but sadly it\'s not the case here. Making the character models look cheap and ugly and having people scream their generic dialogue IS NOT A JOKE. Having eyes that turn to white circles with black outlines around them IS NOT A JOKE. Having a PG-13 hot spring scene where naked girls grab each other\'s boobs IS NOT A JOKE. It\'s absolute garbage that irritates me and needs to stop, there have been PLENTY of other animes that ACTUALLY TELL JOKES and don\'t involve characters screaming at other characters for dumb reasons while having chibi animation. But it seems like anime fans are mostly made up of dumb teens that also enjoy generic boring crap like The Big Bang Theory and those pesky Minions movies so of course they\'ll like this show if it\'s already been established that they\'ll laugh at ANYTHING no matter how much it\'s been overdone or how unfunny it ACTUALLY is.So in conclusion, those are the KEY REASONS why this anime is terrible and why you shouldn\'t watch. Other reasons include the awful dialogue, mediocre animation, generic score, and a tone so inconsistent it makes the combination of Manchester By The Sea and Jack & Jill look like a good idea. Again had the comedy not existed and a few characters were reworked and removed, the show would actually be pretty decent. But as far as I can tell, this is one of the most unfunniest most generic most boring and most annoying anime I\'ve experienced in a while. Not even the likes of Sword Art Online and its clones could even come close to being as bad as this. Seriously if you value your time, you will NOT WATCH THIS. Even if Season Two does come out, it will not fix ANY of the issues that Season One made me endure. Stay far far far away and go watch something else. it\'s BARELY an isekai. The main character gets hit by a truck in the first couple minutes of episode one, they NEVER go back to that scene in any of the other episodes or explain who the character was or how it relates to his current character in the other world.

Not even the likes of Sword Art Online and its clones could even come close to being as bad as this. Seriously if you value your time, you will NOT WATCH THIS. Even if Season Two does come out, it will not fix ANY of the issues that Season One made me endure. Stay far far far away and go watch something else.', ""TL;DR (im putting it in the beginning so its easier to see) Guy gets truck kun'ed to isekai land and is hot shit cuz hes good at magic and goes to magic school.

This is purely a show that can only be enjoyed with no expectation that anything will be done smartly. Preferably, watch this show at 3AM when you are tired, and your expectations are generally lower.The characters are... well, nothing special. I found myself skipping through the romantic cut-scenes and just getting into the meat and potatoes of the 'interactions', although mostly I was there for the fighting. Frankly, him being some loser salary-man from another world only comes in with his shitty gag 'inventions' (my favorite being...the wooden treadmill), and this show wouldn't lose anything if it came to the story just starting with him as a boy when it comes to anything else. Not that it had much going for it anyways - the MC probably would've been just as overpowered without Merlin's help, if his reactions could've made that any more obvious.The cast is a mixture of stereotypes, some naturally enjoyable, others intentionally annoying. I didn't find myself particularly hating any of them.Art fell on its face sometimes, but for the most part I enjoyed the visual and auditory spectacles of things being wiped from existence. I didn't have any soundtracks floating around in my head by the end of this, so it's likely unmemorable and generic.The big baddies are entertaining, and it was nice to see that they at least 'attempted' to spice things up with the main one, as opposed to him just being evil for the hell of it. Didn't really pay attention to anything else in the story, besides what was told, now shown.tl;dr : Watch this when you're tired. You *might* be able to look past the bad that way. Watching it in one sitting helps (then you don't have to deal with it anymore)! If all else fails, at least you can mark it as 'Completed' and move on. the wooden treadmill), and this show wouldn't lose anything if it came to the story just starting with him as a boy when it comes to anything else.

The occasional blood and guts in a fantasy world aside, it's a story where you can't imagine anything but a happy ending across the board.There's just something very therapeutic in seeing an overpowered nice guy protagonist smacking everyone around and getting the girl while his friends cheer him on.A perfect anime to blitz through in an afternoon when...you're not interested in getting overly invested in a story or having your mind blown or heart shattered. You watch this to uplift your mood and then move on. you're not interested in getting overly invested in a story or having your mind blown or heart shattered. You watch this to uplift your mood and then move on."", 'hoho, people be hating this anime because how shit it is, to be honest, i agree, and yet, i somehow stupidly enjoy it, but there are at least some few things are off and very boring to be honest, and maybe awkward, which lets start with the story firstso basically, this anime is about a business man yada-yada-yada, truck-kun arrived, classic Isekai truck thing, and Shazam! the person got Reincarnated into another world, as usual like the other isekai animes, god, i dont get why does japanese people like people getting hit by a truck so much, or maybe they just tryna to give some...people a lil bit of humor, by adding ""Truck-kun"" in it, since its popular nowanywho, so, there is this main character named ""Shin"" and he got adopted by a creepy old man aroun- i mean, an ""Old"" magician, that was once at the ""Old"" age he was a hero, somehow took Shin, and raise him after gotten attacked by a demonic creature, or so a bear, which he killed at the age of 10.. which is weirdly dumb that the character somehow is too overpowered, like bruh, just why?? why would people like to make the MC that very overpowered?? itss somehow stupid, and dumb, and they always take care of the enemy ""By themselfs"" while the side characters didn\'t have that much of a screen timetalk about side characters, to be honest, this story is at least too focused about the demon thing incident, and about the MC (Shin walford), i mean, c\'mon mate, at least give the other characters more screen time, and backstory, it would at least make the audience got interested on the anime, and they should\'ve not made the MC too OP, just because he is from another world that got reincarnated, damn, i feel like this story, or so anime should at least be remake or reworked, to make it look more interesting, or rewrite the whole thing, to be honest, im freaking tired watching the MC getting too overpowered at the beginning, without even developing something interesting at first, and then somehow manage to control full power of its power, but somehow SHIN just MANAGED TO HECKIN USE A OVERPOWERED SPELLS AND ENCHANTMENT MAGIC EASILY, they should at least make the MC more like Naofumi Iwatani (from shield hero)Naofumi is literally one of the overpowered MC in these type of animes, BUT, on first, he didn\'t just fully control it, of course, he somehow had to struggle handling his power, and all of the trouble happened to him, which is interesting, and make the episode more live-able, i mean, a whole 24 episode in 1 season, and HEY! the anime blows! it was awesome compared to kenja no mago, kenja no mago is basically just one of those anime who just replica/copied the others who got ""Hit"" by a truck, and get got magic powers in another anime, and suddenly manage to handle the power easily, without any long time training that took years to actually handle that kind of powergosh dang it, just ONCE, SOMEONE PLEASE, NOT WRITE A ISEKAI ANIME THAT ISN\'T GETTING HIT BY A TRUCK, AND BE ORIGINAL (like shield hero -ahem-) IM SICK OF THIS, AND YET, AGAIN, I SOMEHOW ENJOY THE ANIME, WHICH IS DUMB, but i guess, i really do find enjoyement in this anime, but the lack of story is just the problem, and there isn\'t that much of a fan service, or romance, in like every episode, which is good at least, and here i am, just giving a feedback about this anime, everything i said here might hurt the author feelings, but hey man, its the internet community, and theres at least a reason why did this got an anime, which is nice, and so we an give a criticism about it, and looking at the rating page, its almost at 7 stars, which is amazing actually, didn\'t expect that some people would enjoy this shitty piece of writting artwork, but, i do enjoy it too, i guess its just one of those ""Anime isn\'t for everyone"" thing i guess, where some people might, and not enjoy these type of storyand thats that, thats it, nothing else to say, decent anime, shit story, Wonderful Character design, and loveable, 50/50 rating for me, because this anime seems nice at least, i would recommend watching this for people who like isekai stuff, anywhoAgain, nothing else to say anymore, until i see the next sequel, or so maybe OVA.Criticism-chan people a lil bit of humor, by adding ""Truck-kun"" in it, since its popular nowanywho, so, there is this main character named ""Shin"" and he got adopted by a creepy old man aroun- i mean, an ""Old"" magician, that was once at the ""Old"" age he was a hero, somehow took Shin, and raise him after gotten attacked by a demonic creature, or so a bear, which he killed at the age of 10.. which is weirdly dumb that the character somehow is too overpowered, like bruh, just why??

The one to say, "" Read the manga."" Mostly because I didn\'t really read enough manga.  However, after watching this show, I really wanted to read the manga so know what happens next.   Well, after catching up with the manga, I had to re-score this adaptation.  Like they really didn\'t do the manga justice at all.  I believe season one covers the first 15 chapters but there is only like four chapters worth of information in this anime.  I wouldn\'t be made except that this whole anime was rushed....Like Gus\'s attendence.  In the mange, there\'s this whole thing about meeting them but in the anime, they just pop out of nowhere.  Also, Shin\'s speech was cut right at the beginning but there is some actual good content in there that gets reference later in the world.  I love anime and in all honesty, I don\'t want this anime to go away but I feel like they need to either redo season one and put some more time into it or let it be produced by another company.

It was a pleasure to watch.It had a well written story, good character build up, and the animation was good too.I was happy with how the main character acted and the relationships between the wiseman and guru, the friends of the wiseman, king and prince, the students/friends. It was very good in how they treated each other and how they all learned from one another.I was also happy with the romantic / love relationships in this anime and how the main character and the woman he loves act in talking to their parents.I am hoping that...this series gets a season 2, and even more. I think it deserves to have more seasons to finish this story arch, explore this world, find out what other evils await them, and to see what the Ultimate Magicians are capable of. this series gets a season 2, and even more.
