The tales are taken from things that happen in the show, so easy to follow and each about 6 and a half minutes I believe.   You won't miss anything of the overall story with not watching, but is one of them simple things to give a smile.so story fine, art bad...on purpose, so fine, sound simple enough, and enjoyment fine as nothing to write home about, but as a short ova, hard to be ore than that. on purpose, so fine, sound simple enough, and enjoyment fine as nothing to write home about, but as a short ova, hard to be ore than that.""]"

Miru Tights: Cosplay Satsuei Tights,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40176/Miru_Tights__Cosplay_Satsuei_Tights,"[""On July the 27th of 2019, the biggest catastrophe in human history occurred, the unforgivable had happened: The greatest show to ever be aired on Television, Miru Tights, ended. With it finally ending, fans all over the world cried in sorrow for their beloved show to come back, some even lost what little meaning they had left in their lives. Miru Tights, a show that brought so much joy, happiness and memories to countless generations of Anime fans had finally ended, and many people could not live with that harsh reality.Luckily, our lords and saviors over at Yokohoma Animation Lab were kind enough to...bless us peasants with one more episode of this flawless masterpiece. So, does it hold up?To nobody's surprise, it does. Yokohoma Animation Lab managed to make this special as perfect as it’s predecessor. We get incredibly well written, four dimensional characters as always, so much so that I am still wondering if they are characters or actual human beings to begin with. We also have the most beautiful visuals in all of TV history being prevalent here. Add in to the fact that the OST is so memorable you’ll be blasting it 24/7 until your speakers break.Miru Tights is the best Anime ever made, and the best Anime that will ever be made. Give up Japan, you’ve reached your absolute peak.11/10 bless us peasants with one more episode of this flawless masterpiece. So, does it hold up?To nobody's surprise, it does.

Extremely raw, straight to the point tight related fan service, the teasing is just...as strong as ever, but still gets nowhere as exciting as the legendary episode 7 of the parent show.The animation quality and the voice acting are not extinguishable from that of the Anime's, it's almost it was one pack with the rest and was only decided that it would be left out as extra for the hungry fans later.But all in all, it was just another 4 minutes long scrabble with tights stretching and erotic camera angles. It could have been better if we're being honest, but never expect anything from similar shows. as strong as ever, but still gets nowhere as exciting as the legendary episode 7 of the parent show.The animation quality and the voice acting are not extinguishable from that of the Anime's, it's almost it was one pack with the rest and was only decided that it would be left out as extra for the hungry fans later.But all in all, it was just another 4 minutes long scrabble with tights stretching and erotic camera angles.

Miami Guns,https://myanimelist.net/anime/783/Miami_Guns,"[""Some of you might not know it, but I grew up at the movies. I spent the majority of my life going to popcorn flicks with friends and family. Besides horror flicks, it was always the action movies I couldn't get enough of. Die Hard, Demolition Man, Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon - all a big part of my childhood. Miami Guns manages to take the Hollywood action genre that I hold close to my heart and pay homage to it the best way it can, by making a total joke out of it. And you know what? I love it! Miami Guns starts out simple...enough, with a pretty basic plot outline and a cast of fairly stereotypical characters, but it's the second episode when this series really shines as a comedy, and everything after that is comedy gold or damn close to it. Its been a while since I've been able to watch an anime like Miami Guns and not feel numb or apathetic towards its cause. I personally think this series' cast of likeable characters and good use of spoof humor is to blame for my &amp;quot;reawakening&amp;quot; to the genre I began to grow a distaste for, but there is so much more to Miami Guns than what you see on its surface.Unlike many spoof animes out there, Miami Guns chooses to be a bit more subtle when making references to other franchises. For example, in one episode they introduce Bruce Tsuji and refer to him as a real 'die hard.' Obviously this is a reference to Bruce Willis in Die Hard, but while other similar animes would more than likely have this character running around screaming 'Yippie-ki-yay, motherf****er!' every chance they got, Miami Guns just leaves it at that. I think this works well, and it helps from making the comedy in the series feel forced. My main gripe with a lot of the comical animes I've seen over the years is that they try to be too crazy for their own good, and once you've seen one anime like that you've pretty much seen them all. Miami Guns is far from sane, but it seems to have an intelligent method of laying out the funnies. This is a welcomed change.Miami Guns has an interesting setting. I assumed it would take place in Miami, and while the city is called Miami it seems like it's the only place left on the Earth. Not to mention it is revealed in the second episode that the Earth was destroyed and Miami City was built from scratch, but in animes like this I take every plot arc they toss at me with a grain of salt. Either way, the scenery is very nice with its southeastern vibe. Even though Miami Guns is mainly a parody of the Hollywood action genre it doesn't mind getting its hands dirty and cracking fun at other clich&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;s and animes. Seeing how it was released in 2000 you just know there is going to be a Matrix reference thrown in there somewhere, but I don't know if you'll be expecting the Astro Boy one. It's all in good fun, and even though the series doesn't really follow a main storyline I couldn't help but get attached to some of these characters over time. Miami Guns isn't without its blemishes though. The opening episode was rather weak, as were a few of the last episodes, and this is something that can really hurt an anime as short as Miami Guns. For the most part the series redeems itself when it's all said and done since I was craving for more, but there are some episodes and plot developments I wish they would have just gotten rid of. The Yao, Lu, and Nagisa triangle for example only helped slow the series down for me. Nagisa is evil, Lu knows, and Yao is too blind to see it. Okay, I get it, you don't have to keep beating the dead horse. Nagisa becomes the evil side villain of sorts but none of the cast members really do anything about it, so ultimately we just have a wasted character and, due to her numerous appearances throughout the series, a lot of wasted time that could have been spent on something more entertaining.Animation and music in Miami Guns is actually pretty good. I liked the OP and ED themes, and all the music throughout the series really got me into the whole police action movie theme it was trying to develop. I love the character designs and I love the general design of Miami City. It's all good stuff. Once again, this is a series I ended up watching the English dub of and I must say I am happy with that decision. Some of the voices can get on your nerves, especially given the character they're coupled with, such as Yao who is almost as annoying and hyper as Excel, but after switching over to the Japanese audio and listening to how high pitched the female voices were I was forced to switch back to English. Julio Peacemaker's voice actor alone makes the English audio my personal pick. I don't think any Japanese voice actor can pull off that kind of Hispanic accent. Seriously, this guy is pretty damn talented. It's sad that his only credited role seems to be for Miami Guns. A lot of U.S. distributors could really use a talented voice actor like him, and it's obvious from sifting through the piles of anime with crappy English voice acting.Typically, animes can become one of two things: 1) Instant classics that everybody clings to and makes a big deal about, or 2) forever lost in obscurity. Miami Guns seems hopelessly destined to be the latter. The series has the workings of a really fun comedy, but it just hasn't been able to really catch a fan base large enough to put it up there with other comedies like Excel Saga and Azumanga Daioh. This is unfortunate, but it's not surprising. While the main cast members of Miami Guns are likable and memorable, they are hardly stand out characters that draw in fans. Besides Al the talking alligator and his master Julio Peacemaker (both supporting characters only featured in a few episodes), Miami Guns doesn't exactly have what many would call a 'crowd pleaser.' Also, this series doesn't have a very strong Japanese theme to it and takes place in 'Miami.' This too is something that could very well be the cause of Miami Guns not getting the exposure it deserves. Or possibly this anime just flat out sucks and I'm one of the few people who enjoyed it, but I'll try to hold onto my dignity and pray for the former.It's really hard to review a comedy, arguably harder than any other genre simply because comedy is a lot like music in the sense that It can never be perfected. People all have their own idea of what's funny and what's not, and, well, I think Miami Guns ranks up there with some of the best. It's not about the quantity of humor that really matters to me, or about how edgy and groundbreaking it is. If I laugh then that is all that matters, and is all that should matter. I have to defend this anime after a lot of people were telling me how crappy it was. Yes, it has its flaws and doesn't always hit its mark, but that is something that can be said for literally every comedy out today. Comedy has always been hit or miss, trial and error, but it's all about the miss/hit ratio that determines whether something is comedic brilliance or cheesy garbage. Miami Guns manages to hit far more than it misses, at least for me. While there are other animes out there that serve the same purpose as Miami Guns I argue that this series stands alone on its own merits. Miami Guns is no FUMOFFU by any means, but it doesn't have to be in order to get my seal of approval. I suggest you check this anime out if you ever get the chance.My Score: 9.0Version Watched: English Dub enough, with a pretty basic plot outline and a cast of fairly stereotypical characters, but it's the second episode when this series really shines as a comedy, and everything after that is comedy gold or damn close to it.

I suggest you check this anime out if you ever get the chance.My Score: 9.0Version Watched: English Dub"", ""What made me stick with Miami Guns after the first episode was a scene in which the police force in Miami were all told they couldn't shoot their guns just yet and they all started shivering and fondling their various firearms with bloodshot eyes like they were all drug addicts. What a Totally Accurate Representation of Americans!The story concerns Yin and Yao, two cops in the Miami Police Force, who cause a nuisance for their boss. They're a lot like Panty and Stocking, with Yao being loud, irritating and generally a horrible person, while Yin doesn't have much personality at all. The set ups for...each episode are meant to involve teamwork to take down the baddies, but it usually involves Yao charging in and making the situation worse while Yin clears up the actual problem behind the scenes. There's a few inspired scenes in it, such as the episode where Yao regains her humanity after regressing to neaderthal status by smashing open a vending machine in quite possibly the greatest 2001 Space Odyssey parody I've ever seen (and given how many times that movie has been parodied, that's saying a lot), but most of it is just dumb buddy cop stuff taken to illogical extremes.The animation quality is TERRIBLE! Someone who is more knowledgable about animation will have to clue me in on this, but nearly all the TV anime made in 2000 looks dreadful compared to the anime that came from even several years before. Maybe I'm just blinded by the fact I've been cherry-picking the best looking stuff from the years before it, but so many of the anime made that year have awkward movement, incorrect perspective, bland character designs, weird shading, everything. My theory is that it has something to do with the switch to fully digital animated stuff. Love Hina was the first fully digitally animated TV anime, so maybe at the time the animators hadn't quite gotten used to the new format yet. I wouldn't have thought bad animation would put me off so much, but its end result was a lot like panty flashes. It might be telling a wonderful story or a hilarious joke, but I keep getting distracted away from the main attraction by having bad animation/striped panties clog the screen.Speaking of panty flashes, there's a worryingly amount of 'Imma gonna raep you' fanservice involving the two girls, where their kidnappers tear their clothes off with knives or whatever. Now this could be a parody of the voyeuristic nature of kidnapping scenes in these kinds of shows. In the first episode, Yin wears her swimsuit under her clothes when she gives herself up as a hostage because she knew she was going to have to take off her clothes, and then proceeds to wave to the police force from the balcony of her kidnappers apartment window so the media can see her fancy new bikini. However following episodes have similar strip down scenes with no sense of irony to them at all.This is a small example of the wider problem Miami Guns has (beyond the atrocious animation). It forgets it's supposed to be a parody and starts playing things straight. They keep trying to play up the relationship between Yin and Yao like it's really touching and friendship helps them solve crimes and all the other stuff Barney the Dinosaur used to sing about when he wasn't singing about how much he fucking loved peanut butter, but it doesn't work because Yao is a horrible person. There is no reason for Yin to like her. Being a terrible person is fine if you're making a big joke out of the whole thing. We weren't ever supposed to take the relationship between Panty and Stocking seriously, as the final episode wonderfully proved. But the show kept devolving into sappy territory and it became painful to sit through at times. Especially with Yao's voice. I gravitated towards the English dub because I always do when the option exists, but when Yao's screechy voice became too much to bear I swapped over to the Japanese, only to discover that the English voice actor had simply copied what her Japanese counterpart had done.A review of an anime you've never heard of that isn't quite bad enough to make the review funny but not good enough to make you interested in the anime. What a useless post. Oh well, this is what I'll probably get if I try to pick up obscure forgotten titles from the last decade. each episode are meant to involve teamwork to take down the baddies, but it usually involves Yao charging in and making the situation worse while Yin clears up the actual problem behind the scenes.

I would like to say after the first episode it gets better but that is not quite true. Having seen the entire show i can understand what they were doing. Could they have done better in illustrating that fact? hell yes. For example the chief of police his skin color. No, i am not a racist. Going by memory his was different then the following episodes because someone thought it was better another way. Yes, we all understand that changes...happen but rather than waste an episode explaining it (potentiality confusing the viewer) have a little fun with it. Let\'s use the same example. Skin color. I make a cartoon and i was told it could air if a character had a certain skin color instead of the current one. Depending on the shows plot and genre it could go in countless ways. A comedy... ""the one time i try sun tanning and it becomes permanent."" Rather than telling your viewers with your animated characters the chief was this now he is that and leaving it at that.Aside from the semi confusing art the story was decent and relate-able. Who doesn\'t have energetic coworker or friend? Mix that with trying to your job and dealing with that.The voice castings per character were good. They matched the age and personality. happen but rather than waste an episode explaining it (potentiality confusing the viewer) have a little fun with it. Let\'s use the same example. Skin color.

Rokumon Tengai Mon Colle Knights,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4962/Rokumon_Tengai_Mon_Colle_Knights,"['This is one of the worst anime I\'ve ever seen.Sound 1/10What makes this anime so intolerable is that the characters NEVER stop talking and it\'s like a machine gun of bad jokes! Seriously, it\'s like the animators who created the English dub were under the impression that in every single scene the characters had to be saying something.For example, in almost every episode they recycle this animation of the Mon Colle Kinght\'s jet, The Millennium Eagle, taking off and the animation never changes, but for, some reason, the dialogue changes in each episode and it\'s always just a new bad joke.""Hay guys. Have you...ever noticed if you say the word blast-off enough times it sounds like a Russian persons name? Blast-off. Blast-off. Blast-off. Blast-off. Blast-off"" SHUT UP!!!!Story 2/10The story for this anime makes no sense.The Mon Colle Knight\'s goal is they want to collect all six monster items so they can use their magic to combine Earth with the monster world, but my question is: why is that a good thing? Seriously, I fail to understand how combining Earth with the monster world is in anyway a good thing. Shouldn\'t that be more something that the ""heroes"" should be trying to prevent from happening. Are you sure the Mon Colle Knights are the good guys?Also, what exactly are ""monster items""? They never go into any detail about it.For example, a bag of magic seeds that give you super strength if you eat them is not a monster item, but a pair of magic boots that let you fly is a monster item. Why?Plus, Rokuna and Mondo have this power that lets them fuse with monsters to battle with them, but it\'s never explained where this power comes from. Were they born with it? Did the Professor give it to them?However, the thing I hate most about this anime\'s story is how it feels like it\'s on fast forward. The characters all talk fast, everything happens fast, and, like I said, it feels like a machine gun of bad jokes. Mondo and Rokuna may just be sitting in class when a giant vacuum cleaner appears, sucks them up, and the Professor says ""We have a new monster item!"".Art 4/10The animation and monster designs are both decent, but there are some monster designs that just seem lazy. For example, there\'s a monster called Bisonator that\'s just a giant Bison and a monster called Lambda that\'s just a purple sheep.In other anime like Pokemon and Digimon, they base their monster designs off of real animals as well, but at least in those anime they make their monsters look unique and not like regular animals that are giant or a different color.Characters 2/10All these characters are annoying! They never go through any kind of development and we never learn anything about them. Why does Mondo have a bandage on his forehead? What happened to Rokuna\'s mom? Why do Bacch and Gluko work for Prince Eccentro in the first place if he\'s so bad at being evil? None of these questions are answered.The only characters I liked were Gluko and Ms. Loon.Gluko is one of Prince Eccentro\'s sidekicks and there\'s this running joke that bad thing always happen to Bacch and Eccentro, but never to Gluko. It was one of the few funny jokes in the show.Ms. Loon is Rokuna and Mondo\'s school teacher and what I like about her there this running joke that she\'s desperate for love, but can\'t seem to find a boyfriend.Overall 2/10It\'s obvious that Mon Colle Knights is just another Pokemon rip-off. I hated everything about this anime and do not watch it. ever noticed if you say the word blast-off enough times it sounds like a Russian persons name? Blast-off. Blast-off. Blast-off. Blast-off.

Did the Professor give it to them?However, the thing I hate most about this anime\'s story is how it feels like it\'s on fast forward. The characters all talk fast, everything happens fast, and, like I said, it feels like a machine gun of bad jokes. Mondo and Rokuna may just be sitting in class when a giant vacuum cleaner appears, sucks them up, and the Professor says ""We have a new monster item!"".Art 4/10The animation and monster designs are both decent, but there are some monster designs that just seem lazy. For example, there\'s a monster called Bisonator that\'s just a giant Bison and a monster called Lambda that\'s just a purple sheep.In other anime like Pokemon and Digimon, they base their monster designs off of real animals as well, but at least in those anime they make their monsters look unique and not like regular animals that are giant or a different color.Characters 2/10All these characters are annoying! They never go through any kind of development and we never learn anything about them. Why does Mondo have a bandage on his forehead? What happened to Rokuna\'s mom? Why do Bacch and Gluko work for Prince Eccentro in the first place if he\'s so bad at being evil? None of these questions are answered.The only characters I liked were Gluko and Ms. Loon.Gluko is one of Prince Eccentro\'s sidekicks and there\'s this running joke that bad thing always happen to Bacch and Eccentro, but never to Gluko. It was one of the few funny jokes in the show.Ms. Loon is Rokuna and Mondo\'s school teacher and what I like about her there this running joke that she\'s desperate for love, but can\'t seem to find a boyfriend.Overall 2/10It\'s obvious that Mon Colle Knights is just another Pokemon rip-off. I hated everything about this anime and do not watch it.', 'I watched the subbed version, I don’t think it’s the same as the dub. But it’s very much a Pokémon/Digimon/Yugioh style mash-up. There’s a boy and girl who seem to be deeply in love,lol. And the girls father is a scientist looking for these relics in another world. So they visit the other world every episode to go searching for these relics, while also bumping into a Team Rocket group that also hunt the relics. The bad guys literally go blasting off in every episode, just like team rocket. It’s really cute kids show, but my goodness if you know anything about occult symbolism, demons,...ancient gods. They’re everywhere, they’re used as monsters to fight, I don’t know if I ever learned the reason they even battle to be honest. Then the main plot has angels vs demons. I was really impressed by how good it was towards the last 15 episodes. The episodes building up to those were stills fun “adventure of the day” where they bump into giants, and monsters.I you grew up watching Pokémon and digimon. It’s a fun show to watch. ancient gods.

"Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu.",https://myanimelist.net/anime/24705/Ore_Twintail_ni_Narimasu,"['""If you love twintails in your heart, anything is possible!"" - TailRedWelcome to the anime of the season. No, of ALL the seasons.From start to finish, Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu provides perhaps the most deep and thought-provoking story I\'ve ever come across in my anime career. It blows just about all the cult classics out of the water with its originality. The plot revolves around a typical high-school boy named Souji. Or rather he\'s typical with the exception that he\'s a diehard fetishist for twintails. Already here we can see that the anime is starting to go down a direction you don\'t see particularly often.One...day, Souji happens to run into a perverted scientist from outer space who gives him a mission. A mission to protect planet Earth from the EVIL HORNY SPACE LIZARDS threatening to steal all the twintails from our beloved homeworld for themselves. Therefore, the girl provides Souji with an epic space-tech gadget which channels his love for twintails into a power capable of transforming him into a mecha-suit-clad red-twintailed loli named TailRed, wielding super powers strong enough to thwart the evil space lizards\' immoral assault on the planet. This plot twist was mindboggling to me and left me in awe due to how incredibly unique and well thought-out it was.Of course a super heroine freedom fighter of justice wouldn\'t be complete without her band of epic sidekicks present as well, but fear not because Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu delivers absolutely flawlessly in this category as well. You see, as philosophical and interesting as TailRed is as a character, she is not the only masterful heroine this anime has to offer, no sir. Because there is also her loyal compatriot super heroines TailBlue and TailYellow fighting by her side as well! And as shocking as it may sound, they\'re even appropriately named since their nicknames *also* match the colour of their respective hair! The difference being that TailBlue and TailYellow are actually blessed with being twintailed young women in their natural human form as well, and we all know by now that twintails by default implies that anything is awesome. By adding these two additional super heroines to the main cast, the quality of the show is automatically multiplied by a factor of three, meaning that if the anime wasn\'t mindblowingly amazing enough as it was, then with this taken into account it suddenly shatters all sorts of records.But the joyride doesn\'t stop even there. After all, heroines of justice can only fulfill their roles as long as there is an enemy to fight, and the villains of Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu are of a scale unlike anything you\'ve ever laid your eyes upon before. Since it\'s common knowledge that twintails are the answer to everything, have you ever heard of a plot so malicious and figuratively dripping with ulterior motives as one where the evil space lizards are literally trying to steal away all the twintails of planet Earth from mankind? And then once the lizards have done so, surely they will be spending their retirement years doing both this and that with their legendary captured hairstyles? The shock and horror this notion fills me with upon merely considering it is on a level entirely of its own. As a result, the conflict between the twintailed warriors and the space lizards feels disturbingly real and manages to captivate the viewers completely during each and every second of the anime\'s progression.The production value is no less staggering either. Every time you begin a new episode of this anime and get to hear the opening theme kick in, your heart and soul will get filled with a kind of euphoric tranquility upon being exposed to the beautiful lyrics dedicated to everyone\'s passion and love for twintails. It is an entirely different level of affection and dedication compared to what you\'d ever find in any other anime, and as a result you\'ll always be right there in the twintail mindset whenever you watch this anime. It is truly a work of art in its own right.And regarding the visuals, all that needs to be emphasized is the breathtaking character design of our three super heroines, especially TailRed herself. Just one glance at them and your mind, heart and... *other regions* are all going to be virtually bursting with happiness and satisfaction. If you\'re the type who gets jealous easily however then you might want to take caution as finding yourself being unable to huggle and cuddle with TailRed in person due to the pesky boundaries between fiction and reality can be a heartbreaking experience. What you can do however is tie up your hair into twintails yourself and you can have the peace of mind of knowing that she\'ll love you like nothing else because of that alone. If only everyone else had a heart as open as hers, there would be so much less malice in this world.As a whole, Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu is a masterpiece unlike any other and does a massive job at saving the currently declining anime industry. It takes everything you thought you could take for granted in this day and age and flips it up-side-down with a fresh and unique storyline and the most likable heroine cast in anime history. We can only hope that the rest of the anime industry will give this show the attention it well and truly deserves and tries to learn from it, because if they do then Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu might very well be the gateway anime paving the way for what the future of multimedia will look like.A revolution in the anime industry.

Essentially they are a bunch of perverted losers who leech off of others and ruin people\'s lives, sound familiar?Our heroes, a group of twintailed heroines must use their love of twintails to fuel their magical girl powers in order to defeat these monsters, thus saving the human race. Along the way, it\'s a hilarious journey with perverted humor, (Like gender bending, tentacles...and ecchi scenes) and then just about anything else that you will see in a typical high school comedy anime.The aliens are COMPLETELY hilarious, the cast is great (Especially Twoearle), and pretty much everyone in the show is necessary, you don\'t have 50 different characters that are completely irrelevant popping up for 30 seconds just to fill screen time. The voice acting is solid, the theme song is catchy (""LES-CUE!""), and I have no real qualms about the sound. Likewise, the artwork is great and pretty typical of a modern show. (The boobs are exaggerated as hell on tail yellow for comedic effect)My only qualm with this show was the fact that the story, like any magical girl show bar madoka, was the sheer predictability. While it was entertaining as hell, and did a great job of satirizing anime similar to something like gintama, like gintama the story is kind of lacking, since the point of the show isn\'t the plot.While it may not be quite a masterpiece, it\'s an absolute blast to watch, and I highly recommend it if you\'re into this sort of show. Anyway, there\'s two types of people who rate this show poorly, people who either-A: Don\'t like this kind of humor.B: Just don\'t get the satire.If you don\'t enjoy perverted jokes and constant porn references, like Sekotai Yakuindomo, this is not your show. This is a show created to mock the present state of anime, especially the magical girl genre, and it heavily exaggerates perverted scenes in order to make a point.

I found myself enjoying this series quite much by not questioning the characters' logic too much and viewing this anime as more of a comedy rather than something serious, because there are many things that occur that don't make much sense in the real world.StoryI have to say that the story was quite generic up until episode 7, it consisted mainly of very cliche things. The...characters just gained superpowers and rids the world of evil every day, there weren't any particularly interesting things in their fighting style either, just the same old scream out the name of the attack/power and wreck shop. After episode 7 the story suddenly takes a turn and becomes much more interesting.ArtI liked the artstyle in Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu quite a lot, the girls were all very cute and would always put a smile on my face. Unfortunately the quality of the art was a bit lacking. What I noticed was that the close ups become slobby in certain situations, either the facial structure was a bit weird or the eyes become very 'intriguing'. With that being said I want to clarify that the art quality was still far from being horrible and still pretty good despite its flaws.SoundThe only song that I took a liking to is the opening song, I would often find myself not skipping the OP to listen to it another time and that's a good sign.The background music in the anime however was nothing special and neglectable, it did set the mood well and complete it's duty.CharactersThis was the weak part of the anime, the characters were all quite flat and didn't develop that much aside from the main character Souji.

An anime like this should not have plot if it's going to be this bad. Did I really come to watch how hard it was to maintain twin-tails? Did I come for horny lizards? Did I come for a lesson on a separation between fetishes and people? I didn't ask for it, but the anime gave all of those things.For most, the show is mostly due for its fan-service. It's understandable, a...lot of shows have peculiar themes meant for this type of stuff. Unfortunately, it's subdued by pretty much everything else it decides to mix into the hodgepodge. The plot itself is about as strong as Team Rocket's failed attempts in Pokemon. It's completely predictable, thrown in with a little fan-service and hardships. About half of every episode is devoted to the comedic situation between the characters, and the other half devoted to slaying horny lizards. I don't care much for the latter, but only because I had given hope for a good plot upon the first episode. There's also the possibility that the show itself is satire on male-aimed magical girl/mecha anime. Even if it is, its goals aren't met.In consideration, perhaps we could ignore all these bad plot points and enjoy the anime for what it is. It certainly delivers (to some extent) few enjoyable scenes -- awkward situations worth a little giggle. I think that's exactly what this anime should have delivered on, and yet instead we cue to awkward tentacle scenes, short-lived remorse and doubt. The show itself succeeds in only particular scenes. Most might find its charm through particular highlights of the show. Watching an entire episode is quite different.Aside from (debatably) the main cast, the enemies are unlikable. Perhaps they represent the audience the show was aimed for, but as obscene as their fetishes are, all they receive is a cruel and meaningless punishment of death. In attempt to analyze the show on a deeper level, perhaps the monsters are symbolic. Perhaps these monsters give off a message that the fetishes they seem to have are disgusting and unjustified. As much as I could go into this, it's simply just false. The show itself isn't anything more than a cock-tease most of the time.The battle scenes in particular are atrocious, and are better off skipped. The opening and ending songs with their respective scenes give all the action you'll need to see in the entire series. It's pretty much all the same aside from the enemy looking a bit different each time. The peculiar thing about this anime's battle scenes is that they seem to make the quality of the anime seem a lot worse than it actually is. As much as I want to see a generic shounen fight where the characters yell out the names of their moves... It's completely unneeded for this type of show. The charm of the show is due to its peculiar and awkward situation, not the fact that the protagonists are fighting horny lizards. However, the plot begs for it, so the scenes are structured towards it. It would be acceptable if they were even mildly entertaining. The funny thing is the fact that the novel's illustrations actually make it seem like the battle scenes are cool. Perhaps they had potential with this, but potential means absolutely nothing if never brought out.In the end, this is one of those shows you wouldn't want to be caught watching.

Has that love swallowed you whole, allowing little to no breathing and forcing you into the darkest depths of your heart\'s inner-workings as you grasp for air and fight to regain control of your life? Or have you accepted that and started the trek toward a downward spiral in which everyone you know questions your fixations and starts to lose hope for you?Souji Mitsuka is obsessed with twintails, a hairstyle only possible and acceptable within the world of anime. And even though this hairstyle...is undeniably the greatest there is, there is a line that must be drawn. Because when a group of humanoid animal creatures invade your world with affinities of their own, your fetishes will not save humanity. Unless you are Souji Mitsuka. He loves twintails so much that he is given the power to transform his affection into a physical manifestation and annihilate monsters in order to save the world.Still reading? Cool. I should also mention that this power transforms him into a girl -- and a cute one at that. And even though the entire thing is overly-spontaneous and silly, it really isn\'t all that bad. It\'s something you can just throw yourself into and have a good time with, which isn\'t all that easy anymore.Now, I know that we\'ve already come so far over the past couple paragraphs, but we need to go deeper in order to figure out just what this show is. So I\'m going to break it up into a few key components in order to further this review.Music: 8/10I think this might be the first time I\'ve reviewed a show where the music outshines the rest of the aspects. Gonna Be The Twin-Tails! brings you in-your-face and extremely catchy rock music for both the opening and closing of the show, being somewhat reminiscent of how the Power Rangers was many years ago. It\'s both a good and bad sign when you are waiting the entire episode for the ending song to play. And with lyrics like, ""Put our dreams and wishes into these twintails,"" you really can\'t go wrong. However, despite how awesome the music is, it does quickly get repetitive having to hear the same songs every time a new fight breaks out (Which is at least once every episode). It does a great job and really pumps you up, but it honestly just gets boring after a while. Except for the ending song. I will listen to that all goddamn day.Characters: 5/10As far as the characters go, there isn\'t really much to be invested in. Each one is slightly interesting and completely different from the others, but there really isn\'t much to them when you break them apart. It\'s a harem, so each girl has a thing for Souji, but only one of them really has a reason to (That being the childhood friend and best-girl, Tsube). It\'s nice having three characters able to transform into different versions of themselves as soon as they yell ""Tail-on!"" but considering they are almost identical to the way they are when they aren\'t transformed, there just really isn\'t much of a point to it apart from gaining superpowers. The characters definitely had potential, but didn\'t develop as the story progressed. They were all just too static and not interesting enough to be considered good.Art: 6/10Character design is well-done and relatively intriguing in Gonna Be The Twil-Tails! But boring landscapes and art that grows weaker as the series moves on really depreciates the overall quality. It was clearly evident that the studio was either running out of money or just getting lazy in the later episodes. But consistent design of the humanoid monsters (Or guildies as they are called in the show) stay pretty decent overall. Fight scenes are disguised by flashing lights and magic pillars, so focus is taken away from what\'s on screen and is instead directed toward background music or the lame dialogue the characters have to yell at that point. The color schemes are solid and appear interesting at first glance, but quickly become dull and boring, just like the characters do.Story: 6/10I\'m going to be direct here and say that story isn\'t all that important in comedic anime. Gonna Be The Twin-Tails! relies on its script to succeed -- and the script is actually pretty good. But the story feels like there is something missing. It works like this: Tailred and friends take on a lizard-man or insect-man, completely destroy it, and then move onto the next one. It\'s just recycled action over and over again. The series attempts to get more interesting with the introduction of Dark Grasper, a human that is idolized by and in control of the Guildies, but she is just another boring character essentially trying via reverse-psychology to get Souji\'s mentor to love her. It\'s not something you can\'t find anywhere else, but it is fairly decent and watchable.I\'ve always liked uniqueness in visual media -- creativity is what I look for more than anything else when I review something. But there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Gonna Be The Twin-Tails! approaches entertainment from a non-serious standpoint, and so it can\'t be graded the same way a serious anime is. It is watchable, but it isn\'t by any means great or groundbreaking. Approach this anime the same way that you would approach a stand-up comedy routine. If you go in with high-hopes, you will come out disappointed. But if you go in expecting it to just be okay, you might wind up enjoying yourself. is undeniably the greatest there is, there is a line that must be drawn. Because when a group of humanoid animal creatures invade your world with affinities of their own, your fetishes will not save humanity. Unless you are Souji Mitsuka. He loves twintails so much that he is given the power to transform his affection into a physical manifestation and annihilate monsters in order to save the world.Still reading? Cool. I should also mention that this power transforms him into a girl -- and a cute one at that. And even though the entire thing is overly-spontaneous and silly, it really isn\'t all that bad. It\'s something you can just throw yourself into and have a good time with, which isn\'t all that easy anymore.Now, I know that we\'ve already come so far over the past couple paragraphs, but we need to go deeper in order to figure out just what this show is. So I\'m going to break it up into a few key components in order to further this review.Music: 8/10I think this might be the first time I\'ve reviewed a show where the music outshines the rest of the aspects. Gonna Be The Twin-Tails! brings you in-your-face and extremely catchy rock music for both the opening and closing of the show, being somewhat reminiscent of how the Power Rangers was many years ago. It\'s both a good and bad sign when you are waiting the entire episode for the ending song to play. And with lyrics like, ""Put our dreams and wishes into these twintails,"" you really can\'t go wrong. However, despite how awesome the music is, it does quickly get repetitive having to hear the same songs every time a new fight breaks out (Which is at least once every episode). It does a great job and really pumps you up, but it honestly just gets boring after a while. Except for the ending song. I will listen to that all goddamn day.Characters: 5/10As far as the characters go, there isn\'t really much to be invested in. Each one is slightly interesting and completely different from the others, but there really isn\'t much to them when you break them apart. It\'s a harem, so each girl has a thing for Souji, but only one of them really has a reason to (That being the childhood friend and best-girl, Tsube). It\'s nice having three characters able to transform into different versions of themselves as soon as they yell ""Tail-on!"" but considering they are almost identical to the way they are when they aren\'t transformed, there just really isn\'t much of a point to it apart from gaining superpowers. The characters definitely had potential, but didn\'t develop as the story progressed. They were all just too static and not interesting enough to be considered good.Art: 6/10Character design is well-done and relatively intriguing in Gonna Be The Twil-Tails! But boring landscapes and art that grows weaker as the series moves on really depreciates the overall quality. It was clearly evident that the studio was either running out of money or just getting lazy in the later episodes. But consistent design of the humanoid monsters (Or guildies as they are called in the show) stay pretty decent overall. Fight scenes are disguised by flashing lights and magic pillars, so focus is taken away from what\'s on screen and is instead directed toward background music or the lame dialogue the characters have to yell at that point. The color schemes are solid and appear interesting at first glance, but quickly become dull and boring, just like the characters do.Story: 6/10I\'m going to be direct here and say that story isn\'t all that important in comedic anime.

Ok, first of all it uses an already overused plot of inter-dimensional beings out to invade earth, second, it has FETISH!!!!!!!!!!!!Written all over it and those so called ""Twintail Attributes"" was obviously a euphemism for ""PIG TAIL FETISH!!!!!!!!!!!""And that is why   Kenzen Robo Daimidaler is...a top recommendation for this anime since they were both based on sexual innuendo except the latter was very brazen about it ,while this anime was more like making something look innocent. But seriously why did studio ""FUNnimation"" even thought of making such anime that has a compensates it\'s FETISH based theme with a lot of monologues ? Fuck, if I can go to Japan right now, I\'d be going over studio   FUNimation  and punch the Executive Producer Fukunaga Gen in the face for not picking other manga with sense for an anime adaptation.Art:  Very Good 8.The rating is for Shindo Erina in her Tail Yellow suit, Twoearle since she is my kind of eye candy in this anime and Dark Grasper since I do have a thing for bikini girls in glasses.Sound: Mediocre 5.Co\'z I just have no comment in this part, but I do like the opening theme.Character: Dreadful 2.You, know, this is one of those anime where, the bad guys are more lovable than the good guys, thought I would have rate this part a 7, well, the fact is that them bad guys just come and go, also their monologue just infuriates me. So so what about the other characters? Reason number 1 for my score.Mitsuka Souji- In this anime/manga he....or she embody\'s a typical gender bender in this anime, where he\'s kinda of a metaphor for  every closet gay\'s desire kinda thing. I mean, where can you find such character who can be a girl in an instant? Only in this anime, basically he was just a typical harem gay who- as usual was oblivious of his childhood friend\'s feelings for him.  What makes me hater his/her character very much was his love for twintails, or let\'s cut the crap FETISH for twintails where at time I\'m begging to think that because he can transform into ""Tail Red"" that he is a narcissist who is in love with his alter ego as a Tail Red a girl. IMAO, his defense for twin tail attributes makes me wanna kill him.  Reason number 2 for my score.Shindo Erina- As tail yellow, she is another girl with a fetish for wanting to make love to a hero, where just like Souji, has the capability of loving herself in a sexual manner, since she is tail yellow anyways. Reason number 3 for my score.Tsube Aika- Ok, frankly she was the only normal character around here, and as always no harem is complete without a childhood friend. Then again, whether we like to admit it or not she is the sadist in this anime, only, story writer, Mizusawa, Yume, had her toned down. She is reason number 4 for my score.Twoearle- What can I say, she is the quintessential bimbo in Souji\'s harem, however, she is a toned downed MILF.Anko ""Dark Grasper"" Iisuna- I kinda hate that she wasn\'t made to follow through with her goal of eliminating those twin tail trios. And just like everyone else, she has a glasses fetish and she is the  last nail in the coffin where I gave this part a low score.Enjoyment: Dreadful 2.Just don\'t ask and don\'t even get me started.Overall: Pathetic 1.Definitely an anime for people with fetish and a certified PTW. a top recommendation for this anime since they were both based on sexual innuendo except the latter was very brazen about it ,while this anime was more like making something look innocent.

Whether we like it or not, hair is an essential part of who we are and how we live. There are products devoted to it and establishments entirely about removing it in a cleanly fashion. For those that have it, it is resting peacefully atop our heads. Sometimes, people do their hair up in fancy designs. One of these styles is known as the ""twin-tail."" In Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu, ""twin-tails"" isn\'t just...a hair-do; it\'s a way of life and a source of unimaginable power.STORYTwintails stars Souji, a high school boy with an incredible fascination with ""twin-tails,"" a type of hair style. One day, he is visited by the mysterious Twoearle. After receiving a bracelet from her, Souji becomes the famous TailRed, a fighter of evil and champion of ""twin-tails.""It is impossible to argue the utter ridiculousness of the premise. It\'s an adventure not just about twin-tails, but about all strange fetishes. To this end, everything contained within is a massive parody. The enemies, the battles, the drama, the characters; all of it is taken lightly, and subsequently looked at in a comedic manner. Enemies are almost always defeated in a single move, archetypes are pounded into the ground, and the abilities of the girls are extremely silly. The parody works because it casts its net wide. In fact, one could interpret what goes on as Twintails presenting an elaborate take on the current state of the medium. That it is filled with an overabundance of sexual preferences that infect and detract from what anime truly has to offer, but the only way to be rid of them is to inject yet another fetish, perpetuating the cycle, and thus causing it to never end. Or it could all be for fun.While Twintails may contain some actual literary merit, it does suffer a terrible fate. Mired in repetition, many of the events are the exact same in nature. New bad guy shows up, TailRed battles, ideals clash, and TailRed wins. That is the extent of the anime. It seems as if the strong parody that the show demonstrates would be lost among such boring writing...but once again, there\'s a catch. The repetition is prevalent and blatant not because there was nothing else to do, but is instead another statement about the anime industry. Season after season, similar stories are pumped out, with the exact same types of characters, settings, and plot devices. Nowadays, there is a large lack of innovation or risk that is taken, simply because ""don\'t change what isn\'t broken."" Then, when something does come along that tries to shake up the formula (say, Twintails), it goes down in a blaze of glory, signified as being trash, and subsequently being trodden underfoot by the ""new"" wave of anime it attempted to thwart. Or it could just be directionless and misguided.Disregarding the warranted or unwarranted extrapolation, the anime does do something for sure: tackling the idea of having a passion. Ultimaguildy are the villains, but only when they attempt to place their beliefs upon others. Going further, the victor in every battle is the one with the strongest passion. Therefore, Twintails is attempting to relay the message that one can believe fervently in anything (religion, hobbies, etc.) as long as such beliefs do not impose or bring harm to others. At the same time, such a passion shouldn\'t consume oneself; there exist other parts of life that are worth investigating or having. This is bolstered by the final deus ex machina, and wraps up the show\'s message in a concise manner befitting of its previously established parody.ANIMATIONWhile the analysis of Twintails\'s story is debatable, the quality of its art and animation is not.The art for the show is largely uninspired. The world is often bland and devoid of life, mostly sticking to common backgrounds such as outside of school or on a rocky cliff. Lighting effects are nearly nonexistent, and many times the art itself dips so low in detail that it appears unfinished.The character designs suffer the same fate. Boring regular outfits, plain faces, and the same missing detail as the art make them unappealing. Their only saving grace is in their twin-tails and their transformations, and the varying amount of baddies.The final nail in the coffin arises from the animation. With minimal character movements at all times, with dialogue being spoken with mouths only, it doesn\'t look pretty. Coupled with the fact that the battles reuse the same scenes and that the choreography involved is stale, it makes the entire experience a slow but deteriorating death.But is this really not debatable? The analysis in the previous section demonstrates that Twintails may be smarter than it is perceived to be. Is there some deeper meaning to the show\'s descent into terrible quality? The short answer is, no. It\'s just not done well in the slightest. The pretentious answer is, maybe. Twintails\'s devolution from an okay looking anime into a complete mess could be a depiction of the anime industry\'s downward spiral towards mediocre and generic looking shows, where uniqueness and innovation can never emerge. A big ""maybe,"" but more food for thought.CHARACTERSThe cast of Twintails are mostly stereotypes, which at this point, should be obvious. However, that inkling feeling rises again....Souji is the main character, and the boy with a passion. His love for twin-tails knows no bounds, thinking of them first and his person second. He embodies the spirit of TailRed, holding the same fiery and burning desire that she is known for having. The only character to experience any semblance of growth, he is still the typical good guy, being the love of everyone\'s life. Souji represents the idea that it\'s okay to question your convictions, that there are moments where one needs to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.As Souji\'s childhood friend, Aika has a lot to overcome. Violent yet caring, beautiful yet ashamed of her body, she very regularly clashes with Twoearle in her pursuit of Souji. As TailBlue, she utilizes water. With calming waves and tumultuous torrents, her personality shines through her fighting style. What\'s interesting is her constant inability to take teasing about her bust size, despite Souji not caring about that when it comes to women. It\'s seems like an unnecessary insecurity, but this characterization follows the same motif; water always wants to conform to its surroundings. Even so, she serves as an example that it\'s best to be comfortable in your own skin, and not worry about what others may think of you.Twoearle not only has a strange name but is also a strange character, too. Seemingly from another planet, her silver hair, large boobs, and invasive personality make her a standout person. She actually provides a lot of the comedy with her playful behavior and sexuality. Having lost her Attribute, she relies on Souji, Aika, and Erina to do what she could not. If anything, she signifies that despite not having intense dedication towards an aspect of life, one is still able to find joy and happiness in other ways.My personal favorite from the anime, Erina is the student council president. Proper and unquestionably kind, she seems like a normal, everyday young woman. But she actually harbors a secret; she\'s a huge masochist. Her transformation into TailYellow demonstrates this clearly: growing slightly taller, gaining larger breasts, and developing wider hips, she becomes an incredibly sexy figure. Her abilities incorporate both exhibitionism and electricity, allowing her to go through the torture she desperately wants to give her the power she needs. Erina serves as a reminder that it\'s okay to indulge (within reason!) the passions we have, because we all need a little pick-me-up from time to time.As always, there is a need to see more to this part of the anime. What do the characters mean behind the archetypes they exemplify? How are they used as a satirical outlet? It\'s harder to see but the answer is there: each of the characters has to be something they wish they weren\'t. Souji turns into a girl, Aika has a flat chest, Twoearle lost her twin-tails, and Erina acts elegant. Even Dark Grasper maintains a cool and evil persona that masks her reserved and awkward self. The purpose of the characters, then, is to bring to light the idea that anime is currently in a state of self-denial. It\'s in a predicament where it doesn\'t fully know what it wants to be: forced ""moe,"" extravagant fan-service, and generic adaptations have become the norm, not because anime necessarily wants it to be that way but because it can\'t be any other way. It may want to escape from the corner it has backed itself into, but such radical changes require extraordinary happenings.SOUNDThe OP starts very light and jumpy, with guitar and piano playing in harmony. The song picks up half-way, with the vocalist singing along well with the beat presented. It contains a strange break where the song loses tempo, but ends on a nice guitar solo.The ED is actually pretty good. It\'s quite catchy, with the vocalists singing individually and in unison. The beat and guitar pick up halfway through once again, with the guitar and drums working together to make it a nice little jam. Again, the song ends on a fun little guitar riff.The soundtrack contains typical pieces: triumphant arrangements, happy-go-lucky beats, and violin, choir-singing tracks for those tense moments. Nothing original, but they work well in their respective moments.Voice-acting sees average to above average work across the board. A special shout-out to Maaya Uchida as Twoearle, Sumire Uesaka as TailRed, and Chinatsu Akasaki as Erina.One last time, we need to put on our ""read between the lines"" glasses. Does the sound-work follow the same trends as everything before it? Of note are the opening and ending songs: both are generic, both contain nonsensical lyrics, and both follow the same song pattern. Twintails, then, is aiming to show that music within anime has become a breeding ground for ridiculousness and unoriginality. Just trying to be catchy, with the slow build-up followed by the song picking up in the middle, is easy; it\'s a cheap trick that many shows employ, because it works.ENJOYMENTAt this point, I need to present a question I brought up in one of my earlier works: at what point do my analyses go from being interpretations of what the anime was doing to trying to justify and look for answers? I\'d like to think that the show was more than just a bunch of twin-tailed girls flying around. I want to believe that some of what I\'ve said is correct. After all, there is evidence for a lot of it. Sure, the ""Animation"" and ""Sound"" ones are rather weak (I fully admit that), but there is logic behind those from ""Story"" and ""Characters.""It\'s a difficult dilemma, because where does one put his or her foot down, where does one draw that line in the sand that says, ""Up to here is what they meant, and no more."" Does that line exist right from the get-go, or does it appear somewhere in the middle? I\'d hope that it\'s the latter.For something like Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu, it will be seen by many as just another random show that only anime can pull off. But behind the twin-tails lies a satirical work that challenges what anime currently offers, even if the execution isn\'t fully apparent.SUMMARYStory: Fine, parody, repetition with purpose, thematicAnimation: Bad, bland art style, okay character designs, low actual animationCharacters: Good, TailRed, TailBlue, TailYellow, and Twoearle represent more literally and figurativelySound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Good, a hidden satireFinal Score: 5/10 a hair-do; it\'s a way of life and a source of unimaginable power.STORYTwintails stars Souji, a high school boy with an incredible fascination with ""twin-tails,"" a type of hair style.

Just trying to be catchy, with the slow build-up followed by the song picking up in the middle, is easy; it\'s a cheap trick that many shows employ, because it works.ENJOYMENTAt this point, I need to present a question I brought up in one of my earlier works: at what point do my analyses go from being interpretations of what the anime was doing to trying to justify and look for answers? I\'d like to think that the show was more than just a bunch of twin-tailed girls flying around. I want to believe that some of what I\'ve said is correct. After all, there is evidence for a lot of it. Sure, the ""Animation"" and ""Sound"" ones are rather weak (I fully admit that), but there is logic behind those from ""Story"" and ""Characters.""It\'s a difficult dilemma, because where does one put his or her foot down, where does one draw that line in the sand that says, ""Up to here is what they meant, and no more."" Does that line exist right from the get-go, or does it appear somewhere in the middle? I\'d hope that it\'s the latter.For something like Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu, it will be seen by many as just another random show that only anime can pull off. But behind the twin-tails lies a satirical work that challenges what anime currently offers, even if the execution isn\'t fully apparent.SUMMARYStory: Fine, parody, repetition with purpose, thematicAnimation: Bad, bland art style, okay character designs, low actual animationCharacters: Good, TailRed, TailBlue, TailYellow, and Twoearle represent more literally and figurativelySound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Good, a hidden satireFinal Score: 5/10', 'What would you do if the one, uh, I mean, two things you hold most dearly are threatened to be taken away? This is no question for our protagonist and fellow twintails connoisseur Mitsuka Souji: of course you defend it with all your might! Plz stop deleting my reviews ok it makes me platinum mad.Souji has just begun his first day in high school. Unmatched in his passion for twintails, he can only revel in the grandeur of all the damsels sporting his favorite hairstyle, much to the dismay of Tsube Aika whose affection for him goes beyond that of an ordinary childhood friend. Their...peaceful days, however, comes to an end as the world faces unprecedented danger in an invasion from an alien species that lives off the power of passion, love, twintails, and fetishes. Souji won’t allow none of that, mind you; after being approached by the mysterious big-bust Twoearle he was granted the power to transform into cutiegirl Tailred with the best twintails in town if not literally the universe. Incidentally, his cutie form possesses power overwhelming enough to fend off the invaders and defend the world from these twintails-eating abominations.Some may recall Kenzen Robo Daimidaler from earlier 2014 which plays on a similarly ridiculous premise but with mecha instead of mahou shoujo and sex drive instead of twintails power. Whereas Daimidaler abuses its premise for blatant fanservice and a few repetitive gags, Twintails employs comparably minimal fanservice and focuses on being consistently entertaining through creative jokes and sound plot progression. While intentionally absurd, it is not altogether void of essence as it may seem at a glance.I Want to be the Twintails is a story about identity. It’s about standing up for who you are and what you love in the face of your worst adversaries. The protagonists and antagonists alike proudly parade their dubious interests in the heat of battle, for therein lies the source of their might. With zeal far beyond ridicule and shame, it is during these moments of peril they engrave their ephemeral existence into eternity. Souji fends off not only the alien invaders, he needs to constantly resist Twoearle’s and Aika’s attempts at wooing him as well as Mother’s insistence on his concession to sexual desires. But not once did Souji falter as he embraces a more refined pleasure by locking herself up and fingering herself in the twintails. This review is a ruse; I just really like Tailred. In contrast, student council president Shindou Erina finds strength through the release of her repressed sexuality. Twintails is about being honest with yourself and freeing your real you that is repressed in fear going against social expectations. The theme is a common one, but Twintails handles it with a touch of novelty and never strays from its original intent of entertainment.Incidentally, there are two sides to all coins of the dual-faceted type. Even Souji is capable of viewing his love for twintails through a lens of irony. He acknowledges it as an irrational infatuation because such is the nature of passion. As much as it is a bliss for him, he realizes that it is not an ideal to be forced upon others. In her own words, “Twintails can only come to be on the hair on either side of the head that supports them!”. Despite this, he never rejects this infatuation even when his life is being threatened, not because he is senseless but because next to his love for twintails is his will to protect the world and battle alongside his friends.I Want to be the Twintails is not about a hairstyle as much as it’s about being conscious of who you are and daring to be different. You know this show does. I think I’ll also grow a pair and play with them in the bathroom. peaceful days, however, comes to an end as the world faces unprecedented danger in an invasion from an alien species that lives off the power of passion, love, twintails, and fetishes.

I do agree with the main character about twintails. It’s a beautiful hairstyle. Sadly, the anime connected to it is less than stellar. What is this? A celebration of fetishes? A satire of it? Is it making fun, laughing with me or all of the above? Why are last episodes so generic?You’d think that a genre as overflowing as Harem would lead to tighly-focused anime. You have so many shows to learn from and yet the anime is still a confused mess. If it were just cliched, fine. Haganai...was also cliche but at least it had focus. Twintails is too busy being confused over its genre to settle for a direction.The obvious point of comparison is Date A Live. That underrated anime, while not amazing, was still a unique harem. It had a weird premise that turned the Action on its head and gave a new context for the Harem aspects.The premise of Twintails doesn’t actually add anything. Our hero transforms into a girl and the enemies give big speeches about their favorite fetish. Every episode concludes with a lightshow and characters giving their attacks pet names. Thankfully we never get insight into how the battle system actually works – it wouldn’t make the lightshow any less dull.Beyond the speeches and the fact our heroes all have twintails, the story is derivative and common. The creators clearly didn’t want just another story, but their attempts at turning the fetishes into plot points fail. Most of the time it’s just creepy fetishism. Borrowing the Hero’s Honor bullshit from JoJo doesn’t make your anime more diverse. It only highlights how confused the creators were. What does macho bullshit have to with twintails and harems?It all ends with a big fight draped in red and black. The hero is full of doubts, about to lose the fight because they don’t have faith. Then suddenly he has an encounter outside of time. A figure speaks to him in a vision and he regains his love, screams the attack name and defeats the enemy. After that we see everyone going to school like nothing happened, with tsundere beating up the big-breasted girl as always.Again, what does this has to do with, well, anything?The whole structure is a mess, and it can’t be saved. None of the ingridients are worthwhile unless you focus on them. Heroic stories are a common template and fetish stories often sexually harass the audience. The anime at least doesn’t go too far in what in subjects the audience. Anyone looking for juicy screenshots will be disappointed. Still, even a messy plot can survive if the characters are good enough.Even there the series fails, despite trying hard. Everyone is exaggerated and our main character, for a chance, has a personality. Although it’s not much, being an obsessive over something is definitely progress over typical heroism. In fact, there’s a specific moment where the MC reveals he’s driven more by his selfish obsession than saving the world. For a change, our Harem MC isn’t just a convenient moral compass.Too bad everyone around him is an exagerrated archetype. If the creators could imagine funny situations in which these archetypes are effective, fine. How many times can the flat-chested childhood friend beat up the big-breasted new girl? There’s no difference between each time it happens. Twoearle makes something sexual and Aika beats her up.The line between failures like these and successes like Neptunia are blurry. Both rely on silly archetypes, but Neptunia has wilder situations. Its archetypes are more well-thought out. They don’t govern just the funny situations but every aspect of the character lives. Here the quirks only rear their heads when it’s time to beat up the perverted girl. At some point, it becomes characters abuse. When your Harem comedy resembles Saw in its treatment of characters, something is wrong.Even the visual design doesn’t rescue it. Shows like this are an example why sexy character design is a positive thing. Although all the girls are meant to be pretty, nothing about their design is interesting. Twoearle is closest thing to a good visual idea. Although twintails are an awesome hairstyle, the show does nothing with it. Generic big eyes are all you have left. The battle suits are also typical pieces of metal stuck on bodies. The enemies are equally just blobs of metal, a macho mess inspired by an animal but no different than a TransformerThe series starts off being some fun and the concept is ridiculous enough. This is another case where a Harem anime doesn’t take advantage of its silly premise. What’s disappointing in these anime is that they’re never as outlandish as they promise. In the end, this isn’t a story about how glorious twintails are. It’s just another anime with heroes in dull outfits who shout attack names and beats blobs of metal.2 twintails out of 5 was also cliche but at least it had focus.

That is only until you find out the true power of twin tails. In this anime the comedy is hilarious with the amount of people looking towards this anime it isn't getting enough notice. But think about it... Twin tails. You can't replace such a brilliant idea like that with anything other then the famous twin tails you see on women today. As an anime lover I recommend this anime as a Great comedy and decent story line to follow. "", 'You either die the comedian or you ride the joke long enough to be the reason everyone cringes. This show unfortunately become the latter.The story is best under stood when explained by the loony tunes Tasmanian Devil while on acid during a roller coast ride that breaks down half way through. While its reasoning to be a super hero anime, is beyond mind comprehending other than having a reason to put in as many obscure fetishes into a show as possible, it does however at least keep the basis of a \'superhero\' type anime. Good guy is winning, bad guy gets stronger, good guy starts...to doubt, divine intervention and back to ass kicking, etcWhen you start to give more attention to detail on the shows fanservice suits and insane amount of fetishes, it becomes something a little difficult to watch. While bearable at first, it gets very noticeable about half way through of how little care they put into the actual faces of both the MC\'s and secondary characters alike. The colors are similar to that of a childrens superhero show in that all the good guys are bright colored while the villains are almost always dark, gloomy and obsessed with stealing/destroying something on the earthMusic holds a rather high point about this anime though as not one is it a dull or misused moment with sound effects or BGM. The sound is the one thing that makes the action scenes somewhat captivating and not making you turn off your computer and burning your eyes for the fact of it seems more entertaining at the time.Character development does happen, however... odd it is. Every new development is another strange addition to the characters profile. Most villains never last more than one episode and the process is rinsed and repeated every new installment. Apart from that one lesbian character that was relevant for all of 3 episodes. That was a record secondary character introduction for this anime.Enjoyment and humor was super high from the get go. The sheer ""wtf"" of this keeps you laughing enough to want to see how stupider it can get. Until however by about episode 9 or 10 it gets old and boring when they harp on about the same jokes expecting more laughs and you just want it over with.

Though not too impressive, the plot does improve slightly as the anime progresses. Although not brilliant, the plot did change my view of the anime making...it slightly positive as opposed to slightly negative. The last few episodes really up it a little bit and it does intrigue you a little bit more due to a barrier which needs to be overcome.~Sound~~7~I enjoyed the OP and ED of this anime ~ the ED I would even consider possibly downloading. The character voices suited their respective characters and so I believe the voice actors were well suited to the roles which they each played.~Visuals~~6~I found the graphical style of this anime to be pleasing, though possible slightly below that of many others I have seen ~ that being said it is still enough for it to gain a positive rating of 6. There wasn\'t anything in particular which I disliked about it, but there are areas where I feel it could have been cleaned up slightly. The action scenes were well drawn.~Character~~5~I feel that the characters are one of the weaker points in the anime.

Don\'t ever listen to what your friends tell you to watch.  Cause when you do, you end up watching stuff like this.Fetishes.  Things that appeal to one\'s preference in a sort of sensual matter.  We all have our tastes and things that pertain to us, in which we find attractive and pleasing.  But when you make an anime surrounded by that idea...yeah, it can get pretty weird.  Here\'s Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu, or, in accordance to Funimation\'s dubbing, ""Gonna be a Twintails!""  (Oh god, why.)Story (6.00/10): To be honest, the...show\'s story is quite bland.  Mitsuki Souji, our main protagonist loves the twintail hairstyle.  When I mean loves the style, I mean LOVES the style.  It\'s to the point that he devotes his time to admiring them and even made his tsundere totally not in love with him childhood friend wear them as her natural hairstyle.  One day, a mysterious woman by the name of Twoearle drops down and tells him that the fate of twintails is in danger, leading him to become a twintail himself and protect twintails with his very life!I don\'t think I really need to go into just how absurd this story is, because it really sorta speaks for itself.  What really makes the story bland is the way that it\'s structured.  From episode to episode, you basically get the same cookie-cutter style of storytelling that the Mighty Morphin Power rangers have done for the last 20 years.  A single bad guy and maybe a hoard of disposable minions descends onto the planet with powers unique only to them, the good guys come in to stop them from spreading their evil power over the land to stop terrorizing people, they fight hand-to-hand, usually ending in failure, before bringing out their big guns, before destroying their enemy the exact same way every time.  (This show is basically Power rangers with skimpier clothing, and all the villains have anime-related fetishes.)  With a story like this, the show really becomes nothing more than a snoozefest because there\'s really not much variation from episode to episode.That being said though, the show does diverge a little bit in its story by adding some background to the mysterious Twoearle, as well as making a new focus for its plotline for the second half of the show.  While these attempts to make the show interesting were admirable, it still follows its ""Oh!  A bad guy!  *fights*  Doesn\'t work!  *Uses ultimate attack*  Yeah! We beat him!"" style of storytelling for basically every epiosde.The comedy for the show is subjective at best, trying very hard to be funny with its use of sexual innuendo mostly thanks to Twoearle being the horny girl she is.  You may get a couple laughs out of this show in addition to the many regrets you may tally when watching this, but there\'s really nothing memorable I would say about this.  That being said, make sure you watch this show ALONE with the door closed.  You do not want anyone stepping in when you watch this.Overall, Twintails was...interesting for a storyline to say the least.  The actual way that they delivered the plot was boring to all hell, with the same technique being used over and over and over again like a broken record.  But because this show did have a unique story concept of which is obvious why it was never done before, I guess it gets a good mark for it?Overview:+/-  Interesting story idea?+/-  Subjective comedy  (It\'s mostly just over the top sexual innuendos)-      Stale storytelling-     It\'s honestly kinda awkward to watch.Characters (5.44/10):  Can...can you even call these characters?  The cast of Twintails is...interesting, and I use that word very questionably.First we have Mitsuki Souji.  This guy loves twintails.  Yep, that\'s it.  That\'s all of his character traits.  In the series, Souji is our main protagonist, aka TailRed, as he is known.  Above liking twintails, there\'s not really much to know about him other than the fact that he cares solely for twintails and the many variations that they come in, even going to the extent of proposing for a twintails club at school because reasons.And then we have Tsube Aika, aka TailBlue, aka the ""tsundere childhood friend who has a bust complex"" because we totally haven\'t seen that before.  (Reference 75% of Rei Kugumiya\'s work here)  Similar to Souji, that\'s pretty much all you get for her aside from the fact that she\'s the violent type who can beat the shit out of a gorilla, and still win.  She\'s not a bad character per say, similar to all the others, but there\'s not really much to them since you don\'t really get to know these characters on account of the show saying the word ""Twintails"" every 10 seconds.Then, Twoearle.  Oh, twoearle, twoearle.  Twoearle is the only character that really gets any sort of backstory or semi-focus in this series because of her past and all this jazz that the series pulls.  Apart from maybe like two or three moments in the series, Twoearle is that busty girl character who\'s so horny that she will not hesitate to rape you in your sleep.  Five times.  Again, not really much to her since this show doesn\'t really give a crap about its characters.And finally, we have Erina, aka TailYellow, who is that sweet little rich girl without any common sense as to what things are on account of being raised without knowledge of certain things.  Oh yeah, and she\'s also a masochist.  Go figure.  You get one episode to know about her, and that\'s it.And now the real characters that I wanted to talk about, the Utilmagil, aka the fetish aliens.  These lot are a real piece of work.  Every one of these antagonists is focused on one thing, which is defeating the twintails.  In addition, every single one of them has a personal fetish that they hold dear like it\'s their lives, which honestly is kinda true on account of the fact that these guys last like 20 minutes tops per episode.Overall, the characters, all of them, ranging from major to minor, all have one thing in common.  They all have a fetish to strive for, and desires that some would say is best to keep to themselves.  There is really no development from character to character as the moment you get to know what their tastes in hairstyle/body shape/obscure features like the back of the neck, you\'ll know their entire character 100%.Overview:+/-  They\'re easy to understand?Art and Sound (7.44/10 and 6.44/10): The art for the series is pretty standard.  There isn\'t really too much standout at face value, and the art really just does its job at being a pretty picture to look at with its bright colors.That being said though, the character designs are actually relatively well-detailed.  The characters both good and bad have a good chunk of detail to them and would make an otherwise ordinary show, look a bit better.  However, it\'s also important to keep in mind that the show also uses subjective imagery, and make certain situations a little bit more perverted than they actually are.The soundtrack is generic and ordinary.  Not bad, but not fantastic.  It\'s skippable.  Trust me, it\'s honestly not even worth your time.Overview:+  Good detail on characters+/-  Meh artwork+/-  Meh soundtrackOverall Enjoyment (6.66/10):  Twintails...well...I guess you could say the feeling of this show is sorta unexplainable for me.  While watching the show, I honestly despised it cause every minute I spent watching it was every minute of regret adding to my life, but after finishing the episode, I wasn\'t hesitant to continue watching it more, even going to the extent of finishing the series.  To say I hate this show is a stretch, but then again, saying I like it is also a stretch too.Did I like this show?Um...Well...I\'m not really sure.  I watched it, even becoming somewhat addicted to it by watching five episodes in one go when I said I was only going to watch one, but I don\'t like the storyline.  It\'s...weird to describe it.What didn\'t I like about this show?From a technical standpoint, the show has bland pretty much everything, all except its core story idea of twintails (since the way this idea was handled made the show almost unexplainable as to what the hell it actually was).  As a personal standpoint, I\'m not really sure what to hate because I\'m honestly stunned as to what I should say about this.  (I legitimately cannot find words to accurately describe my feelings for this show.)Would I recommend this to anyone?I personally wouldn\'t recommend it on account of just how weird and strange this show is, as well as the effect that it had on me.  But honestly, this show is, to put in simple terms, an experience.  So, if you want an ""experience"", I\'d put this near FLCL, as it has a similar feeling of ""What the fuck did I just watch"" like this show.  Never have I thought in my life that I would watch Super Slutty Power rangers, and I\'m not really sure how to react.Author\'s note:  I don\'t get how this show isn\'t tagged as gender-bender.  The only guy in the show spends more screentime as a fucking girl than he does his own gender.Overall Score: 6.00/10 show\'s story is quite bland.  Mitsuki Souji, our main protagonist loves the twintail hairstyle.  When I mean loves the style, I mean LOVES the style.  It\'s to the point that he devotes his time to admiring them and even made his tsundere totally not in love with him childhood friend wear them as her natural hairstyle.  One day, a mysterious woman by the name of Twoearle drops down and tells him that the fate of twintails is in danger, leading him to become a twintail himself and protect twintails with his very life!I don\'t think I really need to go into just how absurd this story is, because it really sorta speaks for itself.  What really makes the story bland is the way that it\'s structured.  From episode to episode, you basically get the same cookie-cutter style of storytelling that the Mighty Morphin Power rangers have done for the last 20 years.  A single bad guy and maybe a hoard of disposable minions descends onto the planet with powers unique only to them, the good guys come in to stop them from spreading their evil power over the land to stop terrorizing people, they fight hand-to-hand, usually ending in failure, before bringing out their big guns, before destroying their enemy the exact same way every time.  (This show is basically Power rangers with skimpier clothing, and all the villains have anime-related fetishes.)  With a story like this, the show really becomes nothing more than a snoozefest because there\'s really not much variation from episode to episode.That being said though, the show does diverge a little bit in its story by adding some background to the mysterious Twoearle, as well as making a new focus for its plotline for the second half of the show.  While these attempts to make the show interesting were admirable, it still follows its ""Oh!  A bad guy!  *fights*  Doesn\'t work!  *Uses ultimate attack*  Yeah! We beat him!"" style of storytelling for basically every epiosde.The comedy for the show is subjective at best, trying very hard to be funny with its use of sexual innuendo mostly thanks to Twoearle being the horny girl she is.  You may get a couple laughs out of this show in addition to the many regrets you may tally when watching this, but there\'s really nothing memorable I would say about this.  That being said, make sure you watch this show ALONE with the door closed.  You do not want anyone stepping in when you watch this.Overall, Twintails was...interesting for a storyline to say the least.  The actual way that they delivered the plot was boring to all hell, with the same technique being used over and over and over again like a broken record.  But because this show did have a unique story concept of which is obvious why it was never done before, I guess it gets a good mark for it?Overview:+/-  Interesting story idea?+/-  Subjective comedy  (It\'s mostly just over the top sexual innuendos)-      Stale storytelling-     It\'s honestly kinda awkward to watch.Characters (5.44/10):  Can...can you even call these characters?  The cast of Twintails is...interesting, and I use that word very questionably.First we have Mitsuki Souji.  This guy loves twintails.  Yep, that\'s it.  That\'s all of his character traits.  In the series, Souji is our main protagonist, aka TailRed, as he is known.  Above liking twintails, there\'s not really much to know about him other than the fact that he cares solely for twintails and the many variations that they come in, even going to the extent of proposing for a twintails club at school because reasons.And then we have Tsube Aika, aka TailBlue, aka the ""tsundere childhood friend who has a bust complex"" because we totally haven\'t seen that before.  (Reference 75% of Rei Kugumiya\'s work here)  Similar to Souji, that\'s pretty much all you get for her aside from the fact that she\'s the violent type who can beat the shit out of a gorilla, and still win.  She\'s not a bad character per say, similar to all the others, but there\'s not really much to them since you don\'t really get to know these characters on account of the show saying the word ""Twintails"" every 10 seconds.Then, Twoearle.  Oh, twoearle, twoearle.  Twoearle is the only character that really gets any sort of backstory or semi-focus in this series because of her past and all this jazz that the series pulls.  Apart from maybe like two or three moments in the series, Twoearle is that busty girl character who\'s so horny that she will not hesitate to rape you in your sleep.  Five times.  Again, not really much to her since this show doesn\'t really give a crap about its characters.And finally, we have Erina, aka TailYellow, who is that sweet little rich girl without any common sense as to what things are on account of being raised without knowledge of certain things.  Oh yeah, and she\'s also a masochist.  Go figure.  You get one episode to know about her, and that\'s it.And now the real characters that I wanted to talk about, the Utilmagil, aka the fetish aliens.  These lot are a real piece of work.  Every one of these antagonists is focused on one thing, which is defeating the twintails.  In addition, every single one of them has a personal fetish that they hold dear like it\'s their lives, which honestly is kinda true on account of the fact that these guys last like 20 minutes tops per episode.Overall, the characters, all of them, ranging from major to minor, all have one thing in common.  They all have a fetish to strive for, and desires that some would say is best to keep to themselves.  There is really no development from character to character as the moment you get to know what their tastes in hairstyle/body shape/obscure features like the back of the neck, you\'ll know their entire character 100%.Overview:+/-  They\'re easy to understand?Art and Sound (7.44/10 and 6.44/10): The art for the series is pretty standard.  There isn\'t really too much standout at face value, and the art really just does its job at being a pretty picture to look at with its bright colors.That being said though, the character designs are actually relatively well-detailed.  The characters both good and bad have a good chunk of detail to them and would make an otherwise ordinary show, look a bit better.  However, it\'s also important to keep in mind that the show also uses subjective imagery, and make certain situations a little bit more perverted than they actually are.The soundtrack is generic and ordinary.  Not bad, but not fantastic.  It\'s skippable.  Trust me, it\'s honestly not even worth your time.Overview:+  Good detail on characters+/-  Meh artwork+/-  Meh soundtrackOverall Enjoyment (6.66/10):  Twintails...well...I guess you could say the feeling of this show is sorta unexplainable for me.  While watching the show, I honestly despised it cause every minute I spent watching it was every minute of regret adding to my life, but after finishing the episode, I wasn\'t hesitant to continue watching it more, even going to the extent of finishing the series.  To say I hate this show is a stretch, but then again, saying I like it is also a stretch too.Did I like this show?Um...Well...I\'m not really sure.

The only guy in the show spends more screentime as a fucking girl than he does his own gender.Overall Score: 6.00/10', ""Twin Tails is an anime about embracing all the things in the world that you love with all your heart and soul no matter how random or strange they might be to other people.Yes the over all idea behind it is to embrace twin tails and at first I did not really get into the anime because even though I do like twin tails on girls I'm not super obsessed with them but the idea is not so much the twin tails but its more so about embracing something that's different from the norm.Aside from the twin tail girls themselves this anime presents...these perverted Otaku like lizards who express there own fetishes for certain things they love and these fetishes tend to be really out there and strange like one lizard is like me and embraces the idea of legs and getting stepped on by girls. Another lizard might be obsessed with gender bender guy girls or something just really random or strange.In all honestly all the villains though portrayed as evil are really noting more than just obsessive Otaku goof balls that just have strange fetishes that there very passionate about and want to express to others.Its no different than being a real life Otaku being obsessed with anime and buying all the merchandise you can on it or having a strange sexual fetish that while strange is still something you love and want to embrace with all your heart and also tell people about.Just think of something you yourself love that most view as strange and think about how much you love it anyway and want to express that love with all your heart that's what this anime is aboutThis is also a story that was created to look like a magical girl action anime but if you go into not understanding the true purpose and intent behind it you will not enjoy it and this is why many people who watch this anime come out of it not thinking its any good because they totally miss the point that's why I'm taking the time to express all this to guys so you can hopefully watch this anime with an open mind.This anime is meant to take a bunch of strange hobbies and fetishes to the absolute extreme and using this concept the creator also made a really fun story out of it that's not meant to be taken to seriously.So even if it looks like its meant to be a magical girl action series with transformations and evil villains don't let yourself be fooled.It can honestly be soooo much fun to watch going into it with the proper mind set.Like for me one thing I really like about this anime is I imagine the person who created it had an obsessive love for twin tails on girls mainly from like anime or video game type girls and despite some people looking down on this fetish thinking its stupid or that there's no point to it he was able to turn this random passion of his into something creative in the form of a light novel that then turned into his job that then became an anime that is most likely entertaining tons of people world wide and inspiring them to embrace there weroid fetishes without shame despite what the others say about what they like.He's taking a strange passion in his love of twin tails along with other random fetishes and crafting a story in a way where its all about embracing what you love in the mostly overly obsessed way possibleloving twin tails themselves is not the point nor it that required to love this anime.Just understanding the intent behind it is enough which is embracing something that is out there and weroid not the twin tails themselvesI can totally feel the authors passion for something he loves and admire that he was able to make a story centered around what his passion is cause plenty of people have a passion for something but don't show it for fear of getting judged.I also think this mans example and intent with the story is to say no matter what type of passion a person has in the world you can make something constructive with it regardless of what other people say you just have to have the confidence to embrace it and express it with all your heart and something great could come of it like this man and his random story about twin tails and other fetishes.So if you do watch this anime hopefully your able to take in all the things I mentioned and hopfully this can also inspire you to embrace the things you love and express them without shame and do something with that passion like create a book or draw pictures of it or make videos regarding it and it could turn into a job or just some amazing creative art that has your signature on it.I imagine if this guy talked about his love of twin tails to people in his real life and everyone looked at him thinking that is such a stupid thing to be obsessed over just like how someone can say anime is stupid to be obsessed over cause there just cartoons but you and I know differentlyHe totally ignored any possible criticism he might have gotten and took what he loved which was twin tails and as randomly as it was he created a world for it to be appreciated and expressed and made it into his job and shared that same passion with people all over the world to be entertained by it and also to be inspired to embrace there own fetishes because as I mentioned its not just about twin tails but tons of other fetishes are explored and embraced by other characters so if you have a strange fetish there is a chance it will be highlighted and embraced by one of the characters in the show cause this anime is about embracing what you love no matter how random, strange or weroid not about twin tails even though that happens to be the authors fetishes but its more about embracing something you love with all your heart despite everything.Another thing I love about this anime is the way they introduce the whole harem concept. cause Its done in a way that's more realistic than most.Like the mother is obsessed and open to the idea of her son actually getting teoghter with other women and the friend I mentioned watching the anime with connected this to the idea of japan's declining birth rate that's going on in real life.So if you take that perspective into account it would make since for a Japanese mother to push for her son to be with be with another women and want to get him married off as soon as possible because for the sake of japan's decline birth rate and lack of people getting teoghter.I'm assuming you know the story behind this btw if you don't then I suppose I'm explaining this part for noting but if your aware of japan's issue when it comes to people getting married and having children the if you watch the anime and see the overly nice mother pushing her son to get married to other women just think about it from that perspective and the harem becomes realistic and fun.Anyways I hope this reviewed helped to want to get you into twintails and also helps you to follow your passion in life and embrace it with all your heart no matter what these perverted Otaku like lizards who express there own fetishes for certain things they love and these fetishes tend to be really out there and strange like one lizard is like me and embraces the idea of legs and getting stepped on by girls.

service anime about a boy who super loves girls who wear their hair in twin tails. When earth comes under attack, he is granted the power to transform into Tail-red, a red armored girl with super long twintails.As they defend earth from monsters with a strange range of questionable (but never outright sexual or rated r) fetishes, such as pictures of girls with dolls, bathing suits, or girls in glasses, the show becomes amusingly absurd in how serious it takes the subject matter of believing in the power of your hairstyle.I...truly enjoyed this series. It\'s difficult, relying on the subtitles and wondering if the authors intent has been skewed, but I feel like it\'s got a Monty-Python-esque level of self-respect for it\'s own ridiculousness.The animation, especially near the end of the series, is as good as any I\'ve seen. The color-explosion is extreme, the animation is incredibly smooth, and the music is great. There\'s only a few times where an animation is recycled, but it looks good enough it\'s worth seeing again.The characters are good too. Tail-blue is a good enough tsundere / comic relief, and the sexual deviance of their strange mentor is pretty funny. Tail-reds moms encouragement of these different girls to seduce her boy is a nice touch, and not commonly seen.In the end, you could substitute hairstyles for any number of things, and the message is the same. Whether you are obsessed with girls with twintails, playing nerd games, or doing algebra, it\'s about accepting that you are you and your proud of your skills, even if it\'s something silly.I liked the message, the animation is great, and the show is generally funny and filled with some great anime tropes. I recommend watching it, it\'s free on Hulu. (Don\'t need +!) truly enjoyed this series.

It is very funny because it is relatable and because all of the characters take their fetishes or ""attribute power"" very seriously.The dialogue from all the characters really show how much they love what they love and really makes it relatable to people who have the same and/or similar kind of *ahem* ""attribute power"".The animation and soundtrack are both amazing and although it\'s not...the best animation ever it really shined in their transformations, characters and battles.The best of the soundtrack is the ED ""Twintail Dreamer"", because the song is most fitting in the anime. The lyrics of the song and of course the title really tell about their love for twintails which makes it fit really well and the melody is just epic together with the lyrics because it sounds lighthearted yet passionate. the best animation ever it really shined in their transformations, characters and battles.The best of the soundtrack is the ED ""Twintail Dreamer"", because the song is most fitting in the anime.

Anime characters often have some sort of fetish, but the creators of this particular anime series decided to build the whole storyline on fetishism, made it into a cult and amassed an unusual team to protect the fetishes.A 15-year-old Shoji Mitsuka is obsessed with a hairstyle ""two tails!"" He loves it when girls wear this particular style on their heads, and at the same time he does not notice that his childhood girlfriend is walking around with two tails. And that is...all because the hairstyle for Shoji is a fetish, and he is in love with an unattainable ideal and not a mandate reality. So his new female friend took advantage of this inviting him to defend fetishes from monsters. She suggested defending them as a red-haired girl with two tails on her head. Why monsters need fetishes? Well, because monsters sincerely believe that without fetishes humanity will wither away.Gonna Be the Twin-Tail parodies all anime clichés, but does it rather cleverly – each warrior gets armor according to her fetish. Aa! According to the rules, a team of monster fighters consists only of females, and so Soji will have transform into a girl.The graphics if the series is rather ordinary and the storyline is limited to the opposition between girls and monsters; but here it does not play a big role. The most important thing in such anime series is fighting, hitting, punching, vulgar humor and beautiful female characters.

Many cringe worthy moments of absolute stupidity that will turn away people with a sound mind. Yet because of its “originality” it was one of the most fun watches of the season.Story – 7/10Despite being utterly ridiculous the story is still good. There are no obvious plot holes and progression and development flow so smoothly, truly never a dull moment. But that does not mean it is spectacular, it’s actually pretty cliché. New enemy pops up every...episode and they defeat it while getting just a bit stronger all the time. It’s really in the amazing characters that this anime succeeds.Characters – 10/10Everyone is fantastic. Firstly, just because a characters is over-the-top strange does not make it a bad character. Actually for this anime if we met a normal person, they would be the weird one.  Now let’s start looking at the TwinTails. Red/Souji is your typical weird high school guy with a strange fetish and a childhood friend who loves him but is too dense to notice it. Soji is always fighting for a cause and defends it to the end, even if said cause is a hairstyle. Blue/Aika is the cliché childhood friend in the beginning, but after joining up and becoming TailBlue becomes her own character entirely. Initially she acts normal enough, going along with Souji because she likes him. It’s only when she meets Tweorle that her personality of being quick to anger comes into light. Special note: Sure fire way of getting killed is to call her flat chested. Yellow/Erina, no weird fetish anime would be complete without a seemingly innocent character actually becoming a lecherous beast who would do anything her master commands now would it?  Tweorle is the team leader of sorts as she gave them the ability to become the TwinTails and leads from her hidden HQs that are built overnight. Despite being a constant thorn into Aika’s side she cares about all the TwinTails and does her best to help from afar.This is one of the anime that I will give special notice to the once an episode enemies. As not only do they do a fantastic job of being weird, special shout-out to guy with a back of neck fetish and Spider/Aracnhe guildy for his girlyman fetish, but most of the character progression is caused by their dying words.Art/Animation – 8/10Very beautifully done. The fight scenes were actually very intensive, instead of just seeing the usual of one character moving round and fighting we get to the huge battle and only close in on special dialogue is being used.Sound – 10/10Perfect voice actors for the parts, and an even added bonus for most of the dialogue being so weird and yet the actors being all too serious sounding. The music is very powerful and very good. Most of the tracks are in perfectly accompany the scene they were used in.Enjoyment – 10/10Completely loved this anime and its ungodly levels of weirdness. Even when I became too busy studying during school and skipped other shows I made sure to watch this the moment it came out. Easily one of my top 3 of the season, as it’s just the perfect anime to just watch and laugh.Total Score: 9.21 episode and they defeat it while getting just a bit stronger all the time. It’s really in the amazing characters that this anime succeeds.Characters – 10/10Everyone is fantastic. Firstly, just because a characters is over-the-top strange does not make it a bad character.

As not only do they do a fantastic job of being weird, special shout-out to guy with a back of neck fetish and Spider/Aracnhe guildy for his girlyman fetish, but most of the character progression is caused by their dying words.Art/Animation – 8/10Very beautifully done. The fight scenes were actually very intensive, instead of just seeing the usual of one character moving round and fighting we get to the huge battle and only close in on special dialogue is being used.Sound – 10/10Perfect voice actors for the parts, and an even added bonus for most of the dialogue being so weird and yet the actors being all too serious sounding. The music is very powerful and very good. Most of the tracks are in perfectly accompany the scene they were used in.Enjoyment – 10/10Completely loved this anime and its ungodly levels of weirdness. Even when I became too busy studying during school and skipped other shows I made sure to watch this the moment it came out. Easily one of my top 3 of the season, as it’s just the perfect anime to just watch and laugh.Total Score: 9.21', '""What."" - How I can best describe my experience with this series.Translating the name ""Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu"" it means ""I will become a twintails!"". I was of the opinion that this was a very interesting (if somewhat strange) title, which for that very reason made me start watching it.Story: 6I can only say that I was shocked at the start. I had no idea what to expect and I just found the entire setting absurd and hilarious. I also didn\'t feel like this series had any true story to it at all - Just that a guy with a fetish seems to just...have scored a 20 on his latest dice roll. But something was off. I couldn\'t place my finger on it.And then it hit me like a truck. The basic story was, in essence, a Super Sentai (Power Rangers) parody! But because of that I felt that the story was sacrificed to explore more upon characters. And in all fairness, I believe that was for the best.Art: 9It\'s simply well animated and there are good effects. I\'m impressed with them, really.Sound: 8I think the only nitpick I have is the opening of the series; I am of the opinion that the ending is much better and, in all honesty, fits better as the opening than the actual opening. Otherwise there are good sound effects, good music to set the mood and good voice actors.Character: 9Here\'s what makes the series. As stated above, the story really feels like a parody, which in turn allows it to make characters quite a bit more enjoyable than otherwise. The Monster of the Day enemies are hilarious, and I find myself laughing (and even sympathizing) with the antagonists.As for the main cast, Souji is very interesting. The others are there to fill the main Sentai tropes but the main character is the one who feels like he\'s breaking the mold. And the way they parody the story and the harem genre (somewhat) at the same time does wonders. This series would have been extremely boring had everything been taken 100% seriously, and luckily it\'s not.Enjoyment: 10It\'s hilarious. I can\'t look at this as a 100% serious series, it\'s just got too many parallels with the Sentai genre that I know so well and it makes fun of it all too well. But because I can\'t take it seriously, it becomes better. There are those few serious moments that still don\'t feel entirely unnecessary (heck, alot of them are serious because it makes it more fun), and the show knows when and when not to joke around.Overall: 8In the end, I think if you\'ve watched any Sentai/Power Rangers series as a kid or in your later days, you\'ll find that this series is very funny to watch. If you\'ve watched alot of harem series as well, you\'ll find it even more hilarious. If you haven\'t seen alot from any of these genres you might interpret the show differently, in a way I sadly cannot shed any light on.

Twintails has a stupid plot but it is driven by the crazy characters.Earth has been invaded by the Ultimegil a race of fetishistic creatures who all seek attributes to feed their desires but serve greater masters, the greatest of which enjoys Twintails (really long pigtails Miku Hatsune style). A hero rises up to face them with his equal, if not greater, obsession with this hair style:Sōji MitsukaThis guy is so obssessed...that im pretty sure he is in a padded room imagining all of this. He is a cardboard cutout like every character in this show and honestly is the least funny character in the show as his lines can be summed up with ""Twintails are awesome, fuck you aliens, my passion is greater, i have the biggest dick even when I am a girl because hair is amazing""He spends his fighting time (and a few episodes) as a girl simply called Red (real original guys)This girl is young looking and draws people who enjoy lolis (this show is full of them). She ends up garnering the attention of just about every person on earth and leaves her allies behind in popularity, proving that the world is a bunch of pedos and that flat is justice.Speaking of; remember the fetish freaks from earlier? Well they attempted to answer the question of flat or plot and both died horrible deaths, but at least the flat lover was a tentacle monster.Next in our main cast is Aika Tsube, a wonderful tall loli who has many cute moments in the show that mainly have to do with insecurities about her breast size and the many beatings of Twoearle.This girl becomes Blue when she transforms, her outfit manages to be the most revealing of the trio and she manages to be the strongest physically. She is the ideal tomboy character and appeals to those who want a girl that can kick the ass of all the bullies at school because you don\'t feel like it (unless you are stronk like me and do 500 pushups a day at a minimum).Finally we have a loli that actually is contending for a spot in my favorite characters because she peaks a meter deep in my heart. Erina Shindō, the class president with a submissive side and makes Kanbaru look tame.She looks like serious jail bait and ends up needing to be saved for half the series. However, when she is given a chance, she proves to be a force to be reckoned with and is the only Tail to have a bust. She is Tail Yellow and will strip off her armor in a heartbeat only to become stronger.Her biggest dream is to be Soji\'s pet, this is something that propelled this character so high in my esteem for her. This is because even if one can look objectively at something, they will inevitably enjoy something that brings them happiness and this is one of them. She is hilarious to watch and makes the show for me.The Ultimegil are too numerous to count, but I guarantee that one of them has your fetish, go on, look on the wiki and find one.The story is like a magical girl show (which I classify this as magical girl in every aspect, even down to the loli fan service) and thus is not too great.  The Ultimegil are taken down in troves and the girls occasionally have to get over some self issue in order to take one down. The show just kind of ends with the big boss character being called back on a mission from her boss.The appeal of the show is the fetishes you have and the comedy, because the characters are one dimensional and only have fetishistic value to drive them.Ratings:Story: 5 Really not a story at allAnimation: 7 Good animation all around, no real good moments except the ending theme which has great hair movement at pointsCharacters: 8 Again one dimensional but will appeal to each on a fetishistic and humorous levelSound: 8 This show actually has a great sound track, with the opening and ending really standing outEnjoyment: 8 I enjoyed this show because of the previously stated reasons, with Erina being the shining star for me------------Overall:  7.2 Feed those fetishes my friends, and stay strong. that im pretty sure he is in a padded room imagining all of this.

But here it is anyway:Is this show a plain parody, or a parody of parodies?  Maybe plain satire, or a satire of satires? It’s so many levels, and that’s wonderful! If you are going to watch it, first you really need to understand that this is a satire show that not only makes fun of a bunch not only of a bunch of other anime, but also otakus. Don’t take anything in this show seriously. Ever.The symbolism is very easy to understand. The...ugly invading aliens with their different fetishes, represents us: The consumers of anime. The otakus. The main characters aren’t badly written either. I especially like Tsube Aika (Tail Blue) in her role as “the MC:s childhood friend”. Even though this is a parody (almost at a Leslie Nielsen-level) she feels like a more realistic character than many other characters in other “serious” anime shows. ugly invading aliens with their different fetishes, represents us: The consumers of anime.

Anything and everything about this anime is so random I love it. I really didn\'t expect to like it as much as I did. This anime is so serious with its premise and plotlines, you can\'t help but be confused and laugh it off. However, it\'s also self-aware and sarcastic as well.The story aspect in this anime is very straightforward. There isn\'t much to it, but that simplicity gives this anime strength. It\'s what you\'d expect: a worldwide threat emerges, a hero is born, forces are created, and things go off from there. In a way, it really...reminds me of Power Rangers, with how abstract and straightforward everything is. The boldest part of the entire story, however, is the attributes of the world. It feels like this anime is being sarcastic to the point where it\'s not sarcastic. It\'s so random and abstract, I couldn\'t help but enjoy every second of it. This anime has given me a new appreciation of twin tails.The characters are this anime\'s strong point. Our main cast is a bunch of wild cards that wouldn\'t seem to work well off each other, but you\'d be surprised. From a boy with an obsession with the twin tails hairstyle that gender bends to a busty alien woman with a perverted mind, all the way to a tiny girl who is somewhat a masochist, this anime somehow has it all. Even the one-off enemies and their designs and ""interests"" all have their charms. However, sometimes they do feel a bit bland at times, but this is rare.The animation is iffy. When it comes to fighting scenes, it\'s well done. Everything moves so smoothly and the fights are bold and interesting. However, there is an absurd amount of animation reuse, but from an anime of its time, this is to be expected. The normal everyday scenes and such are less quality, however. This is most obvious with their faces. Whenever a character is talking or the camera shows their face, the face sometimes looks so blown out of proportion (especially the eyes). This isn\'t hard to spot either, as it is unfortunately rather common throughout the episodes. Overall, the animation is lower than quality, but this anime doesn\'t take itself as seriously, so it\'s passable.Overall, an unexpectedly entertaining anime. This anime is purely just dumb fun with glorified seriousness, and that\'s all it is. If you go in expecting more than that, you\'ll be extremely disappointed. The main purpose is really just to entertain and give you a small break from your normal anime. I enjoyed this, and I recommend you give this a watch (even though it\'s most likely not for everyone).Twin Tails Forever. reminds me of Power Rangers, with how abstract and straightforward everything is.

Oh, you don't like twintails? Then don't bother watching because this show is intended to those who like twintails. Why do I say this? Well, there are several reasons.First, The story revolves around twintails. Powers come from twintails, love comes from twintails, everything revolves around twintails! At first, I thought it was hilarious how everyone in the show took it seriously, but it got boring overtime. There was nothing else in the show but public confession of fetishes. Though I must admit, there was a stable plot and also cliffhangers that kept me anticipating for more.As...for the characters... they're not that bad. The MC wasn't really your typical anime schoolboy. He was passionate about twintails, so much that he became one himself. Also, he's not timid and unafraid to show the whole world of his love for it. Let's not forget Twoearle, whom I anticipated to see in twintails. It's this mystery of how she looked like in twintails that really got me interested in her. Other than these two, the other characters don't really stand out.The art and animation could've been better. There were some fails here and there. It wasn't exactly a fluid animation. Maybe the production company didn't have the budget or the luxury of time...? The point is, it could've gone better.All in all, It's a fairly good anime. If you're into twintails, then I recommend you watch it. If you don't, then just watch your favorite fetishes get beaten up. There is only one true fetish, and it's... I said it 11 times and I'll say it again: twintails! for the characters... they're not that bad. The MC wasn't really your typical anime schoolboy. He was passionate about twintails, so much that he became one himself. Also, he's not timid and unafraid to show the whole world of his love for it.

I said it 11 times and I'll say it again: twintails!"", 'I sometimes wonder if an anime that falls just short of being a masterpiece is worse than a true stinker.  Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu is one missed opportunity short of greatness.  While the production values are not particularly high, it has the rare courage to take an outrageous idea and just go for it.  It starts out with great setup but a rather routine monster-of-the-week plot.  But then the story takes progressive turns into ever more daringly deviant territory.  And then it misses the mark in the last two episodes.  I thought it would zig but instead it zagged....Despite this, if you are a fan of gender-bender anime, this one is worth the watch, if only to spark your imagination regarding what could have been.Speaking of what could have been, when I was a kid, I experimented with cross-dressing a couple of times and I was surprised at how gorgeous I looked in the mirror.  For most people, their gender is a huge part of their identity but for me it\'s just a shell we take on to interact with others.  Since I\'m probably unusually detached to gender roles, naturally I was curious about what women\'s lives were like.On an even further side note, I have a tiny daughter now, and she looks just  like I did when I was little.  People literally stop to stare at how cute she is.  She causes a stir everywhere she goes with strangers fawning over her.  So maybe from a genetic perspective that question is answered.How is this relevant to ""Gonna be Twin Tails""?  Well, this is a gender-bender anime, and the target audience is probably kind of small.  It\'s significant for anyone who has ever wanted to be able to change gender, even if only on a temporary basis, just to see what it would be like.  It even has a scene where our main character, Soji, sequesters himself in the bathroom so he can transform into his girl self and... examine himself (herself?) more closely.  It\'s got a hilarious twist exactly appropriate for the theme of the show.  As an example of great dialogue, his childhood friend is watching from a hidden camera and asks, ""I can\'t watch, but I kind of want to.""Soji, the main character, is a guy in high school who REALLY loves pig tails, or ""Twin Tails"" as the Japanese apparently refer to the hair style.  An alien comes to Earth to save us from a third invading alien race out to get our ""Twin Tail"" attribute.  The anime knows how silly this is, and uses it only to set up increasingly deviant fetishes of aliens who seek something very specific, such as having little girls hold dolls.  This anime doesn\'t hold back; a number of popular and embarrassing fetishes are paraded before the audience, and this anime plays them to the hilt.You see, the nice alien lady offers Soji a bracelet that gives him the power to battle the bad aliens on even terms.  Except it also turns him into a loli girl with fabulous twin tails.  Brilliant.Yes, this anime is a harem, and there are multiple girls after Soji.  Yes, it has gobs of over-the-top fan service.  But curiously, it takes the time to explore the psychology of why these girls might actually like the main character instead of just blindly acting as the story requires them to.  These girls have their own hang-ups and some closet deviant fetishes themselves, and aren\'t particularly shy about exhibiting them for comedic effect.The fight scenes are clearly a parody of both mahou shoujo anime and shonen battle anime.  Our team of heroines transform into their battle forms in racy style.  The outfits are skimpy and double entendres are common in the dialogue.  Don\'t tune in for great action scenes.  Watch for the the unabashed way the show just tries really hard to get a smile out of you.  Of course some jokes fall flat but I laughed out loud more often than I really should admit.Then comes episode 11, when Soji wakes up one morning and things take a curious turn.  I was really hoping the show would go there and it does... sort of.  But instead of allowing us to see what social situations this would create, it sticks to its focus on the invading aliens.  It was at this point I thought an opportunity for both outrageous comedy and daring adventure was missed.If an anime is going to be a racy comedy, I prefer the funny, witty kind to the juvenile, embarrassing version.  If someone falls on top of somebody else, by god it should be full-on and not some nerdy accidental breast grope.  At one point our alien lady friend develops a version of the battle bracelet that makes the wearer\'s breasts larger.  Soji\'s flat-chested childhood friend doesn\'t dance around the issue; she begs the alien to allow her to wear this bracelet instead of the one she\'s been given.  Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu even delves into the practical difficulty regarding the proper care and maintenance of the twin tail hairstyle, using this as the pivotal character development turning point for Soji.  ""I wonder if I ever really understood twin tails.""  Brilliant.I can imagine that many people would not like this show.  If you think overly explicit sexual subject matter is childish, you won\'t like it.  If the idea of fetishes turns you off, you probably won\'t like it.  It\'s easy to dismiss this as yet another harem-mahou shoujo-shonen battle anime where a team gets together to save the world while exploring their burgeoning sexuality.  On the other hand, if you are willing to just go with the show\'s brazen attitude, you might enjoy a fetish-filled alien invasion or two. Despite this, if you are a fan of gender-bender anime, this one is worth the watch, if only to spark your imagination regarding what could have been.Speaking of what could have been, when I was a kid, I experimented with cross-dressing a couple of times and I was surprised at how gorgeous I looked in the mirror.

Since I\'m probably unusually detached to gender roles, naturally I was curious about what women\'s lives were like.On an even further side note, I have a tiny daughter now, and she looks just  like I did when I was little.  People literally stop to stare at how cute she is.  She causes a stir everywhere she goes with strangers fawning over her.  So maybe from a genetic perspective that question is answered.How is this relevant to ""Gonna be Twin Tails""?  Well, this is a gender-bender anime, and the target audience is probably kind of small.  It\'s significant for anyone who has ever wanted to be able to change gender, even if only on a temporary basis, just to see what it would be like.  It even has a scene where our main character, Soji, sequesters himself in the bathroom so he can transform into his girl self and... examine himself (herself?) more closely.  It\'s got a hilarious twist exactly appropriate for the theme of the show.  As an example of great dialogue, his childhood friend is watching from a hidden camera and asks, ""I can\'t watch, but I kind of want to.""Soji, the main character, is a guy in high school who REALLY loves pig tails, or ""Twin Tails"" as the Japanese apparently refer to the hair style.  An alien comes to Earth to save us from a third invading alien race out to get our ""Twin Tail"" attribute.  The anime knows how silly this is, and uses it only to set up increasingly deviant fetishes of aliens who seek something very specific, such as having little girls hold dolls.  This anime doesn\'t hold back; a number of popular and embarrassing fetishes are paraded before the audience, and this anime plays them to the hilt.You see, the nice alien lady offers Soji a bracelet that gives him the power to battle the bad aliens on even terms.  Except it also turns him into a loli girl with fabulous twin tails.  Brilliant.Yes, this anime is a harem, and there are multiple girls after Soji.  Yes, it has gobs of over-the-top fan service.  But curiously, it takes the time to explore the psychology of why these girls might actually like the main character instead of just blindly acting as the story requires them to.  These girls have their own hang-ups and some closet deviant fetishes themselves, and aren\'t particularly shy about exhibiting them for comedic effect.The fight scenes are clearly a parody of both mahou shoujo anime and shonen battle anime.  Our team of heroines transform into their battle forms in racy style.  The outfits are skimpy and double entendres are common in the dialogue.  Don\'t tune in for great action scenes.  Watch for the the unabashed way the show just tries really hard to get a smile out of you.  Of course some jokes fall flat but I laughed out loud more often than I really should admit.Then comes episode 11, when Soji wakes up one morning and things take a curious turn.  I was really hoping the show would go there and it does... sort of.  But instead of allowing us to see what social situations this would create, it sticks to its focus on the invading aliens.  It was at this point I thought an opportunity for both outrageous comedy and daring adventure was missed.If an anime is going to be a racy comedy, I prefer the funny, witty kind to the juvenile, embarrassing version.  If someone falls on top of somebody else, by god it should be full-on and not some nerdy accidental breast grope.  At one point our alien lady friend develops a version of the battle bracelet that makes the wearer\'s breasts larger.  Soji\'s flat-chested childhood friend doesn\'t dance around the issue; she begs the alien to allow her to wear this bracelet instead of the one she\'s been given.  Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu even delves into the practical difficulty regarding the proper care and maintenance of the twin tail hairstyle, using this as the pivotal character development turning point for Soji.  ""I wonder if I ever really understood twin tails.""  Brilliant.I can imagine that many people would not like this show.  If you think overly explicit sexual subject matter is childish, you won\'t like it.  If the idea of fetishes turns you off, you probably won\'t like it.  It\'s easy to dismiss this as yet another harem-mahou shoujo-shonen battle anime where a team gets together to save the world while exploring their burgeoning sexuality.  On the other hand, if you are willing to just go with the show\'s brazen attitude, you might enjoy a fetish-filled alien invasion or two.', '""I would gladly give my life to spread the giant breast attribute across the land""--Buffalo Guildy EP 6If you don\'t see the humor in that quote, you aren\'t going to like this anime.Matter of fact take a second and think ofThe Airplane Movies.The Police Squad MoviesThe Scary Movie series.The Producers...A funny thing happened on the way to the forum.Get Smart.If you liked those movies and more importantly were able to appreciate how they deconstructed the genres into absolute comedy gold chances are you will love Twintail. Twintail does the same thing those did, just this time, it\'s being done to anime and the asian/kung fu/fighting genre. It rips tropes from just about everything where they are handled with seriousness, turns them on their head, and lets be just as stupid as they really are.Twintail starts strong with with the main character jonesing, for Twintails, and before you can say hair fetish, he\'s the chosen protector of humanity. The characters are spectacular in themselves. They are all anime types we have seen hundreds of times before and they are played straight but to extremes that bring out the comedy. The bratty girl next door type, the mysterious stranger, the haughty highborn girl with a secret, the clueless about girls main character, the oversexed mom.  (that\'s all in the first 6 minutes) . Then it just builds from there.Bottom line, if you want to spend some laughing at Anime, Silly Asian Fighting Shows and the rather perverted nature of Japanese culture, this is a win for you.

One day he and his childhood friend and neighbor – how original! – meet a strange woman who gives him a bracelet and telling him there isn’t much time to explain. After some time-wasting, she teleports everyone to another location where aliens are attacking girls with twin-tails in order to drain their ‘attributes’. Souji – the hero, uses his bracelet to transform into a little girl...with crazy strength and twin-tails in order to defeat the aliens. Later on, more girls become heroes as well.Yes, it sounds extremely ridiculous, and it is, but the best part is how all the aliens are obviously parodies of otakus / weeaboos. The entertainment value lives on all the crazy stereotypes. Considering the nature of the show, I was expecting it to be heavily ecchi, but it has pretty low amounts of it, which is somewhat refreshing – not that I dislike ecchi or anything...The majority of the storyline is following the girls around the world battling the aliens. Each time they gain a new member or some kind of power that helps them to fight off increasingly tougher and weirder aliens. Towards the end, things take a slightly more serious turn, with some power justifications.There is so much BS flying around and the characters are all too accepting of what is going on, but this clearly isn’t meant to be a serious show. It’s trying to be a comedic parody with all of the reasoning and ridiculous battle scenes. For example, the only thing the heroes stand to gain from defeating the bad guys is to avoid having all the twin-tails taken from their world.There are plenty of discontinuities.ART+ANIMATION+MUSIC:I really like the art style, but the quality is inconsistent.The battle animations are good, while the rest of the show animations range from fine to poor. The exploding bad guys are quite well done for whatever reason.Music is average.Sound effects are mostly overused stock sounds ranging from average to bad.CHARACTERS:Not much depth of characters, but each has their own distinguishing, yet overused, personality traits.The main character, Souji, transforms into a little girl he names “Tailred”. He is a standard fare male lead in most regards. He loves twin-tails to the point of being unable to defeat anything with twin tails.Twoearle is a woman from another planet who is intending to stop the spread of the aliens. She is always trying to seduce Souji, but with the show lacking the ecchi element, it is a lot less annoying than in some other anime.Souji’s childhood friend, Aika, has a crush on him and is constantly fighting off Twoearle. She eventually becomes a hero as well. She is overly self-conscious about her small chest and most of her additions to the show revolve around that and her violent tendencies.Erina is the class president, a cute rich girl who collects hero figures and has an obedience fetish.All the support characters exist to perpetuate the ridiculousness, especially Souji’s mom, who is immediately 100% okay with everything that is going on, and even invites Twoearle into her house knowing full well that she is trying to seduce Souji – even supporting her in that regard – despite Aika’s resistance. On multiple occasions she even accompanies everyone into the secret base that Twoearle built under their house anytime the heroes are called into action.The bad guys are all reptilian/insectoid/etc. personifications of the various sub-focuses of otaku/weeb culture and have unnecessary character development in the style of One Punch Man, where you learn all this backstory only for them to last maybe a portion of the episode. Here it is not nearly as well done for the OP comedic aspect that OPM has, but it’s entertaining nonetheless. Their backstories are essentially just what their favorite ‘attributes’ are, such as “little girls hugging dolls,” “back of the neck showing,” and the more typical “big boobs” and “small boobs” war.The aliens are not inherently evil, as they feed off of these traits and enjoy them similar to the people that they are parodying. Many of their interactions with each other and the heroes is hilariously mundane. My favorite example is where they have a jenga battle in order to determine who will attack Tailred.The character design is reminiscent of other girls-in-battle-suits anime but manages to be less ecchi than average. The exception being Tailyellow, who always receives the more compromising camera angles.ENJOYMENT:It’s so ridiculous that it is funny. Having the various mundane anime fetishisms explicitly mentioned and personified is something new to me.Twoearle’s pushiness, Aika’s chest envy, and Erina’s innocent puppy delusions are nothing super original but they are entertaining.A lot of the jokes are intentionally made to seem sexual but are actually referring to twin-tails. Other jokes actually are sexual.One bad guy complains about the death of true literature as opposed to what anime today has become. This is one of the few shows I have seen that gets (a little bit) political with its jokes, something I miss from American adult cartoons.And of course the gender-bending plays a strong part in the show. I found it entertaining at least. Souji seems to brush it off without much thought, unlike other shows where they immediately start groping all their new parts.

The story is, well, fine. The art is great, but the animation in the later episodes is trash. The sound is great, the character is well, quite frankly, one of the best out there, but was let down quite a bit in some areas. I overall enjoyed the hell out of it.The storyline seems a bit generic, and is repetitive, but the concepts used are amazing (gender bender, and that's literally it). It shows that on the outside, you may be literally nothing, but on...the inside, you are something that is amazing. Tail Red, I'm talking about you. It's quite predictive, in some way, and it's not as polished as some other stories. I could just go on and on about the little things that make it not as polished, but I'll leave that up to you. To me, it just seems predictable, and quite frankly, in some ways, a bit weird. It's quite hard to describe it.Art is, in the best way I can describe it, great in the first few episodes, and then just becomes trash in some of the later episodes. The first few episodes seemed great when it came to animation. Not many corners cut when it came to the action scenes. Later on though, well, let's say episode 10. Skip to about 8:30 and you will glance on possibly one of the worst animation you will ever see. No shading, basic colour. It is basically what an amateur do when he/she is out of time. Disgusting. Literally took all the good out of animation. It WILL make you cringe HARD, and it will hurt.Sound is fine to normal standards, that's why I gave it 8 points. Not amazing, not bad. Just mediocre in anime standards. And the dub isn't that bad... Seems weird like always listening to anime girls speak English, but this one is quite good, more natural than some others.Character is good, but gets generic. A mentor and a few 'kids.' Alright, move on. The gender bender really boosts up the score though, or else it would be a 5 or 4.I enjoyed it, and I'm feeling a bit generous with it. I personally like Tail Red a lot, but everyone else, well, just seems like magical girls doing what they usually do, fight monsters. It's not that emotional, and it's generic.

I thought now would be as good a time as any to watch it, especially after the horrible mess that was Kampfer, a show that shares a similar premise to this one. So, was Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! good? Well, let's hop on and find out!Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThis is the story of Souji Mitsuka, a boy who is obsessed with twin-tails. No, that's an understatement. He's completely consumed by twin-tails. Any girl that arranges her hair into...twin-tails will grab Souji's attention, whether it is Souji's friend Aika or the school council president Erina. Souji's unusual but peaceful life comes to an end when aliens invade the world, attempting to steal twin-tails from mankind. Fortunately, aid comes in the form of Twoearle, a woman that gives Souji a bracelet that transforms him into Tail Red, a superpowered warrior that protects twin-tails. The catch? Souji becomes a little girl whenever he transforms into Tail Red. Well, it's not really a catch because Souji now has his own set of twin-tails he can touch whenever he wants. Soon enough, Aika and Erina join Souji's struggle against the forces of evil and become Twintail Warriors as well.For the lack of a better description, Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! is a fun parody of the Super Sentai franchise, and its American equivalent Power Rangers, and does its best to poke fun at the Sentai genre's elements, such as weapons, secret bases, villains and superhero poses. While the show is not afraid of getting serious and intense once in a while, Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! is mostly a comedy that derives much of its humor from things enjoyed to near-otaku levels Aside from twin-tails, we have characters obsessed with glasses, books, breasts and even effeminate boys. The weird thing from all of this, and the show even acknowledges it, is that by attempting to prevent people from enjoying the things the villains like, the villains are technically destroying the things they like. At least the show is honestly by how corny and ridiculous the villains are, which makes the show so fun in the first place.Unfortunately, if the show cannot take itself seriously, viewers are unlikely to take it seriously. There is dramatic tension and emotional stakes to be had, but they are so low and insignificant that there is no reason for viewers to genuinely be concerned for the characters' safety and wonder whether or not they shall survive the current battle, because they most certainly will. (7/10)CharactersGonna be the Twin-Tail!! features some of the weirdest and most unusual character casts in anime history. Almost every character in the show is obsessed with something, like Souji's love for twin-tails or Dark Grasper's love for glasses. It's always amusing to see the characters express their love for such mundane things, to the point they gain superpowers from it.Aside from his/her love for twin-tails, though, Souji is a pretty standard anime protagonist. He/she dresses in red, wields a sword, derives strength from his/her conviction to protect twin-tails and earns multiple love interests. Now, that doesn't mean Souji is a bad character, far from it, it's just that when you really think about there is depth to him/her and it's the other, more colorful characters that move the story forward. For what it's worth, though, Souji is genuinely heroic and does worthy of the praise he/she gets from his/her comrades. He's basically Natsuru Senou done right.As I said before, the emotional and dramatic heavy-lifting of Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! is done by the supporting cast. It's always fun to see Aika, Erina, Twoearle and, weirdly enough, Dark Grasper try to earn the affections of Souji, even if they fell in love with him for entirely different reasons. I also felt a bit of sympathy towards Aika because of her insecurities towards her body and it appears that her love for Souji gives her some kind of validation, not to mention that her violent assaults on Twoearle are fun to watch. Don't feel too sorry for Twoearle, she makes bad jokes about Aika's chest every 5 minutes. One of the most fascinating characters in the show was Erina, a polite and elegant young girl that becomes sexually perverted when she meets Souji and his/her friends. It's so fun to see her act as the most mature and intelligent of the group in one of moment and then indulge in her sexual fantasies in the next.The villains of Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! have to be some of the weirdest and funniest I have seen in any kind of TV show. Their motivations amount to nothing more than destroying the very things they enjoy so no one else can enjoy them. Even Dark Grasper, the most threatening and dangerous of them all, is a shy and awkward otaku that loves glasses. While they aren't the most threatening or dangerous of villains, they are at least hilarious to watch. (7/10)ArtThe visual quality on this show was amazing. The animators and designers did a fine job in adapting Ayumu Kasuga's art style to life in the animated format. Despite their simplicity, the character designs are pleasing to the eyes and the fight scenes are very well choreographed and animated. Everything, from the weapons and the villains, are excellent references to the toku genre. (8/10)SoundThe soundtrack of Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! was fine. Not great, just fine. Sure, I enjoyed the opener and closer but they were nothing to write about. Still, I was amazed by the quality of the English dub. Bryn Apprill, Sarah Wiedenheft and Mikaela Krantz did a fine job as the three female leads and I appreciated the comedic performances of both Morgan Garrett and Leah Clark. Talent was to great effect in this show. (8/10)OverallIn closing here, Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! is the perfect Kampfer repellent. It's everything Kampfer should have been. It has a genuinely badass protagonist, excellent comedic timing and over-the-top fight scenes. I'm very glad I watched this show after Kampfer. While the lack of serious stakes might turn viewers off, it's still fun to see the show poke fun at the toku genre, as well as the perverted love the characters have towards mundane things. I'm disappointed that this show ultimately didn't get a second season, as it would have been a great chance to dig deeper into the source material, not to mention a chance to improve the comedy. This was a fine show and if you like Super Sentai series, you are likely to enjoy it.

At least the show is honestly by how corny and ridiculous the villains are, which makes the show so fun in the first place.Unfortunately, if the show cannot take itself seriously, viewers are unlikely to take it seriously. There is dramatic tension and emotional stakes to be had, but they are so low and insignificant that there is no reason for viewers to genuinely be concerned for the characters' safety and wonder whether or not they shall survive the current battle, because they most certainly will. (7/10)CharactersGonna be the Twin-Tail!! features some of the weirdest and most unusual character casts in anime history. Almost every character in the show is obsessed with something, like Souji's love for twin-tails or Dark Grasper's love for glasses. It's always amusing to see the characters express their love for such mundane things, to the point they gain superpowers from it.Aside from his/her love for twin-tails, though, Souji is a pretty standard anime protagonist. He/she dresses in red, wields a sword, derives strength from his/her conviction to protect twin-tails and earns multiple love interests. Now, that doesn't mean Souji is a bad character, far from it, it's just that when you really think about there is depth to him/her and it's the other, more colorful characters that move the story forward. For what it's worth, though, Souji is genuinely heroic and does worthy of the praise he/she gets from his/her comrades. He's basically Natsuru Senou done right.As I said before, the emotional and dramatic heavy-lifting of Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! is done by the supporting cast. It's always fun to see Aika, Erina, Twoearle and, weirdly enough, Dark Grasper try to earn the affections of Souji, even if they fell in love with him for entirely different reasons. I also felt a bit of sympathy towards Aika because of her insecurities towards her body and it appears that her love for Souji gives her some kind of validation, not to mention that her violent assaults on Twoearle are fun to watch. Don't feel too sorry for Twoearle, she makes bad jokes about Aika's chest every 5 minutes. One of the most fascinating characters in the show was Erina, a polite and elegant young girl that becomes sexually perverted when she meets Souji and his/her friends. It's so fun to see her act as the most mature and intelligent of the group in one of moment and then indulge in her sexual fantasies in the next.The villains of Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! have to be some of the weirdest and funniest I have seen in any kind of TV show. Their motivations amount to nothing more than destroying the very things they enjoy so no one else can enjoy them. Even Dark Grasper, the most threatening and dangerous of them all, is a shy and awkward otaku that loves glasses. While they aren't the most threatening or dangerous of villains, they are at least hilarious to watch. (7/10)ArtThe visual quality on this show was amazing. The animators and designers did a fine job in adapting Ayumu Kasuga's art style to life in the animated format. Despite their simplicity, the character designs are pleasing to the eyes and the fight scenes are very well choreographed and animated. Everything, from the weapons and the villains, are excellent references to the toku genre. (8/10)SoundThe soundtrack of Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! was fine. Not great, just fine. Sure, I enjoyed the opener and closer but they were nothing to write about. Still, I was amazed by the quality of the English dub. Bryn Apprill, Sarah Wiedenheft and Mikaela Krantz did a fine job as the three female leads and I appreciated the comedic performances of both Morgan Garrett and Leah Clark. Talent was to great effect in this show. (8/10)OverallIn closing here, Gonna be the Twin-Tail!! is the perfect Kampfer repellent. It's everything Kampfer should have been. It has a genuinely badass protagonist, excellent comedic timing and over-the-top fight scenes. I'm very glad I watched this show after Kampfer. While the lack of serious stakes might turn viewers off, it's still fun to see the show poke fun at the toku genre, as well as the perverted love the characters have towards mundane things. I'm disappointed that this show ultimately didn't get a second season, as it would have been a great chance to dig deeper into the source material, not to mention a chance to improve the comedy. This was a fine show and if you like Super Sentai series, you are likely to enjoy it. (7/10)"", 'The whole story is about twintail.

Pokemon Best Wishes!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9107/Pokemon_Best_Wishes,"[""I'm a long time fan of the Pokémon franchise, both anime and video game, but this season of Pokémon really took a turn for the worst.It follows the typical story of Ash Ketchum, but this time there is just about no returning character except for Ash himself and Pikachu. I really liked the character Brock, but sadly he was replaced by a new companion, Cilan. I'm assuming Cilan is supposed to be the exact same as Brock, as he is the first gym leader in Unova. The other companion is as always, a female companion, and her name is Iris. Despite me finding it...pretty cool that she wants to be a dragon Pokémon trainer, she uses the same phrase 'you're such a kid' over, and over again.In my opinion, the biggest downfall for this season is the new drawing style. If your new to Pokémon, this probably doesn't affect you, but this season broke the traditional style. I was surprised when I saw Nurse Joy looking different from the typical format. I'm used to Ash changing his appearance every so often, but these classic characters look so much different. If anything they all look younger, but not in a good way.I'm sad to say that this season made me drop the Pokémon anime, and only after 10 episodes. My overall enjoyment was extremely lacking as I found myself actually hoping the episode was over, after only maybe 5-10 minutes into the episode. I know Pokémon is for a younger audience, but what happened to Ash wanting to be the Pokémon master? He now just wants to make friends, and his Pokémon skills are lacking. His Pikachu basically got reset at the beginning of the season, and I'm assuming at a later point he probably gets beaten. I may revisit the series if I can find the list of episodes he competes in the Pokémon League, if he even did that this season, as nothing can make that bad.Overall ranking around a 3 pretty cool that she wants to be a dragon Pokémon trainer, she uses the same phrase 'you're such a kid' over, and over again.In my opinion, the biggest downfall for this season is the new drawing style.

I\'ve stuck with Pokemon through the first season- until Diamond and Pearl.I\'ve got games and cards, posters and collectibles. I\'ve loved Misty and May was okay- but Dawn? I wished she\'d just go and vanish somewhere.I\'ve loved the first pokemon series when there was just Ash, Misty and Brock. In my opinion, Pokemon should\'ve ended on Diamond and Pearl.Pokemon is one of the worldwide BEST kid cartoon shows, yes for kids. But many teens still watch it, I\'m not saying you shouldn\'t or anything- but Best...Wishes is simply another replay of the other Pokemon seasons.Story- 5The story is the usual simple storyline, Ash goes to venture somewhere new and catch the pokemon- get the gym badges, there\'s going to be a movie where he meets the legendary pokemon of Black & White. So? Sounds pretty repetitive to me.Art- 7The art of pokemon has always scored pretty high points, there are times the animation quality drops  (depending where you\'re watching it). But overall, the art is quite simple and nice to watch. They also have some 3d aspects in it now- not scoring too much points with me.Sound-7The ED & OP are done better than in Diamond & Pearl, good parts to the animators there. The sound is pretty good with some usual themes that get you wrapped around, the battle music is great- it does get a bit repetitive but you don\'t notice it as much. They could use a lot more sound but the usual, pokemon moves have sound effects, the pokemon repeat their names a lot of times...Now onto the voice actors, I find Iris\'s voice a bit annoying but Ash sounds the same. The voice actors do great jobs of portraying their roles.Character-6Remember the catchphrase? : ""Gotta catch em all!""Well, this \'catchphrase\' seems pretty contradictory to me, firstly, I want to point out Ash\'s problems.* He releases a legendary at the end of each movie* He releases all his previously caught pokemon and only keeps Pikachu* No character development at all.Alright, Ash DOES get a bit mature throughout the series but he still has his beginning personality. He is the stereo-typical main character- and after watching MANY anime on my part, this doesn\'t stand out.Is it just me or does Ash seem pretty ""Playboy"" to you? Think about it, Lyra from Diamond & Pearl hinted love to Ash, Dawn does hint it, so does Misty and May. Will Iris?Dent & Iris replace Brock and Misty- Or Brock and Dawn. I\'m getting used to their personality but I must say it\'s not the best trio.Team Rocket! The only group that stayed together throughout the series of pokemon. They are slowly changing but in the previous series they\'ve always given people laughs. They ARE changing- but a bit too slow over the span of almost 12 seasons of Pokemon.Enjoyment 6Why did I rate it a 6? I think the pat on the back goes to the creators on this. Able to come up with almost 100 new pokemon and a new storyline with new characters. As I mentioned before, this plot is becoming very boring. The only thing that stands out is the sound and pokemon there are.As long as they are kids buying games and watching, Pokemon is a never-ending series with the same main character and Pikachu who sticks with him through his whole journey of ""Catching Pokemon!"" ""Collecting Gym Badges!"" ""Releasing all the pokemon!"" ""New journey!""I\'ve forced myself to watch almost 20 episodes, and my thoughts didn\'t change.Overall 6/7Pokemon Best Wishes, I recommend to Hardcore Pokemon Fans. But if you don\'t like the first few episodes, I warn you to stop right there. To all you Pokemon fans out there, I\'m wondering how you manage to stick through this boring loop of same events but different Pokemon and characters.Pokemon Best Wishes is not likely to be the last season, if it sells, they make more. And for about 10 years now, Ash has remained 10. He won\'t ever grow up and the series probably will never end. Until the creators run out of ideas that is- but that may be a long way away.I suggest these series to Pokemon fans, if you\'ve watched Pokemon for a long time and stayed with it through stupid Dawn, watch this. I must say if you\'ve rated this a 9, 8 or 10- you must be a Pokemon fan and hating us \'haters\'.  I want to point out to Pokemon fans that you should really try another anime- there are many other anime after watching you\'ll come back and understand why I rated this low.

I didn´t expect much and I wasn´t disappointed. After 15 episodes I can say: This season is poorly made!For the beginning, the opening: What have they done? The usually good or even great music with their catching lyrics are gone and what is left is a 0815 sound plus voice. The idea of making the pokemon 3D was good but the realization could have been better.The art: My guess is that the producers were only interested in making the attack more eye- catching and flashy. Much to the regret...of the Charas. Ash looks younger and much more stupid than in season 1. His eye colour has changed and his outfit is OK. It could be better but that is for everyone else taste.Characters: OMG that was one of the cruelest thing they ever did on pokemon. Not only is Ashs look younger then before, but his personality as well! Now he´s like a newly 6 years old Trainer who got his his very first pokemon 10 days befor season begun. That would explain why his pikachu was like a level 5 starter. For a pokemon which fought in 4 ligas and beaten up many opponents, his action until now were a complete disaster. Ash used to have a symbol for his tactics and strategies, but now he should give it back, cause he couldn´t live up to it until now.Dente is a poor compensation from brock with the very same skills. He can cook, understand the feelings of pokemon, cares about them and has the function as a advicer. He´s not really that outstanding or interesting like Misty, may or even Brock.Ires. The only thing I can say about her is: she annoys me. And that in every episode. Before I thought dawn was a pain in the ass, but now I think in comperison with Ires she was not that bad, cause Ires tops them all.Story development: Everytime it´s the same. There is some stupid reason why pikachu has lost his power again, then there´s an attempt to steal it. Later pikachu shocks the female or her bike and in the end they confront a new rival who is mostly arrogant and wins the match against Ash.

(Note: this review is based on the English-subtitled, Japanese anime. I strongly recommend watching this series in Japanese to better appreciate the characters for reasons I will explain in later in this review.)A very fun, easy-to-watch show, with exciting moments, updated character designs [while still maintaining the charm of the 90\'s style, the new eye designs show the brown of Ash\'s eyes in more than close-ups and tearful moments], and better animation quality than its predecessors, although it hasn\'t reached XY\'s peaks of beauty or Sun & Moon\'s lively fluidity yet,...it still has well-animated battles and very expressive characters.The soft reboot-esque beginning of the series makes it easier for newcomers and children to start watching without prior knowledge of the series, but it also rewards viewers of the earlier stories by including references to the past, reanimated flashbacks, and returns of some familiar faces (human and Pokemon!) in its second season. This review will focus on the first season.Despite its flaws (a weak league and a strangely one-sided rivalry where Shootie, while framed as the main rival, isn\'t really written as such and his story arc mainly concerns the Champion Adeku/Alder, a frequently misunderstood-by-fans scene in the first episode [a sick Pikachu with Electric type moves temporarily sealed after an encounter with a Legendary loses to a stronger-than-usual starter Pokemon given to a trainer]), it has a lot to enjoy if you liked the humour, friendship stories, sense of adventure of the original series, as well as some very unique/quirky main characters!I absolutely love Satoshi/Ash\'s dynamic with Iris and Dent/Cilan, theirs is a very genuine friendship, each have their own unique inter-group dynamics, and no one is just pushed to the background or ignored until they get a focus episode.The friendship is very genuine, balanced, and natural, with friendly teasing (the dub didn\'t convey this very well, so Iris\' teasing still sounded mean later on for a lot of people) and their own in-jokes (Dragon Sneeze, etc.).Ash is the same character from the first series, although he originally came here on vacation, before getting so excited, he decided to take on the Pokemon gym challenge and aim for the Unova league!Iris is a Dragon empath with empathy issues due to her past and much of her story arc is about learning to open up to and empathize with others\' problems!Dent/Cilan, a Pokemon Sommelier (a sommelier is an expert in food/wine marriages; a Pokemon Sommelier judges the marriage of human trainers and their Pokemon... using wine terminology, do you see why the dub had to change his dialogue and character so much?) starts out very arrogant and self-absorbed (running a PG-rated host club that double functions as a Pokemon Gym with screaming fangirls does that to a guy), but learns to see a new point of view and becomes kinder, but still hilariously self-absorbed and dramatic.He\'s played by MamoMiya (like Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club) which makes him very funny to watch in Japanese due to his theatrics and gratuitous use of English.And these are just the main characters!! The rivals (Iris and Dent/Cilan also have rivals, not just Satoshi/Ash!) are also very funny and quirky, with their own motivations, goals, hobbies, and personalities that play off in amusing ways in the many, many tournament arcs of Best Wishes! which make use of this large cast of rivals.As for Satoshi/Ash\'s ""main rival,"" I found Shootie/Trip a very unique character, even if he wasn\'t invested as a rival for most of it (Kenyan/Stephan, Virgil, and even Bell/Bianca stepped up to that plate more), but he was a unique character and it was interesting seeing him clash with Satoshi/Ash on issues of morality (BW! 22), his cynical world view is quite unique, and seeing them become friends was cute (even if I do wish we had more time spent on that!).The rivals are so colourful and varied in this series, EVERYONE gets a rival or two, and they\'re all so funny and different, there\'s a rival to fit everyone\'s tastes (Burgundy and Cameron are largely comedic, Georgia can be very funny too but also touching in how she develops and directly AND indirectly furthers Iris\' growth, Bell/Bianca is a naive and spoiled-but-sweet character you\'d love to cheer on, Shootie/Trip is one of those morally dubious rivals but he\'s kinder to his Pokemon and less sure of himself, with a surprising motivation that puts him in a different light from Shinji/Paul).In short, any time I go back to this series, I find it very watchable and fun!!!I wish the postponed two-parter would air (even if parts of it were repurposed for the Meloetta arc\'s finale, even XYZ\'s Flare finale), just to satisfy curiosity for how the first major Rocket mission ended in this series (the earthquake and Fukushima Daiichi disaster unfortunately occurred, preventing the episodes from airing [likely due to earthquake imagery and a possible nuclear power metaphor with the Meteonite which the Rockets seeked to weaponize... it would\'ve been in very poor taste to air after that]).Its exclusion leads to some episodes being reordered and a bit of a lull after episode 22 (which was supposed to lead up to the two-parter), but the series picks up again after a few episodes. Understandable. The original series also had similar issues after the banned episode.The first season is more strongly liked and has wider appeal than the second (which takes different directions every few arcs and changes of the title the series to match).A lot of characters aren\'t what they seem at first and should be given time to properly judge them; the Champion Adeku/Alder, for instance, is disappointing due to his character flaws compared to the idealized image another character has of him. That\'s the point. Keep watching to see him actually display his good qualities too, like his wisdom and strength. it still has well-animated battles and very expressive characters.The soft reboot-esque beginning of the series makes it easier for newcomers and children to start watching without prior knowledge of the series, but it also rewards viewers of the earlier stories by including references to the past, reanimated flashbacks, and returns of some familiar faces (human and Pokemon!) in its second season. This review will focus on the first season.Despite its flaws (a weak league and a strangely one-sided rivalry where Shootie, while framed as the main rival, isn\'t really written as such and his story arc mainly concerns the Champion Adeku/Alder, a frequently misunderstood-by-fans scene in the first episode [a sick Pikachu with Electric type moves temporarily sealed after an encounter with a Legendary loses to a stronger-than-usual starter Pokemon given to a trainer]), it has a lot to enjoy if you liked the humour, friendship stories, sense of adventure of the original series, as well as some very unique/quirky main characters!I absolutely love Satoshi/Ash\'s dynamic with Iris and Dent/Cilan, theirs is a very genuine friendship, each have their own unique inter-group dynamics, and no one is just pushed to the background or ignored until they get a focus episode.The friendship is very genuine, balanced, and natural, with friendly teasing (the dub didn\'t convey this very well, so Iris\' teasing still sounded mean later on for a lot of people) and their own in-jokes (Dragon Sneeze, etc.).Ash is the same character from the first series, although he originally came here on vacation, before getting so excited, he decided to take on the Pokemon gym challenge and aim for the Unova league!Iris is a Dragon empath with empathy issues due to her past and much of her story arc is about learning to open up to and empathize with others\' problems!Dent/Cilan, a Pokemon Sommelier (a sommelier is an expert in food/wine marriages; a Pokemon Sommelier judges the marriage of human trainers and their Pokemon... using wine terminology, do you see why the dub had to change his dialogue and character so much?) starts out very arrogant and self-absorbed (running a PG-rated host club that double functions as a Pokemon Gym with screaming fangirls does that to a guy), but learns to see a new point of view and becomes kinder, but still hilariously self-absorbed and dramatic.He\'s played by MamoMiya (like Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club) which makes him very funny to watch in Japanese due to his theatrics and gratuitous use of English.And these are just the main characters!! The rivals (Iris and Dent/Cilan also have rivals, not just Satoshi/Ash!) are also very funny and quirky, with their own motivations, goals, hobbies, and personalities that play off in amusing ways in the many, many tournament arcs of Best Wishes! which make use of this large cast of rivals.As for Satoshi/Ash\'s ""main rival,"" I found Shootie/Trip a very unique character, even if he wasn\'t invested as a rival for most of it (Kenyan/Stephan, Virgil, and even Bell/Bianca stepped up to that plate more), but he was a unique character and it was interesting seeing him clash with Satoshi/Ash on issues of morality (BW! 22), his cynical world view is quite unique, and seeing them become friends was cute (even if I do wish we had more time spent on that!).The rivals are so colourful and varied in this series, EVERYONE gets a rival or two, and they\'re all so funny and different, there\'s a rival to fit everyone\'s tastes (Burgundy and Cameron are largely comedic, Georgia can be very funny too but also touching in how she develops and directly AND indirectly furthers Iris\' growth, Bell/Bianca is a naive and spoiled-but-sweet character you\'d love to cheer on, Shootie/Trip is one of those morally dubious rivals but he\'s kinder to his Pokemon and less sure of himself, with a surprising motivation that puts him in a different light from Shinji/Paul).In short, any time I go back to this series, I find it very watchable and fun!!!I wish the postponed two-parter would air (even if parts of it were repurposed for the Meloetta arc\'s finale, even XYZ\'s Flare finale), just to satisfy curiosity for how the first major Rocket mission ended in this series (the earthquake and Fukushima Daiichi disaster unfortunately occurred, preventing the episodes from airing [likely due to earthquake imagery and a possible nuclear power metaphor with the Meteonite which the Rockets seeked to weaponize... it would\'ve been in very poor taste to air after that]).Its exclusion leads to some episodes being reordered and a bit of a lull after episode 22 (which was supposed to lead up to the two-parter), but the series picks up again after a few episodes.

Keep watching to see him actually display his good qualities too, like his wisdom and strength.', 'There was some time, long ago, when I watched Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, it was in 2012, and then after a long break I wanted to go back watching Pokemon, but didn\'t want to rewatch but complete the series I have started watching from my childhood and completed DP later, so I started off completing the Pokemon anime with Pokemon BW - Best Wishes in Japan, Black & White in the International Dub, it was in 2018, long time after finishing DP, and when I watched Black and White I totally enjoyed, I mean, Ash maybe went back to learn basics, but as I remembered...Pokemon with lots of useless episodes and stupid stories for most of the times, Black and White came to me with lots of Pokemon catches, lots of battles and importantly the series didn\'t took much time from Gym to Gym. I was completely enjoyed from Black and White, that was until I decided I do want to rewatch Pokemon from the start, and when I did rewatched Pokemon and reached for the Advance and the DP which took Ash to more mature places from each series I felt that my first impression of BW were cheated by my the mere long time it took to me to watch the BW series after DP.First of all, the DP series concentrated much more on Ash and Paul than beating Gyms and Contests, more on character development than story, and when reaching the league we all kinda felt cheated by that troll character who invited to prevent Ash going to the Champion League, so Ash forced to return to Pallet Town, and for what? to visit a new region while vacation, not because he needs to be a Pokemon Master, but to purely enjoy himself, it\'s not taking much time for Ash after Legendary Pokemon attack to be convinced to stay in the new region for another Pokemon journey, and then he meets the fake Paul under the name of Trip, which is trying so hard to be Paul, but before of that, did we mentioned that Ash forgot how to damn-how-can-you-forget-obvious-things-you-learned-in-4-different-regions - how to catch, types matches and important of all good battle tactics you so invested on the DP series, the writers didn\'t just lowered Ash level to stupidity, they lowered him down to the start of the series, yeah the same Ashy boy that doesn\'t know what to do in battles and sometimes just having luck due to his Pokemon loving, the only thing is that he knows he traveled in far away regions. great example for that is the scene that is shown in DP where Ash is thinking about strategy, there in DP he concludes he will believe in his Pokemon and that\'s it, and that was very fitting for Ash in DP as he combined his believing in Pokemon in his strategy, but when scenes like this appear in BW he says clumsily ""It will work out somehow, like always!"" I believe that there\'s no need to add much... As a joke I told myself this - between Kanto and Johto Ash didn\'t had time to relax at home but went away immediately, same with Hoen and Sinnoh, but then he stopped running away from home and stayed, so Pallet returned his stupidity.Now that I finished with the Ash stupidity, we will go to the more burning issue - seems the writers had been replaced, and knew that DP story was great, so why not rewrite it in Unova? let\'s create the same model only with some addition, and so Ash has another *hem*fake*hem* rival named Trip, and he\'s so much alike Paul that Ash is encountering now and then, making their rivalry like Paul and Ash in DP, the problem is that Trip is not Paul, while Paul has some kind of training ideology, Trip doesn\'t have, he\'s more like Gary in look-like Paul, the writers so tried to make a ""rivalry"" like Paul and Ash that they forgot that, what made Paul and Ash rivalry was their argued ideology, Trip on the other hand is only thinking that Ash style is lame and he has better (mainly since ash got a restart from the writers so Ash really feels lame compared to Trip). their rivalry is maybe better than Ash and Gary, but it\'s nothing compare to Ash and Paul rivalry. the problem is as I said - the writers just went with it and made their stupid rivalry for the entire BW league arc, some of their encounters are very good, but the feeling of forcing their rivalry is devastating, and again Trip is not that interesting and should had got Gary treatment to show once in a while instead we get a rivalry theme for the series which is not catchy or serious. so yeah their ""rewrite"" had ultimately failed.What\'s more bad about BW characters is the replacement for Brock which survived 2 regions, Brock though to lose his ""role"" in the first series over the seasons, still felt necessary for the series for two simple of reasons - one which Brock who was a gym leader has a lot of information about Pokemon and battles which contributed a lot for Ash\'s benefit, secondly is that Ash and the second teammate doesn\'t know much about surviving in the nature which is the most of the journey, especially in the food category, so his appearance seems essential even though to have some chicks problems. but then he\'s been replaced by Cilan in BW, in the start Brock\'s replacement seems rational to hold the above commitments - he himself is a Gym leader from the first gym and the gym itself is kind of a restaurant which makes him immediately the new cook for the gang, he declares when joining Ash and Iris (which I will write about her in the ""good"" section) that he\'s aiming to be a better Pokemon Connoisseur, which his job his to evaluate Pokemon abilities, he\'s aiming to be class A, which are actually better ambitions than Brock\'s breeder ambition which seems he have gained it long time ago. but that\'s only for the start. Cilan quickly shows a different problem which Brock had, if Brock had problems seeing-girls-without-starting-with-her, Cilan is quickly claims he is Connoisseur for everything that moving, and it\'s annoying, very annoying which I will not even start to explain why but only to say that guy doesn\'t have much of a life if he can\'t find one thing to concentrate in and every couple of days saying ""IT\'S CONNOISSEUR TIME"" for stupid things like trains or ""IT""S EVALUATION TIME"", which is very annoying hearing it very each episode, even Team Rocket motto is much more bearable. my only thought of ""why did they do this?"" has come with simple answer - Piplup with his annoying ""pip-lap pip-lap"" cry had been out, they wanted another one.After so many bad things, there\'s some good things, though not to ""save"" the BW series from being the worse, they makes the series more bearable.First of them is Iris, which is the Misty-May-Dawn replacement, the first good thing about Iris is that she\'s written much more tomboy than May and Dawn and reminds a lot of Misty whom liked a lot to tell Ash he\'s a kid not-literally, Iris doing the same only literally, and I mean she literally calls Ash ""you\'re such a kid"", no wonder though she\'s calling him that way after the restart the writers gave him. And that\'s not only in the beginning, the more the story continues the more we learn about her and her love for Water-sorry, Dragon Pokemon, and her ambitions are to be... yeah that\'s right, a Dragon Pokemon Master, Misty anyone? I won\'t deny for Misty to be one of the best characters, but Iris just has to offer much more than Misty - there\'s really a lovely story between her and her Axew which develops along the story, and her mature attitude on Pokemon (unlike Ash in this series) really makes you grow on her, so if there\'s really great pearl in BW is Iris.Another great change that everyone loves, is the change of Team Rocket, and no, they haven\'t became less annoying or less ""let\'s catch Pikachu"", but they finally seem more fitting to their mature age, doing secret missions for their Boss Geovany. this great ""change"" making them first of all less annoying by the fact they are not appearing in every episode anymore, and secondly to make ""Team Rocket"" how they should have been done in the first place in the anime like in the games - the Player is encountering the evil team in the region doing their schemes and sabotage their scheme but not enough to catch them, and finally it\'s done in BW with Ash and Team Rocket. Their BW special appearance is continuing \'till the lousy Decolora arc, and might be their best appearance in the series, their characteristic may not have changed much though their mature work, but that\'s how we like them, only in much better performance.Another thing which is good in the series, is the fact that though Ash is acting like he never battled a Pokemon battle in his life, he\'s catching much more Pokemon in BW than the rest of Pokemon seasons, BW will be remembered by me as the first series when Ash caught more than 8 Pokemon per series and actually request to change his 6 Pokemon team much more often, which can make you be surprised from battle to battle, he is also not afraid much to evolve them, though some evolution treatment reminds me the Johto evolution treatment he still has a variety of Pokemon in BW. Also, though the complains about Ash\'s stupidly restart, seems he hasn\'t forgot to treat his Pokemon with good training from time to time, one of the best moment in the series is when Ash actually goes to Pokemon fitting gym to train them, or rather training their new moves so Ash is not completely lost cause about Pokemon training though he is clueless about everything else (which is a really big contradiction for his training attitude, but I will not go further this since BW is bad enough). add to that the fact that like the Advance and DP series the gym leaders development before the actual battle is kept which makes things better.Something more that makes the BW story bearable, is the fact that the battle tournaments are much more often instead getting fillers episode style ""the gang meets a trainer with his Pokemon bla bla bla"", in some way it\'s making BW much better because after all Pokemon is about Pokemon battling, and we have that a lot here, making Ash battle more than only Gym battles, but it also has the other way around - though to be more interesting it feels like the writers didn\'t know how to stretch the story anymore, and because there aren\'t contests anymore they are filling the holes with more Pokemon tournaments, maybe to once again make BW resemble the way of DP that did this kind of tournaments but it just seems forced.Before we end this long ""Story & Characters"" section, I will talk shortly about two rather supportive characters that feel like ""Paul"" fakes but not for Ash but for Cilan and iris, one of is Burgundly who is rival with Cilan and Georgia who is rival with Iris as she calls herself ""Dragon Buster"", the two make good interesting points in the series, but they get similar ""Paul"" treatment like Trip for Iris and Cilan which is in another word a pain in the butt. there\'s also Bianca which is a replacement for Barry from DP to adapt the character chibi from the game, but has annoying style though to still add some story to the anime.Story: 6/10Characters: 7/10Thing that may making the BW a little better from DP is the thing with Art and Animation, finally the moves don\'t look stretched and old but more like the attacks from the game, don\'t get it wrong, there is still used frames, but they are now looking much more refreshed and new than DP reused frames.The art getting serious update as well, some may complain about Ash\'s anime style eyes and looking as a child with those, but the general idea of the animation is completely fresh making huge step from DP.The OST as well making some changes, first of all, to use many of the games sounds is a great idea that used well especially since the BW game sounds are much more cleaner than the old GBA sounds, and secondly those are used more smartly.All these great upgrades in the OST and animation really made me wondering loudly while writing - why they couldn\'t invest their brains in the story like they invested it on the OST and the animation? though that treatment came in the next franchise series XY it\'s still making the OST and animation pale in comparison to the DP\'s story quality which I\'m preferring more on rather good OST and animation as BW.Sound: 8Art: 8Despite that the BW is maybe the worst series in the Pokemon franchise, precisely from the story and characters problems mentioned, it still has the more filler clean story than the other Pokemon series which must be brought to point together with the other good points, but it still disappointing to see BW right away after the good DP, so those points only make the series to be bearable, and not that fun to watch.There\'s a good potential in BW and I will admit it, like Iris, some Characters and the Gym leaders development, and especially with Team Rocket that too bad they didn\'t continued to be like in BW for the rest of the franchise, the problems are those bad points, the too much trying to resemble the rivalry of Trip and Ash to Paul and Ash and above all the stupid restart of Ash after great development in DP, all that together making BW worse as Johto arc. too bad OLM didn\'t used the good potential, especially since the game is one of the best in the franchise for me.Enjoyment: 5/10Overall: 6/10 Pokemon with lots of useless episodes and stupid stories for most of the times, Black and White came to me with lots of Pokemon catches, lots of battles and importantly the series didn\'t took much time from Gym to Gym. I was completely enjoyed from Black and White, that was until I decided I do want to rewatch Pokemon from the start, and when I did rewatched Pokemon and reached for the Advance and the DP which took Ash to more mature places from each series I felt that my first impression of BW were cheated by my the mere long time it took to me to watch the BW series after DP.First of all, the DP series concentrated much more on Ash and Paul than beating Gyms and Contests, more on character development than story, and when reaching the league we all kinda felt cheated by that troll character who invited to prevent Ash going to the Champion League, so Ash forced to return to Pallet Town, and for what? to visit a new region while vacation, not because he needs to be a Pokemon Master, but to purely enjoy himself, it\'s not taking much time for Ash after Legendary Pokemon attack to be convinced to stay in the new region for another Pokemon journey, and then he meets the fake Paul under the name of Trip, which is trying so hard to be Paul, but before of that, did we mentioned that Ash forgot how to damn-how-can-you-forget-obvious-things-you-learned-in-4-different-regions - how to catch, types matches and important of all good battle tactics you so invested on the DP series, the writers didn\'t just lowered Ash level to stupidity, they lowered him down to the start of the series, yeah the same Ashy boy that doesn\'t know what to do in battles and sometimes just having luck due to his Pokemon loving, the only thing is that he knows he traveled in far away regions. great example for that is the scene that is shown in DP where Ash is thinking about strategy, there in DP he concludes he will believe in his Pokemon and that\'s it, and that was very fitting for Ash in DP as he combined his believing in Pokemon in his strategy, but when scenes like this appear in BW he says clumsily ""It will work out somehow, like always!""

Many people don't like it because it is a soft reboot.I think their nostalgia is blinding them. I watched it in 2010 then rewatched it again in 2021 with all of the other seasons. The first pokemon season is the worst in my opinion because they are trying so hard to appeal to the western audience. The world is still a lot like the real world. But the game world is a lot alien. They were afraid that an alien world might weird out the audience and that's why the first season is so bad.But...here they are just presenting the real world of pokemon. They not trying to please the western audience. It is alien and different. That's why people don't like it.Writing has gotten better with each season of pokemon. It shines very well in this season. Episodes are funny for me. I love Oshawott and Emolga. I like the new art style.Ash's brain is reset and it might displease some but I don't care. Every new game gives us a mute protagonist and the entire game mechanism is introduced again. They did the same thing in the anime. I like the changes made to the team rocket. Because of these changes we got two season finales. One here and next one in the next season. These season finales feel great because of the entire build-up. Most of the previous seasons just ended anywhere. Team Rocket was the most annoying part of season 1. They did the same thing in each episode and dumb people enjoyed it for some reason. Now they are part of the story seriously and people are complaining. This season has a better structure than any of the previous ones.Each episode is well written and something new happens. Each character and pokemon have so much more personality. I just love the cottonee episode.Attack animations are changed. I saw some people complaining. This has been done first time in the anime but in the games, each new console has different attack animation.Music from games is used more than in previous seasons and I like that.The episodes where Meowth joins our crew are so fun. Iris even tries to capture Meowth.In the Purrloin episode, Meowth and Oshawott fall in love with the Purrloin but it turns out to be a guy. So there are subtle jokes here and there in this season and I like them.There is a lack of fillers. All eight badges are acquired in just 84 episodes. The travels between each town are small. Instead, more focus is given to battle competitions that happen in each town.Many people dismiss this series because they changed many things that people loved over the years. I don't like to watch the same stuff again and again. That's why I like this. They did something new this time. Give this season a try. Yes, the next seasons of Black and White suck but this one is very good. here they are just presenting the real world of pokemon. They not trying to please the western audience. It is alien and different. That's why people don't like it.Writing has gotten better with each season of pokemon. It shines very well in this season. Episodes are funny for me. I love Oshawott and Emolga. I like the new art style.Ash's brain is reset and it might displease some but I don't care. Every new game gives us a mute protagonist and the entire game mechanism is introduced again. They did the same thing in the anime. I like the changes made to the team rocket. Because of these changes we got two season finales. One here and next one in the next season. These season finales feel great because of the entire build-up. Most of the previous seasons just ended anywhere. Team Rocket was the most annoying part of season 1. They did the same thing in each episode and dumb people enjoyed it for some reason. Now they are part of the story seriously and people are complaining. This season has a better structure than any of the previous ones.Each episode is well written and something new happens. Each character and pokemon have so much more personality. I just love the cottonee episode.Attack animations are changed. I saw some people complaining. This has been done first time in the anime but in the games, each new console has different attack animation.Music from games is used more than in previous seasons and I like that.The episodes where Meowth joins our crew are so fun. Iris even tries to capture Meowth.In the Purrloin episode, Meowth and Oshawott fall in love with the Purrloin but it turns out to be a guy. So there are subtle jokes here and there in this season and I like them.There is a lack of fillers. All eight badges are acquired in just 84 episodes. The travels between each town are small. Instead, more focus is given to battle competitions that happen in each town.Many people dismiss this series because they changed many things that people loved over the years. I don't like to watch the same stuff again and again. That's why I like this. They did something new this time. Give this season a try. Yes, the next seasons of Black and White suck but this one is very good."", ""I've always loved Pokemon, so there's no doubt that I will love this series too. That in mind, so far, the first few eps have been very similar to the first season of Pokemon.I'm enjoying the darker, less slapstick-heavy Team Rocket as they were becoming too farcical in the previous seasons.I also like what we've seen of the Isshu region so far, the lack of prior generation Pokemon is a good idea on the part of the creators.I had read that this season was going to be faster-paced and more exciting than previous seasons and I've certainly been excited to see the episodes and loved...them but I think it's more love of new Pokemon as the story is as slow moving as it always was. them but I think it's more love of new Pokemon as the story is as slow moving as it always was."", 'Pokemon is one of my favorite video game series of all time. I also a huge fan of the movies,anime,etc. I love anything pokemon. Pokemon Best Wishes! is a very boring series. In my opinion, it ruined pokemon. Like a Ice Cream Cone pokemon? Thats stupid. I can\'t stand it. I wish pokemon will be like what it used to be.Storyline3/10-Ash Ketchum, a 10 year old kid now going to the Unova region to catch em\' all. I wouldn\'t hate the storyline to much if it wasn\'t so dumb. I don\'t hate the pokemon storyline. From Indigo Leauge, to Dimaond and Pearl, it was amazing....Black and White ruined it. Its so boring now. It got less interning because of the fillers. Like one fill about Ash helping some little kids with some thing. I really don\'t care because its boring. Pokemon used to have good fillers like Meowth\'s backstory. The fillers here suck. Also, the storyline gets less enjoyable. The only good thing is that pokemon still has its charm with the storyline. But the charm here is very little.Characters3/10-This is the worst part. Iris is worst then Dawn. All she says is ""Your such a little kid""! I can\'t stand that. Ash seems more childish now too. It seems like he just got less mature. Ash was always a idiot, but not like this. I mean, no trainer uses a water type pokemon against a grass type pokemon. It just doesn\'t work. Ash should know that by now if he\'s been a trainer for almost 20 years now. Cilian is the new character that replaced Brock. Even if he\'s strange, no character can replace Brock. Team Rocket isn\'t funny no more. WHY?! Team Rocket was so funny. There aren\'t many good characters, only Snivy(the grass starter pokemon).,and that otter pokemon that Ash caught are the characters are good.Soundtrack5/10-Pokemon always had great music. The wild pokemon battle theme and the trainer theme are the best. Sadly, Best Wishes! fails with the soundtrack. Its okay, its not the worst, not the best. Its in between. The Black and White video game had this really sad music that was beautiful. However, the anime didn\'t have the music. Why does the soundtrack have to be worst then the other soundtracks from the anime? Its not even close to being horrible, but that doesn\'t mean its great. I never really thought of the OST because its unmemorable. (the opening theme songs are good,but the OST is still decent).Art4/10-Best Wishes! has new art, but its not good. The new looks for the characters are just plain bad. Ash has a very bad look now. He used to have black hair and black eyes. Now he has blueish hair with big brown eyes. The new look just isn\'t that good. The characters looks just feels sloppy. The pokemon attacks has bright colors, and the opening theme songs has a lot of bright colors, but it just not as good as the other art.Enjoyment4/10-There where times when I did enjoy this anime, in a way,but the overall anime is a let down. It is bad. Nothing will change that. Pokemon used to be great,now its bad. There isnt a lot of enjoyment,so it gets a 4.Overall4/10-Pokemon Best Wishes! is still boring, and is one of the pokemon series so far. I barely enjoyed it. The pokemon looks, candles, ice cream, steel ants, what is this? DO NOT WATCH THIS ITS POORLY MADE. Black and White ruined it. Its so boring now. It got less interning because of the fillers.

DO NOT WATCH THIS ITS POORLY MADE.', ""At long last, the Pokemon anime series has develpoed some sense of maturity.After enduring the Diamond & Pearl season and watching the deterioration of Dawn (a character that I liked at first but throughout the course of the series turned into a whinier version of Misty), and with the new Black & White DS games coming out, I was filled with anticipation upon the upcoming Best Wishes season. A new region (Unova), brand-new Pokemon (156 if I counted right), and a couple of new companions for Ash make for exciting new adventures for our budding Pokemon master. Best Wishes so far has met its expectations...as being the most entertaining Pokemon season to date, despite still using the same basic, episodic plot formula.The new characters Iris and Cilan are great addtions to the Pokeverse, and they are a tremendous upgrade to Dawn and Brock respectively. Iris especially make a excellent companion to Ash. She does have some of the brassness and cockiness as Misty, but she's far less annoying. But in a way she does have some of the same characterisitics as Ash such as dealing with difficult Pokemon in her possession (Excadrill and later in the series Emolga), wanting to be the best trainer, not backing down from a challenge, and so on. Cilan is pretty much like Brock without the womanizing that became Brock's trademark. Just by that aspect alone Cilan became a likeable and enjoyable character to watch. And he can hold his own in battle (he is a gym leader, after all).But what really makes the Best Wishes season stand out over the prior versions is how they are utilizing Team Rocket. No longer are they the bumbling idiots that are always going after Pikachu and some other random Pokemon/Pokemon of the Week every time and blasting off after Ash & Co. defeat them. Now they have a more serious, vicious tone to their deeds. Yes, they're still going after Pikachu, but now they're not as prominent as they were in the past. I think it's a very refreshing and dynamic direction that the writers are taking them, and I feel that it was long overdue.The music should have a familiar feeling to Pokemon players as it was taken directly from the Black & White games, similar to the preceeding seasons. As a seasoned Pokemon player, I always liked the soundtrack of the various versions of the game (even dating back to the old Game Bay Color days), however I consider the soundtrack to the Black & White games the best in the series. So watching the episodes and listening to the background music gives a good nostalgic feel.Not much change in the artwork in the Best Wishes season them in prior season. Still have the very familiar and basic tones and colors, nothing elaborate or spectacular as one should expect from Pokemon.But despite the improvements of some of the aspects of the long-running anime series, it's still Pokemon, and it still has the same basic plot devices and episodic formula. By no means do I consider it a bad thing - thanks to the more mature aspect of some of the characters (especially Team Rocket) and the exciting new region and the Pokemon that resides in Unova, Best Wishes is the most exciting and dare I say it watchable Pokemon season to date. as being the most entertaining Pokemon season to date, despite still using the same basic, episodic plot formula.The new characters Iris and Cilan are great addtions to the Pokeverse, and they are a tremendous upgrade to Dawn and Brock respectively.

They make sure made it really derpy and kind of interesting at some points. I usually don't watch the pokemon anime, but I loved playing Black so much that I checked this out and I'm glad I did because this is simply hilarious.The story is pretty similar to other pokemon series; Ash ans friends going around on adventure to be the pokemon master. The different things are the different characters from the Unova region.The best character is definitely Dent/Cilan because he's voiced by Miyano Mamoru and...his personality is so weird and funny. Just hearing his random phrases about this taste and that makes me LOL.The thing I don't understand is why there is no Cheren when there is Bel (forgot her English name). I feel like Cheren should be the main rival of Ash in this anime but idk why they made another character for that.Now the main reason I watch this show is the Subway Masters! I'm so happy they made it to the anime even though some people just didn't (like Cheren, Black/White, N....).

Its still not as good as the original anime series but its a big improvement from the horrible Sinnoh anime.Now I've never really been the biggest fan of the anime I stopped watching when Misty and Brock left and watched a little bit of the Diamond and Pearl anime which I couldn't stand. The Hoenn anime is still a mystery to me. I always preferred the games and manga over the anime. I thought the characters had a lot more personality in them (well not...in the games as the main character doesn't speak.)I wish that they would just kick off Ash Ketchum as he is never going to become a Pokemon master is he. In the next region I hope they have new characters but I know that's never going to happen.So anyway let's get back to the review. I think that the art and sound are great as its always been. I've always loved the music in Pokemon so there is nothing really to say there.Now I really don't have a problem with any of the characters apart from Ash but I've explained all of that above. My favourite character would have to be Cilan closely followed by Iris. I love their personalities.I think Team Rocket are better in this anime as well as they seem to be a lot more serious like real villains but sometimes I just wish they would crack a lame joke like they used to in the original anime, but I really don't care if they don't it would just be fun to see.So overall I like this series.

I really hated this show when it first came out but know i have grown used to the graphics. the overall story is tahe same as the other plot- with average flow, its kind of an easy going show, not very fast paced. You can skim it without missing anything important. Good classic anime. ', 'Here\'s my approach to kid\'s anime -  choose a flavor and enjoy it.Sure, there\'s some truly fantastic series being made sometimes, but a lot of things are just average. There\'s nothing wrong with average. Depending on your point of view, Average can be Above Average, or Below Average, or really awesome, or total crap.When it comes to Pokemon, you don\'t want to watch all of it. It\'s been on for 15 years, it\'s never going to stop. So pick your favorite Generation, and watch that.I picked ""Best Wishes"" because I loved the Black/White games. Plus, this series is modern, it uses digital...ink, and is available in widescreen.Story: One refreshing aspect of this season was the change for Team Rocket, they used to appear in every episode, but this season they\'re only used half the time. Jesse and James also get serious, they spend most of the beginning of the season succeeding in their schemes. Something else I noticed, every 12 episodes, we get a two-parter, a cool change of pace to show us that thing are not easy enough to resolve using one episode.Sadly, Team Plasma do not appear until the end of this generation.Characters: Ash\'s traveling companions, this time it\'s Iris and Cilan. I can predict that we will never see someone stick around like Brock did for Four Generations. I\'m guessing the writers got tired of making the same gag over and over again, so now every traveling companion will be limited to each region, with only cameos every now and then.Cilan takes Brock\'s role as ""older brother"" to Ash, and playing the man in the apron. Cilan\'s tick of comparing everything to food can get pretty grating sometimes. They also do a bit more with the fact that he is a gym leader and an expert on pokemon. They even add a rival for him named Burgundy, it\'s refreshing to see a character actually completely outclass their rival for once.Iris is Ash\'s second companion, a Dragon Trainer, and a different take on the Tsundere Girl. Iris spent a lot of time by herself in the mountains, so it made her more bold, blunt, and energetic  than an ordinary girl. While she sometimes berates Ash for not knowing things, there are times when she doesn\'t know things either. They add an Ice Type trainer named Georgia who is my favorite of all the rivals.Ash gets a rival named Trip, who is just a watered down version of Paul.Overall: I liked Pokemon Best Wishes. There are times when you just want to sit back and let the TV play. I wanted a super long simple show, and that\'s what Pokemon is.

This doesn't mean that Pokémon can't be enjoyed by older audiences, in fact, Pokémon has always been a show that is incredibly easy to watch and enjoy - and the new series actually have some really great art, sound and story direction.However, even when I saw the Black and White anime when it first aired, I knew something wasn't right. Within the first episode, despite all Ash (Satoshi) had learnt, he loses to a lvl 5 Snivy, owned by a trainer who is clearly a knock-off Gary Oak. I...remember being so confused why Ash always needed constant reminders about Pokémon type matchups, what specific moves did and how they worked, how many Pokémon he was allowed to carry - when at this point, Ash had already visited 5 separate regions, and learnt all the basics a million times. I understood that this was simply to guide new audience members into the world of Pokémon, and explain the basics; but for some reason the writers made Ash seem like a total moron. In the Sinnoh series, Ash had an amazingly strong team, and even had a really well written and fleshed-out rival, in the likes of, Paul. This was all thrown out of the window when this series rolled around.I've been back to watch this series since, and even compared to the original Pokémon series, Ash appears to be a mindless trainer who hardly puts any strategy into the fights, and is even surprised when one of Pikachu's electric attacks has no effect against a ground type Pokémon. Although the series EVENTUALLY picked up its pace, this is definitely the worst iteration of Ash. remember being so confused why Ash always needed constant reminders about Pokémon type matchups, what specific moves did and how they worked, how many Pokémon he was allowed to carry - when at this point, Ash had already visited 5 separate regions, and learnt all the basics a million times.

He was an idiot, a spoiled brat and a growing jerk, but he always wanted to be a good guy. He is completely unaware of the dark future that lies in wait for him. One day, he found a toy drum, with a cute,yellow creature on it. Sadly, some asshole stole it, along with all his other toys (It was the house butler, or as we like to call them, the bat-man. I\'m not kidding, I was facing an existential crisis when I heard that). A few months later, he saw a new TV show...on Cartoon Network. It had a young boy, who wanted to be a Pokemon Master, along with a yellow creature, named Pikachu. He loved it, and became a die hard fan. This lead him to a world of wonder, where his stupidity had a heavy price (worth his sister\'s love), and that studying will get him a new pack of Pokemon cards (Who needs drugs, when you can pop open a booster pack full of your favorite Pokemon?). He finished Pokemon Gen 1, then Gen2, then his favorite, Gen 3, and so forth. He didn\'t like Pokemon, he LOVED it. He even has a username based on one of his favorite Pokemon. Who is he you ask? That boy would grow up to be known as, SirKnight007, ME, the anti-social nerd, who joined MAL and is here to give you an honest to goodness review. And as a Diehard Pokemon fan, I tell you this-POKEMON BEST WISHES SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!Let\'s move on with the review.Story - 3 - For those of you who watched the anime, you know the story by the back of your hand. Ash wants to be Pokemon Master, yada yada yada yada. But here\'s the kicker. When you watched the show, some of you might have noticed that, somethings off. It\'s itching at the back of your mind, and then it hits you. I\'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE!! Yes, you guessed it right, this season recycles everything from the previous seasons and makes it cringe-inductively childish. We have the filler, showcasing all the Pokemon, but they are just downright LAME. In the previous seasons, the fillers would be more interesting and captivating, making us wish we were in the Kanto region, or go surfing in the Orange islands and check out the female Swimmers and the Beauties, if you what I\'m saying ;-). But here, NO, just NO. If someone gave me the choice to live in Vampire Nazi infested England or Unova, I\'ll take the former and get me some Harkannen (did I spell that right?) and blow that New York-wanna-be to pieces (I still look forward to going to New York though. I heard it\'s awesome in comparison to THIS monstrosity).Art and Sound won\'t be here, because I cringed so much I didn\'t give a damn. So I\'ll add in a new segment (Please forgive me admins of MAL, but THIS must be addressed) called The Works, and break an anime down to it\'s core and find the reason for it\'s ascension, or it\'s downfall. By the way, both Art and Sound got 4.The Works - 10 - Why 10? Because it explains everything. You all should know that the anime is based on the Gen 5 game, the series that, in my opinion, jumped the Sharpedo. It had an excellent premise, but the Pokemon introduced were....er, let\'s say, recycled. You can make a list of recycled Pokemon and it still wouldn\'t be enough. You see, what I concur is that the anime decided to recycle the best part of the previous seasons, just like they recycled the Pokemon in the game. There were good writers and staff, and the fact that they tried to recycle the previous seasons, kinda makes sense.Maybe they were pissed about Gen 5 too, and they let their rage get projected into this pile of Mudsdale Poo?Still confused? Don\'t worry, it gets worse.Character - 2 - EVEN THE CHARACTERS WERE RECYCLED!!! We have Iris, a poor man\'s Misty, and Cilan, a Poor man\'s Brock (Bring back Brock Senpai, YOU BASTARDS). The characters were just borderline forgettable (EVEN the Gen 4 game was more memorable than this!). The previous seasons had a female lead (Misty, May and Dawn) who all have their lovable charms. My favorite, May, was a trainer who wants to be a Pokemon Coordinator, and even meets rivals of her own, like the suave and handsome Drew, to the sneaky a-hole Harley (Who I think looks gay, for some odd reason). Dawn also has rivals, but they represent her troubled past, and by overcoming them, she overcomes that trauma (remember that Bitch who gave Dawn, the diamond dust? Man, I hated her guts). Iris..........meh. She has no personality and no charm whatsoever. Brock was everybody\'s favorite lovable idiot, who chases love but gets whacked, smacked, dragged and Poison Jabbed away, just to avoid getting sued (Maybe he\'s trying to get a Restraining Order with Officer Jenny\'s signature. That\'s a win in my book), but he is a great cook and pioneered the art of the Frying Pan (Rapunzel is a very devout student of this sacred technique), and though love slips through his grasp, we will ALWAYS love him. Cilan is, like I said, a Poor man\'s Brock, who shoehorns in that fruits is good for you, and that you need to eat healthy (Yes, they did that). Ash............................he never changes.Enjoyment - 1 - Guys, I watched two episode and dropped it. Wanna know why? Because the show was so cringe-worthy that I dropped it altogether. So I spoiled myself, and I shook in disappointment and told myself, ""I\'m glad I spoiled myself.""Overall - 2 - Guys, this has to be the worst anime I have EVER watched. I mean, it\'s bad, like REALLY BAD. Any die hard Pokemon fan can watch this and lose their faith in the Pokemon anime altogether and just play the games instead.Or so I thought.One day, I was surfing through Youtube and something caught my eye. It was an episode of Pokemon XY&Z, the Gen 6 anime, subbed, and it was made by the very same staff. And so I decided to give it a shot, out of sympathy, and the fact that it was subbed (the dub made my ears bleed).And then, I saw it. After watching that one episode, just ONE, I knew what this meant,This Pokemon anime isn\'t going to be good,This anime is gonna be AWESOME.And I look forward to watching it. on Cartoon Network. It had a young boy, who wanted to be a Pokemon Master, along with a yellow creature, named Pikachu. He loved it, and became a die hard fan.

And as a Diehard Pokemon fan, I tell you this-POKEMON BEST WISHES SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!Let\'s move on with the review.Story - 3 - For those of you who watched the anime, you know the story by the back of your hand. Ash wants to be Pokemon Master, yada yada yada yada. But here\'s the kicker. When you watched the show, some of you might have noticed that, somethings off. It\'s itching at the back of your mind, and then it hits you. I\'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE!! Yes, you guessed it right, this season recycles everything from the previous seasons and makes it cringe-inductively childish. We have the filler, showcasing all the Pokemon, but they are just downright LAME. In the previous seasons, the fillers would be more interesting and captivating, making us wish we were in the Kanto region, or go surfing in the Orange islands and check out the female Swimmers and the Beauties, if you what I\'m saying ;-). But here, NO, just NO. If someone gave me the choice to live in Vampire Nazi infested England or Unova, I\'ll take the former and get me some Harkannen (did I spell that right?) and blow that New York-wanna-be to pieces (I still look forward to going to New York though. I heard it\'s awesome in comparison to THIS monstrosity).Art and Sound won\'t be here, because I cringed so much I didn\'t give a damn. So I\'ll add in a new segment (Please forgive me admins of MAL, but THIS must be addressed) called The Works, and break an anime down to it\'s core and find the reason for it\'s ascension, or it\'s downfall. By the way, both Art and Sound got 4.The Works - 10 - Why 10? Because it explains everything. You all should know that the anime is based on the Gen 5 game, the series that, in my opinion, jumped the Sharpedo. It had an excellent premise, but the Pokemon introduced were....er, let\'s say, recycled. You can make a list of recycled Pokemon and it still wouldn\'t be enough. You see, what I concur is that the anime decided to recycle the best part of the previous seasons, just like they recycled the Pokemon in the game. There were good writers and staff, and the fact that they tried to recycle the previous seasons, kinda makes sense.Maybe they were pissed about Gen 5 too, and they let their rage get projected into this pile of Mudsdale Poo?Still confused? Don\'t worry, it gets worse.Character - 2 - EVEN THE CHARACTERS WERE RECYCLED!!! We have Iris, a poor man\'s Misty, and Cilan, a Poor man\'s Brock (Bring back Brock Senpai, YOU BASTARDS). The characters were just borderline forgettable (EVEN the Gen 4 game was more memorable than this!). The previous seasons had a female lead (Misty, May and Dawn) who all have their lovable charms. My favorite, May, was a trainer who wants to be a Pokemon Coordinator, and even meets rivals of her own, like the suave and handsome Drew, to the sneaky a-hole Harley (Who I think looks gay, for some odd reason). Dawn also has rivals, but they represent her troubled past, and by overcoming them, she overcomes that trauma (remember that Bitch who gave Dawn, the diamond dust? Man, I hated her guts). Iris..........meh. She has no personality and no charm whatsoever. Brock was everybody\'s favorite lovable idiot, who chases love but gets whacked, smacked, dragged and Poison Jabbed away, just to avoid getting sued (Maybe he\'s trying to get a Restraining Order with Officer Jenny\'s signature. That\'s a win in my book), but he is a great cook and pioneered the art of the Frying Pan (Rapunzel is a very devout student of this sacred technique), and though love slips through his grasp, we will ALWAYS love him. Cilan is, like I said, a Poor man\'s Brock, who shoehorns in that fruits is good for you, and that you need to eat healthy (Yes, they did that). Ash............................he never changes.Enjoyment - 1 - Guys, I watched two episode and dropped it. Wanna know why? Because the show was so cringe-worthy that I dropped it altogether. So I spoiled myself, and I shook in disappointment and told myself, ""I\'m glad I spoiled myself.""Overall - 2 - Guys, this has to be the worst anime I have EVER watched. I mean, it\'s bad, like REALLY BAD. Any die hard Pokemon fan can watch this and lose their faith in the Pokemon anime altogether and just play the games instead.Or so I thought.One day, I was surfing through Youtube and something caught my eye. It was an episode of Pokemon XY&Z, the Gen 6 anime, subbed, and it was made by the very same staff. And so I decided to give it a shot, out of sympathy, and the fact that it was subbed (the dub made my ears bleed).And then, I saw it. After watching that one episode, just ONE, I knew what this meant,This Pokemon anime isn\'t going to be good,This anime is gonna be AWESOME.And I look forward to watching it.', '(As a little side note: I\'m writing this review after the episode where Ash wins his eighth badge for this region. The episode list on Wikipedia doesn\'t match up with the number of episodes on this site. In the past keeping track was easy. Even if I lost track on my episode count, the series ended when Ash moved on to the next region. Best Wishes ends a little past mid-Unova, it seems. But, reading the synopsis for the next season, it looks like I\'ve reached the end of the series as far as MAL counts it. Now that that\'s out of the way...)So,...Pokémon quickly went from reaching its highest point to hitting its lowest point, but this wasn\'t immediately apparent. At the start of episode one, I was really optimistic. Best Wishes starts out with Ash accompanying his mother and Prof. Oak on a vacation to a region so far away, there are no Pokémon from any of the regions he\'s traveled through so far. In a very quintessential Ash move, he becomes enthralled with the few new Pokémon he does see and decides he\'s going to start over again in Unova and collect eight badges to enter their Pokémon League. And at this point, I thought Best Wishes was gearing up to be something really good. This felt like a really original start and was in keeping with Ash as a character.And then things started to go downhill...Much has been said about the introduction of Ash\'s new rival and their first battle. And I\'ve seen quite a few excuses for why things went down the way they did-- their encounter with one of this region\'s legendaries left Pikachu temporarily unable to use any electric-type moves-- but I still say Ash\'s loss to Trip was bullshit. I don\'t care if Pikachu was limited to only a few moves. Trip met his Snivy literally five minutes earlier. The difference in experience alone should have more than made up for any handicap Pikachu was suffering from. But I soon realized that this first fight was indicative of a much bigger problem this series had.It feels like the writers tried to hit the reset button without explicitly saying it and with no real good reason to. I understand that the start of each new season is a chance to bring a whole new generation of kids into the fanbase, but setting Ash back like this really does a disservice to the older fans who\'ve been watching from the beginning. But maybe I\'m getting ahead of myself. The point is, it felt like they were following a formula that just doesn\'t suit Ash anymore. Case in point with Trip: Ash does not always have to be the underdog. Maybe they were trying to ride the coattails of Ash\'s rivalry with Paul in the last season, which was the best yet. But recreating Paul just doesn\'t work with Trip. What reason does Trip have to be so arrogant? Paul had experience-- arguably just as much as Ash as it is stated that he had also journeyed through other regions-- Trip is just starting out. And I find it ironic, all the little remarks he makes about Kanto being such an off the map, backwater little place considering Unova is the region that\'s established to be so disconnected from everywhere else. But its not Trip himself that I dislike. At this point, I\'m reserving judgment for Trip. I feel like he still has room to grow. In their last encounter, he doesn\'t seem to have changed much, but I was really optimistic about the one before that. Trip\'s backstory so far is that he met this region\'s champion, Alder, when he was very young and, being ambitious even back then, swore to one day defeat him. When he asked for advice, he was basically told to do whatever he had to in order to become as strong as possible. Except... our heroes meet Alder and he\'s nothing like Trip remembered. Skilled and powerful but also laid-back and goofy. And most importantly, he doesn\'t remember giving Trip the advice that shaped his entire life, nor does he seem to agree with that line of thinking now. It was a really interesting episode, and Trip seemed really shaken by this, but I\'m still waiting to see how that\'s resolved.So in short, it\'s not Trip himself, but the way Trip is written that I have a problem with. (Like in their most recent encounter, Trip seeming to fall back into the way he was before they met Alder.) But any problems with Trip\'s writing doesn\'t hold a candle to Ash. I\'ve really liked seeing Ash continue to grow as we continue to move from one series to the next. He started out as an enthusiastic but really dumb little kid. Then we got to see him be the experienced one for a change in Advanced, where May learned a lot from him. And even Dawn, who was more experienced to start with, did a lot of learning alongside him. And don\'t get me wrong, Ash has always had his moments, but it\'s held true that he\'s gotten a little better each season. So there is no excuse for him suddenly seeming to have no recollection of things like strategy or type advantages upon reaching Unova. And it was even more baffling for him to suddenly forget basic Pokémon world lore, like the fact that all the Nurse Joys and Officer Jennys are identical. (And yes, those two both got a design change this season, but he had no trouble recognizing who they were.) Like I said, it felt like the writers tried to hit the reset button and there was no reason for it. I mean, Ash has always been very formulaic as to what he\'s going to do in each region, but if the writers are totally lost trying to do something new... Well, that\'s the biggest problem so far.Which leaves us with the new characters. Well, to start with Ash\'s Pokémon, who are always a little hit or miss when it comes to personality, it\'s been another longrunning complaint from fans that Ash doesn\'t catch enough Pokémon in each region. But l\'ve never minded him only having just enough to fill up his team with a few substitutions. Most of them barely have any character as it is, which is really showcased in this season where Ash does catch quite a few more Pokémon than usual... and most of them are really forgettable. The bird in this region in particular seems really bland, and it\'s really implied that Ash only caught Pidove for the convenience of having a flying type whenever someone is lost. (Seriously, there\'s an episode where every other one of his Pokémon is sleeping outside of their Pokeballs with the kids, but when they realize a few of them have run off, Ash has to get his bird out of its Pokeball to go look for them. I think what\'s not explicitly stated in that scene says a lot...) And his other Pokémon are just kind of... there. I mean, I guess Oshawott is cute, as far as Piplup knockoffs go, but none of his other Pokémon really stand out in this season.In general, this is the season people like to cite when they talk about Pokémon running out of ideas. This was the season where they made the Pokémon based off of an ice cream cone... and the Pokémon based off of a refrigerator and a coffin. But personally, I only reached my breaking point when I reached the episode with the buffalo-themed Pokémon that would leave our heroes alone... just as long as they were wearing afro wigs.And then we have his new companions. I just cannot seem to grow attached to Iris for some reason. She\'s just really annoying... (Though I think what\'s more irritating than her constantly telling Ash that he\'s acting like a little kid is that he\'s usually earned it.) I\'m pretty sure Axew was supposed to be cute. Yeah, he never grew on me either. But I think the main problem is that Iris\'s goal of being a dragon master really doesn\'t mean anything. She doesn\'t seem to really know herself how to go about dong that, so really she\'s just another companion. I think her only saving grace is that she practically grew up in the wild and has great survival skills.And then we come across the gym-leader-turned-companion who constantly compares Pokémon and strategy to food. Why, hello, replacement Brock. Actually, you know what, Cilan? I take back any sass. You ended up being the most likable one in the group.And then we reach the minor characters. As with Diamond and Pearl, there are an abundance of minor characters, but I\'m a little on the fence about them. Well, Bianca sums up herself pretty well: ""Dodging is for cowards!"" As for the other three... Well, it is kind of cool that all three of our heroes have their own rivals. (For Ash, it was more like a less serious rival.) But, though we see quite a lot of each of them, none of them grow past their initial gimmick. No one pronounces Stefan\'s name correctly. Georgia hates dragon types. Burgundy lost to Cilan\'s gym and aims to humiliate him the same way she felt humiliated. And that\'s really all there is to any of them.Past that, it\'s Pokémon. A million mini adventures with a few gym battles or other mini tournaments thrown in between. Which doesn\'t mean it was unenjoyable. A lot of those episodes were fun, even if there was no real consequence to a lot of those plots. But if there was one thing I really liked about this season, it was that they tried to make Team Rocket threatening again. For the first time since their introduction in Kanto. And, while their master plan hasn\'t been fully explained yet, I like that they\'re no longer simply the comic relief villains. They feel like actual villains. Which means this region\'s final conflict with them, whatever that\'s going to be, has the potential to be really good. Pokémon quickly went from reaching its highest point to hitting its lowest point, but this wasn\'t immediately apparent. At the start of episode one, I was really optimistic. Best Wishes starts out with Ash accompanying his mother and Prof. Oak on a vacation to a region so far away, there are no Pokémon from any of the regions he\'s traveled through so far.

Otherwise it's obviously not a top-of-the-line anime, but it never once tries to be. Mostly it's just a big load of fun.Characters, in particular, are wonderful. As well as Iris and Cilan, who are both absolutely the best the entire anime has had to offer in terms of endearment (rivalling with Misty!), for the first time ever, there are fun supporting characters, too. They come a little bit late into the game, but this is pretty...much a show that keeps getting better, so expect that all round.The Pokemon especially are just great characters, with real warmth and fun. I was already a fan of the BW Pokemon, but pretty much all the ones I was unimpressed with have completely won me over through the anime. I can't believe that once upon a time, I didn't care for Axew at all. Believe me. That will change.The dub is the best it's ever been. Music changes are still around, but usually make sense, and Pokemon characters like Snivy, Axew, Emolga, Scraggy & more are just given more charm. Team Rocket's weird, but whatever. It feels like the show's given up on them a bit too, and they're really just vague extras providing a bit of contrast now and again. They still have their place, it's just deservedly small.Everything is surprisingly well paced - 'filler' episodes are fun, gym battles aren't always predictable: the only one I found a bit dull was Burgh. Unfortunately there's one major pacing flaw - the gap between Burgh and Elesa's gyms is ridiculously large, and there the series lags. But no real worry if you don't get impatient.Stick around for Snivy, Emolga, Excadrill, and supporting characters Burgundy and Georgia - and the sincerely heartwarming Battle Club. The show probably isn't for you if you go in expecting genuinely well-produced anime with a deep story and tragic characters: but why would you? At being Pokemon, Pokemon is the best.

Slow Step,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2180/Slow_Step,"['All of life’s trivial quarrels can be solved with a simple bet. Well that seems to be the motto, this terribly old-fashioned anime follows. If you’re not into sports anime where there’s always something trivial at stake then it’s best to steer clear of this one.Slow Step is yet another Sports, Drama from the legendary mangaka Mitsuru Adachi. A man known for creating the classic sports manga Touch, which spawn a hefty number of anime adaptations. This time round the sport of choice is softball, where Nakasato Minatsu is the ace of her High School’s softball team. I would go into how it follows the...classic sports drama formula (the underdog team) but in Slow Step the real story lies in the Romantic, Comedy side of things. In the beginning it’s already established that Nakasato is sort of seeing her childhood friend however by some weird circumstances she ends up in a love triangle. Well I say weird because the root of this love triangle dilemma is none other than one of the most widely used clichés (mistaken identity) and from there this series, which initially showed so much promise, gradually diminishes into something far less enjoyable. Not only that but when things sort of become a love pentagon, hexagon, whatever… chances are you’ll stop caring about the outcome.I wouldn’t really blame anyone for not caring about the romantic outcome, since the characters range from a bunch of immature selfish kids to some really old-fashioned adults. I understand that this was based in the 80’s but when the only appealing character is a typical delinquent student, then that’s saying something.The art style also reflects the time period it was based on, with stubby appearances and bean shaped heads. At times it does show off some great animation, especially during the games, but these moments are few and far in between. Same can be said about the soundtrack, there were a few good tunes here and there but they’re just a few of them and the same old ones were constantly repeated.Overall just like the titles says, Slow Step is slow in advancing its romantic plot and any real advancement is due to the sports side of things, where it all comes down to a simple bet. The sports element was interesting, especially when it also went into boxing but don’t expect anything on the level of Hajime no Ippo. With that said, this turned out to be an unsatisfactory anime. Even with five 45min episodes, absolutely nothing was resolved but keep in mind that I didn’t find it a completely wasteful experience. classic sports drama formula (the underdog team) but in Slow Step the real story lies in the Romantic, Comedy side of things.

The characters are pretty cool too! One main problem with these indie animes is that all the characters seem to be kind of the same! So, it becomes very hard to follow them or their path. But, in this case both the characteristics and the designs are very distinctive! So, the emotions the they convey feels very natural and understandable!Art & Animation -If I need to say only one word about the art then it is - Gorgeous!Well, it's...not really surprising though! The name Wit Studio, that's enough! One of the reasons that I watched this anime was definitely because of the background arts! The art really helps the anime in it's worldbuilding! Which I will talk about in a minute.About the animation, I'd say it's efficient. Which is a very good thing! It's a indie project so of course they had a limited quote-unquote budget. So, it's very nice to see them using the animation efficiently! The last two episodes which is basically the climax of the show the animation is at it's absolute best! (Keeping the budget in mind of course)Worldbuilding -The anime does a great job in it's worldbuilding. Which is my most favourite thing about this show!

Yoku Wakaru Gendai Mahou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5454/Yoku_Wakaru_Gendai_Mahou,"['Many anime feature magic of some kind, however in most cases the technical side of casting spells isn\'t really covered to any degree, and while there are shows that do give some insight into this side of ""magic"", the majority only really give cursory information. There are, however, some shows that do cover the technical side fairly well, and they manage to incorporate this aspect of ""magic"" into the story in a way that gives the show more depth than it would otherwise have had (great examples of this are Mushishi, Mokke, Rental Magicka, Ghost Hunt and Ghost Hound).Unfortunately, Yokuwakaru Gendaimahou doesn\'t fall into that...category.Based on a series of light novels by Sakurazaka Hiroshi, the original 2002 book won the Super Dash Novel Rookie of the Year Award under the name ""Mahou Tsukai no Netto"", however this was changed  in December 2003 to its current title. The story was first adapted for manga in August 2008, with an anime adaptation released in July 2009, just a few months after the release of the sixth novel in the series.The story is, ostensibly, about magic and the rivalry between ancient and modern practices, and the show begins with Ichinose Yumiko Christina and Morishita Koyomi battling a dead magician called Gilbartes.After that things get a little confusing.One of the problems with this series is that although it had a great idea, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The plot starts of at a pretty good pace, and the immediate action grabs the viewers attention well, however the story quickly becomes confused as the attention shifts from action to introduction after the OP. After that the show seems to lose its drive and the plot begins its stop-start progress through the series.Another issue with the story is that it is fairly ""wishy-washy"" when it comes to dramatic development. There\'s little that happens in the story, barring the beginning of the first episode, that can truly grip the audiences attention without feeling forced, and while there are some nice ideas introduced over the course of the series (e.g. modern magic using computers, mageslayers, etc), these simply aren\'t enough to offset the vagueness of the plot. It\'s not until the end of the series that the story actually starts making sense, however the viewer will have to watch a number of mediocre episodes to get to that point.As far as the design goes, Yokuwakaru Gendaimahou is pretty stereotypical in its approach, which is truly a shame as this is one of the main reasons why the show is difficult to take seriously. The settings have a generic quality about them which doesn\'t help, however the biggest problem is that the characters have been designed with ""moe"" in mind.That said, the show has some pretty fair animation and visual effects, and I particularly liked the way the magical ""codes"" were represented.One area where this series did suffer was in the sound department as, once again, the producers were afflicted with the generic bug. The music is pretty much what one would expect from a show that has been infused with moe, with a typical J-Pop OP and ED, and thematic music that tries a bit too hard to enhance the mood of the scene.As for the voice acting, well, to say that Yokuwakaur Gendaimahou is typical would be an understatement. While the seiyuu all have a great deal of experience they aren\'t really given a chance to show their talent, something which I consider a waste as aside from Kotobuki Minako (who plays the role of Kaho), the rest of the cast have all shown their true skill in other shows.While it\'s true that the design doesn\'t help the series, the problem is further compounded by the lacklustre characters. The biggest flaw in this series is that there is almost no attention given to the development of any of the characters and, while some shows can get away with this, Yokuwakaru Gendaimahou is sadly not one of them. The lack of any real development leaves the characters as nothing more than moe puppets that have no real depth to them. There isn\'t actually any character who really stands out either, something which becomes more notceable as the series progresses.That said, while it\'s true that there isn\'t any depth to the characters, I was surprised to find that most of them didn\'t annoy me either, however that may be because the premise of the series allows for a degree of flexibility where roles are concerned.Now I will admit that I like the technical side of magic, the whys and wherefores of how things are done, and while Yokuwakaru Gendaimahou gives a little bit of insight into how maigc works in the story, there simply isn\'t enough detail to make either the ancient or modern systems anything more than plot devices, something which may explain why the protagonists only seem to know one combat spell. Granted the premise is interesting enough, but if you\'re after something with a bit more depth and substance to its inner workings, then this series should be way down on your list.While the show does have many flaws, the main one being how generic it is, there are some entertaining moments. However, these moments are not enough to hold the story together, and in some cases only add to the confusion of the plot.

I sure do!  (For those of you that don\'t know, I\'m referring to the anime comedy cliche where that big metal pan looking thing falls on someone\'s head)  I\'m not being sarcastic either.  It gets me every time, and I personally think this anime could\'ve used more of it but maybe I\'m just weird ; )I gave it a 7 overall and I want you to think of that as a good score.  The 8, 9, and 10\'s belong to the big hitters out there, but I think some people might really enjoy this...one.  Let me break it down for you and you can decide for yourself...STORY 6/10- Let me start by saying that this anime had a GREAT concept and probably the most unique idea I\'ve ever come across.  I was fully captivated by the theme of ""modern day"" magic.  Now where this category slips is in the actual content of the story.  With such a GREAT concept, I would\'ve liked to have experienced a more deep and serious unfolding of events.  The story line in actuality is rather lighthearted which some people may actually enjoy more, though in my opinion was in danger of being almost boring.  Really depends on your tastes, the ""6"" being my sole opinion.  Great last couple episodes though.ART 8/10- I give the OP credits a 10/10, absolutely amazing.  The characters were drawn well, though I\'d say the art throughout the anime was somewhat simple not necessarily in a bad way.  The magic effects were great, especially that ""digital"" looking effect.  The fight scenes were pretty well animated, but I don\'t think it can compete with all the other great fight scene anime out there.SOUND 8/10- Once again I give the OP credits a 10/10.  In fact, lets just say that the OP credits of this anime is by far one of it\'s greatest assets (and I don\'t mean to downplay the other aspects of this anime at all).  The voice acting was great, all voices very fitting to their characters (my favorite being Kaho).CHARACTER 7/10- The character design was good, if not rather typical.  Our heroine was quite charming, perhaps a little simple minded (maybe even kinda dumb) but that\'s all part of her charm.  Then you\'ve got your well mannered tsundere, your sensei, and your quiet friend that\'s really intelligent (Kaho!  I\'m a sucker for freckles XD) The bad guys were somewhat boring in my opinion but they played their part.ENJOYMENT 7/10- I always look forward to something unique, as that can be somewhat rare nowadays.  It was easy to stick this one through to the end.If you\'re looking for something unique, then check this one out.  I recommend it! one.

Of course, there are also magicians in the show that use the olden version of magic, which requires them to recite an incantation. The story itself was very plain, with just the basic evil guy trying to conquer the world. Although it was somewhat a new spin on this genre, the hopeless story plot just brought the mark down terribly.Rating: 6/10DevelopmentThe characters in the show...are really loveable from the very start. But I guess that ends there. Pretty much no development throughout the entire show, not even on Koyomi, who still fails at magic at the end of the show. I mean, seriously?

Yea yea, it's all not in proportion and whatnot...but I don't really care XD Not much to say here again but it's perfect =3Rating: 10/10SoundThe opening and ending for the show was really enjoyable, and catchy as well...which reminds me that I have to get the full single soon =3 The background music was decent and nothing much to complain about them ^^ Ai Nonaka's voice is awesome as always, and did a good job as Koyomi's voice. Props to the other voice actressess who also did a good job =]Rating: 9/10EnjoymentDespite having a horrible story plot and character development, I have to say, the show was still enjoyable to watch (to an extent), especially the filler episodes. As long as the evil bad guy wasn't in the shot, the show wasn't too bad after all ^^; I really miss all the characters now O_ORating: 8/10Final Rating: 38/50"", ""Well I struggle to write this review because I have no strong feelings one way or the other  about Yokuwakaru Gendai Maho. It's the most median I've seen in awhile. It's seems like it contains every vicious stereotype about anime in it, but that's what some people love about anime.  On one hand it's a cutesy magical girl anime about friendship and fan service. on the negative It's a cutesy magical girl anime about friendship and fan service! So if those are words you abhor in your anime, run, run away now! But if any of those words get your attention; prepare for...disappointment. The concepts of codes and modern mages is interesting and fun to learn about, but goes unexplored as the characters do not grow nor become more skilled. The story is told  pretty much in the beginning and end, leaving the middle pretty much filler. The fan service,  pretty much vanishes after the beach episode & the action is sparse and anti-climatic. All that was almost forgivable if it wasn't for the end.[spoiler]Everyone lives and has curry for dinner. I didn't expect some dark or depressing or shocking end, but it's how they achieve this ending. Not through the use of codes but Koyomi's friendship. She spends all this time learning about codes and it never pays off.[/spoiler]The more episodes you watch the more one will be inclined to finish it. I watched all 12 episodes but after seven I began to question why I was watching it. But if you like this sort of anime then add it to your queue! disappointment.

I have only watched the anime.I may watch this again.---- Positives ----This series interestingly ties together technology and magic.When dealing with technology and magic, I'm used to series deciding that the two are, for bizarre reasons, at odds with each other, often resulting in battles between users of technology and users of magic. Thankfully, that doesn't happen here. In this series, technology is used to amplify magic. Specifically, computers can be used to collectively cast spells, whereas gathering thousands of human mages to do...the same thing would be impractical. Also, we see how computers can store spells for later use, making them even more useful for magical purposes. This concept of technology being used to improve on classical magic was interesting and done well.Morishita keeps the series entertaining.She has a try-your-best attitude even though she isn't proficient in magic, and her only spell is amusing not only for what it is, but how other characters take it so seriously while Morishita herself doesn't. In key instances, she resolves the current issue in the story with her try-your-best attitude and/or her signature spell. She's a rare instance of an earnest yet amusingly untalented character who is able to still make the series so good.The series maintains a great pace throughout.No part of the series is slow. Because the story lost me in a few places, I might actually characterize the pacing as a tad fast.---- Negatives ----The characters seem to only ever use sword-summoning spells.During battles, I only remember ever seeing sword-summoning spells being used. Some of the summoned swords were physical, some were mana-based, but that was the only memorable variant. The series doesn't talk about other spell options suited for battle, so I don't know whether this is literally the only spell they have available to them or if it's just the best choice for most situations.Opportunity for cancel: No. There should have been explanations on what other spells there are and why they all chose sword-summoning spells.The story is difficult to understand at times.I actually like it when series don't spoon-feed its viewers and instead requires them to think about both shown and speculated-to-have-taken-place events. However, this series just lost me in a few spots. It took a moderate amount of imagination to understand the initially-unexplained gimmick of the first few episodes before the series explained itself. Then, toward the end of the series, there's a battle that I couldn't figure out the purpose of. Some things that happen after that point also left me confused.Opportunity for cancel: No. I think the series could have given different sets of clues to help make certain events easier to follow. the same thing would be impractical.

That combined with the generic feel of the characters leaves me feeling like thins show is lukewarm.', 'I dropped it after 3 episodes because I could not take any more of this trainwreck. The show´s ""magic system"" is really disappointing, which I will get to later.This show has some serious issues when it comes to pacing and transition. It jumps around with flashbacks, and then backwards some more with unnatural transitions as if the staff were drunk when they made the storyboard. The story that was being (poorly) told in episode 1, got put on hold at the beginning of episode 2 for the sake of another flashback.I´m not saying that shows should always tell stories in one single continuous timeline,...but when you want to tell a story where you jump back and/or forth, you should be VERY aware of why and how you want to do it, which I did not feel the creates were with this mockery of storytelling.When the story in episode 1 had been ""put on hold"" I had not reached the point where I cared what would happen to the characters in that specific plot. I was still wondering WHY I should care about it. Maybe if the pacing had been better, or if the creators would have stuck to the first story a little longer, my investment could have been changed for the better.The animation is not awful, but it is just not interesting or good for that matter. Too many corners are being cut to the point that it lowers the quality considerably. There are too many scenes where the ""camera"" is being pointed away from the action because the studio either did not have the time or money to make the extra animation, which could have made some scenes good. Or maybe they simply did not care.The magic system leaves a lot to be desired. From the synopsis, I got the impression that some thought had gone into how the magic works in this world. Like how the supernatural works in ""Full Metal Alchemist"" or ""HunterxHunter"" (not that a magic system needs to have the level of depth like these 2 shows to be great, those shows are just really great examples of magic systems that immersive you into their world). The magic in ""Yoku Wakaru Gendai Mahou"" works like programming a code on a computer. That could have proven to be an interesting ""magic system"" but this show did not pull that off at all. In episode 2 we have mage that splits a car in two. The car drives, then some codes/cord-like lights appear, and then the car is split in 2.The moment the car is split in 2 the camera cuts away, so we don´t get to see how the cut car crashes or whether or not the driver suffers injuries while being in a moving car that suddenly gets cut in 2, which could have been a cool little action scene. I just wanted to mention this part as an example of what I mentioned earlier of how I thought the animation cuts too many corners which makes it seems cheap/underbudgeted/rushed etc. Or just lazy and uninspiring. Okay, back to the magic system and the mage.We did not see the mage do anything special to the car which let it to magically be split in 2. That means that magic in this world is ""magic can do whatever I(the writer of the story) wants/needs it to do in whatever situation and whenever"". The mage could just as well have made some random movements with a staff/wand and chanted ""car splitting spell!"" and we would have had the same level of ""depth"" to the magic. Stories with vaguely confirmed rules about how magic works are by no means bad (just take Lord of the Rings) but it is very important that the creator of the story is aware and upfront about the depth the ""magic system"" ACTUALLY has. the problem (one of the problems) with this show is that it thinks it has a deep ""magic system"", as it tries to present a new way magic could be cast, but it is as old cliche and old as they come, just with a another shallow coating. The only ""modern"" part about it is that it has the word ""code"" in it. Stories with low or high ""magic systems"" can both be great, but a story with a low ""magic system"" can´t pretend/present itself as a world with a high ""magic system"". That is at least very important to me. That might not be the case for everybody, but a story loses a lot of points from me, when the magic of a world does not match the dept it THINKS it has to some extent. This is why this part pisses me off to such an extend.It seems like the story has some sort of time magic/travel or time distortion in it since we meet a woman in episode 3 that seems to be the same girl we meet in episode 1 just more grown up and more trained in magic. But since this story has managed to mess so many things up in just 3 episodes, I do not expect to handle time distortion/travel (whatever the hell it is supposed to be) to any satisfactory level. So I am not going to stick around to learn what actually happens in this uninspiring mess. Whatever twist is being set up can´t be worth it. Which is why cutting episode 1 out, and starting at episode 2 would be a good first step at trying to turn this show from horrible to bad/average.The intro is actually pretty nice. The short segment in the intro where the MC flies just above the water was a good look. If only the actual show had more of that visual appeal. That´s the only good thing I have to say about this show.It was nice to get this off my chest. I could go into greater details like coming up with other examples of how the magic casters in this story are just like any other mages, just with a shallow and meaningless coating (like how the mage in episode 3 just holds her staff and then a monster disappears in light). I could also delve further into why the pacing and transition of this show are god-awful, the characters are boring, etc. but this review is already long enough to get my point across, and I would be happy enough if just a few would read what I have written so far. but when you want to tell a story where you jump back and/or forth, you should be VERY aware of why and how you want to do it, which I did not feel the creates were with this mockery of storytelling.When the story in episode 1 had been ""put on hold"" I had not reached the point where I cared what would happen to the characters in that specific plot.

Vividred Operation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14283/Vividred_Operation,"['Vividred is a bootylicious party with a mix of action porn and, well, softcore porn.SPOILER-FREEA-1 brings us the touching anime-original story of four shapely butts as they fight off aliens, or monsters, or something. Oh yeah, there are girls attached to these butts and they have characterization and stuff. And there’s a beach episode with boobs, but they give way back to butts. And then there’s a fifth butt, this one gets a close up within twenty seconds of the show starting, really setting the tone for the rest of the show.Now seriously let’s have a review.STORY 6/10It isn’t entirely obvious, but you will notice...pretty quickly that this is a mahou shoujo. Even though the characters get their powers from technology and friendship rather than magic, it is pretty clearly mahou shoujo, and a pretty unoriginal one at that. Honestly, most people will have predicted the end within a few episodes. The stakes are high, but the power of friendship comes through in the end. The story adheres strongly to clichés of the genre.The story is frankly not too important in this anime. You watch this anime to have a good time, not to hear a riveting story. It holds together well, and arguably this unoriginality is actually a plus. The story may not bring anything new to the table, but it pulls it off with great skill. The way it delivers such conventional mahou shoujo story is actually very satisfying. This may not be the most intellectual anime ever, but the story is never opaque. I never once had to guess why a character did what they did or what the hell was going on, making this a great anime to watch if you aren’t very smart, or are drunk.ANIMATION 8/10Vividred operation is a very pretty anime. The sci-fi elements show excellent attention to detail. Characters and backgrounds are both attractively designed. There are very few parts that were lazily animated and although there were a couple of hiccups, the show was fairly consistent throughout. The action scenes are great and not padded with too much dialogue. The show in general does not shy away from difficult animation and provides plenty of excellent action.There is a lot of fanservice. It doesn’t really detract from the show, but it will annoy some people.SOUND 7/10The music is upbeat and fits the mood of the show perfectly. The OP and EDs are good, but not stellar. Voice actors adequately fill their roles.CHARACTER 4/10The first thing you will notice about the characters (if you speak any Japanese) is that they are named after their hair color. Unfortunately, every single character is shamelessly copy/pasted from another anime. The worst offense is with not-Homura, I mean Rei. The characters do play off each other splendidly. Being an anime about the power of friendship, the friendships between the girls are well-developed, if a little too sunny. Like the story, there is nothing new to see here. Their personalities may not be nearly as molded as their glutes, but they manage not to be emotionless boards.This brings me to the fanservice. If you are one of those people who can’t stand it, just skip this anime. There is a lot of fanservice, giving special attention to the posterior. A huge portion of Vividred is devoted to close-up shots of sweet, sweet booty.ENJOYMENT 10/10Vividred is a high-octane, feel-good anime that is perfect if you just want to have a good time watching. Generous action and glorious ass shots make this one of the most fun animes I’ve seen in 2013. This category is necessarily subjective, but I would recommend this to anyone who wants an exciting, fun but not very intellectual show.CONCLUSIONVividred Operation is like going to a concert of a really good cover band, like the Strolling Bones.

You may not have done much thinking, but you leave with a smile on your face.', 'I\'ve been a fan of Strike Witches so when Vividred Operation was announced, I was pretty excited. After all, this series is about saving the world without pants once again. In fact, the world that this series takes place in doesn\'t seem so ominous. As a matter of fact, Vividred Operation looks like one of those paradise worlds from the future and one that I would definitely want to live in. It looks like a paradise, it has some features of a paradise, and maybe it is a paradise. Rather though, I gave this series a shot and what I discovered it was from far...it.Vividred Operation is original anime series produced by A-1 pictures and handled by Kazuhiro Takamura, the same director involved with Strike Witches. Thus, expect some of the similar character designs and themes presented here. Among those themes include friendship which ties the main characters together. However, Vividred Operation doesn\'t pull everything together right and that\'s just the tip of the iceberg.Like its predecessor, Vividred Opreation takes the skies once again with its style of saving the world against unknown alien forces. From the surface though, the series looks clean and peaceful. In fact, it seems that the world is at peace, with a lack of global warming, and has advanced technology beyond our times. It definitely looks like a paradise. Set in Oshima, a powerful piece of technology known as the Manifestation Engine has made all of that possible. However, there\'s a problem now and they\'re threatening humanity:The Alones.The series involves a group of young girls that relies on battling the Alones and saving the world. With a little motivation and desire to protect what they cherish, the young girls of the series wishes to protect Oshima and the world that they reside in. It\'s a fairly simple and overused theme in many series. As a matter of fact, the same theme is present in Strike Witches, Senki Zesshou Symphogear, Freezing, etc where normal girls gains powers and abilities. For the girls though, they are tied together by a strong bond known as friendship. The girls are united by friendship and whether you believe it or not, it is one of the keys to prevent the destruction of their world. With science and a little genius behind the works, it must just seem so.At least so, that\'s what it looks like.The new enemy known as the Alone makes their presence well known by causing mass destruction with seemingly no purpose at first. Rather though, they are likely after the polar opposite of what the people living in Oshima wants: war. In fact, their attack on the Manifestation Engine proves this as even in the pilot episode, the Alone are single-mindingly bend on spreading their terror. It certainly kills that laid-back atmosphere and turns the series into more of a dramatic battlefield. It\'s something that almost no one wants in their world especially Akane, a friendly and outgoing girl.From the surface, Akane seems like a normal, outgoing, and cute little girl. Her love for tomatoes seems to symbolize her happy personality and with that, she is easily able to get along with others. It\'s often shown where she cruises around the city on her scooter and joyfully enjoying the atmosphere of what the Manifestation Engine has bought to their world. Well, that was before the Alone made their grand entrances. And as things are present, Akane vows to put an end to this destruction especially after an event in the beginning that even involves her own family.Luckily though, Akane doesn\'t seem to be alone. With her is Aoi Futaba, Akane\'s best friend who has came back to the peaceful city. Like Akane, Futaba presents herself as a a friendly girl who is helpful and caring to those around her. Despite her poor health, she has a strong heart and believes what needs to be protected in their world. On the other hand, there is Wakaba Saegusa, the captain of New Oshima Academy\'s Female Kendo Club as well as being a pro at kendo. She is also the president of her class and is highly respected among her peers. Finally, last but not least, there\'s Himawari Shinomiya who although lacks the brawns makes it up with her brilliance in technology. These four girls makes up the team and what humanity has hope for.Outside of that cast though is a girl named Rei Kuroki. Her presence in the series is seen as more of a mystery because of her actions. Seemingly strange enough, Akane treats her as a friend but her actions tells much more of a different story. In fact, her actions is malevolent and considered a threat to society. Furthermore, it seems that she doesn\'t like society herself judging by the fondness of animals rather than with people. The ""Alone"" themselves may be a symbol of what she stands for because Rei always seems so alone, even though she has people who truly wants to be her friend. Talk about being the anti-Akane here.Now, let\'s get to the action part because what else are those cool gear and gadgets used for? Of course, if you\'re thinking to kick some Alone butt, then that\'s the right answer. The action presented in Vividred Operation is somewhat entertaining but at times, just seems too cliched. It gets crazy at times too when the girls does spectacular aerial displays despite never ever having prior military experience. Even Aoi Futaba who is seen as physically weak pulls out the stops wit her jet catching and battle sequences. When did these girls get so talented? Among other things involving the battles are teamwork that is literally presented when they fuse together to bring out a stronger entity. Oh it\'s flashy but at many times, it just seems too forced. Furthermore, let\'s not forget about the outfits the girls are wearing. The way the young girls are dressed become a joke with the flashy outfits and transformations. It\'s like taking the \'let\'s save the world theme\' and give it a more visual touch of crotches and ass.On the other hand, the Alones are designed with the typical science fiction trope. They have strange shapes, strange attacks styles, and most of all, a strange mystery of their background with their origins. Well, at least they give off that science fiction feel. I mean, just look at them standing some hundred feet tall and roaming around not giving care about what happens to the peaceful world. They seemingly declare war on humanity and brings that feeling of terror to the people in Oshima as well as the rest of the world.As mentioned before, friendship becomes a symbol and a major source of the girls\' power. In fact, it is what ties them together in states of crisis (especially so in later episodes). Unfortunately, the deeper dynamics of their friendship is an unexplored territory. As a matter of fact, there is a lack of real development between the characters. It could of done so in one of the first few episodes but the producers instead throws in one of those fun/fillerish beach episode to give fans service. It just doesn\'t work out right and makes the friendship theme more weaker than it should be.Furthermore, the character of Rei becomes the antithesis of friendship in this series. She seemingly has no real friends but rather a mysterious being that she often has conversations with. These conversations are also not very pleasant and among other things, she seems to have a dark past. Additionally, the potential friendship she has with Akane gets killed in a single episode. This lack of development destroys the mood of the series and makes it seem as if Rei is even worse than the Alone themselves.Despite this though, I do find the series to be entertaining and cute at various instances. Most of this comes from Akane\'s cheerful mood and that energetic personality of hers. She is one of those girls where it\'s almost impossible for anyone to hate her. Besides her strong bond with her friends, she wishes to protect the world and an everlasting peace. She views Alone as a factor that stands in the way of this and something of an abomination to what she believes in.Visually, the series is pleasant and A-1 pictures did their jobs right here. The sun reflects a cheerful atmosphere like a paradise across Oshima. The series also makes the usage of some of the technology through CGI to give the Alone their science fiction trope. However, at times, it lacks any real favor but rather fits into a more category of the \'alien design department\'. Additionally, some of the designs of the Alone looks similar to Strike Witches although it doesn\'t come as a surprise given Kazuhiro Takamura\'s involvement in the series. And of course, who can forget about those outfits the characters wear?In terms of music/soundtrack presentation, the series seems alright but becomes crispy at many instances. With 5 different ED songs, the series gives every character a chance for spotlight. However, the soundtrack is just medicore and nothing particularly stands out. The background music is typical and although the seiyu does their work right, I just feel like nothing really particularly stood out more than the others.Overall, I found Vividred Operation to be a series of fun and entertaining but becomes frustrating to watch as the episodes passed on. The seemingly lack of story and weak character development/relationships makes watching the series feels like a chore. Additionally, some of the fan service are distracting and the Alone themselves seems to have no motivation rather than seeking endless destruction; their designs are also generic and doesn\'t stand out too much from my perspective. It serves just as a device to bring out the \'save the world theme\' with no regards to making any lesson of morality. Ultimately, this show is more of a way to pass time for me, but it did have some of its fun moments. After all, who ever said you need pants to save the world. it.Vividred Operation is original anime series produced by A-1 pictures and handled by Kazuhiro Takamura, the same director involved with Strike Witches. Thus, expect some of the similar character designs and themes presented here. Among those themes include friendship which ties the main characters together. However, Vividred Operation doesn\'t pull everything together right and that\'s just the tip of the iceberg.Like its predecessor, Vividred Opreation takes the skies once again with its style of saving the world against unknown alien forces. From the surface though, the series looks clean and peaceful. In fact, it seems that the world is at peace, with a lack of global warming, and has advanced technology beyond our times. It definitely looks like a paradise. Set in Oshima, a powerful piece of technology known as the Manifestation Engine has made all of that possible. However, there\'s a problem now and they\'re threatening humanity:The Alones.The series involves a group of young girls that relies on battling the Alones and saving the world. With a little motivation and desire to protect what they cherish, the young girls of the series wishes to protect Oshima and the world that they reside in. It\'s a fairly simple and overused theme in many series. As a matter of fact, the same theme is present in Strike Witches, Senki Zesshou Symphogear, Freezing, etc where normal girls gains powers and abilities. For the girls though, they are tied together by a strong bond known as friendship. The girls are united by friendship and whether you believe it or not, it is one of the keys to prevent the destruction of their world. With science and a little genius behind the works, it must just seem so.At least so, that\'s what it looks like.The new enemy known as the Alone makes their presence well known by causing mass destruction with seemingly no purpose at first. Rather though, they are likely after the polar opposite of what the people living in Oshima wants: war. In fact, their attack on the Manifestation Engine proves this as even in the pilot episode, the Alone are single-mindingly bend on spreading their terror. It certainly kills that laid-back atmosphere and turns the series into more of a dramatic battlefield. It\'s something that almost no one wants in their world especially Akane, a friendly and outgoing girl.From the surface, Akane seems like a normal, outgoing, and cute little girl. Her love for tomatoes seems to symbolize her happy personality and with that, she is easily able to get along with others. It\'s often shown where she cruises around the city on her scooter and joyfully enjoying the atmosphere of what the Manifestation Engine has bought to their world. Well, that was before the Alone made their grand entrances. And as things are present, Akane vows to put an end to this destruction especially after an event in the beginning that even involves her own family.Luckily though, Akane doesn\'t seem to be alone. With her is Aoi Futaba, Akane\'s best friend who has came back to the peaceful city. Like Akane, Futaba presents herself as a a friendly girl who is helpful and caring to those around her. Despite her poor health, she has a strong heart and believes what needs to be protected in their world. On the other hand, there is Wakaba Saegusa, the captain of New Oshima Academy\'s Female Kendo Club as well as being a pro at kendo. She is also the president of her class and is highly respected among her peers. Finally, last but not least, there\'s Himawari Shinomiya who although lacks the brawns makes it up with her brilliance in technology. These four girls makes up the team and what humanity has hope for.Outside of that cast though is a girl named Rei Kuroki. Her presence in the series is seen as more of a mystery because of her actions. Seemingly strange enough, Akane treats her as a friend but her actions tells much more of a different story. In fact, her actions is malevolent and considered a threat to society. Furthermore, it seems that she doesn\'t like society herself judging by the fondness of animals rather than with people. The ""Alone"" themselves may be a symbol of what she stands for because Rei always seems so alone, even though she has people who truly wants to be her friend. Talk about being the anti-Akane here.Now, let\'s get to the action part because what else are those cool gear and gadgets used for? Of course, if you\'re thinking to kick some Alone butt, then that\'s the right answer. The action presented in Vividred Operation is somewhat entertaining but at times, just seems too cliched. It gets crazy at times too when the girls does spectacular aerial displays despite never ever having prior military experience. Even Aoi Futaba who is seen as physically weak pulls out the stops wit her jet catching and battle sequences. When did these girls get so talented? Among other things involving the battles are teamwork that is literally presented when they fuse together to bring out a stronger entity. Oh it\'s flashy but at many times, it just seems too forced. Furthermore, let\'s not forget about the outfits the girls are wearing. The way the young girls are dressed become a joke with the flashy outfits and transformations. It\'s like taking the \'let\'s save the world theme\' and give it a more visual touch of crotches and ass.On the other hand, the Alones are designed with the typical science fiction trope. They have strange shapes, strange attacks styles, and most of all, a strange mystery of their background with their origins. Well, at least they give off that science fiction feel. I mean, just look at them standing some hundred feet tall and roaming around not giving care about what happens to the peaceful world. They seemingly declare war on humanity and brings that feeling of terror to the people in Oshima as well as the rest of the world.As mentioned before, friendship becomes a symbol and a major source of the girls\' power. In fact, it is what ties them together in states of crisis (especially so in later episodes). Unfortunately, the deeper dynamics of their friendship is an unexplored territory. As a matter of fact, there is a lack of real development between the characters. It could of done so in one of the first few episodes but the producers instead throws in one of those fun/fillerish beach episode to give fans service. It just doesn\'t work out right and makes the friendship theme more weaker than it should be.Furthermore, the character of Rei becomes the antithesis of friendship in this series. She seemingly has no real friends but rather a mysterious being that she often has conversations with. These conversations are also not very pleasant and among other things, she seems to have a dark past. Additionally, the potential friendship she has with Akane gets killed in a single episode. This lack of development destroys the mood of the series and makes it seem as if Rei is even worse than the Alone themselves.Despite this though, I do find the series to be entertaining and cute at various instances.

I initially chose to watch this anime as it was an original and I love when visual media can put out something spectacular all on it's own. Unfortunately for me though, visual media has failed me this time.Story - 3An interesting initial concept but everything is very dull and predictable. The story plods along very straight forwardly without any twists or turns and you know exactly what is going to happen when the outline of the episode is shown in the opening minutes. I felt...as if my time had been wasted by the end of each episode.Art - 8The highlight of the series. The animation quality is up to the industry standard in this day and age however, the bright, vibrant sceneries and characters make every scene extremely pleasant to watch. If I had one issue it would be that the fight scenes with the Alone could have been more spectacular but they do still look good regardless.Sound - 5There's nothing to complain about but also nothing to praise. All the voice actors do their job adequately, however due to the simpleness of the plot, and thus dialogue, there is not really anything in particular to note. . The ending theme does change with each episode, depending what the episode is focused on, which is a nice touch. However, the opening theme doesn't stand out at all and don't get you pumped up and ready to watch the episode.The background music suits every scene but it doesn't really stand out or add anything to the scene.Character - 3There are no real stand out characters, all of our protagonists fit generic archetypes and have no progression. The only interesting character is Rei, a mysterious girl who is in Akane's class but seems to be helping the Alone's. However, when her story is explored in episode 5, you can pretty much map out what is going to happen to her for the rest of the series, making her just as dull as the others.Enjoyment - 2My main gripe with the show, other than the points above, is that for some reason, it is regulation for middle schools' female uniform to consist of hot pants. There seems to be no practicality to this other than to get as many butt shots of the girls in the show as possible. I was left laughing and sighing at some of the ridiculous shots that were either nothing but butt or included someone's butt at the side of the shot for no good reason. When a big breasted girl gets thrown into the fray the ridiculousness just gets worse. I feel as I've said butt way to many times in the paragraph, but hey, there's VO has a lot of butts!Overall - 4If you want to just sit and let your mind do nothing for 24 minutes and you don't mind seeing an abundant of ridiculous fan service, then you might be able to get some enjoyment out of this series. On my experience though, I cannot recommend Vividred Operation to anyone as, other than the visuals, there is nothing to recommend. as if my time had been wasted by the end of each episode.Art - 8The highlight of the series.

In a manner not dissimilar to its spiritual predecessor, Strike Witches, this anime has been dismissed as bottom-of-the-barrel pandering trash, an asinine attempt to cash in on the sexual obsessions of those gross otaku. This seems terribly unfair to me. What ought to be taken into account is how well Vividred Operation succeeds on its own terms when you more closely examine the contours of its plot and characters. It's unreasonable to hold Vividred responsible for not following conventions that it had no intent to follow in the first place.Vividred Operation...is well produced. The visuals are soft, round and pleasing to the eye, and the animation has the glutes to pull off well-choreographed fight scenes. For a show with such a half-assed premise (a quasi-magical girl spin on the moe militarism trend in which middle school girls use powerful technology to fight giant enemies called Alones) and obvious use of stock characters (you'll peg Kuroki as the Fate/Homura of the show instantly), there's no expense spared on making the visuals nice and meaty. The music is dull but functional.The main characters are cute moe archetypes who are characterized solidly enough for the purposes of the show. Their individual arcs are predictable but they're nonetheless consistent—well rounded and fleshed-out quite sufficiently. Of course, the hungry gaze of the otaku is omnipresent, pupils dilating as Akane squirts mayonnaise all over her food.My major hump with this show is that while it succeeds completely in achieving what it so clearly set out to do, there's only so much value in that. If short shorts and explosions were the highest of high art, this would be a 10. is well produced.

It was going to be full of evocative language and rhetorical flourishes. But you know what? This is going to be crazy long as it is. Let\'s just get started.STORY:Awful plotting, awful continuity, and awful character motivations. Yeah. That about sums it up.Vividred Operation is a decent series. It\'s about a young girl who, one day through strange happenstance, stumbles upon a threat that could wreak chaos upon the Earth, and takes up arms against a threat from another world.Oh, sorry. That\'s Magical...Girl Lyrical Nanoha. Let me try again.Vividred Operation isn\'t a bad show. It\'s about a few young girls who team up to become magical girls. However, the show is less about the plot itself, as it is about the relationships between the characters. Despite its flaws, it manages to be a memorable show with some solid characterization and interesting twists on the magical-girl formula throughout.Oh, sorry. That\'s Puella Magi Madoka Magica. One more time.The problem with Vividred Operation is that it doesn\'t really try to do much that was new. It doesn\'t try to put a spin on tired material. It doesn\'t... try to do much of anything. The story is just a mish-mash of tried tropes tossed into a blender by some uncreative writers that thought that whole silly ""writing a creative story"" nonsense would simply get in the way of their panty shots.The amount of continuity glitches, plot holes, and ignorance of base human psychology run rampant. Characters know things they could only know through reading the script. The show\'s ""science"" is more or less a bunch of gobby-gook that the writers make up on the spot. The show doesn\'t bother to even try to keep its own continuity straight!Yes, yes. I know the plot is goofy. I know that I\'m probably not supposed to take it seriously. That\'s no excuse to not try. The show isn\'t even popcorn-movie level entertaining, because of the rampant continuity glitches and illogical and incoherent character behavior. It distracts you and pulls you out of the story even IF you\'re trying to do nothing but have a good time!CHARACTERS:Oh, hey! Let\'s chat about the characters! They existed. Aside from Kuroki Rei, I\'d say that we already have a solid candidate for the most boring cast of 2013.I don\'t know what to say about most of Vividred Operation\'s cast. I thought about comparing them to cardboard cutouts, but then I realized exactly how cruel that was to cardboard cutouts. Here\'s your typical Vividred Character: They have a name. They have one or two defining character traits. In essence, that makes up their entire identity as a fictional being.But what about character development? Nah. Almost all of them go through a minimal character arc, and really... don\'t do that much. The story really tries to make it look like the cast is developing, they really do. But we don\'t see it. The characters seem to go through experiences that should change their attitude towards other members of the cast, and then this is mostly disregarded and almost never talked about again. There is little self-reflection, and almost none of the characters even bother having any kind memorable backstory.Notice that I kept using qualifiers. There is a single character of interest: Rei Kuroki. She\'s a dark magical girl (Well, Dark Sufficiently-Advanced-Technology Girl), who is working with the Alone and their mysterious benefactors for reasons unknown to the viewer. She\'s actually a rather compelling character- she has an interesting personality, she pretty much steals every scene that she\'s in, and when you learn her motivations, they actually make some degree of sense. (Okay, that\'s partially because she\'s a blatant rip-off of Fate from Nanoha. But I\'ll take what I can get.)The villians are rather stock with unimpression motivations. There\'s really no reason to watch the entire show just to learn exactly why the Alone are coming to Earth: it isn\'t a plot twist of mind-bending proportions.So congratulations Vividred. You managed to have one memorable character. In the long run? Doesn\'t amount to much.Art:Looks pretty, but ruined by the blatant fanservice.The animation is smooth, the character designs are decent (although several of the characters are colored such that they look like they\'re blushing half the time, which annoyed me), and the backgrounds are fantastically done. The show definitely does look pretty. So why did this get such a low score? Because of the blatant fanservice shots. And are there plenty of blatant fanservice shots. The amount of fanservice in the show is simply obscene, and in the end there is no excuse for it.Sound:Opening and Ending are pretty meh. Maaya Uchida is pretty much the only voice actress that even tries, and the sound is overall rather bland.Really, there isn\'t much to say about the music in Vividred Operation. It\'s... okay? I guess? It\'s nothing particularly special, and rather easy to tune out. The opening theme and end theme aren\'t bad, but they\'re pretty generic, as far as openings and endings are concerned. Nothing separates them from the hundreds of competing OPs and EDs out there.The seiyuu performances are... acceptable. They certainly are voices, and there certainly is acting, but pretty much none of them even try to go beyond their comfort zone and add personality to their performance. The except is Maaya Uchida, who voices Rei. She really does try to add some nuance to Rei\'s character, and you can tell that she\'s putting the effort in. It definitely adds to the show, and is probably a key part of what makes Rei a compelling character. It\'s just a shame her talent is wasted on this show.So... what have we learned?:Vividred Operation is a mess. Bad characterization, poor plotting, blatant pandering, and just poorly thought out on every level. There are plenty of shows that do exactly what Vividred tries to do, and do it better.

From the show\'s tagline one already has a grasp what sort of plot are in store. Indeed this show is an amalgamation of the magical girl and sci-fi settings. You have your typical heroines fighting against alien invaders in power suits using all their powers of friendship at their disposal. Early episodes follow the pattern of ""Monster appears, girl transforms, monster powers up and girls power...up and uses finishing move"". It won\'t be anything new if you\'ve been following anime recently (Strike Witches, Rinne no Lagrange), but hey, you are probably not watching this for the plot are you?Art: 8... and speaking of the real reason anyone would watch Vividred Operation, the art is of high quality by the 2013 standards. The staff working on this project have respectable track records in their resumes. We have studio A-1 pictures (Sword Art Online, Ao no Exorcist, Ano Hana), redjuice (Guilty Crown) as the concept artist and of course Kazuhiro Takamura of Strike Witches fame as the director. The colouring are vibrant and vivid as the title would suggest and the action scenes are smooth.Given that Takamura is directing, the audience is also treated to a generous serving of pantyshots from the very first minute and throughout the whole series since well, panties (or hot pants depending on how you look at it) is part of the school uniform in the V.O. universe. In fact, by the end of series, you might be sick of seeing butts every two minutes...Sound: 6The soundtracks in Vividred Operation suit the bright atmosphere of the anime. We have techno mixes for the fast-paced action scenes and in general cheerful BGMs. The ending themes change every episode from 1 to 4 as each girl is introduced, which is a bonus. While the music of Vividred Operation will not be too memorable, it gets the job done.Character: 4The characters of Vividred Operations unfortunately do not stand out as they fall under overused archetypes. It seems the protagonist in this type of magical girl genre is always the cheerful, energetic girl while you also have the pure, innocent type; the cool, strong girl and the introverted, smart girl. You even have the animal familiar that is ubiquitous in the magical girls genre.It seems that Vividred Operation also took a cue from Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica by including a mysterious, gloomy girl who serves as an antagonist at first but will likely become an ally towards the end of the series.The audience should have no difficulty distinguishing the characters as each is assigned a colour that matches her personality. Furthermore, the girls\' last names contain a number in the order of appearance and first names which associate with their colour.Enjoyment: 6I won\'t lie, I started watching with low expectations for everything except for the fan-service department and to that end my expectations have been met. It is definitely a visual upgrade to the Strike Witches series and it won\'t disappoint anyone who is looking for some hot loli butt action. Now excuse me as I return to my guilty pleasure...Overall: 6This is not the best Winter 2013 has offered so far. This is either a hit or miss: you will like it if you like watching magical girl shows or belong to the Roadside Observation Research Institute, otherwise it will probably be Vividredful. up and uses finishing move"".

We have techno mixes for the fast-paced action scenes and in general cheerful BGMs. The ending themes change every episode from 1 to 4 as each girl is introduced, which is a bonus. While the music of Vividred Operation will not be too memorable, it gets the job done.Character: 4The characters of Vividred Operations unfortunately do not stand out as they fall under overused archetypes. It seems the protagonist in this type of magical girl genre is always the cheerful, energetic girl while you also have the pure, innocent type; the cool, strong girl and the introverted, smart girl. You even have the animal familiar that is ubiquitous in the magical girls genre.It seems that Vividred Operation also took a cue from Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica by including a mysterious, gloomy girl who serves as an antagonist at first but will likely become an ally towards the end of the series.The audience should have no difficulty distinguishing the characters as each is assigned a colour that matches her personality. Furthermore, the girls\' last names contain a number in the order of appearance and first names which associate with their colour.Enjoyment: 6I won\'t lie, I started watching with low expectations for everything except for the fan-service department and to that end my expectations have been met. It is definitely a visual upgrade to the Strike Witches series and it won\'t disappoint anyone who is looking for some hot loli butt action. Now excuse me as I return to my guilty pleasure...Overall: 6This is not the best Winter 2013 has offered so far. This is either a hit or miss: you will like it if you like watching magical girl shows or belong to the Roadside Observation Research Institute, otherwise it will probably be Vividredful.', ""I found this anime pretty cool. Because it's about technology in the future not magics. One of the most interesting anime to watch in 2013. The story is really great, awesomely unpredictable. The future technology, action,  sci-fi thingy is simply awesome. Although there's so much fanservice and yuri scenes in it (score: 9). The art is very beautiful, especially for the backgrounds, characters, and the mecha, love it (score: 8). The opening and ending are pretty good I think (score: 8). What I love the most are the characters. The characters personality are all unpredictable, especially Himawari. I thought she was the moe chara...with big oppai. But actually she's a techno addict, never go to school, live alone, character. That's really awesome and the other characters are not boring too (score: 10). Hopefully, I enjoy this anime until the last episode. Please make this anime more interesting with the sci-fi, mecha, and action from episode to episode! And please make it less fanservice and yuri!

(Overall: 8)"", 'Vividred Operation is an action/sci-fi anime brought to you by studio A-1 pictures and the creator of Strike Witches. Vividred Operation is an action anime that is very pleasing to the eyes. A-1 pictures went all out in the animation department, especially when it comes to the fight and transformation scenes. Unfortunately, its art and animation are the best part of the anime. The plot, themes, and characters are all very formulaic, containing nothing we haven’t already seen before in countless other anime.The main character, Akane Isshiki lives with her sister and grandfather in a peaceful and lush world. Always cheerful and bursting with...limitless energy, she takes on every day with a smile, exuding positive vibes. But her peaceful world is soon threatened by a menacing alien threat known as the Alone. Using some high tech super suits built by her grandfather, Akane and her friends must eradicate the enemy threat to protect their peaceful world and the Manifestation engine, which provides the world with 95% of its energy.And there’s a red flag right there. An engine that provides 95% of the world’s energy is stationed in an earthquake prone country on an island? It would make far more sense for multiple engines to be spread out across the world. But that’s just a small little gripe, and that is hardly the biggest thing wrong with the plot. The anime progresses with the “monster of the week” setup, occasionally broken up by the stereotypical beach episode or some downtime to show the viewer some forced melodrama.The world is largely projected as a peaceful world devoid of any war or ugliness, thanks to the Manifestation engine. Also due to this, the world was able to avoid an energy crisis five years prior to the story. It would have been interesting to learn more about this crisis and how the Manifestation changed the world, but there’s no elaboration there. Nor is it even made clear exactly what the Alone are, where they came from, and why they want to destroy the engine. All we are given are bare bones explanations that open up a number of questions about the plausibility of various aspects of the plot.Themes the anime projects are the power of love and friendship and how it conquers all. As if we haven’t already seen this theme a million times already. It makes the whole story pretty predictable. A blind man could have seen the outcome of the individual episodes and the ending coming from a mile away.The characters don’t fare much better. They are mostly cookie cutter stereotypes that get very little character development. Akane Isshiki is a cheerful middle school girl who is bursting with boundless energy. She’s a hardworking yet ditzy girl who is almost instantly liked by all her friends and can pretty much do anything. Futaba Aoi is the quiet and proper little rich girl who is also Akane’s best friend. Kuroki Rei is initially cold and distant, but eventually warms up to Akane and the girl’s later. Saegusa Wakaba is the sporty tomboy. Shinomiya Himawari is the diminutive shut-in, who is also a superb hacker.The little development that the girls get is largely predictable and their pasts are sparsely explained. It’s very hard to care about the characters as there just isn’t anything special about them. Akane in particular gets pretty obnoxious, border lining on Mary Sue. Not having any special skills (aside from some athletic skills that are only briefly hinted at), she overcomes everything using the power of love and friendship. With her positive attitude, she gains the trust and love of several girls instantly. The side characters are pretty much forgettable and contribute little to the plot. The main antagonist is presented as a mysterious and oppressive figure, yet doesn’t get any kind of fleshing out in terms of character. She is also forgettable, and we don’t even really find out what her motivations are or how she was able to do what she did.Another thing worth mentioning is the fanservice. There’s nothing wrong with a little fanservice in anime, so long as it isn’t gratuitous, distracting, and doesn’t detract from the story. The fanservice in Vividred Operation does all three. A few seconds into the first episode, the viewers are showed the image of the sun rising between a 14 year old girl’s legs. In fact, candid butt shots and some occasional partial nudity are riddled throughout the anime. When the girls “dock” they are inexplicably shown in their underwear. The school uniforms are quite silly, consisting of a tight jacket and a pair of booty shorts. And then there’s the predictable beach episode where someone just has to lose their swimsuit. Considering how young the girls look and how little they even have, the fanservice isn’t even remotely titillating. It just makes the narrative and the anime as a whole look silly. As if the cheesy story wasn’t enough, the gratuitous and out of place fanservice makes it even harder to take seriously.Now on to the best part of the anime: the art and animation. A-1 pictures did well in this department. The fight scenes are well choreographed, but the real treat is when the girls use their “docking” ability to combine their powers and bust out their ultimate attacks. Big, flashy, and gorgeous, they burst with vivid color. The transformations are given the same kind of treatment, being flashy, colorful, and dramatic. The fights with the Alone are the highlights of the series. But the final fight tops it all, with the most insane and over the top attack in the series. The soundtrack is also surprisingly good as well. Its tracks sound like something straight out of a sci-fi movie.Overall, Vividred Operation is just an average anime on almost every count. Its characters are stereotypical and one dimensional. Its story is very cheesy and predictable. None of its characters or interesting plot points are fleshed out or elaborated on. The script honestly feels like something that was written for a children’s anime. But this belief is offset by its frequent fanservice that’s quite unfitting for a children’s anime. Its art and animation are superb, but it’s not enough to save the show. Vividred is only really good for its eye popping animation and fight scenes. Its mediocrity in every other department hardly make it an interesting watch. limitless energy, she takes on every day with a smile, exuding positive vibes.

You start with rice, which represents a new land, unexplored by people other than the native residents. Then suddenly a vessel containing a foreign kind of edible substance arrives, and it begins to unload itself onto the barren rice, and soon the rice on the top is overwhelmed by the sudden flash of mayonnaise. Oh, but it doesn't stop there, nope, the mayonnaise just keeps on pouring, completely submerging the top layer of rice. The submerged rice is then dug...up and devoured, revealing the plain rice that was being protected by those on the surface. They are then, in turn, covered with mayonnaise and are consumed. The mayonnaise continues to pour as the rice is devoured, leaving nothing but mayonnaise in the rice bowl, thus the bowl is now a mayonnaise bowl. However it isn't long until the main protagonist of the show has to run off and perform the necessary tasks to continue the supposed plot that exists in the show. And once she leaves, the mayonnaise that took over the bowl is left unattended. Eventually, the mayonnaise will begin to spoil and rot from it's own developments, thus leading to the downfall of the mayonnaise and the bowl is left useless. Then the girl gets home and washes the bowl, only to put another serving of rice in it, thus beginning the circle of life all over again.Ya amuricuh up and devoured, revealing the plain rice that was being protected by those on the surface.

The story is so irrelevant that if you watch the episodes where the girls join you could skip to the end and still be able to follow the story. Basically it\'s power rangers meets the powerpuff girls except less awesome than that sounds and more likely to make you hate your computer/...TV screen.ART: The art is pretty good, the designs for the alone particularly the speaker\'s final form and the girls\' docking transformations were awesome; it has that bright slice of life kind of feel the CG was amazingSOUND: The sound was pretty much average the opening and ending themes are nothing memorable and the voice actors do their jobs, nothing more, nothing less the background music does a good job of staying in the background.CHARACTER: I have never hated a group of characters as much as the ones in this anime,the girls are all pallete swaps of each other with one or two character quirks added that attempt to make friends with anything on two legs that they come across. Every single character is an underdeveloped cliché cardboard cutout. The most interesting character was the villain of the series who in my opinion was too good for such a weak show.ENJOYMENT: There was no joy here only suffering, I fell asleep more times than I could count and developed a newfound respect for the deep characterization and story telling that is power rangers, this show finally made me question my commitment to finish whatever I start and when I found I still had 7 episodes to go I came as close to existential despair as I ever have.OVERALL: I\'m not exactly sure who this anime is for, the bright colors and non-existent story tell me it\'s for 10 year old girls maybe but the little girl swallowing, universe breaking entity at the end says otherwise, I\'m sure somebody in some dark remote corner of the universe will watch this and like it but unless you want to keep being beaten over the head with ""friendship conquers all"" for 12 episodes watch something else, hell the bad guys are even called the alone so yeah it was pretty badP.S: The so called ass-centric ecchi scenes aren\'t worth it TV screen.ART: The art is pretty good, the designs for the alone particularly the speaker\'s final form and the girls\' docking transformations were awesome; it has that bright slice of life kind of feel the CG was amazingSOUND: The sound was pretty much average the opening and ending themes are nothing memorable and the voice actors do their jobs, nothing more, nothing less the background music does a good job of staying in the background.CHARACTER: I have never hated a group of characters as much as the ones in this anime,the girls are all pallete swaps of each other with one or two character quirks added that attempt to make friends with anything on two legs that they come across.

When it\'s done airing I\'m going to see if this is true.After watching: That\'s a whole lotta action, fanservice, and cute-girls-doing-cute-things interactions with each other! Can definitely see how they can call it that, with much the same kind of plot, battles (though this time with a straight-up magical girls feel, despite being pure sci-fi), and ambiance \'n\' aesthetics.This is certainly one of the best-looking animes I\'ve ever seen, though probably because I\'ve never watched one so new...before.The whole ""power of friendship"" thing is lame and simplistic, but it works well here. The final battle and big bad were quite brutal, though! Color me impressed.And now for comparisons. This does seem more mindless; e.g., in SW, girls wear panties by themselves because it\'s natural for everyone to emulate war heroes (just like American men, after the World Wars, shaving their beards to look like soldiers, even though they only needed to to wear gas masks) like the Witches who can\'t wear bulky pants because that\'d interfere with equipping their Striker Units; whereas here, girls apparently wear 80\'s-style short-shorts ""jus\' cuz"". Or to put on an alternate spin: VO is openly honest about their fanservice. Heh heh heh.But likewise, Witches trained hard for battle, while the ladies here go from schoolgirls to suddenly kicking ass and taking names for no reason, not even ""A wizard scientist did it"" -- though the occasional mid-air pop-up holographic displays (reminds me of Dead Space, neat!) explains how they know how their new equipment works. Among a dozen other little things that make this feel more like a shallow [i]Akshun![/i] piece.Ah well, guess it\'s not a big deal, \'tis what it is and still quite enjoyable; just a point in favor of SW, that\'s all. Not to imply that SW is ""deep"" in any way, mind you... but VO certainly took their on-the-surface qualities and ran hog-wild with \'em. Again, not saying that\'s a bad thing, but it DOES make it feel a bit like they\'re just playing follow-the-leader. But hey, not like they were ever going to make SW season 3...On its own, as a magical girls show (but with the magic replaced by future tech approaching but not quite borderline cyberpunk), it\'s a fairly good but standard action piece starring pretty and likeable -- though for the most part archetypal -- schoolgirls of war, like so many animes. Neither original nor groundbreaking, but as I said above, it works well nevertheless....now where have I said all that before? I\'m getting major deja vu here! before.The whole ""power of friendship"" thing is lame and simplistic, but it works well here. The final battle and big bad were quite brutal, though!

It’s not that there’s nothing else to it, it’s just the strongest and arguably the best or worst points of the whole anime. Really, enjoyment in this anime is as subjective as it gets. Do you like cliché and predictability? Do you like fanservice of underaged girls? Colourful cast with only as much depth as their fanservice scenes? Or simply want something simple with a hint of characters and story to watch? If so, this show is for you and you’d most likely enjoy it.The plot isn’t...really a rocket science (even though it has hints of it, no, really). So, a genius that invented an infinite source of energy gets turned into a stuffed animal for mascot purposes just when weird creatures begun attacking the energy machine-thingy. So he sends his pre-teen granddaughter to fight them with cool effects and lots of ass in tight shorts, not by the mascot. Of course, she gets a colour matched (tight) dress with rockets and jets and a boomerang. ‘Cos they’re cool. Later she makes friends at school and gives them keys (the magical devices that turn them into mahou shoujo of science) as if they were manufactured. Why would anyone with a bit of sanity let a 12 year-old give out weapons of mass destruction in return for friendship is beyond me. But I guess stuffed animals aren’t made with a big brain. There’s also a mysterious girl that appears at the scene of attacks with not as much fanservice… I mean screen time. At first. She gets better. At both. Oh, and there are some yuri hints all over the place. That’s the plot. Intriguing, right?Characters are as strong and unpredictable as the plot is. Every character is colour coded. Of course, Akane, the lead, stupid and naïve goody-two shoes is bright red. Her little sis (that serves as a hook for those that find pre-teens too old for their liking) is bright pink and looks like her copy. Blue, I mean Aoi (Oh, wait) is shy and cute goody-two shoes. Wakaba (green) is the goody-two shoes samurai (metaphorically speaking). Yellow, Himawari, is the goody-two shoes hikkikomori with stunning beauty and the last but not least; Kuroki , black as her name hints, the goody-two shoes mysterious girl. Pick your goody-two shoes… I mean colour… I mean character and you stick with it until the end because that’s as far as they go. Preferred fanservice doesn’t really matter because all of them get the same over and over. What can you expect when their school uniforms look like they were designed by a paedophile?Don’t worry, fanservice isn’t the only thing this show is good at. Art is one of the points when the anime shines the most. But, really, have you seen the art? Those colours should be used for traffic lights in bad weather. Still, the character design is really amazing and fits the show perfectly (even the clothes design, those ass shots would be awkward with baggy jeans). I really liked it. It’s fresh, lively and sweet while it didn’t give me diabetes. So, it’s the good kind of sweet. Like a semi-dark chocolate. I don’t care if you like it or not, it’s chocolate!All in all, this was an entertaining ride that I’ll forget I have ever watched in a week or so. The most memorable thing about this is the fanservice that makes me wonder if the animators ever felt awkward while working on this. Second most memorable thing would be the character design, which I really liked and the vivid colours. There’s really not as much fanservice as I keep implying. There’s more! So, before you start watching this make sure it won’t make you feel weird. And don’t watch it with you parents. Just don’t. really a rocket science (even though it has hints of it, no, really).

Quite simply beautiful and amazing with great ecchi scenes and just everything! I freaking love Vividred Operation.Vividred Operation is about 4 (5 really) girls, Akane, Himiwari, Aoi and Saegusa Wakabe who become these amazing super hero girls with the power of the Palette suit. Created by Akane\'s grandfather Kenjirou Isshiki, Akane is the catalyst to the entire creation and operation of this suit. Through the power of friendship, she allows Aoi, Saugusa and Himawari to also gain the powers of the Palette suit. The henshin...scenes in Vividred Operation are incredible, I should honestly make some gifs of the SFW ones because they\'re drop dead gorgeous and sexy; especially the Vivid henshin scenes which are astonishing.The story for Vividred Operation is rather simple, living in an idyllic world where energy and power is essentially free through a rather large and powerful machine named the Incarnate Engine (95% of the worlds energy is created from this device, also created by Kenjirou Isshiki), enemies named Alone are trying to destroy this Incarnate Engine. The reason why, we don\'t know, the person behind it, we also don\'t know. What we do know is that they must be stopped at all costs for the destruction of the Incarnate Engine would be the end of this idyllic world.There are so many things about Vividred Operation that I could label as ""best things"" because I like it so much: the transformation scenes, the ecchi and nude scenes, the action scenes, the friendship theme, the absolutely eye popping art style and colors, but these are all obvious things, the biggest surprise was about Rae-chan, the 5th girl of the show who was doing things her own way for her own reasons. As we learned more about her, I thought for the longest time that her ""world"" was her family and things of that nature, but when we learn she comes from a freaking parallel world because her ""world"" was destroyed, I was absolutely stunned. I didn\'t see that twist come at all and it was just wild to think Rae-chan would be involved in something so serious. Destroying the Incarnate Engine to restore her world, but being played by ""them"" and the Speaker from the get-go, ridiculous. The whole ""them"" situation is wild too, using Alones as tests to see if a world deserves to use an Incarnate Engine. The crow/speaker was hell bent and crazy too, I can\'t believe she ate Rae in the scene and then transformed to be this huge monster.The girls in Vividred Operation are so incredibly cute and beautiful and gorgeous and even sexy, they\'re so pretty. The girls alone are all you need, to watch this anime. The henshin (transformation) scenes are all really really pretty and my goodness, the ecchi is so good. Akane holds the group together, being just all out eccentric, happy, cute and always never giving up (her seiyuu is incredibly cute too, I love the ""hehe\'s"" that she does, makes me giggle hearing that). Aoi-chan is really pretty, I love her blue eyes and accents; she has a really nice personality, always being extra polite and sincere, impossible to not like her. Saegusa is really cool too, she\'s strong and powerful, always wanting to get stronger and with the help of Akane, really understand what it means to be strong; she also loves really cute things like Akane\'s younger sister Momo and Himawari. Himawari is a super genius, mega cutie with the shyest and most reserved/timid personality out of the girls, she talks in a nigh on monotone voice, but can show her emotions when there are reasons for it. I love all the girls so much and think they\'re absolutely incredible. Rae is a bit of an odd ball since she\'s a pseudo-antagonist for most of the season, but she\'s a very sweet girl who is very nice and cares about people, she just closes herself off from the world because of her mission. In the end, I really did end up liking Rae-chan, I think she was able to overcome her issues and friendship prevailed in the end, a really sweet ending was involved with her.I shouldn\'t just focus on the girls alone, Akane\'s grandfather, Kenjirou is really cool and when he becomes a stuffed animal that looks like an otter was really funny. The otter is really well animated and I love the teeth and all the ridiculous faces he can pull off, so funny.Focusing on the art style for Vividred, it\'s one of the best looking anime I have ever seen, the colors are so unbelievably vibrant and eye explodingly good, everyone looks great and the detail when shown is just outstanding. On visual eye candy alone, Vividred Operation surprised me so much, with my eyes opening extra wide to take in all the visual feedback that I was witnessing. Every attack the girls did, all the explosions, all the trails, all the beams and seriously, just everything in Vividred Operation looks good, fantastic, just absolutely amazing. I\'ll go as far to say that the CG used in Vividred Operation looked really really good too and blended really well with the hand drawn art.Sound design and music is unbelievably good in Vividred Operation too, all the sounds sound so good and the music, wow did they nail the action music and the heartfelt music and everything. The OP and ED\'s used, I can\'t fault it at all. Just the general music and BGM used is fantastic, honestly just really good stuff.Even knowing that this show is poorly rated because it\'s a focus on fan-service and most people don\'t like that, or the story makes zero sense at all and people feel like the pacing and motivations for everything is just whack, but I can\'t help but feel so in love with Vividred Operation. I teared up many times, the theme of friendship, as cliché and overused as it can be, still touches me dearly and seeing the girls go through their hardships was just enough to make me tear up; heck the last 2 episodes really brought on the watery eyes and tears fell at the absolute ending of the season.I feel so happy today, that honestly, I don\'t have any faults with this show at all, not with the animation, not with the sound, not with the art-style, not with the story or it\'s pace, and I most definitely don\'t have an issue with the ecchi shown, I freaking love it!! scenes in Vividred Operation are incredible, I should honestly make some gifs of the SFW ones because they\'re drop dead gorgeous and sexy; especially the Vivid henshin scenes which are astonishing.The story for Vividred Operation is rather simple, living in an idyllic world where energy and power is essentially free through a rather large and powerful machine named the Incarnate Engine (95% of the worlds energy is created from this device, also created by Kenjirou Isshiki), enemies named Alone are trying to destroy this Incarnate Engine. The reason why, we don\'t know, the person behind it, we also don\'t know.

One day giant, mysterious entities known as ‘Alone’ appear and attempt to destroy the engine however it’s inventor, Kenjirou Isshiki (Terasoma, Masaki), creates the Vivid System in order to combat them. His granddaughter, Isshiki Akane (Sakura, Ayane) and her friends utilize the Vivid System to transform into mech-like warriors in order to fight back against the Alone and save both the Manifestation Engine and Earth.[Characters]:The main characters in the...show are Isshiki Akane and her three friends who she gathers over the first few episodes in quick succession.Because the show is essentially a mahou shoujo you can expect what Akane’s character is like – upbeat, cheery, enthusiastic, and friendly. She is quick to latch on to people and can become upset when she can’t help others or when she fails. I feel that, while Akane is a perfectly fine character within the context of the show, her character-type defines her to a T and at no point did I feel that she was a departure from the cute, friendly magical girl trope that she exhibits. Because she is what she appears to be and never anything more I felt pretty bored with her as a character.The other characters are not much different unfortunately. As mahou shoujo are classically color oriented, Akane’s friends of course exhibited the characteristics more or less associated with their archetypes and become the blue, green, and yellow magical girls alongside Akane’s red. They aren't very complex characters and ultimately just want to be friends with each other like ‘all young girls’.To explore the remaining characters – Akane’s grandfather is fairly present but is accidentally transformed into a plush sea otter thus fulfilling the show’s professed necessity in having the classic animal companion/guide for the magical girls. While the antagonist(s) of the show are the Alone that attempt to destroy the Manifestation Engine, there is of course the ‘dark magical girl’ who works against Akane and her companions. Kuroki, Rei (Uchida, Maaya) is more or less similar to everyone else in the show in that she exemplifies her archetype and behaves throughout the show accordingly. She is lonely and desperate but not beyond saving and this character trait, as always, serves as a good amount of tension within the show.[Art/Animation]:The art was on point and pretty high-quality in A-1 Studio’s fashion. The show used CG quite well and to good effect in the action sequences without making it look out of place or distracting. The character designs are pretty much what you would expect of a mahou shoujo – the girls are each somewhat oriented towards their magical girl color each other visible trait backs this up in different ways. Takamura Kazuhiro is responsible for both the character designs and directing and this feels incredibly similar in approach to one of his renowned shows Strike Witches. You can hardly go a few minutes without having multiple crotch and ass shots of the girls even in casual dialogue and while I would describe this approach as distracting and distasteful, other people gravitate to this style and so I simply want to prepare prospective watchers for this element of the show.The other thing I feel that I need to touch upon is the transformation sequences. In classic mahou shoujo style each girl has a transformation sequence when they shift into their Vivid engine palette suit and additionally a transformation beyond this when any of the girls combine with Akane to create a more powerful mech-girl. The sequences themselves are really well animated and are some of the better transformation sequences I have seen and they aren't done to death each episode like they are in some shows (they are often more tastefully edited down so that they do not play the full sequence each time after the audience is acquainted with them). While they are very good sequences I wouldn't say they are reason enough to watch the show – only one strong element alongside the good animation and CG.[Story]:I want to be upfront with the fact that, Vividred Operation is not a show that borrows elements from mahou shoujo in order to create a new genre or explore the story differently – it feels most akin to a reskin of the genre itself, substituting ‘technology’ in place of explicit magic and trading away certain design points in similar fashion. The show sticks very closely to its premise in that the magical mech girls defend the engine from the invasive Alone and eventually reach a final conflict in which the fate of things are decided. It is not an original plot but it doesn't pretend to be one. The show is not comedic however the characters are moe and by product of this there are comedic elements within the show despite the fact that it lacks gags or even mild jokes – it is comedic in the same way that being cute is comedic.Something I have to stress to prospective viewers of the show is that you cannot ask questions when it comes to the underlying logic of the show – Once you do, everything starts to unravel because hardly anything makes sense to begin with outside of the large picture conflict between a foreign entity and us, the human race. I say this because there is a great danger in what Vividred does when it trades away its aesthetic elements of magic for those of the technological. It is somewhat neat to have mech-girls instead of inexplicably magical ones however by making the show rely on technology, a purportedly explainable thing rather than magic, the typically incomprehensible element of the show – it begs explanation for each piece of ‘technology’ it utilizes. Now of course there is no explanation for why anything works the way it does and that is the slippery slope where the show is concerned.Why does Akane’s grandfather make the ‘docking’ (the combination of two girls into one stronger girl) require a kiss to activate the Vivid Drive? Why is the Vivid System capable of self-replicating in the case of Akane’s friends however is not put to greater use in order to destroy the Alone? Why are the palette suits, which are empowered by means of the Manifestation Engine, immune to EMP’s while everything else in the world that runs off of the engine is treated normally? There are no enjoyable answers to these questions and there is nothing to read into – they are simple logical inconsistencies born out of poor writing and lazy implementation. You would be much better off treating the show as if they were just magical girls and frankly you’d have a hard time proving that they aren’t. Clarke’s third law has a place in all of this (that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic) however it is the fundamental reasoning behind the implantation and use of the technology rather than its actual existence that is called into question.All of that aside, because the show relies so heavily on all of the tropes and elements of the classical mahou shoujo genre, it is highly predicable in the plot department and so needless to say this is probably the show’s weakest point.[Music]:The music was one of the better parts about the show. It was pretty good all things considered and my only gripes are that it didn't have much diversity in that most of the songs sounded the same (which worked fine for the show) and that occasionally the scene would demand more tense music but the score at the time was awkwardly upbeat and heroic which somewhat damaged the mood rarely.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:Vividred Operation is a show where you get what you expect. If you know going in that the show could be summed up as ‘well-animated fan-service put to pretty decent music’ then you would find just that and not much else outside of minor character quirks.Because of the route the show took, in occupying all of the classic themes of majou shoujo and nothing else, it lacked the extra ‘something’ that made those shows work in their own way. Just as an example – there really is no ‘coming of age’ element in Vividred however it can commonly be found within the genre. Something like that would have greatly improved the show in my opinion because it would have given the show a sense of sentimentality and relatability – giving the show an ultimate meaning amongst the otherwise nonsensical things that transpire.Rating: 4I give Vividred Operation a 4 because at the end of the day I can only think of it as unoriginal, nonsensical in the extreme, and hyper-sexualized to the point of being obnoxious. I like the animation and the music and the transformation sequences are really good however everything else fails pretty spectacularly. It over-acknowledges its genre and never tries to be anything more than what came before it.[Recommendations]:Because of the nature of being a ‘4’ I probably wouldn't recommend Vividred to anyone because I feel like the genre is executed elsewhere far better. Its a perfectly fine show if your aim is to watch fan-service within a mahou shoujoThere may be an argument for Vividred being a decent gateway show into the genre of mahou shoujo, especially to those who are more skeptical of it, because it has decent action and the animation and music is on point. However I would say that even this is a dangerous sentiment as the show could also very easily turn people off of the genre entirely because of its negative aspects. If one can approach the show with this in mind, then it would probably be an alright thing to explore tentatively. show are Isshiki Akane and her three friends who she gathers over the first few episodes in quick succession.Because the show is essentially a mahou shoujo you can expect what Akane’s character is like – upbeat, cheery, enthusiastic, and friendly.

If one can approach the show with this in mind, then it would probably be an alright thing to explore tentatively."", ""Vividred Operation is a show that has been on my list of shows to watch for a while now. Action anime with female casts are something I tend to usually enjoy and the director, writer and studio have all done work I've liked previously. The show was also being compared to Strike Witches, an anime which I've always thought did so much right and didn't get credit for it because of the girls flying around in their underwear. I wanted Vividred to be a repeat of that experience and shine as something undeniably great. In that respect, I was disappointed.Vividred Operation is not a bad...anime. I gave it an 8 because I can't deny that I enjoyed it and I also can't deny that so much is technically great. Nevertheless, the show is kinda flat and often does come up short. It could be said that Vividred Operation does not have a lot of ambition. It almost makes me wonder if they didn't sit down while making this and ask themselves if they could make a good, memorable anime while bringing absolutely no new or original ideas whatsoever. If that was the challenge of the day, I might say A-1 Pictures actually somehow succeeded, if barely.The trick is keeping the production values high. The animation is pretty throughout. The action, the characters, the vehicles, the transformations, the Alone, and yes the frequent fanservice shots, all of it looks very nice and eye catching.  The music is good, with a cute catchy OP and a number of suitable if not overly memorable EDs. The voice acting is fine too. There is very little wrong with the presentation. A-1 went all out to keep it strong. Which is good, because if any corners had been cut it would have just made the shortcomings of the show all the more blaring.The story is simply put, not very memorable. It's cliche magical girl cheese from the beginning. It has some high moments, it's all fluffy, comfortable fun, but it's not very high in suspense or intrigue. Revelations lack weight; motivations aren't defined properly, and you just never don't feel like the magic of friendship won't win the day. That said, I would not call it bad or incompetent, just lazy and routine. It plays to the tropes directly and only seldom pretends unconvincingly like it isn't. The setup isn't as strong as something like Strike Witches, and the threat just never seems as real. It's not without it's few rewarding moments though, I suppose, though it's definitely not for the cynics.The characters for the show are as stock as can be. You got your energetic, optimistic idiot main character, her polite rich girl best friend, a kendo girl and your typical recovering hikkimori. The last, Hinamori, is in my opinion has the best design of the bunch and is also the best developed; having two great character development episodes. None of the four are very unique though and seem plucked straight out of other shows. Then there is the rival/antagonist girl who practically is Homura from Madoka Magica... which might actually be a good thing if her motivation wasn't kept obscure, the audience never clued into just what she lost as we eventually were with Homura. There's also the main character's grandfather who becomes a talking animal mascot in the first episode for no other reason than it seeming to be a requirement for the magical girl genre. There are a few other characters, but none of them are developed to the point where they matter so much.But while horribly uninspired, the characters are still rather cute and can occasionally be fun. They interact well with each other. Their designs are nothing new, but aren't bad exactly. The magical girl outfits are well designed and the forms when they fuse together are especially beautiful. It just really kind of falls short of something like Strike Witches, which juggled more characters yet had an excellent and diverse cast that were developed smartly. This doesn't so much, which holds it back.There's also the unavoidable subject of the fanservice. Of all the things that went into Strike Witches, this was not something I've ever thought was vital to it or it's success. It had, as I said, good characters and a good setting. The fight sequences were surprisingly well thought out and the show knew when to take itself seriously and when to have a good time. It was a good anime, panty shots or no. For me, throwing a bunch of teens in short pants in our faces doesn't make this show the new Strike Witches at all, as it's just not any of those things exactly. I don't personally mind fanservice in anime; there are some blatant fanservice anime I enjoy. Here though, mostly it's just kinda distracting, and for some people I can see it killing the experience entirely.Despite all I said, there was fun to be had with this show. It wasn't the next Strike Witches by a long shot, but it was an enjoyable and overall fairly harmless take on the magical girl genre. While not particularly rife with good ideas, it made up for it through flash and charm. Perhaps I'm ultimately being over charitable, but I do feel an 8 is right for the show based on the merits I see. With the right mindset and the right expectations, I think someone could find a quite enjoyable experience with Vividred Operation. anime.

There's also the main character's grandfather who becomes a talking animal mascot in the first episode for no other reason than it seeming to be a requirement for the magical girl genre. There are a few other characters, but none of them are developed to the point where they matter so much.But while horribly uninspired, the characters are still rather cute and can occasionally be fun. They interact well with each other. Their designs are nothing new, but aren't bad exactly. The magical girl outfits are well designed and the forms when they fuse together are especially beautiful. It just really kind of falls short of something like Strike Witches, which juggled more characters yet had an excellent and diverse cast that were developed smartly. This doesn't so much, which holds it back.There's also the unavoidable subject of the fanservice. Of all the things that went into Strike Witches, this was not something I've ever thought was vital to it or it's success. It had, as I said, good characters and a good setting. The fight sequences were surprisingly well thought out and the show knew when to take itself seriously and when to have a good time. It was a good anime, panty shots or no. For me, throwing a bunch of teens in short pants in our faces doesn't make this show the new Strike Witches at all, as it's just not any of those things exactly. I don't personally mind fanservice in anime; there are some blatant fanservice anime I enjoy. Here though, mostly it's just kinda distracting, and for some people I can see it killing the experience entirely.Despite all I said, there was fun to be had with this show. It wasn't the next Strike Witches by a long shot, but it was an enjoyable and overall fairly harmless take on the magical girl genre. While not particularly rife with good ideas, it made up for it through flash and charm. Perhaps I'm ultimately being over charitable, but I do feel an 8 is right for the show based on the merits I see. With the right mindset and the right expectations, I think someone could find a quite enjoyable experience with Vividred Operation."", 'After watching the preview and first episode, the first thought in my mind was, ""Huh, so is this Strike Witches plus Nanoha?"" Visually, there\'s a lot of similarity with these 2 shows. A detailed and very fan-service-y transformation sequence is quintessential (well, more like cliche at this point) Nanoha. While the concept originated with Sailor Moon, the ""high-tech"" styling of the sequences clearly play to otakus rather than young girls, and the ""key in the ignition"" shot is a possible throwback to the tagline of Nanoha A\'s. The way Rei was portrayed also reminded me very strongly of Fate Testarossa. As for parallels with Strike...Witches (SW) other than the production staff, the tried-and-true formula of defending mankind from a powerful and mysterious threat with pubescent girls wielding implausibly powerful machines and weapons is a classic in anime.It\'s possible that the Vividred Operation production staff wanted to address weaknesses in SW with this series, for example, ""Just what are the Neuroi, anyway, and why are they attacking humanity?"" In SW there was much more emphasis on the cast of characters, so while it is a rather glaring detail to have not addressed in 2 seasons, a movie, and several manga/novels, the only thing lost was an opportunity to add depth to the bad guys.In Vividred Operation, we get to see a face and hear a voice to the Neuroi-- er, Alones attacking humanity. Additionally, the production staff tied together the Alones and the characters in a fantastic drama, and I believe this is the best part of the series, rivaling the Fate/Precia subplot in Nanoha.The ultimate villain in the series is, in my view, one of the best-written villains in recent memory: arrogant, judgmental, unforgivingly perfectionist, sadistic, and ultimately hypocritical, it embodies many aspects of humanity that good people strive to avoid. This villain also serves as a reminder that everyone faces these demons and even suffers as a result, and that what matters is how we live in the face of them. Vividred\'s finale shows that a villain can be hopelessly ""overpowered"" and still be entertaining because of the strength of the writing, something that is far from easy to accomplish.Alas, I wish that they had applied similar depth and drama to the four girls, who seem little more than rearrangements of anime stereotypes: the cheerful optimist, the quiet ""iyashi"" type, the straight-laced knight of justice, and the tsundere otaku. Ordinarily, I wouldn\'t mind Yet Another Anime With Cliche Characters (TM), and to the writers\' credit, these four are in fact developed into a respectable team of heroines. But since the theme is ""friendship"", I think the show could\'ve been much stronger if their friendship were ultimately tested through the main conflict of the show, rather than just establish the relationship and test them through moments that would seem silly and trivial in retrospect. This is where similar shows like Strike Witches and Lagrange are stronger, because we feel the full impact of the bonds straining to the point breaking, and re-forming stronger than ever. In Vividred, the climax only tests Akane and Rei\'s budding friendship, and while this is a central development, it pretty much turns the other 3 girls into ornaments and robs some of the drama from the ""there is still hope"" scene-- you could do the last 2 episodes without them and get the same dramatic effect. While I believe this is the show\'s main character weakness, I also think this was an understandable tradeoff, and thus a very good effort for a 12-episode series.The scene immediately following the climax clearly seemed to be a scene made to help fit the series into 12 episodes rather than 13. Considering all the seriousness the threat was treated with, wrapping it all up in a single scene with such simplicity requires not a suspension of belief, but a careless disregard of prior events. Had this been a 13-episode series, the writers would\'ve had the space to properly address the last conflict left hanging in the balance: the justice demanded for threatening an entire world, versus the desire to restore a lost world.There are a few minor details that I think could\'ve been done better. In the climactic scene, the hero attacks the villain not with a rather obvious choice of weapon, but her fist. I know the ""sword duel/clash of titans/banzai charge final attack"" is a favorite of production crews in Japan, but it\'s seriously been done to death by this industry. There\'s also a scene where the girls somehow survive a massive explosion ""with atmospheric and seismic effects"" and pretty much shrug it off like it was a tiny firework-- I know anime\'s realism basically dwells in the realm of ridiculous, but this was stretching the limits of believability. There were some visual discrepancies in the finale\'s broadcast, almost as if the animators didn\'t have time to finish matching the consistency of all the shots. Again, these are minor issues that only distract from the experience at most.Visually, I thought that other than the default setting of ""no pants or skirts for girls"", the animation and design were very well done, and restrained in terms of fan service-- believe me, the titillation in this show is tame compared to some other animes out there. The soundtrack was a wonderful match to the drama on screen, and the soaring theme when the girls combine is a fine heroic piece in its own right. The opening theme, ""ENERGY"", is one of the better theme songs of the season, but the ending theme songs didn\'t really float my boat. The voice cast\'s performance and direction is a good match to the writing, but honestly could have used a little originality.Overall, an 8 out of 10, a good 12-episode series for fans of sci-fi. Some issues in plot and characterization, but nothing I would consider show-stoppers.

This anime has a ton of great things in its offering, especially when it came from the same people who created Strike Witches.The story might\'ve been influenced much from Strike Witches, but it\'s more than just some slice of life thing. It always keeps the pacing to the maximum and whenever it wants to slow down the pace in favour of something else, it does that very well (see episode five, if you know what I mean). It\'s also a lighthearted magical girl, and I can never have it in any other way.The characters in...Vividred Operation are very likable, from the quirky yet smart weasel that happens to be Akane\'s grandfather, to the friend of Akane, Aoi Futaba. The five important girls all contain a lot of backstory to them, and they all are interesting and will later focus a build on development.Graphically speaking, this is by far some of the best balance between 2D art and 3DCG I\'ve ever seen. The art style looks sweet, and the 3DCG looks crisp and detailed. Don\'t believe me? Look at the magical girl transformations. That\'s how great the graphics are.Musically speaking, it\'s just great to listen to. The opening theme, ""Energy"" by earthmind is a song that I can\'t get enough of. The background music fits the situation that is going on especially when it gets to the intense parts, and the ending themes are always different offering variety to it.As you probably already know, Vividred Operation is truly a masterpiece that one can look forward to. If Madoka kickstarted 2011, then Vividred most certainly kickstarted 2013. This anime definitely deserves a recommendation.

Don't expect any deep sci-fi plot material here, but the underlying story is mildly interesting in that it follows the well-worn theme of battling invaders from parallel universes, with some general storyline similarities to the Mai-Hime, Yumeria or Noein series.  The story was somewhat remarkable for what it didn't have: no boys or male love interests, almost no comedy or humor.  All in all, Vividred was a pretty light feel-good series with more than a few fan service moments. "", 'I have a couple of animes I consider ""guilty pleasures"".  I know they\'re below average, but I was sucked in by an interesting universe, premise, or art style, and became invested in what I was watching.  Even when things become dull or predictable, I continue to plow through because I genuinely want to see what is next.  I\'m INVESTED.Vividred Operation fails to invoke investment.  At all.  In any way.The entire thing felt like magical girl paint-by-numbers constructed from the leftover scraps of Strike Witches.  ""Spiritual successor""?  More like ""shameless knock-off""!The first 2 episodes were some of the most...painful I\'ve ever experienced since Sword Art Online, and since Vividred was aired back in 2013, I have no problem giving you plenty of spoilers.A list of complaints, given in mostly-chronological order (I refuse to go back and do research, it\'s not worth it):Why is the genius scientist grandfather turned into a stuffed animal?  Does it serve the plot?  Will it lead to anything?  Nope!  We needed a cute animal mascot for our magical girl show without any magic, and he was the least important character, so he got the short straw.  They literally throw out some science-y gobbledegook and handwave how he ended up transferring his consciousness.  At least Lyrical Nanoha character Yuuno had a REASON for being a ferret (He was a mage, and injured, and transformed to conserve energy and later to remain incognito.  It gets dropped once the plot picks up and we don\'t need a mascot anymore.).The island is being destroyed!  Planes are being shot down left and right!  Entire ships are sinking, drowning thousands of sailors!  What is your reaction, Akane?!""How terrible.""Do you mind not sounding like you\'re reading off your grocery list, Akane?!""How terrible.""This is a warzone, Akane!  Put some actual EMOTION into it!""Look, Aoi!  You get to be a psuedoscience girl, too!  Wow!  Your outfit is so pretty, even though it\'s the exact same as mine in a different color!""I DIDN\'T MEAN LIKE THAT!Say Akane, didn\'t you used to be afraid of heights?""I got over it.""I know you just saved your friend from certain death and all, but trauma-born fears don\'t just-""I GOT OVER IT.""Okay, okay, you got over it.  Sheesh...So the whole reason Akane and Aoi can\'t ""dock"" (basically fusion dance with double entendre name because FANSERVICE) is because of friendship troubles.  What deep, dark secret is preventing them from fusing?Well, when Akane first met Aoi, she decided to randomly give her a tomato pulled right out of her ass (including obligatory ass shot).It\'s just like, BOOM HI I ALMOST HIT YOU WITH A NEWSPAPER WANT A ****ING TOMATO?!And apparently this is enough to ruin their friendship because Aoi hates tomatoes!  So she lies.  This is not a big deal, but the show makes it out to be because FRIENDSHIP.  Even Akane thinks her tomato-lying-friendship-crap is crap, and they transform into a cool-looking fusion.  It\'s still kinda disappointing, but we needed more looking cool, and less being cool.  We\'re cool like that.This is all done with flashbacks in the middle of a ****ing warzone, by the way.  So there\'s that.Okay, so there\'s a lot of fanservice in this show.  Unlike Kill la Kill, you can\'t ignore it in favor of the awesome.  And unlike Strike Witches, there\'s no in-universe excuse for the butt shots.You see, Strike Witches gets away with it by not only having lots of World War II paraphernalia, but by establishing a universe where magic meets science, and taking some refuge in audacity.  At one point in the second season they test fly a JET version of the Striker units, and the girl using it carries FOUR 30 mm cannons and a FIFTY MILLIMETER CANNON that\'s THREE TIMES AS LONG AS SHE IS TALL!  That\'s awesome, that\'s amazing, but it\'s even better because there are canon reasons behind all of it.Strike Witches ensures its characters are always in their panties because they couldn\'t use their equipment otherwise.  The Striker units are worn on the legs, so every time you get a butt shot, chances are you get a shot of something vaguely resembling a WW2 era plane.  Not to mention that the show has military attitude.  Butt shots aside, you will never see a Strike Witch gush over how cool they look or have friendship problems while battleships are sinking.It\'s do or die, and that gives the show some much-needed investment, because if the CHARACTERS are invested, then the VIEWERS are invested.  And it\'s hard to care about the fate of the world when the main characters are still squealing over their bright shiny new costumes and superpowers.Overall, I couldn\'t watch this show.

However the story itself isn't strong enough to determine how a show is considered as well done. Instead 'character' is the main core in driving a story forward.  And this shines in Vividred Operation. The friendship between the girls displays a heartwarming bond that slowly develops throughout the series. You may think a well-defined original plot is essential in deciding the final outcome of what is considered to be an excellent show, yet in Vividred I find it not completely necessary.Instead the storyline in Vividred serves to help in developing this bond further. With...each fight against the Alones, we see Akane and her friends developed a stronger relation with one another. Personally I feel a warm sensation when watching this relationship grows. Despite the unique traits of each character, their friendship comes together with the mighty cheerful Akane that undertakes the center role of bringing their friendship as one. With each girl; Aoi, Wakaba and Himawari, that have their own individual concerns in the beginning they show what friendship itself means to them and displays it through a touching confession to the opposite party and this brings an understanding between one another. Watching as each girl friendship grows deeper is truly inspiring. Life can only get as exciting as it is unless breaking through the limits of one's solitude.For the story of Alones existence trying to destroy the Manifestor engine is so-so. Girls in pilot suits that are extremely overpowered may not create much tension in defeating the enemy but the teamwork between friends that happens especially when they are 'Docking', is an example of things that are only achievable with the co-operation between friends. Though the show does turn out to explain the appearance and reason behind the attacks I find it is more enjoyable seeing Akane and her friends working and playing together.Personally I find the opening and ending song to be lighthearted that really suits my point of a deeper friendship exhibiting in this anime. Overall bgm is nice and soothing especially at times in down moments.The art may not be outstanding but it was pretty pleasant that was just right for this kind of show. The sun that sheen the blue skies throughout the series with never really a dull moment in the setting really keeps the mood spirit of the audience high.To sum it up I believe that if you are searching for a heavily-focused story then this show isn't what you're looking for. However the show is only well developed with the use of characters and this is well portrayed in Vividred that really uses the storyline of the Alones and the Manifestor Engine, itself as the basis of building each character. Without these girls and their bond, we'll just be seeing a unscientific creature that tries to destroy the Manifestor engine where the development of the show can go entirely on a different route and thus this feeling of a heartwarming friendship is lost.To make it clear in one sentence: Friendship shines in Vividred Operation and it is developed through the use of the plot that brings together this warm sincere bond. each fight against the Alones, we see Akane and her friends developed a stronger relation with one another.

Although the technologies aren\'t too impossible, most of them would be impractical in the real world. This anime is much more well-know for the fanservice than it is for its story.The art and animation is the main attraction here. Everything from the character designs to the world layout are done quite well. Some of the villains look a bit generic, but they at least die in interesting ways. The school uniforms ditch the traditional skirt and instead go with...boy shorts in order to display the characters\' beautiful asses. The lolis are all very adorable even when they\'re intended to be antagonists.The voices all fit the characters with the intentional exception of the grandfather who looks like a stuffed animal, although this was in order to keep the ""magical girl familiar/recruiter who looks like a stuffed animal"" trope while also keeping the show sci-fi only without other magic. The aliens sounded generic, although not out of place, and the music was nice to listen to.The characters personalities all fit fairly standard archetypes for the most part, but they were still fun to watch.

That world suddenly attacked by monsters and only a few girls capable to fight it. Using an advanced technology, they transform into a Mecha Mahou Shoujo (with fan service). The transformation result is a girl wearing a suit of armor that really fancy and shining. These girls fight and become stronger...by strengthen their friendship. They fight and keep fighting. The final battle, they fight a giant monster that can destroy their world. They fight it with the sole purpose to save their friend whose been trapped by that monster (take a note, they fight for their friend, not for their world. teheee). Finally they defeat that monster and the world become peaceful again. END OF SUMMARY.This anime has an excellent art done by A-1 Picture and good sound, but it's not come with a good story and character development. I quite enjoy the show at first, but the last few episodes just boring. Overall I can only give this anime the score 7.So, If you wish to watch a mahou shoujo like anime, this one is not exactly correct. Try Madoka or Nanoha instead.

You know, just like that identical scene in the first episode of Strike Witches.  Maybe they were worried someone might accuse them of being original.If the similarity bothers you, don\'t watch this.  As for me, originality...is way down on my list of important qualities I look for in anime, so I\'m fine with it.Story: 5Giant robotic aliens are attacking the earth.  A group of teenage girls has the power to defeat them, aided by technology created by the father... I mean, grandfather... of one of these magical girls, which allows them to fly around in their panties... I mean, in their shorts... and fight the aliens from the sky.  If this plot sounds familiar, you\'ve probably seen Strike Witches.The main difference is the setting.  Instead of a WW2-era alternate history, this one takes place in a near-future utopian society, where all the world\'s problems have been solved by unlimited access to essentially free energy.  Of course, such a setting would be boring in an action anime, so naturally a bunch of alien robots have to show up to spoil everything.  How rude of them.As is typical in shows like this, the traditional military is powerless against these robots, so of course it\'s up to a handful of teenage girls with high tech weapons and powers to save the world.  Take this show with a grain of salt and a double helping of willing suspension of disbelief.Art: 6Clean, bright, and shiny, just like you would expect from the kind of utopia the show presents.  The character designs are cute, although they\'re not even trying to hide the fact that Akane is clearly based on Yoshika from Strike Witches.The ""mahou shoujo"" transformations have an interesting high-tech flavor to them, reminding you that this is science fiction, not fantasy.  Aside from that, they\'re your typical ""superhero costume gradually appears on the girl"" transformations.Notes on fanservice: some nudity, but not a lot.Sound: 5Nothing wrong with it, but nothing really stands out either.  The voice acting is fine.  The theme song is fun but not as catchy as some.  Akane\'s ""vroom vroom"" sing-songs as she rides her levitating scooter are cute.Characters: 6The heroines are all right, though not particularly interesting.  They\'re stereotypical: the cheerful girl, the nice girl, the athletic girl, and the emotionless girl.  Each of the heroines is associated with a different color and weapon.  They can power up by ""docking"" with the main heroine in a slightly homoerotic version of the mahou shoujo transformation scene.  (Speaking of which, there\'s a lot of innuendo built into the Vivid system, such as the fact that all the girls\' main weapons have ""naked"" in their names.  I suspect Grandpa is a closet pervert)The most interesting character in the show is the villainess, but then I\'ve always been a fan of sympathetic villains.  In fact, you could even make the argument that she\'s the main character, despite not having as much screen time as Akane.My main complaint is that the aforementioned grandfather\'s transformation into a stuffed animal serves no purpose in the show.  It just feels way too gimmicky, like they felt obligated to add a cute critter to the show and couldn\'t figure out a better way.Enjoyment: 7I really like the tone of this show.  It has some slightly dark moments, but mostly it\'s upbeat, cheerful, and exciting.  It\'s an ironic mixture of a plot that you just know can\'t end happily for everyone, and a tone that makes you believe it will somehow all work out in the end.  Spoiler: it does.  Admittedly, there\'s a bit of deus ex machina to resolve one of the main subplots, but at least it has a happy ending.Overall: 6If you\'re not looking for something original, this is a fun and entertaining anime.

The only thing is Strike Witches KNOWS its audience should be primarily teen males interested in naughty outfits and some drama for their age group.  Vividred Operation appeals to the male demo with the clothes but...the drama is mostly light and feels like it appeals it a much younger crowd, almost to the point of annoying your older viewer.

There are some ""Chinese things"" in the plot: like over the top social stereotypes and personality traits that makes me stay away of all the Chinese and Korean mangas but overall pretty fun, the plot is very sarcastic and makes fun of game-isekai plots, give it a look if you are bored, I know I\'ll check it to the end. The art is very colorful and CGI, maybe not your liking but I find it pretty cute. ', 'This is my very first chinese anime. The english name got my attention and i was bored, so i gave it a try. And well, i was not disappointed.Before i continue, a word of warning:If you are one of the guys, who grabs a pitchfork and a torch whenever you hear CGI: Dont even bother watching this!!! Its full of CGI. But if it doesnt bother you, or you are a fan of CGI then you should give it a try.Story:The MC get\'s isekai\'ed to another world. You think ""ah yes another generic isekai"" but nope! first of all its a rare form where...we have a female MC. Also she is not the hero or better said the savior, but that doesn\'t mean, that she is not the OP char. Her attitude and the sarcastic views on other isekai animes are very fun to watch. My rating for Story so far: 8/10Art:Well its CGI, either you like it or not. Here it is harmonic in his own way. So yes, you can see it is CGI, but it doesnt look as bad as in many other animes. Still im giving it just a 6/10Sound:I never was the type to judge a sound. normally i just say: not good or good. Well its not the best sound but not that bad either. im giving it 7/10Characters:Our MC Liu Yinuo is, like i said before, just fun to watch. But also her companion Tian Enya adds up to the fun. While some actions are still predictalbe the behavior of those two girls are just not what you would think of isekai\'ed characters. Wich gives the isekai genre some freshness i sometimes miss in japanese isekai anime theese days. A lot of sidechars and cute little fellas makes the whole setting even more enjoyable. So my rating is 10/10Overall:While i welcome the freshness in story and chars, i need to get used to the chinese language and the whole CGI (im not saying it is bad but just not what i am used to).

This series was a riot from start to finish in ways I did not expect and that were refreshing and new for a genre that has been redone to death.For starters, if you are a fan of gaming as well as anime, then this series has a LOT of in jokes and skits that call back to games like Assassins Creed and Zelda. Which is just fun to see despite not being particularly creative in itself. What was really creative in this show was the use of game mechanics in the show in a way you...don't see in the hundreds of game-isekais out there. One example, and minor spoiler, was a character pausing the game during a fight to use a screenshot mode to reset their character pose and velocity. Additionally, the story goes to all kinds of different game genres from Gacha to Rhythm and RPG. Really leaning hard into the world in the series being a video game.If you are a fan of the game-based-isekais like SAO, Shangri-La Frontier, or Log Horizon, then you will like this show.The CG animation improves rapidly after the first 2 episodes or so and the action is fun and fast and pretty. The jokes are unique and not overplayed. The characters are cute and have distinct personalities. Safe to say I LOVE this show.EDIT: I watched this in the JP dub. Didn't notice it was all out in Chinese until I got halfway in. No idea which is better but the JP was good imo don't see in the hundreds of game-isekais out there.

Every episode is so compact and full of details with good plot, even tho it's mostly cliche, you will feel refreshed by how they approach it.  Overall this was such an enjoyable experience it will never leave you empty after...watching it, unlike some boring isekais.  The ending was above decent, but you can't say that it was excellent.

It\'s a primarily 3DCG anime that doesn\'t take itself seriously and uses the medium to have fun.

009 Re:Cyborg,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11755/009_Re_Cyborg,"[""As a large fan of the Cyborg 009 series, this movie felt like a personal offense. The movie is a darker, 'realistic' reimagining on the series and its characters. This isn't inherently a bad thing, of course, but it comes off as following the current trend of gritty remakes instead of trying to understand its source material.The plot is confusing whether you are familiar with the show or not. It might help to be acquainted with the characters and their backstories beforehand, but the movie doesn't even try to explain its own universe. What little there is of the story is given through large, boring...exposition with nothing visually interesting happening on the screen. Questions constantly asked throughout the film are only ever answered with a character shrugging their shoulders, then are never addressed again. All of this is topped with a near comically vague ending.The art is a strange hybrid of CGI and 2D, which makes for a lot of blank staring and jerky movement. The animation is at its best when there's a lot of action going on screen - but considering RE's love for characters talking to one another about the scarce plot, satisfying fights are few and far between.As far as sound goes, this is one of the only things I don't have any real qualms with. It wasn't memorable or anything, but it wasn't terrible and at least upped the hype a little at certain points in the film.As far as the characters go in this movie, they themselves are not bad. What is bad, however, is their treatment. Jet has been turned into an extreme asshole with far worse of an attitude than we've ever seen before, and has lost his defining physical features. Francoise meanwhile has been shoehorned into a sex symbol being the series only main female character, complete with a pointless, uncomfortably long scene of her in lingerie making out with Joe. There's not much to say about the other characters, as they didn't get much screen time.All in all, I'm giving this movie a 1 for all around poor story, poor animation, and poor characters. Perhaps watch it if you're looking for something hilariously bad and confusing, but otherwise I recommend you skip it entirely. exposition with nothing visually interesting happening on the screen.

Yet in Cyborg 009's case things are different. The classic manga of Ishinomori sensei has three anime adaptations and even more movies. Is like the anime industry wants to introduce to every new generation this classic  story. I myself have watched the 2001 version when I was a kid and I can say in a way that I grew up with it. I recently watched...it again to remember those times and then watch this movie. Well I can say that the results didn't dissapointed me at all.The story in this movie has a lot of changes than the anime. Actually this movie is loosely based on Ishinomori's epic. This happened because this movie had a big problem. How could it to introduce to teenagers nowadays who grew up with fast paced anime, with lots of gore and fights like Tokyo ghoul, Naruto, Bleach and many more, a story that was written in the middle of the 70's. In order to manage this the movie ditches the somehow naive story  of the anime and takes the story's setting to today's world. I liked it that. Sure it didn't remind me at all the classic anime but as I said this is  mostly a try to introduce the story to teenagers today. And I believe it did it very well. I had a little problem with the plot though. I would like it if it wasn't  so much Americanized. But I will explain this later. Also it isn't necessary to see the anime but I would recommend it  if you want to know some things about the characters.About the animation itself I can't find words to describe it. Production IG did a stunning job. The animation is amazing and the movie doesn't loose any opportunity to show it off in almost every scene.  I was captivated by it right from the first moment. I couldn't find any flow in it no matter how hard I tried. If I could rate it with  mark above 10 i would gladly do it. Another thing that I liked in this movie was the sound. A first class budged movie demands a first class voice actors. Mamoru Miyano, Daisuke Ono, Toru Okawa Noriaki Sugiyama and all the other seiyuus did an excellent job capturing their characters  personalities almost as good as voice actors of the 2001 anime's. Also this movie had excellent OST's and really good sound effects. For the latter you just have to listen to Ivan's voice every time he  speaks.The characters was the weakest link of this movie.  Because the characters  wouldn't appeal to the teenagers with their obsolete 70's animation changes were made not only in their design (which was fair I have to say) but mostly in their personalities.  The movie introduced the characters like they were an X-Men rip off. Because of the already mentioned Americanization  the characters were made to look like American superheroes and this way a little bit of their personalities was lost. In either way if you haven't seen any of the previews anime adaptation I don't thing you will have a big problem with this.Summarizing, I have to say that I was really pleased with this movie. It didn't looked like the anime series at all but I don't think this was a problem. It did a fairly good job at introducing Joe and the others in the new generation. I'm really curious to see if there's gonna be another adaptation. Who knows maybe in a decade or so we will see a crossover between between the 00 cyborgs and X-men.

As a fan of the 2001 series since childhood and a great admirer of the studio which worked on this (Production I.G., who are responsible for such wonderful series as Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex) I expected great things from this darker, more realistic take on the classic franchise. Sadly, despite a promising start and beautiful animation, the film falls flat on its\' face, resulting in something which may be worth watching once, but which cannot stand up to even the most cursory analysis.It would...be terribly easy to blame this film\'s failings as yet another example of why remaking children\'s series as ""dark"" and ""gritty"" doesn\'t work, but to do that would be to disrespect the source material. Why Ishinomori\'s manga and the preceding anime series were definitely goofy, there has always been an undercurrent of mystery and intrigue to them that is very compatible with darker tones. Sadly, the writer of this film seems to have confused ""dark"" with ""unnecessarily confusing"" and ""intelligent"" with ""random statements about God with no connecting thread"".The plot is, for one thing, completely impenetrable to new viewers. If one is not already familiar with the franchise, this film offers only a few badly-executed lines of exposition to explain to you who exactly thesecharacters are, and does even less to show why you should care about them. This would not be so much of a problem if the premise of the filmand it\'s status as a stand-alone universe within the Cyborg 009 canon didnot seem to set it up as a jumping-on point for new viewers. The maincharacter begins the film with amnesia for god\'s sake, and yet he regainshis memories incredibly unceremoniously, without even the briefest offlashbacks to hint at his origins. Instead, this is infodumped to you almosthalfway through the film, at which point it might have been better not to mention it at all.For all the story\'s numerous failings and it\'s failure to highlight whatmakes these characters interesting, the film at least looks good. Surprisingly, even someone like me who is normally squeamish about CGI mixing with 2D animation, the action sequences are not only dynamic but fluid in a way thatevokes the best of action cinema, making full use of the cyborgs\' fantastic powers. Of particular note is the film\'s rendition of Jet Link, who visually putsall previous incarnations of the character to shame. A pity the same can\'t be said for his personality.Overall, I would recommend this movie most to people who have not interest whatsoever in the source material, but who appreciate good fightchoreography and beautiful animation.

I haven't watched the original 009 series which was aired before i was even born but I have watched the 2001 remake when it aired in my country. I have forgotten most of the storyline but I do remember bits and pieces and the feeling that I had when watching it. Cyborg 009 (2001) was possibly the second anime I watched and it was absolutely stunning! at that time. My review down below is taking into consideration what I felt when I first watched the series.When I watched the movie I was initially excited...at the way they had changed the character designs and added a touch of freshness.For those of you who have already watched any of the previous series, NOSTALGIA IS ILL ADVISED. Yes, the characters are a bit nostalgic, yes the action is a bit nostalgic and yes, the overhaul with CG looks amazing initially BUT here are somethings you may not swallow very well. (Forgive me if they seem irate.)One, I may not remember the 2001 series that well but I most certainly definitely absolutely remember it was lucid and simple plot that my childish brain could follow with ease. Okay, so that generation is all grown up and needs adult material, alright... BUT that does not mean you should make it into some freakin' goddamn Evangelion plot with HIS voice governing all. Yeah, yeah I know you don't give a damn about God but why use it just to give your plot some pseudo-intellectual pseudo-religious air. I mean was 009 ever this psychological?! Hell no. WTF is Freud doing in a sci-fi, battle anime which was much better without that complex mind-curdling crap.If i want to watch psychological complexity and Freud's theories I'd  much rather watch Evangelion and Ergo Proxy. They just ruined a totally fine storyline because they couldn't come with an antithesis? Man, I'm beyond words at this.Two, the characters. Well given the short timespan, they did a fine job at introducing the characters. But they cannot be fleshed out as well as they were in the series. The sense of familiarity is reduced because the characters hardly get much time except 009 of course. The rest have to spew the stupid psychological shit in the extremely limited time they get. I'm wondering if they forgot about half of the team less than halfway through the movie. But well I liked Joe and Francoise, and their little eyecandy, so ok...Third, the art and animation. In my view it is clearly rushed and subpar. If they think that CG can make it astounding they are so wrong. The character designs are more elaborate but not well rounded. The animation is clearly so stiff that I am thoroughly disappointed. This possibly due to overuse of CG in every aspect. Guess they didn't want much fine-tuned work on it eh? But the backgrounds and special effects are done quite well.If you can get past all of those this movie is enjoyable enough. The action scenes are fine and the sound tracks are good. For someone like me who was a big fan of the original series, it is enjoyable even if a turnoff.Bottomline, Rushed anime, Altered plot, Unneeded improvisation but worth a watch.LOL  I seem really sarcastic here.

I loved how the cover looked and as soon as I got home I watched it. Sadly, I became instantly disappointed.The art was entirely CG with a weird outline of 2D thrown in. It was very off putting but I hoped the plot made up for it. The plot itself was very confusing and if it wasn\'t for the little guidebook they put in with the DVD combo pack I would be soooo lost. The fact that they have to...put a guidebook with all the characters backgrounds, the vital plot points, and all the cities that\'s in it, is just a testament to how confusing this movie was.

I mean seriously, what do you expect from the studio who made Ghost in the Shell?When I start to watch this movie, or any of these movies, I try to keep an open mind so that my judgement wouldn't be clouded by what...the series previous has shown. Especially for this one since people either thought this was a clever way of introducing the series to a newer audience or hated it for how gritty it is was.But let’s look at the good parts first.The action scenes in this movie are incredible. The CGI really does the work as the scenes looks much grander and more detailed than any other of the movies. Even if the CGI is used much during the movie, it ties in and doesn't become too distracting.As for the design, I like it. It fits with the mood well. Sure it doesn't look too cartoonish, but same time, it doesn't look too realistic. It’s a nice blend between those elements and the design does make the cyborgs look like real people, which is an achievement in itself.Now what about story and the characters? Well, if you expect this movie to be similar to the other movies I’ve reviewed, then you’re mistaken.I think there are two problems that people mostly see in this movie. One is that this movie is much darker than the other movies. And two, that this doesn't have much chemistry between most the members.People may argu that this movie is too dark and too psychological for the series, but if you have ever read the God War arc, then you know it’s not true. So it’s not about “if they can embrace darker themes”, but more “how they embrace it”. I mean, gritty remakes or re-imaging have been executed quite well. But there’s always a problem that it might not represent the original or keep it spirit alive, and here, it’s close to that problem.As for the characters, this movie felt like the watchmen all over again, with all the character questioning their moral and ending up fighting against one another. Even if this is a remake of the God arc, I wouldn't really call this a remake, as it feels like it’s already been built on a establish version.  Which why newer audience might not see the cyborgs much as a good team.Not to mention that all the character doesn't seem to have a fully develop personalities or have the time to do so. You will understand when you watch it. But for those who does have the time, it really contrasts on how much mature and serious the characters are from their counterparts. For example, 003 and 009 had a more innocent relationship in the first three movies. They are holding hands and hug each other times to time, showing it off in the most kid friendly way. But here, they DEFIANTLY have a sexual thing for each other. No use of hiding it, these two have gone beyond the first base. If you know what I mean.And for once, they even discuss the consequences of never ageing. Which is again very fitting and should be brought up as 009 always remain as a teen throughout the years.It might be going too much, but I think that the way the character acts are very fitting for a group who has been separated for years and been living in a grey yet subtle world.But what is not subtle is the symbolism. Religious symbolism is at full force in this movie, and it can get very tedious. It’s everywhere. Now I know that this is Production I.G. we are talking about, who usually show off their philosophical pattering thought Sci-Fi films. But I think they might could had been more subtle like they did in Ghost in the shell and not as hammered in.The antagonist in this movie, unlike the rest of the movies before, is actually an intimidating. Unlike Black Ghost who answered to all evil in heart of men, and Zoa who wanted to rule over the universe, “His voice” is a concept of justice and purity that could strike anyone. It could turn anyone who hears it be loyal to its bidding and commit horrible acts without them releasing it. That, is a scary concept as it has no specific form or shape. Although the pronoun game is very strong in this movie, the force seems to be one of the most powerful things that the Cyborgs has ever faced.As I said before, this movie isn't as light-hearted as the other movies. I will not further spoil this movie or bring up any other plot element, as it has to be seen to believe. Especially the ending, which is open to interpretation.People may be pissed off since they have been attached to the TV series, but I think it was worth it to see how the same concept could be handled with much darker. Beside, this is an adaptation of an unfinished arc which was supposed to be the last of the Cyborgs, so it might not be too bad as people claim it to be. But still, this movie has some flaws that won’t satisfy the fans.For me, you need to be in a right mood to watch it. Don’t expect this to be much of the traditional cyborg stuff. I mean, THIS MOVIE OPENS UP WITH SUIDICE BOMBING, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IT TO BE?Watch it if you want to see more mature Cyborgs being hunted by angels from the unknown. the series previous has shown. Especially for this one since people either thought this was a clever way of introducing the series to a newer audience or hated it for how gritty it is was.But let’s look at the good parts first.The action scenes in this movie are incredible. The CGI really does the work as the scenes looks much grander and more detailed than any other of the movies. Even if the CGI is used much during the movie, it ties in and doesn't become too distracting.As for the design, I like it. It fits with the mood well. Sure it doesn't look too cartoonish, but same time, it doesn't look too realistic. It’s a nice blend between those elements and the design does make the cyborgs look like real people, which is an achievement in itself.Now what about story and the characters? Well, if you expect this movie to be similar to the other movies I’ve reviewed, then you’re mistaken.I think there are two problems that people mostly see in this movie. One is that this movie is much darker than the other movies. And two, that this doesn't have much chemistry between most the members.People may argu that this movie is too dark and too psychological for the series, but if you have ever read the God War arc, then you know it’s not true. So it’s not about “if they can embrace darker themes”, but more “how they embrace it”. I mean, gritty remakes or re-imaging have been executed quite well. But there’s always a problem that it might not represent the original or keep it spirit alive, and here, it’s close to that problem.As for the characters, this movie felt like the watchmen all over again, with all the character questioning their moral and ending up fighting against one another. Even if this is a remake of the God arc, I wouldn't really call this a remake, as it feels like it’s already been built on a establish version.  Which why newer audience might not see the cyborgs much as a good team.Not to mention that all the character doesn't seem to have a fully develop personalities or have the time to do so. You will understand when you watch it. But for those who does have the time, it really contrasts on how much mature and serious the characters are from their counterparts. For example, 003 and 009 had a more innocent relationship in the first three movies. They are holding hands and hug each other times to time, showing it off in the most kid friendly way.

So this is definitely the easiest way to get it. (3.5 GB needed)If it weren't for the story, everything would be wonderful. The art and animation both make use of 3-D and 2-D blending. The colors are vibrant, and I can see what's going on. They went out of their way to make the VA have non-stereotypical accents native to their country, which is a nice touch on the dubbing I had only previously seen with Unbreakable Machine Doll. (Though I kept the expecting the 2001 VA) It's why I gave...the sound a 10.The story... however, is a deep, philosophical rambling about what induced man to have a God and bombings.I feel like the the writers wrote a script for 2 1/2-3 hour epic, but as scenes got cut, the meanings of the remaining scenes got left behind, resulting in so much loss of context that the writers lost touch with what the viewer would be seeing. Alright, yeah, it makes sense... because this deleted scene or what was on the chopping board.Couldn't it have been just your general 'remnants of Black Ghost'? Throw in some flashbacks and the characters are instantly so much more relatable, and I become invested in them that much more.And unless you know about the original shooting star ending that the original manga intended to end on, then the ending sorta doesn't mean anything. the sound a 10.The story... however, is a deep, philosophical rambling about what induced man to have a God and bombings.I feel like the the writers wrote a script for 2 1/2-3 hour epic, but as scenes got cut, the meanings of the remaining scenes got left behind, resulting in so much loss of context that the writers lost touch with what the viewer would be seeing.

However, at its time of airing it had a lot of relevance, mainly due to the historical context of the Cold War and political climate, something this movie failed to include when adapting it for the current generation. Buildings being bombed in the name of God... it sure does seem like a subject that could make a point of modern terrorism and politics, but instead it turns into a pseudo-philosophical quest to search for God.The villain of the movie is illogical on every level. While the series...had a running theme of questioning religion and often exposing them as frauds, this story instead decides to portray God as a real tangible thing, and not just as a tool used by humans to control the masses. I do not dislike it for being different, I am calling it out for going against the main themes of the franchise to the point that it might as well have been called something else.I like the new designs of the characters, it is a shame they weren't given more time to shine. I'm aware that they could not have fleshed them all out on such limited time, but I believe they still could have made them work together more often, rather than just make Joe the Tom Cruise of the team.It had a few action-scenes of note that I enjoyed, though they are few and far between, and finally the ending is nonsensical cop-out.

Although I want to rectify this, I don\'t really have a good eye for animation details. So while the spirit is willing the eye-flesh is ... uhh ... what\'s the visual equivalent of tone-deaf? Art-blind? Anyway, despite my art-blind eye-flesh, occasionally I find myself gravitating towards an anime because of some awesome visuals.And that\'s what happened in the case of ""009 Re:Cyborg"", which, despite having heard that the story makes no sense, I\'ve been wanting to see ever since I was...blown away by the visuals in the trailer.It turned out to be more or less as expected. The movie\'s most striking aspect is the animation, which is entirely CG. People in the fandom tend to praise CG in anime in much the same way as people in the health industry like to extol the virtues of smoking, but I think in the case of ""009 Re:Cyborg"", the CG is closer to eye candy than eye cancer. Admittedly, some of the movements still look a bit synthetic, but I love the character designs, and the action is spectacular.The action sequences are the best part of ""009: Re-Cyborg"". The movie\'s action set pieces made superb use of the CG capabilities, blowing me away with special effects such as the matrix-esq slow motion shots. These sequences are further enhanced by the throbbing techno music that wove a montage-like tapestry of sound in the background, its release of melodies timed carefully to the choreography and its ebb and flow orchestrating the ease and build-up of tension as one scene segued seamlessly into the next. The trailer actually managed to capture a lot of what made the action so good, and that played a big part in persuading me to watch the movie.I couldn\'t get enough of the action, so it\'s a little unfortunate that ""009 Re:Cyborg"" is not a particularly action-heavy movie; it\'s arguably more driven by the mystery and intrigue. So let\'s talk about the elephant in the room when it comes to this anime - the story.First, a bit of background: the 00 cyborgs are a team of nine cyborgs led by a human scientist Dr Gilmore. Like a team of superheroes, they originally fought various threats to the world, but ""009 Re:Cyborg"" takes place many years after the team disbanded. In this story, Dr Gilmore tries to bring the team together again to counter a new threat: the destruction of high rises in large metropolises around the world, carried out by terrorists following the orders of ""His Voice"".From what I\'ve heard, the original ""Cyborg 009"" was the product of the social political climate of its time, so it\'s fitting that the remake also reflects the anxieties of the world we live in today - the relevant topic this time round being terrorism.Given what I\'d heard about the movie beforehand, I found to my surprise that most of this movie seems to make sense. As someone who knew little of the back stories, I thought it did a good job of supplying the necessary background without getting bogged down by exposition. I also appreciated its commentary on terrorism and the roles that religion, greed and politics play in its inception.However, as it went on, ""009 Re:Cyborg"" increasingly obsessed over its religious themes to the detriment of everything else in the story. So much so that I started feeling like I was witnessing a religious fanatic having a revelation: perhaps it all makes sense to them, but to me it just comes across like incomprehensible madness. This downward trend accumulates in an ending that had me head scratching to the point of severe hair loss. Besides eliciting responses like ""what the fuck just happened,"" it\'s an ending of such colossal magnitude of deus ex machina that it makes most other such endings look like ones borne of natural plot progression.In the end, that somewhat ruined ""009 Re:Cyborg"" for me. Still, I don\'t regret watching the movie - it was worth it just for the visuals. After all, once in a while even art-blind eyes can enjoy eye candy.

Personally speaking, I actually loved this anime. I actually find it to be a really well thought out movie which introduced a new viewer to the series itself.StoryThe thing which made this anime standout, for me, was how the anime itself addressed the question of ""His Voice"", and actually carried itself not just that as a plot device, but also the in-anime presentation to proceed with the anime...itself. The perspective given by ""His Voice""; as explained in the movie, was not only sufficient (for me as a first time viewer) to appreciate the story as well as give an interesting philosophical perspective on its origins. Yes, there is a cliffhanger ending in terms of HOW the characters - Gilmour, Joe, GB, Palma, Henrick, Jumani, Francoise, 001 and Jeb - wound up in the ending, but for me it certainly provided room for perspective and ascertainment of what could be the possible causes of it. If anything else, the story was handled well and used its characters, art, and sound well.ArtPersonally, I found this anime to be gorgeous. The use of CGI may be slammed in general by anime fans - but then again, anime fans love Naruto which is a shitty anime. It was realistic enough in its textures and detailing of the characters, as well as their environment. Addition to this was the subtlety that was imbued through the anime to portray the emotions and general feelings and thoughts going through the minds of the characters - supporting, main, and NPCs alike. What\'s more, it gave the action more depth and involvement and frankly, I couldn\'t fault it in any form or way and find it surprising that people would slam it. The subtlety in each scene is integral and adds to the viewing pleasure of this anime movie.SoundThe best way to experience this movie, is through the English dub. The acting in the dub represents all the characters well and all of the standout. Granted, there could be raised the concern regarding the soundtrack, but personally I overlooked it because it matched the mood which was needed in each and every scene. Furthermore, the anime in its quiet moments added to the feel and the character arcs of each of the cast, which makes it as good as it can get for 2012. Kudos for a good job.CharacterPerhaps the single biggest facet for me to watch this anime was the characters - I really do feel like investing myself in the 009 anime series to know the characters and their back stories. Even if I didn\'t know that, I found the characters were likeable, and I could relate with their struggles as a viewer. Everyone did a good job and fulfilled their roles well, even providing a realistic representation of how they would act if put in such a situation which is unfolded in the story.Overall, I found this anime to be a significantly better and more satisfying and entertaining sit than the crappy Sengoku Basara, and makes me feel satisfied enough to want to know the series more.

Prior knowledge would help greatly and help understand the background and relationships of the characters a lot more but most certainly is not a requirement.One of the elements i enjoyed most about this movie was its sound. Everything from the music to the sound effects to the voice acting, very easy on the ears in all respects. One thing i can’t stand is when a simple explosion feels wrong because it sound like nails on a chalkboard. I can only imagine...how good it must sound in a theatre.Coming from the studio and director of GiTS SAC/SSS you can certainly expect high production values and the art and animation definitely have some GiTS vibes and as much as the sound was pleasurable to the ears, the art is most pleasurable to the eyes.So are you looking for an action sci-fi movie with mecha elements? Then do not over look this one. It even has a little romance too which i love to have in a mostly action movie/series. how good it must sound in a theatre.Coming from the studio and director of GiTS SAC/SSS you can certainly expect high production values and the art and animation definitely have some GiTS vibes and as much as the sound was pleasurable to the ears, the art is most pleasurable to the eyes.So are you looking for an action sci-fi movie with mecha elements?

I've watched the older series of Cyborg 009 so I was going into this with some expectations. Some were met, with others I was left a bit more disappointed. Initially I was a bit more suspicious that this Anime movie was 3D but I'd say it nailed it better than some Anime do these days. I was quite sad that they changed the iconic design of Jet though which made him feel like an entirely new character and that might have just influenced my opinion quite a bit since he was...my favorite from all Cyborgs. On the brighter side the ship between Joe and Francoise was more or less made official in this movie.Most interesting for me was the concept of the voice of God in this movie although due to it only being a movie, the topic sadly couldn't be explored any deeper, something I would have hoped for. The ending of the movie didn't satisfy me for that reason as much since I was hoping for more and felt slightly confused with the final explanation of everything.This is it for my first review, I hope that I could be of help to anyone who wants to decide whether or not to give this movie a try or not. my favorite from all Cyborgs.
