One Piece: Dai Tettei Kaibou! Kouzuki Oden Densetsu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52199/One_Piece__Dai_Tettei_Kaibou_Kouzuki_Oden_Densetsu,"[""Yet another Wano recap, I guess, if Dressrosa went down as being THE filler arc, Wano might just be remembered by the sheer amount of recap specials that interrupted some of the best highs of any arcs.Ranting aside, this is was a nice quick recap that went through Oden's flashback in a single 24 minutes episode. I see how frustrating this is in a weekly or binge context, however, if you've been away from the series for a while and that happened around the act 2-3 period, this recap will do wonders to refresh some of the highlights of Oden's flashback.

I was entering user profiles here in MAL and saw in the favorites of a user, then I went looking for subtitles but only found dubbed in my language (Brazilian Portuguese).This anime is extremely stupid and full of black humor. In my language dub it is full of swear words, which makes everything funnier. I usually don't like this kind of anime that much, but it was funny to watch because of the dubbing. It was compiled on YouTube all episodes in one video, 01:30:00 in total, and I watched it all at once.It was an anime...that most of the comedy was funny, I really laughed at so many stupid things that are in this anime.The characters of this anime that is funny, because one is more idiotic than the other.It is a full non-sense comedy anime that was funny to watch.

Ni Zhuan Ci Yuan: AI Jue Qi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40823/Ni_Zhuan_Ci_Yuan__AI_Jue_Qi,"[""Reversal Dimension - Rise of AI RecapReversal Dimension follows the duo Shi Jiajie and Xiao Lei, runaways that live in an abandoned factory in the slums; Their livelihood is playing VR games with hacks until they get a mysterious package shipped to them with the full-dive VR headset of trending MMORPG Epoch. Unbeknownst to them, Shi Jiajie and Xiao Lei have just activated a trojan virus in the headset that infiltrates the servers and supposedly gives the AI awareness. The AI 'god' overlooking Epoch has the ability to trap humans in the game world and steal their bodies when they are killed in the game...world. Shi Jiajie's headset is modified so it has authority to the 'key' - an administrator privilege to add and remove anything in the game world. In order to save his beloved and everyone in the game, Shi Jiajie has to make compromises with the AI characters in Epoch.Story: 5/10The story is actually really well executed; It follows game mechanics much better than SAO and has a logical reason to why humans are stuck in a game world. However, I feel like the decision to drag the series to get a sequel really screwed with the ending. Throughout the series Shi Jiajie is chased by Xiao Zhiyao* because of the trojan virus and it doesn't get revealed until later that AI try to save him by diverting his path. In the beginning, an AI in hellish clothing tries to recruit Shi Jiajie in the shadiest way and it isn't until Xiao Zhiyao shows up that he wants to kill Shi Jiajie - The evil-looking sect leader turns out to be an AI; It happens again when Shi Jiajie is about to enter the tournament and is instead sent to an underground prison by the AI girl that entered him into the tournament. Finally, we have the shadiest character - an AI girl with blue hair that tries to control the group situation at every corner in order to save other AI characters, it seems like the moment Shi Jiajie stepped into the game world the AI gained awareness. It could have ended in episode 12 if they skipped all the unnecessary fighting because we know that they (the main chars) will be saved by some plot armor if they lose.Art & Sound: 7/10 & 6/10The art and animation of this series was pretty high quality with the hair and clothing physics. Some settings have terribly low quality though, like the chase scene with Shi Jiajie and Xiao Lei  where the background is just low poly blocks colored in grey to represent buildings.The VA was above average, same with the sound effects and background music.Character: 6/10Character development felt rushed in the beginning with Shi Jiajie and the redhair female MC. They trust each other pretty fast despite Shi Jiajie being wanted and she monopolizes on that fact and the fact that he's weak to control him - It isn't until she realizes why he's being chased yet she still does nothing about it and instead continues with whatever he says. That lack of reasoning is why we are left with odd character development; The romance or character conflict feels superficial as a result.Enjoyment & Overall: 6/10I did enjoy this if I turned off my brain and let the series do its thing. Realistically, it does have a lot of plot holes and rushed char development but the story itself is well structured and deserving of a 6/10 - above average rating. world.

Characters are trapped and it is turned into a death game. The characters designs are nice, and though the animation (especially for the action scenes) are nice, they are a bit mismatched with the scale of some of the fights. I kind of understand why though, since character attack animations don\'t really fit all that well when compared to bosses...that are 10x bigger than them. Other than this, there are some big problems with the plot. Everything feels to convenient and even when the MC asks poignant questions, they just get ignored. While the ""villains"" or ""PK players"" are realistic to a certain degree, the donghua rarely questions any irrational actions of characters or people given the very unexpected situation they are in. There is also the mismatched skill of the MC. He somehow grows to be able to compete with high level characters when he\'s been stuck in the game for only a few days? What?Overall, an nice watch, but not very deep. It\'s suitable for entertainment, but leaves much to be designed in terms of story. that are 10x bigger than them.

Queen's Blade: Gyokuza wo Tsugu Mono,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6633/Queens_Blade__Gyokuza_wo_Tsugu_Mono,"[""So Queen's Blade is back with a second season. If you watched the horrendous first season, you're probably doubting whether you should start Gyokuza wo Tsugu Mono or not. Even I have to admit that I put off starting this season because I didn't want to sit through another 12 episodes of a jumbled up story that relied purely on fanservice. Thankfully, this is nothing like season 1. Pretty much the only similarity between season 1 and season 2 is that there's still an insane amount of fanservice. But Queen's Blade now isn't an anime that you want to laugh at for being so bad....Gyokuza wo Tsugu Mono is...actually pretty good.Story: 8/10Instead of an almost episodic plot containing random fights that didn't help progression at all, this season has a solid storyline. Every episode, two Queen's Blade contestants battle it out, and one, of course, is eliminated. Progressing through this kind of story makes it tremendously better and enjoyable, because you're not just focused on Reina and the girls who want in her pants the whole time. Throughout each and every episode, you get a sprinkle of a lot of characters doing a ton of different things, which I believe is one of the biggest reasons why this season's story is great.Art: 8/10No, I'm not giving this a high score just for the boobs and ass (although the girls are admittedly super hot, which is obviously good for an ecchi anime). One of the best things about the art is that the story is actually set in a Medieval world this time around. I really adore the styles that were in the Medieval times, so I appreciate the gorgeous detail in the backgrounds and such to make it actually look like it belongs in that era.Sound: 9/10Queen's Blade has outdone itself again. I fell in love with the soundtrack for Rurou no Senshi immediately. Surprisingly enough, I like Gyokuza wo Tsugu Mono's soundtrack even more. The opening is a beautiful piece of work, while the ending is upbeat and fun to listen to. Voice acting is fantastic as always. Voice acting was phenomenal, which is something I didn't expect out of a show that prides itself on fanservice. There was a particular scene where Tomoe cried out in despair, and to this day I remember it giving me a humongous chill. I'm still shocked that a simple scene in Queen's Blade actually made me shiver just because of the incredible voice acting. I'd also like to note that Miyu Takeuchi's voice was simply perfect for Aldra.Character: 8/10Thank God, Reina isn't just an annoying idiot anymore! You can tell how much she matured, and it's great. I found myself rooting for her this time, while last season there were plenty times where I wished she would die and Tomoe would take the spot as the main character. Reina isn't the only one who matured-- Tomoe ends up growing up due to an unexpected twist, Listy...well, Listy has something that happens to her that I can't say without spoiling, Nanael is still Nanael except a little (and I only mean a little) less stupid, and even Claudette becomes a likeable character since she's not a humongous bitch anymore. The characters aren't just certain stereotypes put in to please viewers, they actually have their own personalities now.Enjoyment: 7/10Even though the fanservice is still off the scale, I can't help but like this series. As a straight girl, I can't say the nudity really did anything for me, but it also didn't dampen my enjoyment of the show either. Most importantly, this season renewed my faith in Queen's Blade. Instead of dropping it after trudging through the two seasons like I initially thought I'd be doing, I definitely plan to watch any future installments.Overall: 8/10If you're hesitating to watch this because you're thinking that it may be as atrocious as the first season, please give it a try. You'll see the vast difference after watching just one episode, and I'm sure you'll appreciate Gyokuza wo Tsugu Mono regardless of whether you liked Rurou no Senshi or not.

Granted, there are LOTS and LOTS of fanservice (weird camera angles, jumping breasts, ripped clothes and suggestive poses), but if you don't mind fanservice (or if you even embrace it!) and give season 2 a chance, you'll see there are a lot of things that makes it worth to watch.The story continues right where it was left on season 1 and the Queen's Blade tournament finally gets to its final stages. There...are many characters with their backstories being told or expanded. Also, there are many cool matches during the tournament and Aldra's (the current Queen) role makes the whole thing much more interesting. The overall atmosphere in this season feels much more medieval and fitting to the tone the show wants to set. It is worth to mention that Reina's character improves A LOT! I point this out since I believe she was one of the main reasons why I couldn't completely enjoy season 1, but after watching season 2, it all makes sense.I don't wanna give any specific spoilers, so I will just say you shouldn't expect characters to be as shallow as in the first season since everyone has a role to play in the plot. So just give it a try and hopefully you'll love this season as much as I do! are many characters with their backstories being told or expanded.

Well, okay, that might be a bit hyperbolic on my end. Nevertheless, when your expectations aren’t exactly that high for an anime of this genre that usually ends up falling flat on its face, you can’t help but commend it for sticking out above the rest.Now I am not saying Queen’s Blade’s second season, subtitled Gyokuza wo Tsugu Mono (Inheritor of the Throne), is not without its flaws within its plot. It still suffers from the previous season, where there...are so many characters in the show that you wished would have been explored more or given more screen time (my girl Menace deserves more love, dammit!). I’m hopeful that the 3rd season will fix this issue. There is also a new element of melodrama in parts of the story that does get a little overbearing to take seriously. There are instances where it does work involving the character Cattleya and her husband. How Leina and Ritsu resolve their conflict in the 2nd to the last episode was quite touching based on the circumstances. However, the one instance where it doesn’t work is when one character dies. They pummel the emotion to the ground to make you feel a strong emotional response, but something that tragic in an anime like this felt forced and too overblown.Despite all of that, the story has many aspects that they improved from the 1st season. They focus on a plot point that impacts all of the other characters without unnecessary deviations from it. That way, I can easily remember the overall narrative focus without being distracted by sub-plots that do not have anything to do with the main story. The story involves all of the beautiful female fighters who want to be the Queen’s Blade to fulfill their common goals. Pretty simple but sweet to the point. The first season had this same plot, but I felt more emotionally involved due to the stakes being put in place.Everyone who has watched Queen’s Blade says the same thing: Airi is the best girl. While I wouldn’t necessarily say she is my top favorite, Menace, the thicc queen is still my bae. This season showed me why a lot of people love her. It does help that Kanae Itou voices her, and any cutie she voices automatically gets my undivided attention. But she does have a nice well-rounded personality that makes her distinct from the rest of the girls. I thought her relationship with Cattleya’s son, Lana, was really cute and sweet.  Seeing how she grows from a demon only wanting power for the Queen’s Blade title to being a caring big sister type to an innocent little boy she has no relation with. It gives her a three-dimensional growth as a character from this sub-plot.Other characters do get more backstory and time to develop than their debut in the 1st season. For instance, Cattleya and her son are treated with a nice story, helping Leina achieve her goal and involving Cattleya’s husband, which is quite effective. Not to mention Nanael is still as perky and hilarious as ever, thanks in no part to Aya Hirano’s great performance as her. And the fact that they give Nanael something more to work with rather than be this side character is a major plus. As I have said before, I can only hope that with the 3rd season on the horizon, I can get a better feel for the girls that didn’t get as much love. I mean, when Irma and Echnida get less screen love than Ymir, that is a really big issue, in my opinion.I must mention that I did not harp on from my review of the 1st season was the music. For some reason, the music on this season left a big impact while watching compared to the previous one. It is one of those soundtracks that you listen to outside the context of the anime and not even think it's part of some “trashy tiddie anime.” Also, the EDs for this season are now among my top favorite EDs ever. There are three different ones in random order. Each involves the three demon girls, Airi, Melona, and Menace. The fun, jazzy instrumentation, hilarious and sexy lyrics, and the great performances by the Rie Kugimiya, Kanae Itou, and Yuuko Gotou make this one of the few EDs I never skip after an episode was over. The animation of the EDs is also quite sexy and funny to look at, although Menace’s walking animation and pose were really weird to look at.Queen’s Blade: Gyokuza wo Tsugu Mono is a big improvement. I have gone through this Queen’s Blade marathon, and I am optimistic that things can only get better or just as good from here. I’m not expecting anything groundbreaking to happen, but when my lewdness intensifies with each passing episode, that is groundbreaking enough to make me happy.Grade: B+ are so many characters in the show that you wished would have been explored more or given more screen time (my girl Menace deserves more love, dammit!).

It was viewed with English voice overs.""Queen\'s Blade: The Evil Eye"" falls into the category of fantasy action adventure with a significant degree of ecchi content.  It is the sequel to “Queen’s Blade: The Exiled Virgin” (Queen’s Blade: Rurou no Senshi).Parental Advisory:The age rating on the Blu-ray packaging is listed as ""16 AND OLDER"" while some other sites including this one list it at 17+.   Scenes with female topless nudity occur in every episode....Some episodes feature very suggestive poses or actions as well, but nothing overly graphic.  The fantasy outfits that some of the females wear have little beyond the equivalent of thongs for their lower region, and copious amounts of skin are displayed often.  There is combat violence in several episodes, and some deaths occur, but it isn\'t overly graphic.Very brief history of the Queen\'s Blade characters:When watching or reviewing Queen’s Blade, it\'s important to realize that this series did not take a traditional route from manga to anime.  Queen\'s Blade started out as a series of game books and a popular line of PVC figures before that.Story: 7/10The show spans 12 episodes.  While the original series introduced the contestants and covered the events on the way to the tournament in the capital city of Gainos, this series focuses on the Queen’s Blade tournament and some other events transpiring simultaneously.  The first episode is a bit of a throw-away, as it spends a significant amount of time re-explaining information from the original series, and then focuses on the women finding lodging in the city.  However, after this, the action heats up quickly, and most episodes feature one or more Queen’s Blade battles.  Some of the combats are a bit predictable, but there are several surprises along the way.  The episodes also show some behind the scenes actions taken by various characters while fights are transpiring or during the downtime between the battles.The story in “Queens Blade: The Evil Eye” is significantly better than the simple, sometimes thread-bare tale that formed the basis for the original series.  There are some unexpected character developments along the way.  Some characters that were enemies in the past are forced to team up, and in a couple of cases, allies become enemies.  The banter between some of the characters is very well-done, and the interaction between some of the combatants is very entertaining.Nanael has a different role, now being a contestant rather than some kind of referee.  This role suits her much better, and allows her serve as more than just comedy relief.  Instead, multiple characters provide bits of comedy during this series.There are some weaknesses in the story.  At one point, Echidna is identified as one of the remaining characters vying for the title, but then she suddenly seems to be forgotten.  The only plausible explanation is that she pulled herself out of the tournament due to some of the events that affect her and another character, but this is not clarified.  After seeming to be built up as one of the stronger competitors in the early episodes, her absence in the later episodes seems like a glaring oversight.  In addition, the Swamp Witch is never shown, so we never get any more insight into the character that sent the trio of Airi, Melona and Menace to enter the battle.Characters: 8/10Some of what I wrote in my review of the first series is still applicable for this sequel:The ""Queens Blade"" characters are among some of the most strikingly beautiful women to appear in anime.  Although a few characters are younger, most of them appear to be adults, and the artwork and animation captures this very well.   The outfits most of them wear are extremely skimpy, but most of these match the armors depicted in the original game books.  As a result, I give them very high marks for staying true to the original source material.Anyone that doesn\'t understand the reasons for fantasy-based outfits existing in a fantasy world should probably stay away.  Please find a documentary on the history channel about period armors if that\'s what you\'re looking for.  This isn\'t it.The series introduces a few new characters, such as Aldra and Nyx.  While Aldra is a potent villain, Nyx seems to serve little purpose beyond comedy relief, and being an early round loser in the tournament.  I would have really liked to have seen Nyx developed more and not made into such a submissive character.Some of the characters undergo significant changes from the first series.  As mentioned, Nanael is now a contestant.  Risty undergoes a drastic change and becomes a key character in the later episodes.  Meanwhile, Airi and Melona also end up changing allegiances somewhat.  Several other characters show varying degrees of character growth through the series.  By the end, nearly all of them have undergone some measure of change, some much more significant than others.The series still never explains why Airi is wearing a maid outfit, nor does it explain why a specter would bother to exert energy to cover herself in such an outfit, which is apparently what Airi does - when she gets weak, her clothes become transparent layer by layer.Art / Animation: 8/10Most of the characters, and animation are extremely well-done.   The art seemed a bit weaker at times than the prior series, with slight variations to the character design, and at times, simpler animations.  Most of the fight scenes are pretty well done, but too many of them end up with the “cloud of dust” situation where the climax of combat becomes masked by effects or objects that block our view of the characters.  This is a cheap way to reduce the cost of animation, but it tends to leave the viewer unsatisfied.Similar to the prior series, the angles often emphasize showing the female characters busts or butts.  At times this can be distracting, but this is in the theme of the original game book art which tend to feature a lot of ecchi poses for the characters.Sound / Voice: 9/10The song during into credits is largely forgettable, but the rest of the audio is great.  There are different versions of songs used during the end credits, and some of those are rather cute.  The background music and sound effects during the episodes is good.  The voice acting seems to have improved as well.  I especially liked the English voice acting for Echidna and Claudette – the actresses for those do a fantastic job.Enjoyment: 10/10I was not sure if this would be able to live up to the quality of the first series, but it actually exceeded it.   Between the improved story, some key changes to characters like Nanael and Risty, and some very entertaining scenes with intriguing characters like Echidna and Claudette, there was is a lot to enjoy here.  At times, it seemed like the show might push the envelope on the ecchi content too far, yet it never crosses the line into something else.  The result is a series that does a fantastic job of capturing the Queen’s Blade characters in all their glory.Final verdict:  8/10The high amount of ecchi content may be a turn-off for some viewers, which is unfortunate.  Underneath all the eye candy lurks a very interesting and entertaining show.  I’m amazed that the outlandish Queen’s Blade characters which first debuted in game books and then in PVC statues could become brought to life in such a highly watchable and enjoyable anime.  This is a must see for fans of the Queen’s Blade franchise, and is worth seeing even for those that aren’t. Some episodes feature very suggestive poses or actions as well, but nothing overly graphic.  The fantasy outfits that some of the females wear have little beyond the equivalent of thongs for their lower region, and copious amounts of skin are displayed often.  There is combat violence in several episodes, and some deaths occur, but it isn\'t overly graphic.Very brief history of the Queen\'s Blade characters:When watching or reviewing Queen’s Blade, it\'s important to realize that this series did not take a traditional route from manga to anime.  Queen\'s Blade started out as a series of game books and a popular line of PVC figures before that.Story: 7/10The show spans 12 episodes.  While the original series introduced the contestants and covered the events on the way to the tournament in the capital city of Gainos, this series focuses on the Queen’s Blade tournament and some other events transpiring simultaneously.  The first episode is a bit of a throw-away, as it spends a significant amount of time re-explaining information from the original series, and then focuses on the women finding lodging in the city.  However, after this, the action heats up quickly, and most episodes feature one or more Queen’s Blade battles.  Some of the combats are a bit predictable, but there are several surprises along the way.  The episodes also show some behind the scenes actions taken by various characters while fights are transpiring or during the downtime between the battles.The story in “Queens Blade: The Evil Eye” is significantly better than the simple, sometimes thread-bare tale that formed the basis for the original series.  There are some unexpected character developments along the way.  Some characters that were enemies in the past are forced to team up, and in a couple of cases, allies become enemies.  The banter between some of the characters is very well-done, and the interaction between some of the combatants is very entertaining.Nanael has a different role, now being a contestant rather than some kind of referee.  This role suits her much better, and allows her serve as more than just comedy relief.  Instead, multiple characters provide bits of comedy during this series.There are some weaknesses in the story.  At one point, Echidna is identified as one of the remaining characters vying for the title, but then she suddenly seems to be forgotten.  The only plausible explanation is that she pulled herself out of the tournament due to some of the events that affect her and another character, but this is not clarified.  After seeming to be built up as one of the stronger competitors in the early episodes, her absence in the later episodes seems like a glaring oversight.  In addition, the Swamp Witch is never shown, so we never get any more insight into the character that sent the trio of Airi, Melona and Menace to enter the battle.Characters: 8/10Some of what I wrote in my review of the first series is still applicable for this sequel:The ""Queens Blade"" characters are among some of the most strikingly beautiful women to appear in anime.  Although a few characters are younger, most of them appear to be adults, and the artwork and animation captures this very well.   The outfits most of them wear are extremely skimpy, but most of these match the armors depicted in the original game books.  As a result, I give them very high marks for staying true to the original source material.Anyone that doesn\'t understand the reasons for fantasy-based outfits existing in a fantasy world should probably stay away.  Please find a documentary on the history channel about period armors if that\'s what you\'re looking for.  This isn\'t it.The series introduces a few new characters, such as Aldra and Nyx.  While Aldra is a potent villain, Nyx seems to serve little purpose beyond comedy relief, and being an early round loser in the tournament.  I would have really liked to have seen Nyx developed more and not made into such a submissive character.Some of the characters undergo significant changes from the first series.  As mentioned, Nanael is now a contestant.  Risty undergoes a drastic change and becomes a key character in the later episodes.  Meanwhile, Airi and Melona also end up changing allegiances somewhat.  Several other characters show varying degrees of character growth through the series.  By the end, nearly all of them have undergone some measure of change, some much more significant than others.The series still never explains why Airi is wearing a maid outfit, nor does it explain why a specter would bother to exert energy to cover herself in such an outfit, which is apparently what Airi does - when she gets weak, her clothes become transparent layer by layer.Art / Animation: 8/10Most of the characters, and animation are extremely well-done.   The art seemed a bit weaker at times than the prior series, with slight variations to the character design, and at times, simpler animations.  Most of the fight scenes are pretty well done, but too many of them end up with the “cloud of dust” situation where the climax of combat becomes masked by effects or objects that block our view of the characters.

I started Queen\'s Blade like 99% of everyone else: for the *assets* of the characters and the promise of some questionable interpretations of the way gravity works. I stayed because of a great cast of characters with a huge range of motivations all interacting in unique--and oftentimes hilarious--ways.The first season was a big mishmash of character introductions, like a series of early Marvel Cinematic Universe films compacted into twenty minutes and sprinkled with an overload of jiggly...ah...camera angles....But The Evil Eye brings everything together in the same way Avengers does: by playing established personalities off each other flawlessly, with loads of comedic relief and some powerful moments of gravitas.I know from experience that it takes serious skill to pull off tone shifts, but Evil Eye nails it time and again. Naneal specifically embodies what in my opinion sets this medium aside from everything else: she\'s carefree, has dubious motivations, and is driven by past failures and yet totally seizes the stage and outshines the other players by simply being herself. The fact she\'s a side character and not the protagonist really makes the interplay even better, but simultaneously she\'s written and voice acted so well she\'s more than just a joke.My ONLY issue with Evil Eye (and Exiled Virgin too) is some at-times poor, choppy animation. I presume most of the budget was directed at ""realistic"" physics of anatomy, but it should have been directed into a few more movement frames during fights and general character motion. But you can\'t have it all.I highly recommend this.

One finds most of one's questions answered by the end of the season and the story actually gains and follows a structure! Marvelous! Once again we decided to watch this one dubbed so grab your flip flops lads, it's party time.StoryIn this season we follow Laina: The Wandering Warrior on her journey to win the Queen's blade by fighting her friends without being frozen in some sort of undescribed crystal of urine. The same cannot be said for some other characters however,...opening a rather perculiar sub-plot where a demon very quickly turns to the side of good just by walking around with a child (who's entire body is smaller than his mother's boobs) for a couple of days. Not on my watch! I would have put this child in the ground as soon as he opened his mouth the cheeky brat! This demon maid and her strange comrads almost seem to be the focus of this season, recieving some solo screen time and jazzy walking in every ending. Some highlights of the story this season are evil agent Risty, sudden milk-addict Nanael, wand-tenticle rape, incest lesbian tension and straight-up nonsensical friend murdering! Spectacular!Animation and SoundThe animation this season is mostly of the same quality as season 1. A rather strange amount of money, however, seems to have been spent on the ending animations. Near-60fps cycles of characters walking can be found here, accompanied by a story-relevant monologue and some energetic jazz music. As a connoisseur of jazz, this ending really rustled my jimmies! +1 to animation from last season! One wonders whether the entire plot of Queen's Blade could be extracted from these endings, saving the audience a large amount of time while providing both the visual and audio highlghts of the entire season! Alas, these endings have not been dubbed in English, a true let down leaving me emotionally drained and close to writing a strongly-worded letter to the blu-ray distributor! Maybe even to Masahiro Sakurai himself!CharactersSeason two of Queen's blade features the same characters as season one for the most part but still manages to include a few new entries. Not that this is a bad thing of course, Ikkitousen has already shown the damage that an excess of characters can do to a show and this season we needed some fodder for Leina to defeat. Perhaps the most questionable characters introduced here are Nyx and the current Queen Aldra, two characters seemingly possessed by tentacle monsters. To seperate these characters then, something drastic needed to be done and, as a result, Aldra has a horn-penis and an eyepatch and Nyx gets raped every now and again by her magic wand. Thanks Japan!SummaryIn summary, Queen's Blade season two somehow manages to outshine the already great season one, elegantly wrapping up the deep story threads and adding jazz to the ending! Unfortunatly the season does leave a major question unanswered by the end, just who the devil is this Swamp Witch? More importantly, does she have double-Ds too? I want to meet the character that created the acid-lactating pink slime girl! I guess I'll have to wait until next season to find out... opening a rather perculiar sub-plot where a demon very quickly turns to the side of good just by walking around with a child (who's entire body is smaller than his mother's boobs) for a couple of days.

And then they fought some more oddly loquacious battles, providing the seamstress' guild with years of further employment and providing otakus around the world with a second fleet of virtual motorboats.  Ties up some loose ends, but doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense at times - but then, you're probably not turning to a story dominated by swords which mostly just cut bra straps for the compelling plot.  A pretty, though not exceptional, piece of fan service - would be more amusing if it hung a lampshade on itself and featured duels fought with scissors. "", 'This is a review of the Blu-ray version of ""Queen\'s Blade: Beautiful Warriors"" (Queen\'s Blade: Utsukushiki Toushitachi) released by Sentai Filmworks in 2014. It was viewed with English voice overs.""Queen\'s Blade: Beautiful Warriors"" falls into the category of fantasy action adventure with a very significant degree of ecchi content.  The OVAs are essentially sequels to “Queen’s Blade: The Evil Eye”.Parental Advisory:The age rating on the Blu-ray packaging is listed as MA (so 17 and up), and this rating is merited.  Scenes with female topless nudity occur frequently in every episode and during the end credits. In a few scenes, characters are fully nude,...but no details are shown below the waist.   Some episodes feature very suggestive poses or actions as well, but nothing overly graphic.  The fantasy outfits that some of the females wear have little beyond the equivalent of thongs for their lower region, and copious amounts of skin are displayed often.

Queen\'s Blade started out as a series of game books and a popular line of PVC figures before that.Story: 4/10The show consists of 6 OVA episodes.  While a few of the episodes are related by characters or events, each is essentially a stand-alone story that can be viewed separately.  Each episode attempts to continue the storyline for a few of the characters from the original series.  A few of them include unexpected pairings, some of which work out better than others.  Brief cameos by a few characters occur as well.A few of the events or actions don\'t seem to align well with the earlier series.  For example, Claudette has somehow become queen, with virtually no explanation for why Leina abdicated the position.  Also, Aldra has resumed the search for her sister, despite the revelation near the end of the prior series.  However, most of the ensuing actions seems to make sense given where things left off.Three of the episodes are somewhat related with Airi and the swamp witch serving as the main link between them.  Melona is also featured in these, and Menace is included in one as well.  The episode with Menace is the funniest of the set.  It even found a way to tie-in the Queen\'s Blade line of PVC statues, which I found totally hilarious.There\'s quite a bit of action in some of the episodes, but most of the battles end up being rather pointless and only seem to serve as excuses to show the girls in combat.  The OVAs also try to ramp up the ecchi content even further, as if that is even possible.  Overall, the series is primarily scenes with fan service, with some attempts to sprinkle in a weak story in between.  Luckily, some of the character personalities and their journeys are interesting enough to help keep it watchable, even if there seems to be little to no plot.Characters: 7/10Some of what I wrote in my reviews of the prior series is still applicable for this:The ""Queens Blade"" characters are among some of the most strikingly beautiful women to appear in anime.

The outfits most of them wear are extremely skimpy, but most of these match the armors depicted in the original game books.  As a result, I give them very high marks for staying true to the original source material.Airi is featured in 3 episodes, and she eems to get the most screen time of any character as a result.  While her tales are somewhat interesting, her incessant desire to resume serving the swamp witch becomes monotonous.  Considering that she was finding contentment elsewhere, her sudden shift back toward villain seems contrived.  By comparison, her fellow conspirators Melona and Menace each seem to follow more likely courses of action.  Nanael appears in the last of these episodes with Airi and Melona, and she almost seems like part of the team.  It might have been interesting to have Nanael become a fallen angel working alongside them during the prior series.Leina is only shown for a few scenes in the first episode, and Claudette is shown for an even shorter span.  Elina and Echidna get most of the time in the first episode.  I\'ll admit I\'m a fan of Echidna, so I may be a bit biased, but I found her actions and banter to once again be very well done.  Elina\'s actions seems in-line with her prior portrayel as well.  However, their scenes together are somewhat wasted by the contrived setup.Nowa and Alleyne are given an episode, but I found their actions and portrayel to be a bit out of character.  For example, why would elves from the forest be so skilled at beach volleyball, or swimming?  Nyx is also included, but she doesn\'t have good chemistry with them, and she doesn\'t even provide comic relief this time around.The final episode includes Tomoe and Aldra, and some of their interaction is interesting, but they too seem to lack much chemistry on screen.Despite a few hiccups and odd pairings, the characters seemed fairly accurate in their portrayels, and the uniqueness of their personalities was still evident.Art / Animation: 8/10Compared to the prior Queen Blade series, the art was slightly weaker at times, but for the most part it was spot on.  Another change was the increased emphasis on fan service and ecchi content.  For those who like that, the art and animation seemed to be quite well done for those parts of each episode.The fight scenes were well animated.  Most of them are at least as good, and in a few cases perhaps even better than the battles shown in the prior series.Sound / Voice: 8/10The music, sound effects and voice quality was all quite good, and close to the standards set by the earlier Queens Blade series.  The only problem I noticed were a couple spots where Melona\'s voice seemed to fade out a bit in the English dubEnjoyment: 5/10After being highly impressed by the prior Queen\'s Blade series, these 6 OVAs were a bit disappointing.  It was still fun to see the characters in action, but the lack of a real story for most of the episodes was hard to overlook.  While the prior series were able to convey an interesting story alongside significant degrees of fan service, the OVAs seem to push things too far.  The result is a series that focuses too much on the ecchi content without giving enough attention to plot or character development.Final verdict:  6/10The series lacks much of a story or character development, and it primarily serves as extended fan service for several of the Queen\'s Blade characters.

Think of this OVA continuation as: ""Here are six OVAs detailing how all the characters have gone about in their journeys after the previous season."" That is what we are dealing with in a nutshell. That is not to say this is a bad thing necessarily. But to put it out in just six episodes seems a bit fruitless and disappointing going into this. It is hard to evaluate this OVA without going over each episode, so that is what I will be doing through the remainder of this review.The first episode focuses on our dear...sister-love complex between Leina and Elina. Before this episode, I was never a huge fan of Elina\'s constant yuri/incest advances on Leina. Even Elina\'s smoking body always came across as more annoying than sexy. Yet, this episode expands on their relationship from when they were kids and gives us a sympathetic look at why Elina often clings to her sister. It made me appreciate the character more than I originally did before, which is a big plus to this episode.Our elf cuties, Nowa and Alleyne, take up most of the 2nd OVA detailing how their relationship has grown since the last season. This was a pretty cute episode. While these two are not my favorite duo to watch in the series, the writers did some nice relationship-building to make them feel like a genuine teacher and student relationship. It made me respect Alleyne\'s character more than in the previous seasons. Her reaction to Nowa being with Nyx instead of her was adorable.Now we get to my favorite duo, Melona, and Airi. I love it when these two are together. Their chemistry works so well with the comedy and ecchi fanservice. This story did not blow me away at all. It felt like fluff material that did not try to grow the characters in it. It was nice to see fully naked Melona and Airi, at least. I thought it was nice to see Airi\'s relations with Cattleya and her son more. I would\'ve used more of that than the pointless Melpha appearances.Then we have my best girl\'s episode. Menace\'s kingdom of Amara is finally restored, sort of. Airi and Melona must come over to make her come back to the Swamp Witch and drink lots of wine between tiddies. What more could you ask for? This is my favorite of the bunch. I always love to see these three together. I almost wish there was an entire season dedicated to these three going on in adventures now that I think about it. I will admit Ymir\'s participation felt a bit random, but I did not dislike her as much as I did previously, for what it was worth. The fight scene between Menace, Melona, and Airi was probably one of the best in the series.Nanael has her episode, yay! I have always loved Nanael\'s comic relief in the series, and this OVA episode proves that it is good. She grows bored of being part of the good angel club and wants to get out of it to start her harem. Her interactions with Airi and Melona are pretty funny and entertaining to see. Her pantsu shots are an absolute delight to see whenever it pops up out of nowhere.Our last OVA ended off at a low point. Yeah, if it was not obvious already, I am not a fan of Tomoe as a character. I know plenty of fans like her, but to me, without Shizuka next to her, she sticks out like a sore thumb. Ironically, they bring back Shizuka just for her fans to have something to cheer for. That is not to say I think this is a bad episode; far from it. It is decent, but out of all of the episodes in this season, this one is the episode I would go back to the least. There is some interesting dramatic tension between Tomoe and Aldra but nothing to write home about.So, this OVA season was a good one to go out on. Sure, if it were longer and expanded some of the stories, it would have felt like a better conclusion to this arc of Queen\'s Blade. I would regard a couple of the episodes in it as the best in the entire series, while the others are good for just being decent fun. This is something that no fan should miss if that should be something to be reminded of.Grade: B sister-love complex between Leina and Elina. Before this episode, I was never a huge fan of Elina\'s constant yuri/incest advances on Leina. Even Elina\'s smoking body always came across as more annoying than sexy. Yet, this episode expands on their relationship from when they were kids and gives us a sympathetic look at why Elina often clings to her sister. It made me appreciate the character more than I originally did before, which is a big plus to this episode.Our elf cuties, Nowa and Alleyne, take up most of the 2nd OVA detailing how their relationship has grown since the last season. This was a pretty cute episode. While these two are not my favorite duo to watch in the series, the writers did some nice relationship-building to make them feel like a genuine teacher and student relationship. It made me respect Alleyne\'s character more than in the previous seasons. Her reaction to Nowa being with Nyx instead of her was adorable.Now we get to my favorite duo, Melona, and Airi. I love it when these two are together. Their chemistry works so well with the comedy and ecchi fanservice. This story did not blow me away at all. It felt like fluff material that did not try to grow the characters in it. It was nice to see fully naked Melona and Airi, at least. I thought it was nice to see Airi\'s relations with Cattleya and her son more. I would\'ve used more of that than the pointless Melpha appearances.Then we have my best girl\'s episode. Menace\'s kingdom of Amara is finally restored, sort of. Airi and Melona must come over to make her come back to the Swamp Witch and drink lots of wine between tiddies. What more could you ask for? This is my favorite of the bunch. I always love to see these three together. I almost wish there was an entire season dedicated to these three going on in adventures now that I think about it. I will admit Ymir\'s participation felt a bit random, but I did not dislike her as much as I did previously, for what it was worth. The fight scene between Menace, Melona, and Airi was probably one of the best in the series.Nanael has her episode, yay! I have always loved Nanael\'s comic relief in the series, and this OVA episode proves that it is good. She grows bored of being part of the good angel club and wants to get out of it to start her harem. Her interactions with Airi and Melona are pretty funny and entertaining to see. Her pantsu shots are an absolute delight to see whenever it pops up out of nowhere.Our last OVA ended off at a low point. Yeah, if it was not obvious already, I am not a fan of Tomoe as a character. I know plenty of fans like her, but to me, without Shizuka next to her, she sticks out like a sore thumb. Ironically, they bring back Shizuka just for her fans to have something to cheer for. That is not to say I think this is a bad episode; far from it. It is decent, but out of all of the episodes in this season, this one is the episode I would go back to the least. There is some interesting dramatic tension between Tomoe and Aldra but nothing to write home about.So, this OVA season was a good one to go out on. Sure, if it were longer and expanded some of the stories, it would have felt like a better conclusion to this arc of Queen\'s Blade.

Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30749/Saijaku_Muhai_no_Bahamut,"['This anime is a ecchi, action, harem and school genre, all these genres together result in an anime style that usually do not please the audience, that\'s the big problem here. When you first see this anime you may think ""Yeah, this is the kind of cliche anime that every anime season has"", but in my opinion you are wrong if you thought that, personally I was wrong too, I admit, I thought it was the same cliche of always, but it ended up being an anime way more interesting.The story takes place in a fictionary world, where there are ancient weapons, named Drag-Ride that...are ancient mechanical weapons. Five years ago, the protagonist, named Lux Arcadia, was the prince of the Empire, and he also was known as the strongest Drag-Knight, the Empire was destroyed due to a revolt, now Lux is known as the ""Weakest Undefeated"", the Drag-Knight who doesn\'t attack. Due to some reasons Lux ends up entering a girl\'s school that raises Drag-Knights.This is the story, not bad thought, if it was a little more serious I think it could\'ve been an anime that would please more audience than this, one problem is how ridiculous things end up happening and how all the girls want so bad the protagonist, but if you think about it, it\'s very common in the harem anime genres, not saying that it explains why, I think if a harem is built in the correct way it can be good, sadly it wasn\'t the case.The art of the anime has many 3D aspects, which may be a little unpleasant for some people, some parts I think the art was very strange and bad, but nothing that displeased me so much, the art was most part of the time OK, the fighting scenes were all OK too.About the sound, I can\'t really say if it was good or bad, it didn\'t caught my attention enough to make an opinion, so I will just say it\'s OK too, I also liked the OP, it gets in your head, the ED was also very good, singed by the group nano.RIPE that I personally like very much.If I have to say something about the characters is that, yes they are cliche, there are all of the types of girls that almost every harem anime has, but that is almost a standard of harem animes. So I really think that the characters are not bad at all, I liked even some of the supporting characters, maybe more than some main characters, lol. They all have some interesting story about their pasts, and their personalities and ways of acting didn\'t displeased me at all.If I have to choose if I enjoyed it or not, I would really say I enjoyed, the beggining may not catch your attention, even I thought about dropping it in the beggining, but I don\'t regret not dropping it, if it gets a second season in the future I will watch, if you dropped and are reading this, I advise you to give it another chance, you may end up liking it, just like me. are ancient mechanical weapons.

As this was the first show I watched since Pokemon more than 5 years ago, I did not know what to expect.Now that I have watched it, I can safely say that this is extremely disappointing and bad. Not only is the story near non-existent and bad, the concept itself is terrible. Having machineries in a medieval setting is certainly unique, the 3d animation and the design of the machines...themselves do not fit the time period that which the story takes place in. Action scenes feel a little bit awkward given the weird blend of 3d animation on the machines in a 2d environment. It also baffles me that the entire student body in the school are all girls with the exception of the main character.The characters annoy me to no end. The main character's only traits is that he is a super kind guy who is also strong at fighting and has a dark past. He has no other personality outside of that and comes across as completely boring. His lack of backbone and naive nature also pisses me off.The other characters are terrible as well, to the point that I don't even bother to remember their names. In fact, the only memorable things about them is that they all have ridiculously hard names to pronounce. The yellow-haired girl who I assume is the heroine is a terrible character. I can't even take her seriously given how outright absurd and stupid the first encounter she has with the MC is and the only personality she has is that she obviously likes the MC for no reason other than I think is that he is a super nice guy. The only other character who I find a tad bit interesting is the blue-haired girl given her background and the couple of episodes that focused on her was a bit interesting I guess. The rest of the characters are completely forgettable and has no large impact to the show.Overall, this show is terrible, and felt like a complete waste of time. This is the opinion of someone who's experience with anime are only in Pokemon and Digimon, so my opinion might not be as important or highly regarded compared to a person who has watched more anime. themselves do not fit the time period that which the story takes place in.

I\'ve seen most of the big name harem and ecchi series, and figured ""I may as well try this."". Mecha isn\'t really my thing, but the fact that this series is a Mecha isn\'t even what makes it bad. There may be light spoilers in here, but honestly, this show doesn\'t even have much of a story to begin with, and I can only imagine one thing that could be spoiled, and it really isn\'t even that major.Story: 2This series really had no overall story....It just had mini-arcs that comprised the whole thing, and then one antagonist that wasn\'t really explained well at all. The series starts off with the protagonist conveniently falling into a girl\'s bath. And whadaya know, it\'s the most important girl in the kingdom! He then has to fight her for some reason to gain entry into a girl\'s only school to learn how to use his mech. Lets not forget that he is the biggest badass in the kingdom, and singlehandedly overthrew a regime, literally a legend among people. For reasons unknown he has to go to school.Naturally, their fight gets interrupted, queue the ""evil"" in the show: the Abyss. They really aren\'t explained very well either. In the beginning, they seem to have their own free will, since they have no tactics whatsoever, yet later on in the show they exist solely to be used by people who have certain flutes. And there are multiple flutes, which makes it quite easy for people to control them (somehow). Every time one type of enemy gets stale, they get an upgrade, From normal Abyss, to big scary Abyss, to Giant ass fortress.Also of note, for reasons unknown, I can count on one hand the number of males who could use a ""Drag-Ride"". Why is it only females? Why is it a female only school? How do the few guys that do know how to use a Drag-Ride learn in the first place when even Lux was given such a negative reaction upon trying to get into the only school ever talked about in the entire show?Art: 7I\'m no art critic, but I liked the way it looked. It wasn\'t as good as Phantom World by any stretch, but it was fluid, and looked nice.Sound: 7The OP is bad. Starts off like it\'s going to be really intense, then drops into a random electro-pop conglomeration with poorly translated english words thrown in for flavor, like ""fight for the sky!"". ED is decent, but generic. The Sound effects however are where this show really shines. Every time a character pulls their sword out, my ears have a mini orgasm, and explosions are nice and crisp. A female voices Lux, but honestly, that didn\'t make the slightest difference to me. In fact, I wouldn\'t have even noticed if I hadn\'t read it in another review a while back. Other voice actors are alright, nothing stood out as exceptionally good, or exceptionally bad, so I can\'t complain.Character: 1This show has the worst character cast that I have ever seen. Boring main character, generic tropes for every girl in his harem, etc.Lux: Main character, has no backbone except to ""Protect his friends"", never goes on the offensive. His nickname because of this is the ""Weakest Undefeated"". Is completely clueless about how girls work, and even when he has opportunities right in front of him, he drops them. He lacks confidence in anything but his goal to protect his friends, which makes him lose so many opportunities. He could have been laid many times throughout the season, by any of the people in his harem, yet instead he gets a total of 3 kisses, which aren\'t dramatic at all, and very anti-climatic, since he freaks out after each one.Airi: Lux\'s little sister, because what show would be complete if the main character didn\'t have a sister that rarely does anything except push him forward in his determination? Has barely any screen time, manages to be condescending in spite of this.Lisesharte: The princess that he falls into the bathtub with. tsundere, quickly goes full dere in less than a full episode, and then just manages to push herself away from him due to her own stupid decisions, because you can\'t have a relationship in a harem.Philphie: the kuudere childhood friend. Eyecandy is pretty much her sole purpose in the show, barely even an interest in his harem. She\'s too apathetic to care if Lux goes for her or anyone else.Krulcifer: The only good character in the show. She is the only one you can\'t always predict, and that is the only redeeming factor characterwise. Still not enough to pull the rating upto a 2.Those are the only characters I even know the name of. There is a great deal more of them, and none of them are really of any consequence. A brown haired chick that serves no purpose other than pushing the members of his harem closer to him. A black haired girl who is emotionless. I know I\'m forgetting characters, but clearly they weren\'t important enough to remember anyways. Most of them serve a single purpose as a plot device, and the only characters you get a backstory for are Krulcifer and Philpie.Enjoyment: 5This show was one of those where you watch it, in full knowledge of exactly everything that is going to happen before it actually does. It is nothing if not predictable.Overall: 5Unless you\'re trying to get someone introduced to all of the common harem-genre antics, I would not recommend this show to anyone. I was quite looking forward to just getting it over with at the end. I could recommend many other shows that do harem better than this, and even Infinite:Stratos did harem better than this. It\'s no good as an ecchi, since the only ecchi is a bath scene at the very beginning, a 5 second scene in the second episode, one back massage with Celes and then Phi\'s boobs constitute the rest of the ecchi throughout the rest of the show. It\'s not good as an action, because there is too much drama involved with personal relationships.TL;DR Avoid this show unless you are out of any other show you could possibly think of, or if you are introducing your friends to the nuances of weak-character harems.

But after completed this anime, I was very disappointed. Many things came up and make this anime more worse, fot example the last battle was good actually, but some things came and almost make me stopped watching fot a while, but I finally managed to watch it until end.For the story, it's bad. It's really...bad. I can't tell how bad it was by word. Our mc, have a divine drag ride and supposed to be a strong character, in the last battle I think he would use all of his power, but no. His power were useless, well not completely useless but it's useless. That's same with other characters, nobody used their power to the max, that's make me it worse. Beside, the story is pretty hard to understand but I don't really paying attention into it.Intro and ending were good, the songs were nice, it also easy to remember. The voice act is awesome, I like it. The sound effect is great,  No complaint from me, but overall I don't really like it because some background songs weren't fit with the show. But that's okay, I don't mind it.Overall it's an average show for me, because it have bad side and good side. I recommend this to you if you here only for the harem genre (it's not contain alot of ecchi). But if you looking for a good battle or something other than harem, you wouldn't be like this. The ending is a cliffhanger (this is an announcement, I won't tell you why did I wrote it) and I think it would be good if this has a second season. bad. I can't tell how bad it was by word.

It\'s just a cesspool of horrible tropes mixed into a fuckfest of bad characters and predictable storylines. Anytime you feel like it might be good, it just falls flat on it\'s face with disappointment.The entire show is just a massive cop out. I can\'t find a single interesting thing in this anime that hasn\'t been borrowed from something else. The main character\'s backstory was interesting until you get ever so slightly into it and realize it\'s boring...as shit. The voice acting isn\'t necessarily bad, but it\'s nothing to write home about. The character and mech designs are pretty bad as well, they\'re all bland rip offs of other mediocre characters.

These days it\'s hard for shows to be innovative so when I watch a show featuring common clichés I tend not to get too worked up about it, but this show doesn\'t at least attempt to try to differentiating itself and it is as generic as they come. By the first episode these things occur within JUST the first episode:☑ MC is a dense nice harem lead.☑ Protagonist is actually OP.☑ MC gets enrolled into an all-girls school.☑ Started with the MC accidentally groping or...seeing a girl nude.☑ Female student challenges MC to a duel.☑ Every girl falls for the MC. (I\'m not joking with you. Every single female in the school pretty much wants this guy\'s D.)Story: 2/10The story can be summed up like this:Meet MC-kun. After some circumstances he ends up enrolled in an all-girls school (because why not?) and through his efforts he accidentally ends up getting an unwanted harem. The end.Many shows within the ""battle academy harem anime"" genre can for the most part be summed up like this. Obviously this is not a true summary of the story but it does fit Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle and many of its similar shows pretty well.Joking aside, here\'s a rough summary:The previous ruling empire of Arcadia was overthrown via a rebellion five years ago. Lux Arcadia, a former prince of said empire accidentally ends up in a female dormitory\'s bathing area and falls on top of the kingdom\'s new princess Lisesharte while she is bathing and she challenges him to a Drag-Ride duel. The results of the duel somehow ends with Lux being enrolled into this all-girls school which ""coincidentally"" is where his younger sister and childhood friend are enrolled in.If you think the story will try to explore its world more by explaining more on what the monster\'s known as Abyss are or what Drag-Rides are you\'ll be pretty disappointed. The Abyss are your generic evil monster that our main characters must destroy and the Drag-Rides simply get an explanation of: ""They are ancient weapons excavated from the ruins."" The anime does have a plot but due to some pacing issues I can\'t really make much of it and with its one-dimensional villains all over the place I can\'t say who the actual antagonist really is.Basically what I\'m saying is rather than focusing on better pacing, world building, and actual good character development most episodes are like this:• Insert generic harem antics here.• Potential haremette is in trouble!• Lux defeats the one-dimensional villain and saves her.• Girl has joined the harem!• Repeat.This is the case for: Lisesharte, Krulcifer and Celistia which is more than half the harem!Art: 5/10There\'s not really anything noteworthy to mention, it\'s pretty average. A lot of CGI is being used in the fights and they look pretty good at very least. Character design wise... I don\'t like Philphie very much. Her hair looks weird along with her massive breasts.Sound: 4/10Who thought having Lux being voiced by a woman would be a good idea? He sounds much too feminine!

It fits the mood of the show and all but I can\'t see myself praising anything about it at all although it would be nice for more variety considering every fight in the show seems to use the same exact track every time.Character: 2/10Here\'s the characters so far:• Harem lead former prince: Lux.• Tsundere princess: Lisesharte.• Deadpan childhood friend: Philphie.• Flirty foreign student: Krulcifer.• The proud man-hater: Celistia.• The brocon little sister: Airi.• Yandere assassin: Yoruka.I honestly don\'t give a damn about any of these characters.• Lux is your standard harem lead who is blessed with an OP Drag-Ride.• Lisesharte, because her tragic backstory arrives and is somewhat resolved too quickly that I couldn\'t feel bad for her. Then she falls for Lux and spends most of her screentime playing the clingy jealous girl.• Philphie is your standard childhood friend who ends up being there just for the fanservice.• The little sister because she spends her screentime doing nearly nothing.• The rest of the girls for falling in love with Lux after goes all OP on the shows one-dimensional villains.Enjoyment: 2/10""So bad it\'s good."" That\'s pretty much the best way to describe this. That, or I may be a masochist. The characters annoy me, the fanservice turns me off and overall the story bores me for being predictable and horribly cliché. The fights end up as how you\'d expect; the MC shows up to save a member of his harem, turns the tables on his opponent and then absolutely wrecks them. Most of the fights are very anti-climatic because once Lux shows you up can expect the fight to end up pretty damn quickly (I\'m still salty about the episode 12\'s final battle).To elaborate more on the fanservice there\'s a particular scene near the end of the second episode where during a fight they elaborate more on Lisesharte\'s backstory where they show her in a particular position while I guy rips off the lower part of her uniform. Uh? Another fanservice scene that I did not enjoy was when some of the characters invited Lux into a room where they dressed up as maids for him.Overall: 3/10Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle is your standard generic battle academy harem anime that uses concepts and ideas from other battle-harem shows without bringing in any fresh new ideas leaving it as an utterly forgettable anime. It\'s like watching a mix of Infinite Stratos and Asterisk War.Tl;dr: It\'s a massive cliché storm. Please, just go watch something better. seeing a girl nude.☑ Female student challenges MC to a duel.☑ Every girl falls for the MC. (I\'m not joking with you. Every single female in the school pretty much wants this guy\'s D.)Story: 2/10The story can be summed up like this:Meet MC-kun. After some circumstances he ends up enrolled in an all-girls school (because why not?) and through his efforts he accidentally ends up getting an unwanted harem. The end.Many shows within the ""battle academy harem anime"" genre can for the most part be summed up like this. Obviously this is not a true summary of the story but it does fit Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle and many of its similar shows pretty well.Joking aside, here\'s a rough summary:The previous ruling empire of Arcadia was overthrown via a rebellion five years ago. Lux Arcadia, a former prince of said empire accidentally ends up in a female dormitory\'s bathing area and falls on top of the kingdom\'s new princess Lisesharte while she is bathing and she challenges him to a Drag-Ride duel. The results of the duel somehow ends with Lux being enrolled into this all-girls school which ""coincidentally"" is where his younger sister and childhood friend are enrolled in.If you think the story will try to explore its world more by explaining more on what the monster\'s known as Abyss are or what Drag-Rides are you\'ll be pretty disappointed. The Abyss are your generic evil monster that our main characters must destroy and the Drag-Rides simply get an explanation of: ""They are ancient weapons excavated from the ruins."" The anime does have a plot but due to some pacing issues I can\'t really make much of it and with its one-dimensional villains all over the place I can\'t say who the actual antagonist really is.Basically what I\'m saying is rather than focusing on better pacing, world building, and actual good character development most episodes are like this:• Insert generic harem antics here.• Potential haremette is in trouble!• Lux defeats the one-dimensional villain and saves her.• Girl has joined the harem!• Repeat.This is the case for: Lisesharte, Krulcifer and Celistia which is more than half the harem!Art: 5/10There\'s not really anything noteworthy to mention, it\'s pretty average. A lot of CGI is being used in the fights and they look pretty good at very least. Character design wise... I don\'t like Philphie very much. Her hair looks weird along with her massive breasts.Sound: 4/10Who thought having Lux being voiced by a woman would be a good idea? He sounds much too feminine!

Please, just go watch something better.', 'Fans of the typical action-based harem show rejoice, here is yet another entry that follows the script to the letter. See princess naked in first episode? Check. Have princess challenge and lose a duel to the protagonist? Check. Have princess give up on retribution afterwards and pledge fealty to the protagonist? Check? All in the two episodes? Check.Bahamut is a mech-based, semi-fantasy action-based harem that follows closely in the footsteps of shows such as Gakusen Toshi Asterisk and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. The twist this time is that our protagonist is the disgraced prince of the former empire that was overthrown after oppressing its people...too far. To somehow atone for his family\'s past, Lux works as a handyman in the new empire, helping in whatever capacity others need. However, after the events in the first episode, he becomes the only male student in an otherwise female-only academy, and becomes one of the knights defending the school and empire. What enemies lurk in the distance beyond the empire, and what dangers lurk within the multitude of bijins in the school?[b]Animation:[/b]Bahamut is a well drawn show with a bright, relatively saturated color palette and a serene setting with a nice albeit blurry mountainous backdrop. There\'s a nifty blend in the setting between rustic buildings and scenery and ultra-modern technology such as the sword-mechs and holographic ear-pieces. Unfortunately, there is a ton of CGI usage with the mechs here and though it\'s relatively good quality, it\'s still distracting at times. The mechs themselves aren\'t anything that great, their appearance is probably most similar to those seen in Infinite Stratos. The generic mechs used by non-important characters look like they took their color scheme right off of the training mechs of Aldnoah Zero. Character styling is pretty good with a diverse looking cast and a good variety of clothing. There are occasionally some drawing inconsistencies (random clothing articles changing color within a scene) but overall things check out well here. If I were to find fault in something, the overly-obvious, crazed antagonist look makes things too, well, obvious.This show has a fair amount of action with a lot of mech battles and a slight amount of blood. Antagonists take the form of either other mech pilots or occasionally weird dragon-like ancient creatures known as Abyss. Our protagonist wields two swords, which can each transform into a piloted mech. One is a wyvern, an average sacrificial mech. The other is Bahamut, which is essentially a Strike Freedom in Gundam terms. The first time our protagonist uses Bahamut can be likened to the first time Goku goes Super Saiyan, the entire world stops to marvel at what has happened; humorously future summonings have no such effect. Unfortunately, Bahamut is so strong (and fast) that its special ability allows the animator to literally carve out a path of destruction on the screen. If you\'re looking for outstanding choreography, unfortunately this isn\'t where you\'ll find it.This is indeed an ecchi based harem, the protagonist pretty much sees all the heroines at least partially undressed (except his sister thank goodness) and has more than his share of accidental exposures. Granted, some of the heroines are very aggressive relationship-wise (such as Krulcifer) so expect them to make moves on our poor (or lucky?) protagonist.[b]Sound:[/b]The show opens with a few nice guitar notes but then dives into a melody that that isn\'t particularly inspiring; it\'s electronic but not in the right way. The ED carries a similar guitar-based feel with Nano.Ripe\'s instantly recognizable voice. It\'s not a particularly memorable song but a fitting cool down piece. The brass instrumentation of the BGM during the title intro and various other portions of the show definitely give the show a fantasy-like feel. The overall BGM is minimalistic most of the time, and the  instrumentation changes based on the scene. There\'s a nice memorable, string-based theme whenever our show gets to a battle climax.With the exception of Lux obviously being voiced by a girl, I think Bahamut\'s cast is actually very good. This is the first major role for Lynn that I\'ve seen, and she does a pretty convincing tsundere as Lisesharte. I really liked Ari Ozawa\'s voice as Kirin in Gakusen Toshi Asterisk and her ""nii-san"" callings are pretty effective here too. Though her character isn\'t my favorite, Risa Taneda does a great job here as well. And not to be outdone, Shizuka Ishigami has an extremely dangerous/flirtatious character and she totally nails it. Again, if I were to have to pick a negative, it would be the antagonists; the VAs do a perfect job of matching a crazy-sounding voice to the already crazed-antagonist look.[b]Story:[/b]Lux is a Drag-Knight (short for Dragon-Knight, though I don\'t think Japan gets the connotation of their shortened form), which means he can make his sword magically turn into an armored mech, which he can pilot. However, he is not just any knight but the infamous pilot of Bahamut, the pitch-black machine dragon responsible for single-handedly bringing down the former empire (his father\'s empire essentially). It\'s an interesting twist to the setting that honestly isn\'t fully explained in the show.The show follows Lux as he assists the all girls\' school with various tasks, often involving saving various girls in succession who become smitten afterwards. The central plotline is actually rather weak, as the episodes tend to do a round robin through all the heroines. Once all the heroines are ""conquered"", we find that there is yet another tournament! This brings the show to an over-the-top climax followed by an all-too-familiar conclusion.Honestly, despite following the plotline of virtually every other action-based harem in the past few years, this is a story well executed. The story flows well and successfully weaves just the right amount of character development and interaction into the main plot. There\'s just the right amount of action mixed with a dose of comedy, ecchi, and romance.[b]Character:[/b]There are quite a few characters in Bahamut, and not all of them are treated equally. Some of the girls are successfully differentiated enough (such as Lisesharte and Krulcifer) but others still end up feeling like cookie-cutter characters (such as Celistia and pretty much all the antagonists). Airi is a nice accompaniment to Lux though one may wonder why she\'s just treated as an encyclopedia and fact announcer; perhaps they just wanted to be completely sure not to annoy viewers with an incest route. I guess I\'m just happy that the show didn\'t turn into another Aokana as both Krulcifer and Kirihime are quite bold.There are quite a few supporting characters, many of whom don\'t contribute all that much to the story; I will say Noct is a fun character as ""Yes"" and ""No"" are like half her lines. Despite these, there is a fair amount of character interaction and relationship development. Yes, a lot of it is just Lisesharte looking jealous as Lux hangs out with the other gals, but it\'s in a reasonable quantity. If there\'s one downer, it\'s that the characters are pretty static overall, I can\'t say that the events of the show strongly changed any of the characters (just having feelings for the protagonist doesn\'t count).[b]Value:[/b]Bahamut should be the go-to action-based harem of the season. It\'s an entertaining, easy to watch show with a good mix of themes and a fluid execution. It\'s obviously not perfect as described above but overall it tells a nice story with reasonable depth and memorable characters. There are plenty of unanswered questions at the end of the show so I\'d expect there to be a sequel as well. Compared to other shows of the genre, I think it compares about equally with its predecessors such as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry but with a much more moderate dosage of ecchi (especially when compared against Testament).

This anime actually points out the action more often and has less of the Harem while the anime being ecchi, it was merely just a few scenes.I find the other characters annoying honestly like there are those girls who try to hard to get attention from a guy which...basically describes the princess (I'm not good at remembering names) while she also acts too innocent around him. The main character is like not that typical boy in an Ecchi/Harem Anime who easily gets a nosebleed or like blushes.This also has some sense of humor to it which i think is great.

wait the soundtrack, this might be just more of a matter of preference but I absolutely did not like the soundtracks.I like it when the music helps me get the mood of the scene, the soundtracks used in this anime didn\'t make it for me.EnjoymentJust like the overall score, Am giving it a ""bare pass"" 7/10, the anime could have been better but I cant say that it wasn\'t fun to watch , their are some awesome fight scenes and a few characters in here that might catch your attention and I think that how anime should be.The anime is not a must watch, but also its not a not watch, in my point of view its just another anime with a lot of cliche characters and that in it self is not a bad thing, so If you haven\'t started watching it then I think you better stop reading the reviews and just watch it.Reply       My Messages i think this anime deserves being in between ""good"" and just ""fair"".storyWell, the plot is their but the story doesn\'t do a good job in showing you the details, even half way through the anime, understanding what exactly the enemy wants or or why their doing what they do is impossible to figure out.A few flashbacks here and their, most of the time they are very vague and dont cover much of the real stuff you want to know about the direction of the anime, I think the protagonist is supposed to be a sort of tragic hero but how that am not sure exactly how such responsibility fell onto him and not his brother.ArtLike i said in the intro, the best part about this anime for me was the art, the smooth anime, well drawn characters and super vivid colors that are gonna melt your eyes.some of the female characters have unrealistically gigantic boobs. so it for someone who like that kinda thing, then this is your anime but I can\'t really call this is fan service.CharacterWell, for starters, the main character is not the kinda protagonist everybody is gonna love, He\'s back story wont exactly make you understand him and that goes for most of the characters in this anime.Their are parts where its clear that your supposed to sympathize with the characters but because of how much the anime is gonna give you, getting the viewer emotional is just impossible.SoundNot gonna say much because its very rare for anime to mess up this part, you wont be disappointed, Oh!

Nothing about Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut provides the series with any sort of staying power.Uncompelling characters combined with a lackluster plot provide the viewer with nothing but disappointment.Even the harem portions of the show were incredibly uninteresting. This can probably be attritubed mostly to bad writing. What wasn\'t ruined by the atrocious writing was ruined by the uninteresting supporting cast. The bevy of female supporting characters in this show were a massive collection of annoyances.  The only slightly redeeming aspect of this show are the average, at best animations. Even this was nothing particularly special however.In no way am...I a super picky viewer who will drop something if it doesn\'t blow me away. I do, however, expect a certain baseline to be met. If a show is going to delve into the oft-explored depths of the harem-action-fantasy-school genre, it needs to be able to compete with it\'s plethora of competitors. This, unfortunately, usually appears in the form of fan service, but occasionally appears in the form of intriguing plot. Saijaku Mutai no Bahamut, unfortunately, largely fails in both regards.I personally found the ""development"" of the main character to be particularly disappointing. I believe this stemmed from the show\'s crisis of feeling. It was too busy trying to be a light hearted harem anime, and the potential for the main characters dark past being brought to light, and his ultimate redemtion being achieved, was completely squandered. So much wasted potential from this show\'s plot completely saddened me.Ultimately, viewers usually judge the watchability of a show by it\'s enjoyment. This is usually hard to quantify, and is largely affected by an individuals personal preference as opposed to anything concrete. I suppose you could call this the eye test.

(might be more interesting than the main character's)The story itself progressed fine, not bad but not good either.

EVERYWHERE.You name it. Tsundere, Kuudere. Aggresive girl, Anti-boy girl, Sadistic girlEnjoyment: 7This was kinda enjoyable, but still very predictable, i swear i watched these kinds of animes and they are damn similar.Overall: 73D Animation was bad, i only continued watching hoping to find out about the backstory of the villains, sadly i was not. considering this anime was rated roughly 6. I don't think they would make the 2nd season of it.If you're just a sucker for these mainstream harem stuffs, just watch it. it's goodIf you have little time to watch, just watch something else.This is my first review, and that's all i have to say... story might give you a damn good DEJA VU if you watched Infinite Stratos.

They can\'t do their job if the viewer starts expecting them because they keep appearing at almost Every critical moment.The usual plot expectation of any random ecchi harem is fairly low but in this case easily skyrockets early on when it becomes clear there are in fact numerous opposing factions at work and many events take sharp turns you don\'t see coming. Characters that seem harmless but odd gradually start showing their true colors, the recent history of the world is explained and exposed...bit by bit, overall it amounts to a rather high paced and well planned web of tangled intentions and complex connections. Even in the midst of this there are many moments of really good comedy that should make most people burst into laughter, without detracting from the seriousness of the sinister forces lurking in the shadows. If only the english was even a single percent as good instead of painfully embarrassing... this is unfortunately one of those many animes where you\'d wish they would never use a single english word but they are constantly thrown in at random because they ""sound cool"" or something.Sadly things eventually start to break down in a really bad way, all those intricate conspiracies and mysterious personalities are steadily unraveled and turn out to be largely pointless theatrics hiding a gruesome flaw in the characters: their core motivations can in almost every single case be summed up with a few words and they are horribly dumb. It\'s easy to get why Lux is driven by the single thought that he doesn\'t want people to suffer, but why would someone literally strive to be a hated tyrant just for the sake of being a hated tyrant? The longer this mess goes on the more shallow and idiotic their goals become, made even worse by constantly throwing in new characters just to have enough opponents to keep Lux busy.I\'d rate the first half of the season a strong 8 and the rest a weak 6 entirely because of characters and story. The art and sound are generally wonderful except for how overly feminine Lux\'s voice happens to be, it\'s often completely obvious that it\'s not working well. The opening is one of the worst to ever torment my ears but didn\'t factor into my review (openings and endings have nothing to do with the real content and quality of any anime, some would disagree but I stand firm and refuse to have them influence the rating) just a heads up to save your ears and sanity. bit by bit, overall it amounts to a rather high paced and well planned web of tangled intentions and complex connections.

Although there are some typical cliches from this kind of series, there are some difference that makes this anime slightly tolerable. For instance how about the main haremettes are developed enough they get their own episodic arcs with villains and threats that leads into a bigger bad connected to Lux?, good animated battles with mech suits vs. mech suits AS WELL as mutant dragons and finally a decent bigger bad main villain throughout the anime planning behind...the curtains of the anime (though he\'s terribly ""evil for evil sake"" cliched).LA won\'t lie, when LA first saw this anime\'s first episode, LA saw it as typical genericism with the elements LA mocked at the start of this review however as LA carried on watching it, it did get slightly better with the harem growth (along with the main protagonist at that) and plot wise.LA\'s favourite character throughout the anime was Krulcifer Einfolk voiced by \'\'Yukiyo Fujii\'\' and once her arc started LA at least got excited and was satisfied with her arc (and not to mention that arc didn\'t fall under the typical cliches). This anime does follow multiple plotlines from the harem antics aka. haremette arcs, the political dealings between it\'s two warring countries and the threat of dragons attacking and they do balance it in some modest way, LA won\'t say they balance all these perfectly but still, it\'s enough so that those plotlines doesn\'t intervene and distract with one another and more blend together to make a more cohesive narrative.Yes unfortunately the fanservice is there and it is somewhat annoying especially the haremette and childhood friend of Lux, Philphie Aingram voiced by \'\'Yuriko Kubo\'\' but other than that, it\'s ""modest"" in terms of fanservice levels.The animation by Lerche, is decent enough with slick character designs to even the mech suits looking pretty distinct from each of the main cast members, the battle scenes are animated decently enough for LA to get invested in, though this anime\'s battle scenes has a habit to blatantly change into segmented CGI just on the characters face along with both CGI animation and traditional animation on the mech\'s thus is blatant enough to get slightly distracting.In terms of voice acting, as much as LA\'s favourite character was Krulcifer Einfolk and \'\'Yukiyo Fujii\'\' still did a fantastic job for what material she had, LA\'s favourite voice actor on the other hand goes to \'\'Shizuka Ishigami\'\' as our wild-card harem member who voiced Yoruka Kirihime and her character starts to appear in Episode 11!...yeah Shizuka Ishigami\'s voice work actually gave LA enough of an impression of Yoruka for TWO EPISODES and was satisfied by even that.The ending did once again didn\'t fall under certain tropes of this anime genre, because of that LA will praise it at least that the battle harem members DO get something to do for this final battle and not just have Lux one-hit kill everything, however as much as LA praise this ending, it still falls under some battle harem tropes at the same time but LA won\'t explain as it goes into spoiler territory but LA just wished the final scenes of this anime didn\'t end so cliched as it had something good going but then threw that intense, plot-driven and character-invested ending away by the last second.Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle for LA, it is your typical anime you\'ve seen in coming out recently, the ""GENERIC SUPERNATURAL MAIN PROTAGONIST WHO\'S OP GOING TO AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL"" LA mockingly said at the start of this review, however LA will say that as cliche as it is, it does handle some of it\'s plot and character elements better than it\'s anime cliched genre counterparts, such as a haremette-centred focus that simultaneously develops both the haremette in question as well as the main protagonist, good animated battles as well as major villain that actually means and changes something to the plot and characters.At best LA will say that Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut is competent and modest but that\'s the best praise LA will give it, it still has some flaws and cliches hanging here and there to bring back it\'s typical genericism to it\'s anime genre from the beginning to later on the very last seconds of the anime.

As much as i\'d say that\'s uninjoyable, for me that part was fine.  It was done alright with great voice actor good character animation but the big thing that set me off about the series was that It was hard to understand.  It took major plot points and kind of sanded them down.  And the entire thing kind of just gives me a headache.  I had to pause in certain parts to...analyze what was going on.  Now that might work for some people but i\'d rather the show give enough hints that I can figure it out during downtime of the show.  (SPOILER WARNING)Now you might be thinking,""what does he mean by hard to understand, i get the plot points i get it""  I guess you have somewhat of a point.  I might be a little bit slow when it comes down to it but here\'s a couple questions that kind of break down the story for me.  Why is his sister never in the flashbacks, does the sister remember their older brother.  Why was phi used as an experiment if her family was like nobles.  Also halfway through the season they just decide to bring up another government and an entire thing on spies that seems totally irreverent.  And why is it called the old age if they had what seems like better technology than what the people in the story have now.Next thing it sanded down major plot points.  Now i did say spoilers before but most people down pay attention to it anyways.  The biggest plot point so far was that his childhood friend phi is actually dead.  She dies in an experiment five years ago where they were testing experimental human weapons.  Now this is a major development that they literally graissed over.  Now the problem is its well done at the same time its horrible.  Its like they had a writer conflict.  What should we do make the person feel bad for phi because she was just a nice cute girl who wanted the best for everyone and have her brutally tortured and killed made worse by the flashbacks of her being loving and caring or should we focus on the fact she is controlled by a Ragnarok seed.  I don\'t know lets try both.  Honestly the fact that they took a helpless girl like that and made her story sad instantly made my hands lifeless.  It\'s one of those scenes that just makes you think why did someone write this.  Its just painful to listen and to watch.  Kind of like the rape scene from Mirai Nikki.  Anyways the plot point has impact just not as much as it deserves.  At least they didn\'t put her in that lingere during the scene where she\'s in bed that would\'ve killed the entire series and i would stop there.Closing Statement - I came here to watch harem but I got a good story that was badly delivered and i\'m question some of the choices like changing from harem to large plot point back to harem.  It takes me out of the mood completely and its god damn annoying.  Anyways its worth a watch if you have some free time.  If you just take a look at the not harem stuff and only that its a pretty solid watch.Edit - So many plot points so little time. analyze what was going on.

In this anime.At first it\'ll give you a taste of what is going on, but by the middle you really just don\'t get what\'s going on, and at the end you just...want someone to explain it to you...I really like mech animes and I really think this anime could have had so much more to it. When I finished the last episode I couldn\'t decide if it was worth it or not.But you might be wondering why I gave it a 6 with all this looming over my head... well it\'s because I may give the 2nd season a chance, mostly because I want answers to all the unknown in this anime.Should you give it a try? I\'m not sure... I\'d say leave this one for a day you REALLY have nothing better to watch.Thanks for reading! want someone to explain it to you...I really like mech animes and I really think this anime could have had so much more to it.

I\'m not sure... I\'d say leave this one for a day you REALLY have nothing better to watch.Thanks for reading!', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I think it would be cool to investigate some ruins.Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut has a couple of them. Strange structures filled with pillars, moss, and secrets yet found. The trade-off, of course, is a lot of danger. Creatures may be protecting the place. Latent, unknown devices may be itching to go off after lying dormant for hundreds of years. So long as I could avoid all of the risk and reap all of the rewards, I would try to trek through one.Sadly, for Bahamut, it does not just have ruins. It’s in ruins, too.STORYBahamut finds...Lux, a prince of the former Old Empire, enrolled at an academy within the New Kingdom, the order that replaced the older.Then the anime falls apart.Much of what goes on within Bahamut feels like a hodgepodge of material. The anime splits itself up into a bunch of mini-arcs that simply don’t make sense. Information is either shoddily introduced or the happenings seem to come out of nowhere.The first arc focuses on Lisha, the princess of the New Kingdom. Her events revolve around the history of the land, how the new system came into place, and the premise itself. But it is all done through minimal amounts of flashback and lots of heavy-handed dialogue.The second arc focuses on Krulcifer. Her purpose is to bring the concept of Ruins into the fray. But what they are exactly and what they do for others and even why they are important goes largely ignored by the anime.The third arc focuses on Celis. Her arc gets slightly more grounded when actual antagonists make an appearance. Yet said antagonists continue with the slipshod presentation. The giant beasts, Cecil’s female friend Saniya, and the villain who Lux mistakenly thought was his brother get thrown at the audience without much tact. The bigger enemies are meant for bigger action sequences, and the human antagonists are meant to be hated, but, since the context (once again) for them is lost, so is their importance.The fourth arc focuses on Phi. Phi’s arc takes on a combination of all of these previous issues simultaneously. Overly quick flashbacks that do not provide enough. Out-of-nowhere ideas like getting a virus that turns one into a monster. More antagonists that, while somewhat relevant, exist just to be there.The fifth and final arc focuses on Yoruka. Never around until the final three episodes, this arc gets the short end of the stick. Because Bahamut, realizing that it has not done too much with each girl outside of their respective arc, includes a multi-date outing that gets in the way of the events at hand.That’s not the end of it. The whole pointless plotline involving Lux’s inability to pilot his vehicle for very long. The bringing back of a lame villain from the first arc. An ending that does not resolve the tale. It all comes together to put the narrative in quite the disheveled state.More narrative problems exist, too. A random side council gets in the way from time to time, but who they are and what they really do is not made known. The robot suits have no real importance to the proceedings except for fighting. Dramatic moments lack emotion because the show flits from one arc to the next without letting events sink in.Not to mention that the ecchi material, while a welcome addition, serves very little purpose. A small amount of it expounds on their characters, but, on a narrative level, the sexual content has no bearing on the direction of the show whatsoever. It can also tread into repetitive territory; one-too-many bath scenes are had.Even a lot of the action sees trouble when the anime fails to make the fights intriguing. While they can demonstrate special moves and spurts of coolness, the different abilities, such as reading the future or stealthily moving around, are often replaced with too much gunfire or not enough choreography. (Lux’s abilities in particular, despite using Bahamut, are pretty lame.)In short, the entire narrative is a mess through and through.ANIMATIONBahamut’s art and animation fares a lot better.The CG rendering of the robots they drive manages to be passable most of the time, so no complaints there. The backgrounds, though, lack much in the way of detail. Changing perspectives and lighting see similar fates. To be fair, Bahamut uses black-and-white coloring for dramatic moments and red hues for threatening ones on occasion, but the techniques do not contribute much.And to be even more fair to Bahamut, it does include a paneling technique for conversation purposes. Usually used when they are in their robots, the anime puts each character in their own panel to make the conversations “closer” than they otherwise appear to be on screen.The character designs are easily the best part of the art and deserve some praise. They are attractive with their blue-and-white outfits, black stockings, and gold embroidery. The color and glint of their eyes helps, too.For example, Phi’s pink twin-tails, large bust, and lazy expression allow her to become the laidback wonder. Celis’s long blonde hair and taller figure turn her into both a beauty and a leader. And Krulcifer’s long blue hair (so much hair) and sharp face make her out to be the icy queen that she is.Color symbolism likewise plays a part in the designs; a bonus feature. This type of symbolism exists across most of the characters, but using the previous examples helps here. Phi’s pink means kindness, Celis’s yellow means happiness, and Krulcifer’s blue means coolness.Actual animation tends to be somewhere around average. Action sequences can sometimes raise the bar, but downtime is filled with lots of standing around with minimal movements. At the very least, some of the lewder scenes, like pressed breasts or a steamy make-out session, have the anime trying a bit harder.CHARACTERSWhile the characters are nowhere near as problematic as the story, that is not saying a whole lot.At the minimum, Bahamut gives (due to the formatting of the narrative) each girl her spot in the limelight. Not a large amount of limelight, but they each get some all the same. Regardless, barely any execution is present in most of the characters, including Lux.Starting with Lux, he is laughably lame. He hails from the same land as the other girls – the one Bahamut takes place in – but he was a prince of the Old Empire. Because of this and his usage of an inferior robot (earning him the convenient nickname of “Weakest Undefeated,” a trait of his that goes largely unexplored), he initially finds himself estranged in the New Kingdom.Naturally, as he proves his worth, every girl flocks to him. It’s an acceptable development because part of the point is Lux reaching out to each of the girls in turn. Indeed, he has some kind of connection to their own problems: Lisha feeling worthless as a queen as he did as a prince, Krulcifer and he not having much of a family to turn to, and so on.What’s not acceptable is his overly optimistic characterization and lack of a proper backstory. He shoulders everyone’s burdens, but, because his struggles are never looked at in depth, it makes his actions feel more like a requirement rather than a reaction to the situations before him.Lisha follows similar suit, but she has a bit more depth. She is the upcoming queen of the New Kingdom. Her biggest conflict is the brand she received on her abdomen that evil men of the Old Empire seared onto her before her and her family took over. More specifically, she feels unworthy of ruling the land given that she was abandoned (by her father no less) to that unfortunate fate.Sadly, Lisha, for both instances, is not the one to eliminate the person who branded her. Lux takes that honor – and robbing Lisha of some proper closure. Worse still, the anime pushes her into the side character role shortly following the conclusion of her arc, relegating her to flustered scenes thanks to the other girls. The final fight where she, once again, has to be saved by Lux solidifies how little attention she received.Moving on, Krulcifer is perhaps the best written character of the bunch. She wins the academy-wide mini-game, asking Lux to be her boyfriend for a week. The move seems harmless at first, but her true intentions are made more clear following a side-street attack. She took advantage of Lux’s kindness, using him as a shield to thwart off a would-be suitor for the time being.Later on, Lux learns of Krulcifer’s true origins: She is a descendent of the people of the Ruins. The exotic, mysterious nature of the Ruins themselves seeps into Krulcifer’s life as well when she talks about her “family.” She was adopted but not truly loved by her parents, brothers, and sisters because of who she was and where she came from. So she trained herself in the arts, from battling to mannerisms, to try and earn their love. But to no avail.Much of this information is given through more expository backstory. But Bahamut at least shows some clout when the duel between her, her suitor, and Lux holds parallels in terms of using others as tools. I.e., her suitor saw her as a tool to further his gains, and Krulcifer (originally) thought the same of Lux.Unfortunately, the anime lets Lux save Krulcifer from her doom rather than herself, but her actions afterward indicate her newfound fondness of the boy. She becomes very forward, letting Lux know that she will without a doubt be his wife in the future. But she takes her forwardness further with a kiss that was more than just a peck on the cheek.In the end, Krulcifer manages to have some complexity to her character (even if some small snags are had along the way). The rest of the cast – namely Celis, Phi, and Yoruka – fall far below her level.Celis enters the season roughly halfway through, letting everyone know of her main trait: hatred of men. As such, she challenges Lux to a duel where, should she win, he must leave the academy forever. Obviously not wanting such an outcome, and needing some way of getting close to Celis, Lux dresses up as a girl to circumvent Celis’s biggest barrier.After “Luno” picks out a swimsuit for Celis, she opens up to the boy in disguise. She is not really a man-hater. She simply wants to protect Lux by keeping him out of danger in order to make amends, to take responsibility, for “causing” his grandfather’s death.Later on, Celis nearly gets killed by Saniya (who is now randomly one of the main bad guys because she hates nobles; her strength as a villain is nonexistent). This situation prompts Celis to reveal her feelings of loneliness following the loss of her mentor through her indirect hands. Once again, Lux saves the day. He beats back Celis’s loneliness by fighting for her (and defeating the enemy). This instance of saving makes more sense than Lisha’s and Krulcifer’s since her conflict demands resolution through camaraderie.A single conversation and a single flashback supports Celis’s character, though, making it rather weak. And while she does defeat Saniya on her own near the end of the season – hearkening back to her sense of responsibility – it is too little, too late.But somehow, Phi’s character is even weaker. Before the academy went to the “training camp,” Phi was around for mostly two reasons: ecchiness and kindness. Hugging while wearing lingerie is her norm. But once the Ruin near the island surfaces, she changes.Essentially, Phi starts to physically weaken. Lux chases after her when she runs away at one point – only to almost get choked out by her. Hayes (the other random villain) informs Lux (and the audience) that the virus within Phi is making her into an Abyss, a beast controlled by the villains.Throughout her ordeal, Lux learns more about her. She liked Lux from a very early age. She was experimented on to the point of death. She consoled him when his mother died.Per usual, all of this information is either without context or hastily put together. Sometimes both. She later betrays Lux and the others once the virus begins to fully take control, but (as is the case with every character) she gets out of her conflict not through personal change or of her own volition. (Airi is the one to directly save her this time as opposed to Lux, but it’s still so shoddy.)And just for the sake of completeness, Yoruka performs horribly as a character, too. She has a weird affinity for Lux – pledging herself to him due to a contract from the days of the Old Empire. Her conflict also comes in as poorly written backstory. Shortly after, she gets defeated in about thirty seconds thanks to Lux comparing himself to Yoruka’s younger brother, thereby turning her onto his side.Her entire character comes off as unnecessary since her inclusion does very little for the rest of the cast (which can be said for nearly all of them) and her impact on the story as a whole is practically inconsequential. But the worst part is that she hurts Lux’s character and, hence, one of the main themes of the cast: helping others in times of need.During Yoruka’s battle with Lux, Lux describes why he chose to destroy the Old Empire, his Empire. Yet Yoruka’s description of Lux’s actions contradict what he has done for everyone else thus far: “Master, you were fighting by yourself for the sake of the Arcadia Empire from the beginning…” Despite how much the anime emphasized the notion that people require the support of others, unlike the girls in his harem, Lux took on his biggest burden alone.The other villains barely have anything to their name. Airi stands on the outside saying little else besides “Big Brother.” And Relie’s relationship with Phi does not receive adequate attention.All in all, the cast is a wash.SOUNDThe opening track tends to a lot of noise as the beat, instruments, and singer fail to work together. Its English lyrics, like “fight for the sky” and “to be the soldier,” are silly, too. The only redeeming quality is the middle section where the beat shifts and the vocalist reaches loftier heights. But it is not enough to pull the OP up off the ground.Next to the character designs, the ending track is arguably one of the only positive traits of Bahamut. The instruments support rather than overshadow the singer. The pace is consistent yet quick. And the ending’s tiny bit of repetition caps off the piece nicely. The ED is not that memorable, but it is certainly stronger than most of what Bahamut has to offer.Voice acting performs are on a similar level. Perhaps slightly higher. Yurika Kubo as Phi goes kind, tired, and unemotional with an all-in-one voice. Risa Taneda as Celis brings both maturity and class with her way of speaking. And Mutsumi Tamura as Lux plays the young boy role well while being female herself.(A special shout-out goes to Rie Takahashi as Noct for her constant use of “Yes.”)As for the original soundtrack (not including the OP and the ED), it is largely forgettable. Piano ensembles for tenser moments. Rising violins for those triumphant times. And lighter tracks for the lighter scenes. The rising violin piece is slightly cool, but the majority of the OST is very much unimpressive to hear.ENJOYMENTIf I liked anything about the anime, it was the romance between the different girls and Lux.As some may know, I am a sucker for romance. So the content related to it throughout this one made me smile and laugh and be happy. Lisha believing that holding hands was a major accomplishment. Krulcifer’s kiss scene. Celis’s stereotypical falling-on-her-boobs event. Phi splashing water at Lux; she was definitely my favorite character in the show. And Yoruka’s yandere tendencies.Even the outside romantic dealings I found humorous. For instance, Airi scolding her brother for his “perverted” thoughts and Relie cheering Phi on in the game of love. All of the romance was favorable to me in some form.Everything else, however, either got on my nerves or made me bored. Lux as a character was uninteresting – much too passive. The robots and action were more so flashy than cool. And the ecchi material, while not unwelcome, could have at least tried to make itself more interesting.Furthermore, the harem members hardly interacted with one another. It would have been fun to see them have more dialogue between each other than what was given since their traits, likes, and personalities would have definitely clashed and coincided. But that never really happened.Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut falls apart everywhere. The story is riddled with issues, the characters are incompetent, and areas of the art and music have seen better days. In other words, this is one ruin that has almost no rewards to speak of.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, too many problems to reasonably listAnimation: Fine, boring artistic direction, about average actual animation, and nice character designsCharacters: Terrible, Krulcifer is passable, but Lux, Yoruka, and the rest of the cast are beyond poorly handledSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, bad OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, sporadic romance kept the experience from feeling like a total dragFinal Score: 2/10 Lux, a prince of the former Old Empire, enrolled at an academy within the New Kingdom, the order that replaced the older.Then the anime falls apart.Much of what goes on within Bahamut feels like a hodgepodge of material.

"", 'Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut is just another generic ecchi harem.Note: this review will be very opinionated and may contain spoilers, you have been warned.I actully don\'t hate this show but I do hate the whole premis, or rather not even that. The premis isn\'t so bad, how do I put this. I just hate the generic ecchi harem parts of it, which there is plently of. It actully took me a long time to get this show done (like 12 days) which is rare for me with such a short show. It never captured my interest really.So what happens, well what do you think happens....Mister generic MC finds himself accidently in the girls bathhouse and right on top of a girl, of course she\'s a tsundare which means she is who he will end up with and she freaks out at him. Basically it turns out that Lux is a transfer student and his also a male when this is a girls only school. Oh the clichés, just recalling this is activity sucking the creative life force within me. Either way there is more going on as it turns out he is the final prince of the old empire which isn\'t around anymore since it got overtaken by the new empire. This world also just has the most creative names, obviously. either way Lux betrayed the old empire in order to help the new empire take over and while he is still considered a criminal he is mostly givin a lot of freedom as is his sister. His a very talented drag-rider as well, drag-rides being the mecha this shows uses. Anyway these creators called Abyses or something like that sometimes attack and Lux is bascially there as an extra layer of defence, also all the girls in his harem also have there own drag-rides and fight aswell. I\'m not gonna get to into the plot becuase it\'s very inconsistent and works on a two episode basis most of the time.So bascially the first epsiode of any givin two episode set starts out with Lux interacting with the next girl the show is going to cover. She has some issue and needs his help in some way and becuase his just the best guy in the world he decides to help. There\'s only one time his forced to help any of them out and he ends up going above and beyond what she asks so yer. Then by the end of the episode Lux has to fight someone or an enemy makes themselves known as the enemy and then the second episode is fighting this enemy and he wins and the girl loves him and then you get some sence where she goes on about how much she loves him.The issue with this is that these girls become pretty useless fast, they have very little attention given to them outside of there two episode arc (minus the main girl Lisha) and even she gets the shaft in the other girls arcs, is just that in the few episodes where it doesn\'t have an arc going on, she gets the most focus. For instance after Lisha\'s arc we move on to Krulcifer and Lisha is seen once at the start and once at the end of this arc. At the start she\'s trying to capture Lux in order to make him follow a request but is never seen after Krulcifer ends up getting the request. Then she\'s there right at the end to scream ""what are you two doing"" when Lux and Krulcifer kiss two times in a row. I also hate how harem shows do this, these two were kissing and while Lux had the typical harem MC reaction he wasn\'t resisting, in the real world some girl isn\'t just going to slam in and yell at him and make it look like his doing something wrong, he is his own person and can do whatever he wants, if his not out right resisting her then he is consenting to it and so for her to react this way to there face is insane. She might be upset about it or angry at him but she doesn\'t own him, just becuase she\'s the main girl and tsun doesnt make it okay, it\'s stupid.In fact all the characters are pretty stupid. Phi is the only one who I didn\'t think was super stupid, Lisha is just a dumb tsun and makes really stupid decisions. Krukcifer forces Lux to pretend to be her boyfriend and then when he does so tells him to stop becuase she is useless and then when he saves her she goes on to say that they are engaged even though the agreement is over. The third girl (can\'t remember her name) can\'t even tell that Luno is just Lux dressed as a girl even when he takes off his shirt! It\'s from the back but that still makes no sense, plus she pretends to be a man hater cause she doesn\'t know how to deal with them, fine. If she stops being a man hater that\'s fine but she still shouldn\'t be able to deal with men yet once her arc is over she outright starts hitting on Lux and even invites him to help her in a mission, not possible! Phi is the only girl I consider not to be stupid and she actully also has the most development and has the most realistic reason to like Lux, there child hood friends and from a young age Lux promised to protect her and they have both helped each other out a lot though there life and thus this makes a lot of sense. She is also the soul reason that Lux has trained so hard and is the way he is today, it\'s so stupid the the deeper and much more important girl isn\'t the main girl just becuase the tsun always has to win in these shows. The kinda last girl Yoruka is also dumb, she is hyped up for a while and is the final fight aginst Lux and she is taken down in one strike becuase she mentions her brother which causes her to show emotion and then Lux is able to see through her movements because of that even though she was just beating the crap out of him becuase she only attacked when he was unable to respond. Why would she suddenly attack when he can see even if he did mention her brother, she just spent ages talking about her brother while fighting why does he mentioning it change anything and then she betrays the old empire as well for no reason at all, she just does and then at the end is treated like a harem member. She was in the show for like 3 episodes and was a bad guy for most of it, but hey, we need more girls so that you can have a Waifu no matter what your into. There\'s even a Loli that\'s around for like 1 and a half episodes just so that all the Lolicons can have a character to buy merchindise of.This show is bad.I actully enjoyed most of the characters despite them being all a bunch of idiots and phi was absolutely done great which makes the avrage a little better, but just keep in mind that mostly everyone is super generic and dumb.The presentation is the only thing besides Phi that is any good. The OP and ED are generic in the sense that there the same as a lot of other OPs and EDs of the same genre, but it\'s becuase it works and I still enjoyed it even if it wasn\'t anything new. The background music is also pretty good, it does what it needs to do but the music that sometimes plays during battles is amazing and I love it, really good a building up hype. The battles however are mostly a let down, most of them are slow and nothing much really happens, it\'s just a few moves used and then the protagonist has won with an ass pull, sweet. That is untill the final few episodes, the last two or so episodes suddenly start having really well done fights. The drag-rides move fast and chain there moves together well, everything flows together and it\'s acutlly like a real fight and doesn\'t feel really turn based and rugid. I like the last few episodes becuase of this, however it doesn\'t change the fact that the drag-rides are CG most of the time. The CG ranges from bareable to horrible and that\'s an issue. It\'s a shame that it\'s bareable sometimes cause that shows that when they put effort in it can look okay but then it goes to looking horrible in the same episode and I\'m just wondering why some parts got more effort then others, it is better then if all of it was horrible but the inconsistency is a massive pain, becuase it gives me a taste of bareable CG right before slapping me in the fact with really bad and obvious CG that makes me wanna punch my screen. Aside from e drag-rides everything is pretty avrage, there are a few really good parts but then there are also some really poor parts and so overall I\'d say it equals out to be avrage in the long run. It didn\'t really change how much I enjoyed it.Overall I didn\'t hate it, I spent a lot of time ragging on it but that\'s just becuase it does a lot of things bad and it is a generic ecchi harem that makes poor use its one good chareter and for every good thing it does and has just as many if not more bad things in the same thing. Only one solid character, every good amazing fight has just as many stale fights. Every clever moment has an ass pull counter part and all the really well made moments are ruined by being followed by something really poorly animated or by having something dull happen in the amazing area. That really stupid final fight between Lux and Yoruka happened in a beautifully animated area that looks absolutely stunning. But the fight is one huge ass pull plus it\'s also stale and just makes Yoruka who was super threatening, just a dumb dull girl who is obsessed with Lux like everyone else. So objectivily it\'s pretty dull and that did effect my enjoyment a bit but overall I still enjoyed the show most of the time. I never felt like watching it but once I just selected the next episode and started I enjoyed myself for the most part and never wanted to click away or stop watching becuas of the shows fault. It\'s just hard to be interested when your not watching it, I was never hyped to find out what would happen next and show ends in the worst way. With Lux surroded by all his Harem and they ask which one he loves and then each of the girls say there line and he just screams. Even his sister gets a line in even though she has never been shown to feel that way towards him, even Lux is shocked when she chimes in which just shows how stupid it is to make her a part of his harem in legit the last minute of the show. But I did enjoy it enough, its just bad in a more objective way.5/10 average.

Very commonly there are anime that make it so that you out of every genre that is out there, harem is the most hated.  And of course, with the usual seasonal adaptations of harem series, they don't really help your case now does it?Story:  Lux Arcadia is a boy who used to be part of the royal family back in the old country.  Now that that country has been taken over and reestablished as a new country, he must now take on odd jobs and such in order to live a half-decent life.  One day, he crashes into...a roof, right into the nearby academy's bathing room where he crash lands onto a girl and fondles her breast.  (Typical harem stuff.)  As punishment, he must now attend the academy attend school as a student, a school where every student wield a drag-ride, a sword that turns into a mech.  Yep.  It's this kind of anime.Ok, I'm gonna be COMPLETELY blunt about this one.  The story is terrible.  The main focus of this anime is to get girls, that's all it is.  Every few episodes has Lux talking or helping out some new girl he meets, before using his protagonist power and making it so that that specific member of the female species devotes her entire reproductive system to only swearing to bear his children because generic harem.  They have this story about some rebellion against the new kingdom which doesn't get anywhere cause it's horrendously unexplained, we have incomplete explanations about literally every new concept or fact that this show tries to establish (like drag-rides, the Abyss monsters, the ruins, what the main villain's plan was), and just cliches up the wazoo.So, with that in mind, what exactly are the positives here?  Well, to be completely honest, the show is self aware of what it is.  I don't know what it is about this one in particular, but Bahamut is so terribly written that I swear that Lerche was doing it on purpose because they know just how bad it actually is.  It's so chock full of cliches and terrible writing that it's actually really funny to watch cause the show just honestly does not give a single shit whether or not it makes sense or not.  It's for this sole reason that I was able to even finish this series, or get through it without any internal malice towards it.  Don't get me wrong though.  The story here is generic as fuck and is god awful if you actually take a look at it.Overview:-  Absolutely terrible story-  Cliches.  Cliches everywhere.+  The show feels like it knows that it sucks.Characters:  You got your standard fantasy harem setup.  No, seriously.  That's...about all we got here.Lux Arcadia is our main protagonist.  Yada Yada Yada nice guy to all, blah blah blah, holds the ultimate powerful Drag-ride Bahamut who is the plot armor in all of this, fears being hit on by girls...what else, what else...  No, no I think we got pretty much everything.  He's your standard harem MC.Then there's the harem.  Ok, I'm gonna try and explain each member in 5 words.Lisesharte Atismata =  Tsundere princess who's mostly dereKrulcifer Einfolk =  Flat justice who's romantically aggressivePhilufy Aingram = Childhood friend with D^3 cups.  (Yes, that is D cubed)Celestia Ralgris = Senpai who's bad with menSo, basically what we have here is a list of cliches strapped onto various girls.  For the most part, they are the main focus of the series, as Lux helps each one of them before adding them to the harem one by one as the series progresses with really not much else interesting happening.  (Also, what is with these names?  They're really hard to even pronounce.)Oh yeah, there's also his brocon imouto, Airi, and a bunch of other girls that just all sort of jump in the bandwagon in the end too...  Side characters are really just there.  Even the main villain is pretty much just there.  Aside from these 5 main characters (if you can even call them characters), everyone else has a pretty minor role in everything and is just sort of along for the ride.  You won't remember them as you're watching and they'll become nothing but fleeting memories.Overview:-  Cast of cliches and tropes  (Hooray for originality.)Art:  Produced by Lerche, Bahamut's art is actually rather decent.  Its color scheme and overall animation quality are pretty nice, as there is quite a good amount of fluidity and vibrant colors amidst the crap that is story and characters, and the designs for the mechs are actually pretty well designed and nice.CGI for the mech movement is also not really all that jarring and actually flowed well with the overall animation.  It's not the best animation, but there is honestly not a lot to complain about for the art of the series.Overview+  Good artSound:  Generic.  It's bad, it's rather pointless.  Just skip it.  All of it.Personal Enjoyment:  I've had my fair share of harem anime in the past.  Romance and harem are amongst the most common genres of anime that I watch.  Some shows that have these tags are done relatively well and create a nice viewing experience.  Others...not so much.  This was definitely one of them, and will not be one of those that I'm going to go back someday to watch for any particular reason.Did I like this anime?To be frank, I didn't like this anime.  I tolerated it.  I've gone to the point that watching crappy harem isn't really all that much of a headache for me, and there really isn't anything to like about this show aside from just how self aware the show feels when it goes by episode after episode.What didn't I like about this anime?Nothing...really.  It's a show that knows its a crappy harem, so giving it shit for being a crappy harem wouldn't do anything because that's what it is, and it knows that fact.Would I recommend this anime?If you want to watch a crappy harem, there are plenty of other choices out there, but this is definitely one of the less infuriating ones.  Of course, wanting to watch a crappy harem in the first place is quite an interesting demand of a watch, so I don't expect many who are reading this to even consider putting this on their list. a roof, right into the nearby academy's bathing room where he crash lands onto a girl and fondles her breast.

I rewatched it recently, and I thought to share my thoughts on this anime.Story6/10 FairThe story is okay, I suppose. Its nothing special, but it was enough to hook me into watching it. There were parts in the story where I thought it was too predictable, and too cliché, but its nothing too major. Also at times I felt a bit bored until something interesting happened.Art6/10 FairIts okay. Nothing eye catching, but not bad either. Compared to other anime around...2016, its fine, and still upholds today, besides some meh cg moments.Sound7/10 GoodIts good, decent sound effects and such. Voice acting is good. And I really liked the opening and credit songs.Character7/10 GoodThe protagonist was good. Had a okay backstory, okay goal, and decent character development. Any other characters of the main cast also got okay character development with decent screen time. The only other character who didn't really get the same treatment was Yoruka, who is introduced in the final act of the first season. She was interesting, and I really wish she got more screen time.Enjoyment6/10 FairFor the most part, I think I enjoyed this anime for what it was besides some minor nitpicks.Overall6/10 FairOverall, I was satisfied, and wouldn't mind watching a second season, though its highly unlikely, mostly due to the unsuccess of this anime business wise, and its not really popular, and its been around 4 years since the first season released. Would I recommend this anime ? Yes, I would. Its okay, though nothing special. My overall score for this anime is 6.25 2016, its fine, and still upholds today, besides some meh cg moments.Sound7/10 GoodIts good, decent sound effects and such. Voice acting is good. And I really liked the opening and credit songs.Character7/10 GoodThe protagonist was good. Had a okay backstory, okay goal, and decent character development. Any other characters of the main cast also got okay character development with decent screen time. The only other character who didn't really get the same treatment was Yoruka, who is introduced in the final act of the first season. She was interesting, and I really wish she got more screen time.Enjoyment6/10 FairFor the most part, I think I enjoyed this anime for what it was besides some minor nitpicks.Overall6/10 FairOverall, I was satisfied, and wouldn't mind watching a second season, though its highly unlikely, mostly due to the unsuccess of this anime business wise, and its not really popular, and its been around 4 years since the first season released. Would I recommend this anime ? Yes, I would. Its okay, though nothing special. My overall score for this anime is 6.25"", 'Hey folks, this will be a review for Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut. This anime is just alright. That being said I want to break it down some more, but first we need to discuss the number 1 word associated with harems, ""Generic"". People throw around the word generic too much. Calling every harem you watch generic is like calling every variation of plain vanilla pudding generic. The pudding is vanilla flavored whether you dislike it, are tired of it, or any other feelings you may have for it. Its up to you to decide whether or not you like that particular brand or not. That...being said, this brand was not the best.The story is not bad, at least it seems like it would have been good if they explained it. However as it seems like this is a filler anime, we have our story sorely unexplained, and serves only as a backdrop. The harem and girl developing side to the story is also relatively bland however leaving this anime as another waste of time IMO.We start off per usual, with our male mc somehow finding himself seeing one of the prominent female characters naked. This in turn leads to a duel in which showcases our nice mc and his although somewhat lacking ability surpassing the females exceptional ability through his own inner strength. The twist at the beginning is easy to spot, and our female duelist isn\'t a red haired fire wielder so it gains a few points for that spot of originality. After this the story progresses in chunks as we uncover secrets of this world that honestly makes little sense and is only slightly explained by the mature mother like sister. Most of the girls have at least one episode dedicated to them and for the most part they are alright. The end seemed anti climatic and lame, many times conflicts are overcome by our mc by his own super ability.The art was just ok. The voice acting is always great and the music was alright.The characters were a wee bit different than usual, not filling the typical harem roll call which some may like. As I like the typical cast of girls this wasn\'t impressive to me. The girls also even though having some tragic backstory, somehow manage to seem shallow and clingy. Our mc Lux arcadia was your naive super nice, super op character. The girls don\'t really matter. They do, as previously mentioned, have a backstory but they play no integral part to the story. They simply come on the screen to showcase lux then disappear until they are required to progress something again. I didn\'t even have a favorite, though I guess if I had to choose, it would be Phi, who btw shows the most characterI enjoyed this anime as a filler. However there are plenty out there that will probably not like it. If you don\'t like harems don\'t bother. If you like harems and need a fix, here you go. I would recommend Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari if you want a better version of this. The ecchi and fan service is rather low for those who dislike this, your rather safe.TLDR: Not very good, different but not engaging characters, story feels like a backdrop to the anime as a whole, lame ending. Don\'t bother unless you go into it as a time waster. being said, this brand was not the best.The story is not bad, at least it seems like it would have been good if they explained it.

There\'s also nothing too great with the universe.The characters are just another set of artificial tropes that have barely any development.

The story is extremely predictable and unentertaining with the only good thing going for it is it's pacing which the anime somewhat barely does well in. The characters are a disappointment and SUPERBLY linear and stale with every single damn one. To add on to the characters, not a single one of them managed to interest me because of their poor design and high categorization making them fit into specific types of girls with little to no identity and or character outside of the category they're suppose...to be in. The MC fucking sucks. The only character that almost managed to make me raise an eyebrow was Fugil but no season 2 lmao.

BUT watching in Japanese with German subtitles is very pleasant and again captures the atmosphere.

The story is also stale and has been seen many times in different and better ways.

It basically just throws absolutely everything at you without any build up or explanation and feels pretty rushed. A lot of people mentioned for every 2 episodes were 1 LN volume, so...it is not a surprise the show feels pretty rushed.However, I really enjoyed the characters they were all lovable and great as should be expected from a harem ecchi.

The show is actually decently funny too, but it really goes down a more sad and dramatic tone at times as it went on.Watching this show for a second time I was reminded exactly where it falls apart. It is around the Rune/Phi arch and episodes where things just make absolutely no sense. You are introduced to new characters that just babble about nonsense having no idea who they are, along with it is quite a hefty amount of dialogue. Then it just skips around without explaining anything that is going on or why this is happening or even what's up with these runes in-depth rather hinted at something more. The art was also a let down during this arch since it takes place in a minimalistic setting. Worse part is you are suppose to feel something heavy with Phi's reveal, but this show lacked building up the connection to the character that when it happened I more or so did not feel that much about it.Overall, this show revolved around too much on plot twists with little to no build-up of them that they often landed dry when the reveals happened or more often resulted in mass confusion.

Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle is an anime I held lower expectations since whenever I see the haram, school, and ecchi tag on it I assume it was gonna be a cliché anime. Though here were some cliche moments I still found this anime to be somewhat enjoyable. First and foremost I want to talk about the story. The plot and lore in this anime got me interested in the story. The history of the kingdom and the backgrounds of the main character and the villains were intriguing. The only problem I have is that mostly 75% of the anime is Lux...(The MC) legit going on a Pokémon journey acquiring the love of all the girls in the cast and adding them in his harem. Not saying that he does this on purpose just that is how the plot is. The characters in this anime were kinda cliche since you can find the same exact characters personality in any other harem anime. The MC is included. Though I don't really dislike these type of troupes, I find it quite tiring and boring watching these types of characters in the anime over and over again. The action in the anime was good. There 3D art style didn't bother me and was quite entertaining watching the fight scenes. I can see why it would bother people but for a mecha anime it was quite expected. I feel like if the anime was based on magic I would find a bit more entertaining, but that just me. The music in this anime was ok. Didn't really notice it but wasn't bad. I say the best driving point in this anime would be the lore of this anime. I am curious to see what would happen next in the plot line. If this anime got a season 2 I would be somewhat excited but will still have low expectations. Hopefully they won't do a repeat, and just add more random girls in the anime and have our MC go through a another Pokémon journey collecting the women. Overall 6/10 I would recommend this anime if you are just bored. (The MC) legit going on a Pokémon journey acquiring the love of all the girls in the cast and adding them in his harem.

Volume 1 goes from episode 1-2. Volume 2 goes from episode 3-5. Volume 3 goes from episode 6-7. Volume 4 goes from episode 8-9. Volume 5 goes from episode 10-12. That pacing is absolutely ridiculous. It’s so rushed that to a degree it feels broken. It varies from series to series and novel to novel, but three...episodes is the absolute minimum per volume for most series. Unless it’s a rare series with really short volumes, trying to do a whole volume in two episodes even reasonably well is simply impossible. As such, to a pretty large degree, this anime just feels half done. The world that its building seems really interesting, but it feels like it only half explains most of it. This is a problem to the degree it becomes difficult to figure out what is happening and why, to the point everything just feels random. Similarly, the combat seems interesting, though too many mechas have powers relating to affecting other mechas (copying powers, negating powers, controlling other’s powers, etc.) and not enough actual powers, but in general that too isn’t explained properly, so when an explanation is given during crucial moments, they don’t make much sense. The main characters also seem to have interesting backgrounds and personalities, so there are some really great moments, but their stories too feel like they’re only barely told. Each heroine gets a story arc dedicated to them, but none of them feel like they did justice to their stories. Furthermore, they simply don’t have any time at all to spend on heroines other than the one being focused on for that story arc, so after their arc the heroines pretty much have no presence. The exception to that is the final arc, but in that case the heroine of that arc was developed even less than the previous ones. I get why they rushed things so much, as the last story arc is the only one that has an ending that fits as a finale and just on its own would be the best place to end the season on. However, due to how they simply had to rush through everything else, this feels like putting the cart before the horse and overall it was not worth it. A slower pace better fleshing thing out with a mundane ending would have been preferred.The animation was pretty solid. The mech combat CG was well animated and I didn’t consider it an issue at all. Mech designs and character designs were all solid. The OP starts off with awesome audio, has a terrible vocal line, and was then decent for the rest. The OP visuals I thought were really well done however, especially the heroine focus shots. The ED audio was okay, and the visuals were pretty weak, but I liked how they changed over the course of the season. episodes is the absolute minimum per volume for most series. Unless it’s a rare series with really short volumes, trying to do a whole volume in two episodes even reasonably well is simply impossible. As such, to a pretty large degree, this anime just feels half done. The world that its building seems really interesting, but it feels like it only half explains most of it. This is a problem to the degree it becomes difficult to figure out what is happening and why, to the point everything just feels random. Similarly, the combat seems interesting, though too many mechas have powers relating to affecting other mechas (copying powers, negating powers, controlling other’s powers, etc.) and not enough actual powers, but in general that too isn’t explained properly, so when an explanation is given during crucial moments, they don’t make much sense. The main characters also seem to have interesting backgrounds and personalities, so there are some really great moments, but their stories too feel like they’re only barely told. Each heroine gets a story arc dedicated to them, but none of them feel like they did justice to their stories. Furthermore, they simply don’t have any time at all to spend on heroines other than the one being focused on for that story arc, so after their arc the heroines pretty much have no presence.

First of all the MC was very Fantasy, Harem anime protagonist generic accidental boob gropes, being overpowered but having a limit, and acting innocent when something ecchi happens. Second of all the villain of the first season was the definition of generic she has a check mark on generic villains list the reason she wants to take over is just for power she has no reason for it other than taking over the world or empire in this case. Third of all the anime itself felt very generic tsunderes, kuuderes, etc the fights...were the classic i can't use my maximum power because it'll only last for this long. Anyways this is my review for this i did this in the middle of the night so sorry if i put bad grammar into this. Also the genre i don't like it, but i normally don't add that to my reviews because there might be people that like it. were the classic i can't use my maximum power because it'll only last for this long.

There really isn't anything original about this show, or anything redeeming besides there's a bunch of cute girls and one guy, so you can get your male fantasy on, but I mean this show is essentially a diet infinite stratos, and honestly I feel like Infinite stratos at was more enjoyable and watchable than this, and there are just better harem anime out there if thats what you're looking for. The story is basic, fight scenes just...look horrid, same with the monsters and enemies, and the villains don't seem to have motivations that, well, ~seem real~. look horrid, same with the monsters and enemies, and the villains don't seem to have motivations that, well, ~seem real~."", 'Putting it bluntly, this series isn\'t what the anime community would define as ""good"" as it\'s not very original and overall isn\'t anything to write home about. In fact I would say its the epitome of the soulless incessant anime industry pumping out another harem clone for the masses, and not even a good one at that. However, if you\'re honestly looking for a satisfying story in a genre that\'s based almost entirely on wish fulfillment fantasies then you only have yourself to blame. That being said, anime like this one DO have their place. I call them ""refresh"" anime, akin to what one would...call a ""palate cleanser"" in reference to food tasting. This is because while the different aspects of writing (e.g., plot structure, character development, pacing etc) are typically watered down, they often manage to hit on at least a few points that ""get the job done"".That being said, Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut managed to do that for me in the form of Lisesharte. I can honestly and proudly say I have no god damn clue what the hell was happening in the first 2-3 episodes of this anime, but I found myself endeared to Lisha somehow. And it was that, and frankly that alone, that kept me going all the way to ep 10. Along the way I managed to find a liking to actual best girl Krulcifer simply because she had some brass balls and wasn\'t your typical ""weak in the knees woe is me"" heroine. Everyone else, personality wise, was pretty hit or miss for me and I must add more misses than hits.For story I can almost guarantee you\'ve heard it before but essential ""Guy has a past he doesn\'t really wanna talk about cause some bad shit happened when he meets Girl A whom he ends up in a precariously sexual situation with so they fight it out but he wins which means hes now husbando then Girls B, C, and D start falling all over him because, you guessed it, he\'s amazing at everything which means that he\'s reliable because characters without personality are immune to plot contrivances like death and character development that might force him to choose someone interesting."" Throw in some military intrigue, a mech suit straight outta Infinite Stratos, and plenty of fan service and you have the standard harem anime that is Infinite Stratos..... I mean Bahamut.Art actually isn\'t all that bad. I don\'t have any major complaints here, I think the scenery was well done, weapons and armors were well designed, I can even see that effort went into designing the characters decently.

All I can say is that there was more than 5 occasions where I sat here and thought ""well that doesn\'t sound right"" which is a big deal for me. It\'s 5 more than what\'s necessary and it really pulls you out of what little story the show does have.In summary I give the anime 5/10Like I said in the beginning, it\'s my opinion that this anime is like a break between the last good anime you watched and the next one you watch and for that purpose, it filled its role quite nicely.

Colour me surprised, since most of their shows are low quality garbage.In the case of this series, as much as it is for the famous (and precariously overused) Sengoku era warrior Oda Nobunaga, it was a heck of a wild ride knowing his young life, and quite possibly the road and path to the great warrior of which we all know him by in long-lasting fashion of history footnotes.The only seemingly ""orígjnal"" stuff that the production staff added into the mix was the BL aspect of the male characters that seemingly is the trial and tribulations...of followers and retainers of the central characters Nobunaga and his brother Nobukatsu. Needless to say, as much as it as for being otome-ish, being a straight guy watching Otome shows isn\'t my shtick, but it\'s full of loopholes and the uncomfortable feelings of manipulation.

Kokoro Toshokan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/799/Kokoro_Toshokan,"['Once more my passion for ""oddness"" rears its super-deformed head, this time bringing me a bemusing, yet slightly surreal, take on libraries.Kokoro Toshokan originally began as a manga by Takagi Nobuyuki in 2001. The popularity of the series led to it quickly being adapted as a TV series direct by Masuanri Koji (Read or Die TV & OVA, Kamichu!), and the influence of both the mangaka and the director really stands out in the anime.The story is about a library situated in the mountains. This is Kokoro Library, and it is run by three sisters - Iina (eldest), Aruto (middle), and Kokoro (youngest). The...two eldest sisters are fully qualified librarians, however Kokoro is still in training. The library is important to all three sisters as it was built by their parents shortly after a war destroyed the old city library, and whilst the sisters work hard to maintain it, it also doubles as their home.Now viewers may find themselves a little bit bemused by the story in the first few episodes, as nothing major really happens. It\'s almost pure slice of life, however this may turn some people off the show. There are a few slightly surreal elements introduced into the series as it progresses, which gives the latter half of the show a slightly dream-like quality (something which was used to great effect a few years later in Aria), and it\'s these inclusions that add a certain refreshing quality to the show.In addition to this, whilst the series is mainly episodic, the last few episodes do have a pretty decent plot, and explain some of the history of the library, and why it\'s considered important.The art style is pretty good overall. The characters are designed to look like individuals, however I did wonder why the three sisters had to wear what look like maid uniforms, as it seemed a bit odd for a library uniform. The supporting characters are also well done, however there is a certain genericness to them, as well as to the sundry townsfolk. That said, there are some features of the character designs which could have been improved upon, however as the design follows that of the mangaka, I feel that this can be forgiven.The backgrounds and scenery are very well done, giving the series a slightly quaint, rural feeling which belies some of the more strange story elements (androids for example). The timeframe used for the series seems to be that of the early to mid 20th century, and this is reflected in the clothing and transport used throughout the show.The sound is very good throughout the series. The effects are pleasant, and add to the atmosphere of a given scene. The thematic music generally works very well within the boundaries of the series, often adding to the dream-like quality of the show, however there are some moments where the track choice may seem odd. The OP, a song called ""Beagle"", is a rather pleasant track that wouldn\'t be out of place in a theatre musical. The ED is pretty much the same, featuring a melodic, yet slightly off-kilter vibe (this was done on purpose though, and adds to the effect of the song).The characters are pleasant, if nothing truly outstanding. I found all three sisters to have a certain amount of charm, as did several of the supporting characters. However, the series never really tries to develop its cast to any great degree, yet even with this factor Kokoro Toshokan is still enjoyable to watch (very much like Aria and Binchou-tan, although this series preceded both by a few years).There will be people out there who dislike this sort of show, as they like their anime to have a strong story, excellent animation, well developed characters, lot\'s of T & A, fights, explosions, guns, people looking cool while eating crisps, etc, etc. Kokoro Toshokan is severaly lacking in most of that list (it does have guns and explosions at one point though), yet it is still a nice way to spend half an hour.On the other hand, fans of Aria will probably like this show, as it has many of the elements that made Aria a joy to watch. As a slice of life show it works really well, pleasantly mixing various elements to produce a show that, whilst lacking certain ""polished"" qualities, is far more charming overall than many other series with bigger budgets and stronger casts.It\'s worth giving it a try if you have a little time to spare. two eldest sisters are fully qualified librarians, however Kokoro is still in training.

Cuteness and good background music is nowhere near enough to save an anime where meaninglessness is allowed to run amok to this extreme degree.Many anime are slow paced, but in Kokoro library time almost stops.

If there was any comedic ambitions with Kokoro library, the creators have another failure on their list.AnimationTechnically good, but character design is awful. The only one that looks even remotely good is the homophobic sister. The rest of...the cast is cursed with horrible haircuts, boring facial expressions and a wardrobe that makes your eyes bleed.Backgrounds and the general feel of the library is nice, though. Seems like a cousy place, but I wouldn\'t go there until someone strangled the librarians.SoundOP/ED are uninteresting, bordering to bad, but background music is unusually good. Well composed and performed, it increases the cousy feel of the library.Voice acting is average as far as I could tell. I was kind of preoccupied being irritated on the stupid things the characters said, so I didn\'t pay much attention to the accoustic qualities of those stupid things.StoryThere is no story. Towards the end comes an explanation of part of the setting, but it doesn\'t justify all the stupid fillers up to that point.CharacterThe three librarians are cute, innocent (kinda) and stupid beyond repair. Almost nothing they do feels motivated or rational. They overreact, underreact and come up with one breathtakingly meaningless idea after another.Stay away! the cast is cursed with horrible haircuts, boring facial expressions and a wardrobe that makes your eyes bleed.Backgrounds and the general feel of the library is nice, though.

Almost nothing they do feels motivated or rational. They overreact, underreact and come up with one breathtakingly meaningless idea after another.Stay away!', ""Now, well it's normally not within my forte to mention other reviews, I would like to point out that this anime is most definitely not bad enough to receive the lowest score possible. That person must have just had something against the genres this anime represents. If you read that review first, I highly suggest reading this as well before you decide to avoid this anime altogether.Kokoro Toshokan follows the titular Kokoro as she has random adventures around her library. Thanks to my general loving of the Slice of Life genre, I very much enjoyed all of the relaxing tones that this anime offered me....And, surprisingly, I'd even have the nerve to say the background music has potential to be in my favorite anime OSTs simply because it perfectly captures the essence of the genre it's categorized in. Comedy is also warm and innocent, but nothing too memorable with a few exceptions.The most memorable episode of the entire anime is definitely the origin of the library which was very beautiful and a highlight in the anime for sure. If the rest of it was like that episode in terms of writing, I would have given it a much higher score for sure.So, I think Kokoro Toshokan is certainly worth your time if you like the genre, as the soundtrack complements it very well and it definitely has potential to satisfy any fans of the Slice of Life genre. I can't possibly give it anything lower than above average since it is a very nice anime to watch and I could easily see myself giving it another look in the future just for when I decide to marathon some of my favorites.I teared up surprisingly more than I expected to with the drama moments as well, so the anime is fitting of being in that genre as well, despite primarily being about the other two. I want to say it was for sure the soundtrack that made me feel so emotional, though I am definitely very sad that it's a very rare anime soundtrack to come across. I did search for it for hours, but came up with nothing. Would certainly love to learn the piano songs myself someday.Extra Thoughts (CONTAINS SPOILERS)Speaking of the score, although I believed this anime reached my standard quota, I had to shave off some of my score due to an unusually sexual scene present in the anime. For what it had given me in the first two episodes, it just came off as strange to witness.In particular, and I am only spoiling this for those uncomfortable with the stuff and decided to mention it down here since it did not pace very well in the overall review, the third episode starts off Aruto sleeping, Kokoro coming to wake her up and being made out with.It seemed innocent at first, since it felt like Aruto was just kissing her on the mouth due to dreaming of her lover or something and I expected it to end with Kokoro jumping back right after, but you hear moaning in it and it feels a bit unpleasant to watch since it goes on for a little while (with Kokoro not even resisting) before Iina steps in. And I don't mean the moan you hear when a girl is surprised, oh no. You actually do hear her moan for a while. And if anyone is even a bit familiar with how kissing in anime goes, you know that moaning means there's french kissing involved. Really, having to hear it for that long felt like it was meant to be in another anime. I'd say there was just enough going on where I'd even go so far as to say that anyone that watches Ecchi stuff may have actually been aroused by this.The scene is actually kind of funny since it reveals to the audience that Iina follows the trope of being obsessed with her younger sister and it has a running gag I actually enjoyed throughout the episode, but for what seems like a mostly innocent anime to have such a sexual scene that has both yuri and incest in it comes off as too random and partially disturbing, even though the humor is still mildly fitting with the rest of the anime. I know it's also inadvertent on Aruto's end since she was sleeping, but still.Oh, I also forgot to mention that after Iina stops Aruto, she too is made out with; again, moaning is heard for a bit, but it's not nearly as long as it was with Kokoro. Afterwards, she goes on to say it was an indirect kiss with Kokoro, clearly showing that she has a bit of a disturbed obsession with her. And throughout the anime after this scene, you can blatantly see it.If you actually are uncomfortable with this stuff, though, and decided to take a peek down here anyway before watching the anime yourself, my suggestion is to skip to the 3:02 mark of the episode, assuming you are watching it right as the episode starts and there is no extra stuff at the beginning. The title card of the episode even shows up around here anyway, so it feels like the opening portion was more of an extra.

Kore ga Watashi no Goshujinsama,https://myanimelist.net/anime/412/Kore_ga_Watashi_no_Goshujinsama,"['For a show titled He is My Master I am not sure what I expected.  I had just finished watching a rather long series and I was in the mood for something light hearted and short. In the end this wasn’t that bad of a show at all.The story isn’t anything really special but it does have charm in its own way.  Basically Izumi and her sister movie in to Yoshitaka\'s mansion to become live in maids because they have run away from home, presumably because they won’t let Mitsuki keep her pet alligator there.  Yoshitaka insists on them calling him master...and of course he is a pervert and makes them wear all kinds of skimpy clothes, spies on them in the bath, etc.  We will forget the fact that these are like 13 year old girls, I mean this is anime if you’re offended by lolicon you probably aren’t watching anymore.  Izumi is clumsy so she ends up breaking a lot of stuff in the mansion which Yoshitaka makes her responsible for in order to keep her in the mansion.  So much of the story revolves around how much debt she is in and her getting out of it.  It’s nothing really special but it enables enough jokes to make it fun.  The humor gets a little repetitive at times but not so much that I lost interest.Izumi and her sister Mitsuki are fun characters.  Most of the story revolves around embarrassing Izumi, either with the outfits she has to wear, or the work she has to do, or getting her clothes ripped off by the love crazy alligator or the 3rd maid Anna who is madly in love with her.  There is not really a lot of character depth, besides getting to know their basic personalities that’s pretty much all you learn about them.  But I did find them all to be likable.Meh.  The animation is all I can say.  I really find it to be pathetic.  They talk out of the sides of their faces when in profile, they constantly have blush under their eyes and the colors used seem to be washed out and dull.  I was going to punish this show in my final rating because of the crappy art but in the end I decided not to.  The voice acting is pretty good and the music is ok but it’s not anything really great.Overall I wasn’t sure what I wanted to give this show for its final grade.  I had initially leaned towards a ""6"", but after thinking about it some I decided to go one better.  Visually it isn’t much to look at but it did have a lot of comedy moments in it and is not too perverted.  If you want a harmless little piece of fluff that will give you some laughs then I recommend He is My Master. and of course he is a pervert and makes them wear all kinds of skimpy clothes, spies on them in the bath, etc.  We will forget the fact that these are like 13 year old girls, I mean this is anime if you’re offended by lolicon you probably aren’t watching anymore.

There are pieces missing and even the pieces you have don't seem to go together very well.  This is what He Is My Master is like.Story:  The storyline is very...basic.  Essentially almost every episode is introduced as: OK! Let's have a contest today where Yoshitaka get's beaten up by Izumi in about thirty different ways after he tries to look up her skirt. By the fourth episode it was getting a little boring.  I have no problem with slapstick humor, but this starts to become like Love...Hina, it gets really tiring to watch a guy get punched in the face and watch him ricochet off the wall a million times.Art: The art is, ok.  I never was never amazed by the art, I never saw a scene and was floored by it. The art doesn't detract from the anime except in a few certain scenes where the sequences are very awkward, but that was it.  The characters are very nicely drawn, I liked all of them, but Anna was a little too plain and i still have to occasionally check to remember what she looks like.Sound: I didn't pay too much attention to the music in any anime, for me it's a subtle thing where I notice if it's amazing or if it's horrible.  The music is.....typical.Character: Yoshitaka......I love him.  As a main character he is absolutely perfect.  When I first heard this title I was like &quot;hehe....I can be THEIR master&quot; and a whole bunch of other double entendres my friends thought were hilarious. I was expecting the main guy to be very polite, kind, sort of...forced to live with these beautiful maids.  Man....i've never been so happily shocked in my life.  The guy is a complete pervert, I love how they've given his character absolutely no redeeming points other than that he never gives up.  I didn't pay attention too much to the other characters....they seemed a little too typical.  Izumi hates/loves him.....Mutsuki is too busy manipulating everyone and is always behind the scenes and Anna...well...if you watch you'll see.Enjoyment: I did actually enjoy this anime, even though I don't personally think that it's that great.  Most of the time I was enjoying myself because I wasn't thinking about what was actually going on.  So just turn off your brain and enjoy yourself.  Cause if you think about this anime there will be times when you're going to be asking yourself &quot;...................what?&quot;  I know I did.Overall: Well....there is one thing this anime does very well...and I want to end on it.  Boobs.  This anime is a prime example of where pretty girls enhance an anime. It's also a great example of how pretty girls cannot be the sole redeeming feature of an anime.  But seriously....the girls in here....are really pretty.  Izumi is supposed to be 14 or 15....and if I ever find a 14 year old who looks like that...I'm going to make her my maid as well.  Guys are going to like this anime alot more than girls....unless you girls are into boobs.  If you're looking for story....go somewhere else. Anyone wanting some mindless ecchi entertainment, come here.

The title was He is my Master, and yet I didn&rsquo;t see the possibilities of fan service at all.I&rsquo;m not into fan service (unless it&rsquo;s fan service for girls, which is rare) and usually too much fan service hinders me from liking an anime, but for some reason, this anime wasn&rsquo;t too bad. The story was ok, a bit mediocre (to be expected from ecchi series, huh), it was kinda funny at times, and it was easy to understand. Also, for some reason, I didn&rsquo;t think the fan service here was not as vulgar as in...other ecchi series I&rsquo;ve seen, like Maburaho. Maybe the fact that the fan service was an integral part of the series made me think that way. I would also like to note that it ended considerably well, and was able to match my expectations.Another huge cast of characters in this one. Surprisingly, the main characters (Izumi, Mitsuki, Anna and Yoshitaka) had good chemistry among them. As for the other characters, they lacked charisma and forgettable. What&rsquo;s even more annoying is the fact that they introduced one more character towards the end (as if there weren&rsquo;t enough characters for a 12 episode anime already) and I can&rsquo;t remember her name either. All that I remember is that she&rsquo;s just as annoying as Izumi, who&rsquo;s probably one of the dimmest anime characters I have seen. Mitsuki was cool though &ndash; she was cutesy, but not annoying. Same goes for their younger sister Karin, who&rsquo;s twice as adorable as Mitsuki.Speaking of the characters, they have to be the horniest cast of characters I&rsquo;ve seen ever since please teacher! Everything dirty you can think of is in this anime &ndash; Lolicons, a dominatrix, S&amp;M, incest, pedophilia, girl to girl love love and more. That incest bothered me the most, but it was discreet and disappeared from the storyline after Karin was introduced, so I forgot about it a bit.Drawing style was average. The landscapes, colors and details were really good, and there was even use of CG (Minimal), but the people were poorly drawn. I am surprised at the quality of the art style shown during the ending theme sequence &ndash; I&rsquo;m assuming they&rsquo;re from the manga version. If so, The manga version definitely had better illustrations.The music was okay. For some reason, I felt the opening didn&rsquo;t compliment the series very well &ndash; something was a bit off. However, I did like the ending theme. It was cutesy, and it was definitely for the anime. The BGM wasn&rsquo;t bad either, if not, it was good. It fit the scenes very well, and I like the BGM that was played whenever Izumi would show off some skin and Pochi the alligator would get all hot and bothered (I can&rsquo;t believe I said &ldquo;hot and bothered&rdquo;) The voice acting wasn&rsquo;t bad either. I thought it matched the characters very well, and I didn&rsquo;t think it went against the characters&rsquo; personalities.I have to say it wasn&rsquo;t bad. All throughout I kept thinking to myself that it was better than Maburaho, the last ecchi I have seen. I&rsquo;m not a fan of ecchi at all too, so saying that this anime wasn&rsquo;t bad means I&rsquo;m speaking highly of it. other ecchi series I&rsquo;ve seen, like Maburaho.

Its true purpose is mindless repetition and ecchi shots, anything else is purely coincidental.If you watch this show you must keep in mind that the show mainly evolves around middle schoolers, which means they all have a middle school mentality and do not know very much about adult life, other than the sexual parts. And the deciding factors throughout the entire series are contests between two or more people. So, for example when they were fighting for someones love, a contest would commence.Story 5/10There really isn't any story to go on since...the majoirty of the show was pretty much random. The story starts out with Izumi and her sister running away from home. While walking along a side walk they find a sign claiming that the owner of this giant mansion is looking for live-in maids and that is where it all starts. The story dives a little deeper about 8 episodes later, but it is almost completely irrelevant when there is so much randomness happening.Sound 7/10Although the sound wasn't top notch there were a few moments where the music was good and the music almost always suited the moods, that's usually because the moods were almost-always carefree and energetic.Character 6/10Although there is very little character development, this doesn't detract from the story. You will learn a little about each character but everything is pretty much skin-deep.Art 6/10The art is pretty much what you'd expect from a show that was released in the early 2000's.  The art doesn't show a lot of ecchi moments, there are not a lot of panty shots, but there is a lot of cleavage and sexy dresses to go around. I suppose giving a middle schooler a sexy dress is less offensive than giving a 6 year old one, so there's at least a good thing.Enjoyment 6/10After a while I got very bored of this show. If there wasn't any ecchi shots going on, they would be doing some kind of mindless contest. Like before, you must consider a middle-schoolers mentality when watching this show. I don't typically like it when the main male protaginist is a pervert always wanting to grope every chick he sees, but in this case it was really bad when it was a middle schooler doing those things.Overall, after 13 episodes I was finally relieved that I was done with this show.

Um...Jesus Christ, what the hell is there possitive to say about this anime? If I have to say three things, the animation is way better than this show deserves, and the opening theme is decent, not good, just decent, and the character designs are cute, when they're not being exploited.Now on to the bad (warning: this may take a while to read, but be assured it will be funny, yet a little repulsive in its details.)I'm not even going to sugar coat it, this is one of the ABSOLUTE...WORST animes I have ever seen, and it makes me cringe, even as I'm just sitting at my computer typing about it. And to think this was made by M-F(#*ING GAINAX. That's right, the studio behind this...thing...is also responsible for Evangelion, Gunbuster, Daikon, Gurren Lagann, and FLCL. Unbelievable.There are numerous huge problems with this anime, so lets just start it off with the most obvious problem, the comedic writing. The laws of laughter tell us that a joke repeated too often loses its effectiveness overtime. Unfortunately, the writers of He is My Master never realized this, since the entire joke repetoir (I'm not an spelling major) consists of nothing but boob/panty/butt/bra/all of the above jokes. What makes this writing even more dreadfull is the fact that all these situations happen to 12-14 year old girls! So in addition to being lazy, the writing is also borderline pedophilic in nature. What is funny about seeing a 14 year old girl lose her bra, punch Yoshitaka across the room for looking, having another girl Anna (sorry I forgot there's another girl working there Anna, who has a pre-coming out of the closet crush on Izumi, at age 12 nonetheless) fantasizing about sleeping with a barely older 14 year old, all while an alligator(Pochi, dont even ask me to explain him) fantasizes about the same 14 year old girl, all within the timespan of 5 minutes?(my god that was a mouthfull) Simple answer: NOTHING! The writing in this anime is a cynical excersize in laziness and pedophilia.As if that wasn't bad enough, none of the characters are likeable in any way. Yoshitaka is just a douche-bag whose sole purpose in life is to exploit underage girls in his maid outfits. Izumi is nothing but a idiot, for one running away since there are no signs of anything like abuse or anything like that, and two actually accepting this job. Anna, who I mentioned earlier, is a 12 year old girl who develops a borderline psychotic crush on Izumi, is just irritating to an almost science fiction level. Her constant wanting to be around Izumi is another way to slip in pedophilia in this show, this time in the form of lesbianism. The one good character in this show is the blonde sister Mitsuki, only because I don't know what to think of her. She seems totally fine about her job and its requirements and is somehow a master computer hacker (this girl can hardly dress herself without falling over, yet she can hack the computer system of an entire mansion), but she's essentially the obligatory blonde bimbo for any anime like this.In conclusion, let me just sum it up this way: I watched a grand total of 3 episodes of He is My Master. Each episode has about 30 jokes, so a grand total of 90 jokes. I chuckled 1 time, cringed 89 times. He is My Master, in short, is just garbage. For the love of all that is holy and good in this world, avoid this thing like the plague.Footnote: If you REALLY want to test your endurance for how much you can take of this series, watch episode 8. It introduces Izumi and Mitsuki's younger sister, 8 year old Karin, who while at the mansion trys on and walks around in a custom made maid outfit. Yea...an 8 year old, in a sexy maid outfit, whose father and mother find nothing at all wrong about this. It's official, this anime was indeed made by pedophiles. WORST animes I have ever seen, and it makes me cringe, even as I'm just sitting at my computer typing about it. And to think this was made by M-F(#*ING GAINAX. That's right, the studio behind this...thing...is also responsible for Evangelion, Gunbuster, Daikon, Gurren Lagann, and FLCL. Unbelievable.There are numerous huge problems with this anime, so lets just start it off with the most obvious problem, the comedic writing. The laws of laughter tell us that a joke repeated too often loses its effectiveness overtime. Unfortunately, the writers of He is My Master never realized this, since the entire joke repetoir (I'm not an spelling major) consists of nothing but boob/panty/butt/bra/all of the above jokes. What makes this writing even more dreadfull is the fact that all these situations happen to 12-14 year old girls! So in addition to being lazy, the writing is also borderline pedophilic in nature. What is funny about seeing a 14 year old girl lose her bra, punch Yoshitaka across the room for looking, having another girl Anna (sorry I forgot there's another girl working there Anna, who has a pre-coming out of the closet crush on Izumi, at age 12 nonetheless) fantasizing about sleeping with a barely older 14 year old, all while an alligator(Pochi, dont even ask me to explain him) fantasizes about the same 14 year old girl, all within the timespan of 5 minutes?(my god that was a mouthfull) Simple answer: NOTHING! The writing in this anime is a cynical excersize in laziness and pedophilia.As if that wasn't bad enough, none of the characters are likeable in any way. Yoshitaka is just a douche-bag whose sole purpose in life is to exploit underage girls in his maid outfits. Izumi is nothing but a idiot, for one running away since there are no signs of anything like abuse or anything like that, and two actually accepting this job. Anna, who I mentioned earlier, is a 12 year old girl who develops a borderline psychotic crush on Izumi, is just irritating to an almost science fiction level.

The reason they moved out was just silly, and in every episode they had some sort of contest, and that irritated me a lot. I also disliked the fact, that the storyline took some too unlikely turns. Other than that, you can say that this is very shounen, with fast pace and high intensity. At least I wasn't bored.ArtThe animation was okay I guess, but nothing more. I didn't really like how the characters were drawn.SoundI found the soundtrack lame, with cheesy background songs. Opening...theme was mediocre as well, but the ending was kinda good. There were some good voiceactors here, at least.CharacterThe characters weren't that good, to be honest. Yoshitaka is the kind of male character that gets on my nerves, with his behavior. Izumi was okay, and Mitsuki too, but she was too much into the contest she came up with all the time. Anna-chan I liked a bit, because she was funny, and she spiced up the series. As for the side-characters, they were either lame, perverted, bland or boring. Meh, most of the characters were there just to let the creators make some more ecchi-moments. And what's up with having an alligator almost as a main character?EnjoymentThe show entertained me, at the least. It was a funny and brainless watch.OverallThis is the first show i rate as a 5, but there were simply too many things that irritated me to give it anything higher.

The art and way the show was drawn was what initially made me want to watch it, because the scenery it shows is the more beautiful than I've noticed in any other anime.

Lemon Angel Project,https://myanimelist.net/anime/671/Lemon_Angel_Project,"[""I finished Lemon Angel Project just yesterday and I noticed that it didn't have a review yet, so I thought I'd do the honours &lt;3STORYLemon Angel Project is set in the year 2017, and is about Tomo Minaguchi, a girl who's close friend and senpai Yui recently died due to &quot;unknown causes&quot;. While she was still alive, Yui told Tomo that she felt happy and full of life when Tomo sang, and she was also the creator of the popular all-girl group called the &quot;Lemon Angel Project&quot;, who mysteriously vanished shortly before Yui's death.A year and a half later, Tomo, along with other girls, tries...out to become a member of the new and revived Lemon Angel Project.Basically, it sounds dull, simple and recycled, right? Haha. That is so wrong. Lemon Angel Project is far from mindless and it actually covers a lot of things rarely seen in shoujo anime, such as bullying people from other countries.ARTThe art was beautiful! I didn't notice the backgrounds very much, but the people were pretty much always drawn beautifully. Especially Erika; her hair was done beautifully. I think it deserved a 9/10. Nothing to complain about ;3SOUNDHeck, I loved the OP song, Angel Addict. It fitted the series just perfectly and was one of those songs that made me just want to stand up and dance, and that doesn't happen all that often ;3 there was a great number of insert songs and songs used in the auditions, and each of them was beautiful and fitted what was going on perfectly. 10/10!CHARACTERI thought that the characters were going to be simple and standard, because I shamefully based my initial thoughts on this series on Kirarin Revolution. Oh how wrong I was. One or two characters are standard and recycled, such as Fuyumi, but others stood out so well. The one who was the most unique was Erika Campbell. I won't describe her here since I think you need to watch the series rather than read this to fully understand how she is different.ENJOYMENTLet me just say, this is the ONLY series that has kept me up watching until gone midnight. I marathoned the first 7 episodes because it was just so darn addicting; I wanted to see more and more!I don't like idol series, or series about girls trying to become famous singers. But this one was so different, I can't understand why it's rated so lowly here on MAL ;3; I enjoyed pretty much every minute of Lemon Angel Project, and I'd gladly watch it all over again.OVERALLOverall, Lemon Angel Project was fantastic. It had lots of things in it that I really wouldn't have expected, and it was pleasantly surprising in that sense. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a all-female main cast &lt;3 out to become a member of the new and revived Lemon Angel Project.Basically, it sounds dull, simple and recycled, right? Haha. That is so wrong. Lemon Angel Project is far from mindless and it actually covers a lot of things rarely seen in shoujo anime, such as bullying people from other countries.ARTThe art was beautiful! I didn't notice the backgrounds very much, but the people were pretty much always drawn beautifully. Especially Erika; her hair was done beautifully. I think it deserved a 9/10. Nothing to complain about ;3SOUNDHeck, I loved the OP song, Angel Addict. It fitted the series just perfectly and was one of those songs that made me just want to stand up and dance, and that doesn't happen all that often ;3 there was a great number of insert songs and songs used in the auditions, and each of them was beautiful and fitted what was going on perfectly. 10/10!CHARACTERI thought that the characters were going to be simple and standard, because I shamefully based my initial thoughts on this series on Kirarin Revolution. Oh how wrong I was. One or two characters are standard and recycled, such as Fuyumi, but others stood out so well. The one who was the most unique was Erika Campbell. I won't describe her here since I think you need to watch the series rather than read this to fully understand how she is different.ENJOYMENTLet me just say, this is the ONLY series that has kept me up watching until gone midnight. I marathoned the first 7 episodes because it was just so darn addicting; I wanted to see more and more!I don't like idol series, or series about girls trying to become famous singers. But this one was so different, I can't understand why it's rated so lowly here on MAL ;3; I enjoyed pretty much every minute of Lemon Angel Project, and I'd gladly watch it all over again.OVERALLOverall, Lemon Angel Project was fantastic. It had lots of things in it that I really wouldn't have expected, and it was pleasantly surprising in that sense. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a all-female main cast &lt;3"", ""I realise that reviews criticising the anime are rated as 'not helpful' a lot, but I want to say that I'm not trying to criticise the anime, just trying to help people get a better idea of it =]Story:Usually I don't like futuristic stories because I don't like sci-fi stories, but for once, the future year setting does NOT have anything to do with the anime except for more advanced technology. Overall, the story was quite, well, normal. It's quite obvious from the start who's going to be the star of the show, so even at the parts where it's supposed to make you tense...with suspense (rhyme =D) you don't feel anything XD BUT. Suddenly, as you watch the last few episodes, the truth suddenly begins unraveling rapidly and keeps you on your toes. And the last episode is simply sweet ;DArt:The art might look pretty good at first, but when you look closer, you can see that the way they draw the girls aren't so good. The head-body proportions are...kind of weird o_O But other than that, it's good ^^ Nothing to comment on, really, as it's not really a big feature of the anime, not like Clannad, or Sola.Sound:Hm... This is supposed to be a musical anime, right? However, some of the songs I found were not up to my expectations. Other times, the songs are really beautiful, the most beautiful in my opinion Watashi wo Sagashite as it's really meaningful =D So it's really up to you, as many people have different tastes.Character:Well... As you watch the first few episodes, you'll find out something about the main character: she is very, VERY annoying. But miraculously, she suddenly becomes not annoying in the later episodes -_- Other than that, I think the characters were okay, but none of them were very outstanding. The most outstanding character, in my opinion, is Erika, for obvious reasons (and not her skin colour).Enjoyment:The enjoyment wasn't consistent throughout the whole series, but rather, I find that the anime keeps you relaxed and non-expectant in the first few episodes whereas as the show progresses it starts to build up and gradually the enjoyment meter rises. Thankfully the series is short, so you don't feel bored for too long XDOverall:I almost wanted to give it an 8, but I decided 7 would be better because of the significant lack of consistency - good in some of the SAME area, bad in some of the SAME area. But that's just my opinion, and I want to share it with you. I hope you'll find my opinion of this anime useful in deciding whether you want to watch it or not! ;D with suspense (rhyme =D) you don't feel anything XD BUT.

I scoffed at the title and decided to click the link and read the synopsis just for the sake of a cheap laugh. And just like that, on a whim, I subjected myself to Lemon Angel Project, possibly a hidden gem that got lost in the unforgiving trends of the anime season.Before I rip it to shreds, I’ll just get it out in the open that I liked LAP despite its shortcomings, of which there are many. It’s a short feel-good series that’s hard...to dislike, with heartwarming moments and catchy J-Pop tunes abound.With that said…There are many good reasons why this was likely forgotten by everyone, and most likely doesn’t deserve a high place on anybody’s To Watch list. It’s a show that lacks subtlety and finesse, barreling straight on into a clunky mess of a story without any warning. Aesthetically, the animation isn’t great. It was a series from 2006, but even by those standards it doesn’t look like a fresh face.It isn’t terrible, but the appearance is just so mundane that it’s hard to keep watching for the aesthetics alone. With the animation and art style alike denounced as mundane, it’d better have a story to make up for the lackluster visuals. After all, Welcome to the NHK didn’t look too good and that’s a classic in my books. [C] is looking hilariously off model most times, but it’s too interesting just to be held up by that.Fortunately, there is a story in there. It’s just so predictable and obvious that the show almost doesn’t win points for it. The synopsis is essentially as follows: Tomo, oddly enough the only girl with an odd hair color in the universe aside from the foreign girl (Who’s made painfully obvious is foreign, but more on that later), witnessed the disappearance of her favorite pop supergroup, Lemon Angel, over a year before the current time.She learns that the former leader, the elusive and aloof Miki, attends her high school and so begins to stalk her.What begin as time honored Shoujou-Ai clichés quickly and thankfully change to Tomo stumbling on the dark secret of Lemon Angel and auditioning for the revival group. Along the way, she becomes more confident, makes friends, deals with her and her friends’ pasts and yadda yadda yadda. This has all been done before, and done better in Mahou Shoujo shows.To be perfectly fair though, the drama is quite effective in some places; the tsundere being humbled by an old lady being a prime example.Despite the occasional gold specks in the depressing dank of the story, these alone don’t save it. There isn’t a single challenging thought or deed, which I think has been done to attract and keep as many viewers as possible. However, it’s easy to see just how this managed to become such an obscure flop with such an approach.Okay, so the story’s a big piece of shit, but what about the characters? Surely they can hold a show on their own if they have interesting enough personalities or backgrounds. Well, hypothetical inquisitive person who I always seem to quote, that would be the case. And to give the show even more credit, one or two of the characters are a little compelling. Too bad it’s balanced by just as many flat, offensive, and just plain hyperbolic characters.For every girl in a modeling agency who wants to break free from her restraining, greedy, corrupt boss, you get two girls whose only collective goal in life are to be members of Lemon Angel. Also a gay guy who makes Liberace look like a ladies man.For every two of those, you get a villain whose only reason for existing is to make the main characters miserable just for the sake of being evil. C’mon, this is a show about five girls and their rise to fame as part of a citrus fruit/seraphim themed phenomenon. For hell’s sake, Heartcatch Precure does better characterization with their villains. I mean Kumojacky at least becomes a little less smug over time.Lemon Angel Project has little characterization, especially with the antagonists. They stay bad throughout the episodes that they feature in, and have no chance to redeem themselves. If their actions weren’t so cartoonishly villainous, they’d be marginally less boring than the color beige.Speaking of color, the focus on the foreign girl Erika Campbell and just how foreign she is doesn’t make for a very compelling plot. Then again, I’m just irritated that I never found out what her nationality really is. They say she came from South America, but being ethnically ambiguous, that would still lead to confusion over the last name Campbell, a distinctly un-Spanish/Portuguese last name. She also looks and acts similarly to Kaolla from Love Hina, so that only complicates matters more.However, where the characterization, overall plot, and animation fail, individual elements of the plot come to the rescue. It isn’t too much of a stretch to say that despite the lack of a compelling overarching narrative, the plot itself isn’t bad. I retract what I said earlier. The small elements, like Erika learning the truth behind her brother’s past and the entire train station episode, are done pretty well and with enough conviction to make me forget the lame… everything else.Since I seem to be running out of steam, there are just a few more points I’d like to make, and gripes I’d like to complain about.There are a few minor problems that I had watching it, in addition to the larger ones. These weren’t enough to really make my experience unpleasant, but they sure didn’t help LAP’s case at all.First, the main character’s voice is annoying through most of LAP, even when singing. I don’t know any kinder way to put that. Some people just don’t like it, but I found it mildly grating after a little while. Imagine Ahiru’s voice from Princess Tutu, except cracking while yelling into a wind tunnel. Now you can imagine how unbearable Tomo’s voice really is at times.Finally, the entirety of LAP was punctuated with thunderstorms to frame a dramatic moment. I can’t tell you just how unfortunate it was that every single evening and nighttime moment was accompanied by an intense rain and thunderstorm. The last episode had a particularly hilarious example where thunder would sound whenever any two characters argued. I counted four different storms, all brought on by internal strife.To summarize my first point again, Lemon Angel Project isn’t bad. It isn’t particularly imaginative or good, but you could do far worse in the coming summer months. to dislike, with heartwarming moments and catchy J-Pop tunes abound.With that said…There are many good reasons why this was likely forgotten by everyone, and most likely doesn’t deserve a high place on anybody’s To Watch list.

Erika Campbell voiced by Minori Chihara a Brazilian who came to live in Japan who is Tomo\'s genki friend in Lemon Angels, her dilemma has to do with her being a ""foreigner"" as well as her being in her younger brother rock star shadow, she gets some of the more interesting plotlines in the anime. Next is Fuyumi Sakakibara voiced by Juri Hirama a shy girl once a child actress and was childhood friends with Haruka Sendou voiced by Mia Naruse, her plotline follows Haruka the resident bully of the anime in which Fuyumi ""assisted"" Haruka until she warms up to Tomo\'s group and general ""getting over her shyness"" plotline to be expected in a shy girl archetype. Miru Nagisa voiced by Mai Kadowaki, a typical soft-spoken girl who has dreams of being in the new Lemon Angels and idolized Ann (one of the previous Lemon Angels)...she gets less focus aside from her focus episode and is probably the least developed from the main cast. Next, we have LA\'s favourite character, Saya Yuuki voiced by Ami Koshimizu, another of Tomo\'s later best friends but before that, she was a frienemy to Tomo and a tsundere towards Tomo, although her focus episode was about her corrupted Producer taking advantage of her (not that way...gravure and no singing, even though she REALLY wants to sing, that kind of advantage), she is something of a surrogate to the looking at the idol industry as a dog eat dog mentality to Tomo\'s ""fun and ditzy"" side of idol industry and because she\'a a tsundere with a bit of idol dimension to her that\'s kinda why LA took a liking to her even after her focus episode ended and she doesn\'t become a supporting character and gets involved in some of the plotlines (at times)...hmmmmmm why does she remind LA of someone...*cough* Nico~ Nico~ *cough*. Finally we have Miki Suwa voiced by Miki Maruyama, the leader of the newer Lemon Angel Project, she the typical strict leader with a heart of gold and she has some beef with Tomo mainly because of Tomo\'s connection to Yui, the original creator of the Lemon Angels. Character wise, the characters have a bit of dimension to them (mainly Erika and Saya in this regard) though the majority are stereotypical though it\'s not a bad thing due to the subject matter of looking into dog eat dog, scandal-driven, training from hell idol industry.In terms of animation from Radix is overall ok from it\'s time, from the character designs to backgrounds, though LA will quite honestly say that at times there were typical facial derps to low quality widepan of shots at times with Episode 12 being the hardest hit by this. Even though LA said that the backgrounding was ""ok"", they at best were the least remarkable thing from the animation department. LA isn\'t being harsh about the animation by the way, LA DOES realize it was made back in 2006, it would have a few issues and looking at it now at the time of writing this review, it has problems sure...but it doesn\'t outright make the anime bad, LA is merely pointing out that the animation was ""ok"" or at least acceptable even back in 2006...though some people might beg to differ.Ohhh now onto the voice acting and let\'s get the elephant out of the room with voice acting and to those who knows what LA is talking about...it\'s Tomo Minaguchi\'s voice actor Ryou Shihono. Now LA sees what they wanted from Tomo with Ryou\'s vocals, as in the one ordinary ""real teenager"" vocals but with a flipside of a decent singing voice and the surprise that allows this main character to be somewhat unique...but at the cost of having those ""real teenager"" vocals to be both stiff and constantly monotoned. LA doesn\'t outright hate the choice of Ryou Shihono as Tomo LA is just more confused about the direction than hating her vocals, this is because the rest of the voice cast is typical moe and ""anime-esque"" vocals yet Tomo\'s character is the only one that isn\'t and again if it\'s for uniqueness at the cost of having monotoned and stiff vocals...LA just didn\'t get the direction given to Ryou Shihono because of this...thankfully her ""normal cadence"" didn\'t ""completely"" ruin the anime but LA just wanted to talk about Ryou Shihono and this ""rant"" about her, isn\'t LA raging about her more or less confused about her vocal direction. *ahem* moving on...to the rest of the voice cast...well the rest of the voice cast as LA said above is pretty decent and with some well known voice actors with good singing talent at that, from Minori Chihara, Mai Kadowaki and Ami Koshimizu with some one time (seriously) anime character roles of Juri Hirama and the aforementioned Ryou Shihono. LA\'s favourite voice actor quite obviously going to Ami Koshimizu as her role as Saya is something of a ""playing against the type"" before she even had a typecast of a bishoujo action girl. Nonetheless...the voice cast is a generally ok to better singing but with one confusing vocal direction LA just couldn\'t place.Now, want to know LA\'s ""problems"" about Lemon Angel Project...well let\'s get the easiest one out of the way, that being that the ""villains"" of the anime (and yes to be honest there are some) are stock and blatantly evil or horrible character just to make the main cast look better in comparison and it works!, from the aforementioned Saya\'s corrupted Producer to Haruka Sendou, an arrogant, narcissistic bully diva to Tomo\'s group to the scandal-driven photographer. Hell, even when Haruka gets ""redemption""...LA STILL didn\'t like her afterwards and kinda got what she deserved for what she did and how the anime portrayed her, the only defense to all these villains is oddly the MAJOR ""Villain"" of this anime being Shinya Himuro voiced by Takehito Koyasu as he isn\'t a two-bit corporate evil dude, he actually gives us a moral grey area to the idol industry concerning the previous and current Lemon Angels. The other problem is that, well, Lemon Angel Project as an anime trying to look at the production side of the idol industry, it\'s definitely more character driven than looking at the production side of things, though the few times it does it helps defend this anime and somewhat justified. The last problem and this was LA\'s pure opinion on this, was that many of the ""surprise plot twists"" were kinda predictable sans the final few episodes, this is obviously due to the ""evil corporate or paparazzi doing evil things to destroy the Lemon Angels"" and everything but quite early on the plot twists of Lemon Angel main cast forming to their trials and tribulations they go through was too predictable ...but again, LA\'s opinion on the matter and to this defense, the latter plotlines like the final episodes as well as Erika\'s focus episodes were written better to steer away from this flaw.LA kinda find this anime admirable that an anime from 2006 even looking at the ""dark side"" of the idol industry no matter how stupidly coincidental it takes it kinda living up to it\'s name of ""LEMON"" Angel Project, it\'s still an interesting outlier for an idol anime even before it started catching on much later (look at Wake Up Girls and Cinderella Girls 2nd Season).The finale arc deals with the secrets of the previous Lemon Angel Project being revealed to the main cast and the previous Lemon Angel butting heads with the current ones in a music festival. Really this final arc was meant for Tomo and Miki with a little on Miru for her idolization of Ann as a catalyst to start revealing the secrets of the previous Lemon Angel Project and Miki dealing the final blow to it all. If anything though the hints were there, LA  didn\'t see this coming and the hypocrisy Miki had only made Miki in the wrong even further with the ditzy Tomo telling her what\'s what with this entire ordeal. So not only does the final episodes give Miki character development from her ""strict leader with a heart of gold"" scthick but it just made sense WHY she was strict to everyone in the first place......it still didn\'t help HOW she executed it all though. Did the final episodes go into melodrama territory with ""get the band together again"" plotlining?, yes, did the characters develop with this plotline, hell yes, did it end as predictably as it did, yes, was this final plotline good?, yes and to be honest the final few episodes helped what made LA dislike the very few early episodes and that is a good thing.Even from this Lemon Angel Project does delve into an issue about the previous and current Lemon Angels and that does go into bit of *EARLY SPOILERS*...what is it?...well it involves the previous Lemon Angels and that\'s the hint in saying if you don\'t want to know and is planning on watching this anime look away now...that the 1st Lemon Angels were virtual idols...you know like Hatsune Miku and this comes into play of what ""makes"" an idol?, sure in this time and age, virtual idols ARE technically a thing and is HUGELY popular and accepted but if they\'re just programs are they superior or inferior to the more ""human"" idols of the second Lemon Angels....unfortunately Lemon Angel Project merely grazes the surface at this issue due to it\'s character-driven narrative and could have been better discussed in the anime instead of the typical...""we sing to make others smile"" we see in almost every idol anime and the finale that we got which ended predictably with this notion as well.Lemon Angel Project has it\'s problems (vocal direction for Tomo..OK ok..dead horse, animation derps, stereotypical villains with some stereotypical characters and missed potential on a certain issue involving idols), but even with those elements, LA can get behind this anime from it\'s developed main cast, it\'s interesting concept of looking at the dark side of the idol industry even before that became a thing and a solid finale. Even if this anime\'s flaws that had a fair amount that annoyed LA both plot and character-wise but nonetheless Lemon Angel Project isn\'t for LA an underrated old gem of an idol anime, more like a polarizing yet intriguing old anime about idols and it\'s industry from 2006. Tomo Minaguchi voiced by Ryou Shihono a ditzy main character who gets some dilemma about the previous Lemon Angels and quite early, she\'s an audience surrogate when it comes to the production of idol groups. Erika Campbell voiced by Minori Chihara a Brazilian who came to live in Japan who is Tomo\'s genki friend in Lemon Angels, her dilemma has to do with her being a ""foreigner"" as well as her being in her younger brother rock star shadow, she gets some of the more interesting plotlines in the anime.

Hell, even when Haruka gets ""redemption""...LA STILL didn\'t like her afterwards and kinda got what she deserved for what she did and how the anime portrayed her, the only defense to all these villains is oddly the MAJOR ""Villain"" of this anime being Shinya Himuro voiced by Takehito Koyasu as he isn\'t a two-bit corporate evil dude, he actually gives us a moral grey area to the idol industry concerning the previous and current Lemon Angels. The other problem is that, well, Lemon Angel Project as an anime trying to look at the production side of the idol industry, it\'s definitely more character driven than looking at the production side of things, though the few times it does it helps defend this anime and somewhat justified. The last problem and this was LA\'s pure opinion on this, was that many of the ""surprise plot twists"" were kinda predictable sans the final few episodes, this is obviously due to the ""evil corporate or paparazzi doing evil things to destroy the Lemon Angels"" and everything but quite early on the plot twists of Lemon Angel main cast forming to their trials and tribulations they go through was too predictable ...but again, LA\'s opinion on the matter and to this defense, the latter plotlines like the final episodes as well as Erika\'s focus episodes were written better to steer away from this flaw.LA kinda find this anime admirable that an anime from 2006 even looking at the ""dark side"" of the idol industry no matter how stupidly coincidental it takes it kinda living up to it\'s name of ""LEMON"" Angel Project, it\'s still an interesting outlier for an idol anime even before it started catching on much later (look at Wake Up Girls and Cinderella Girls 2nd Season).The finale arc deals with the secrets of the previous Lemon Angel Project being revealed to the main cast and the previous Lemon Angel butting heads with the current ones in a music festival. Really this final arc was meant for Tomo and Miki with a little on Miru for her idolization of Ann as a catalyst to start revealing the secrets of the previous Lemon Angel Project and Miki dealing the final blow to it all. If anything though the hints were there, LA  didn\'t see this coming and the hypocrisy Miki had only made Miki in the wrong even further with the ditzy Tomo telling her what\'s what with this entire ordeal. So not only does the final episodes give Miki character development from her ""strict leader with a heart of gold"" scthick but it just made sense WHY she was strict to everyone in the first place......it still didn\'t help HOW she executed it all though. Did the final episodes go into melodrama territory with ""get the band together again"" plotlining?, yes, did the characters develop with this plotline, hell yes, did it end as predictably as it did, yes, was this final plotline good?, yes and to be honest the final few episodes helped what made LA dislike the very few early episodes and that is a good thing.Even from this Lemon Angel Project does delve into an issue about the previous and current Lemon Angels and that does go into bit of *EARLY SPOILERS*...what is it?...well it involves the previous Lemon Angels and that\'s the hint in saying if you don\'t want to know and is planning on watching this anime look away now...that the 1st Lemon Angels were virtual idols...you know like Hatsune Miku and this comes into play of what ""makes"" an idol?, sure in this time and age, virtual idols ARE technically a thing and is HUGELY popular and accepted but if they\'re just programs are they superior or inferior to the more ""human"" idols of the second Lemon Angels....unfortunately Lemon Angel Project merely grazes the surface at this issue due to it\'s character-driven narrative and could have been better discussed in the anime instead of the typical...""we sing to make others smile"" we see in almost every idol anime and the finale that we got which ended predictably with this notion as well.Lemon Angel Project has it\'s problems (vocal direction for Tomo..OK ok..dead horse, animation derps, stereotypical villains with some stereotypical characters and missed potential on a certain issue involving idols), but even with those elements, LA can get behind this anime from it\'s developed main cast, it\'s interesting concept of looking at the dark side of the idol industry even before that became a thing and a solid finale. Even if this anime\'s flaws that had a fair amount that annoyed LA both plot and character-wise but nonetheless Lemon Angel Project isn\'t for LA an underrated old gem of an idol anime, more like a polarizing yet intriguing old anime about idols and it\'s industry from 2006.']"

Love All Play,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49556/Love_All_Play,"[""I would be lying if I said this was a hidden gem or anything special at all. Love All Play is a pretty fun Badminton anime, that actually just discusses playing badminton at a somewhat competitive high school level. For a badminton fan like myself, this is actually quite special, considering the alternatives are the melodramatic Hanebado, and the utterly boring office/badminton Ryman's club.The characters are quite charming and have fun, wholesome relationships with one another. There's some drama going on in the background with our edgy boi Matsuda, and Mizushima is clearly going to have some special awesome observation powers or whatever, but...it's nothing unique and it's all fairly dull.The art is really pretty, feels like a great throwback to 80-90s anime and I really like it. Animation is pretty disappointing though, with worse badminton matches than Ryman's club, and not holding a candle against Hanebado. In a fast-paced and strategic game like Badminton, this sort of bland animation is really detrimental. Overall, I would say that the presentation of badminton is just overall dreadfully boring, but at least the practice they do is pretty accurate.I came here to watch a cool Badminton anime, but now I'm just staying for the wholesome high school club activities and competitiveness and I'm definitely enjoying it. But, in the end, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone, there's just nothing that particularly stands out in a good way. it's nothing unique and it's all fairly dull.The art is really pretty, feels like a great throwback to 80-90s anime and I really like it.

I admit I was kind of indignant seeing ""not recommended"" and the person has seen 4/5 episodes of a 25-episode anime!Second, THIS ANIME IS PERFECT! I think it\'s literally the most natural anime I\'ve ever seen, their reactions are extremely realistic and you can clearly see how each character is in their own unique way. The colors are beautiful and nice to look at, the animation is also fluid enough. I think especially the expressions and the small details, help to make up the personality of...the boys.The positive point is that there is no pedophile character or sexualization of the girls and boys. And the friendship between the boys is beautiful, even with the ones who left the team or the girls who cheer for them, everyone has a good relationship.The only negative point for me is that the matches could last longer, but even so I think they do a good job of showing us the before and after, so it fills in what we don\'t see during the matches.So if you want to see a wholesome, cute anime with characters that look like real people, this is the anime for you. the boys.The positive point is that there is no pedophile character or sexualization of the girls and boys.

I can compare this anime with the recent badminton anime (  Ryman's club ) Animation + Story, really insane but i mean even if u have a good story, the animation need to follow the story, i know being an animator is really hard in japan but i think we all prefer something well done that take a lot of times instead of something boring.. so yea i recommend reading the manga not...the anime :) the anime :)"", ""Love All, No Play.Love All Play is a disappointing badminton anime. If LIDENFILMS has taught us anything with the excellent Hanebado and Rymans Club, it’s that if you’re going to do badminton you need to make it look awesome. Dynamic camera angles, sakuga muscle animation and shuttlecock smashes are what make badminton anime so exciting to watch and Love All Play is missing all of that. The shuttlecock moves at the pace of a CG snail, the animation is stiff and clunky, honestly it stood no chance of keeping anyones attention on sports anime-ness alone.That’s a shame, because I really liked the cast. Ryou maybe...a typical high school protagonist, but he has layers and real teenage school problems. I really liked the bitter-sweet way the show dealt with him and his middle school friends realising they’re moving to different schools and having to deal with the fact that they won’t be together anymore. I also like most of the friends he makes when he get to his new schools. Sakaki is loud, but friendly and encouraging, Kouki is a Chinese student who's calm and collected, but easily bamboozled and Akira is completely new to the club and the sport which is something I don’t think I’ve ever seen in a sports anime before and leads to some wholesome scenes of first years cheering him on when he's being overwhelmed or pushed to his limit. I also like Kento, the third year and best-est badminton player in the club not because he’s a total asshole at first, but because he gets dunked on a few times and I found it amusing.As much as I liked the characters and the overall theme of wholesome camaraderie that you don’t really see in a lot of highly competitive sports anime, without the animation to back up those themes I lost interest in the show real fast. Unfortunately, it’s another example to show that if you’re going to do a sports anime your production needs to either go big, or go home.4/10 Disappointment. a typical high school protagonist, but he has layers and real teenage school problems.

Not that the sport in this anime is bad but I\'m here...to watch the MC progress and not only the side characters. to watch the MC progress and not only the side characters.', '~ Spoiler free:Love All Play is an anime that fails in telling a compelling story and portrays badminton without conveying the qualities that make it a great sport. The animation, while wasn\'t expected to be anything great, manages to make glaring mistakes to someone who plays badminton and makes the sport feel sluggish, accompanied by a plot that is just plain wrong about badminton. Character ""development"" only occurs in characters realising they\'re just have to believe in themselves without exploring anything meaningful which further disregards the fundamentals of badminton as a sport. The main cast of characters are merely cliché ""personalities"" that appear uninteresting and...typical; such as how Sakaki is loud and ""straightforward"" in his play, with the side cast and most other players being forgettable and bland.~ Spoilers start here:The main rival Yusa is an enigma - the way he is presented is bewildering to say the least as he constantly flips between being the ""rotten prince"" and being a general prick to everyone weaker than him (which by itself, would have made a decent character); and immediately simping for Mizushima\'s sister. As such, he\'s a very confusing character which the viewer is unsure whether or not to take him seriously. At the start, he\'s completely cold to our protagonist (again, would have made the plot more interesting if say, Mizushima had to win his respect) but then slowly becomes more of a rival/friend to him for practically no good reason after the first 2 episodes. It also doesn\'t help that his VA sounds pubescent with how many times his voice cracks.Lastly, we have Mizushima who manages to be a bland main character with no real traits or playing style for the viewer to latch onto. The only things we know are that he enjoys badminton (wow) and never gives up which is the most boring an unoriginal a protagonist can be which we have to be told or he\'d be as bland as a book on the different shades of beige.To elaborate further on the animation - it wasn\'t anticipated to be anything special but I was taken aback by just how lifeless it was. Most of the shots are shown as stills with the CGI shuttle sliding across the screen, with the few points where the characters are moving being animated on two\'s or three\'s which makes the action look both incredibly slow and hard to follow. The most egregious example of this comes in episode 6 where one of the twins has a ""rally"" right at the net (which is utter nonsense in a real game) and it\'s just the two players moving in the laziest motion ever witnessed. In addition, the positioning of both players and shots lead me to believe that the animators have never seen or played a single game of badminton. There are many mistakes to point out, but the most common offender is how a lot of the lift shots are right at the net or in the middle of the court which is always a huge mistake when playing as the opponent can just smash it with ease.In general, the plot seems to only revolve around just straight up believing in yourself to improve your skill which is to disregard the excessive amount of interesting development and ideas you can get from playing styles, technique etc. The matches are hardly shown and are over quickly which, along with the excessive number of tournaments, makes the matches boring, repetitive and lacking a sense of weight. The only good points I can say about the show is the soundtrack by Hayashi Yuki who also did the amazing Haikyuu!! soundtrack which manages to lift up the final few matches, including the match between Mizushima and Misaki which was also animated much better than any other match for some unknown reason. Misaki himself was an interesting character who had previously lost his sense of identity to Yusa which then lit his passion for badminton leading up to Nationals which, combined with his VA\'s stellar performance, elevated his match against Mizushima greatly. Too bad it was only shown for a grand total of about 5 minutes and was still riddled with animating mistakes veiled thinly behind the positives mentioned previously.As a badminton player of 10 years and as an anime fan, I\'d like my time back. typical; such as how Sakaki is loud and ""straightforward"" in his play, with the side cast and most other players being forgettable and bland.~ Spoilers start here:The main rival Yusa is an enigma - the way he is presented is bewildering to say the least as he constantly flips between being the ""rotten prince"" and being a general prick to everyone weaker than him (which by itself, would have made a decent character); and immediately simping for Mizushima\'s sister.

As you\'d expect it\'s rushed and matches don\'t have much weight to them. Part of what makes an enjoyable sports anime is seeing the matches play out with strategy with good buildup between the players in the match. Love All Play doesn\'t have that impact, it\'s hollow.Same can be stated for the characters, outside of their initial introductions, nobody stands out in particular as interesting. There are twins, they are super happy and...energetic, as you\'d expect they love playing doubles, that\'s their strength. Halfway into the series one of the twins becomes conflicted wondering if his passion in badminton is real, but he gets over it fast and the twins don\'t change personality wise.There\'s the straightforward Sakaki who relies on power and isn\'t the smartest tool in the shed, yeah as you can tell all these characters are just troupes. He plays doubles with the MC of Love All Play Ryou, who is exactly what you\'d picture of when thinking of a shonen sports anime MC, so I\'m skipping over him on purpose. What\'s there to say? Ryou\'s biggest strength is his love for badminton and works the hardest to make his dreams come true, yeah we\'ve seen this play a million times folks. Back to Sakaki, he has lots of siblings and works at his families western-style restaurant, as such he\'s a caring, considerate person, he teams up with Ryou simply because he loves the way he plays. As a team they\'re not a great match, but they have fun playing.Alright we need a kuudere as everyone else is cheerful, oh perfect here comes Matsuda. As you\'d expect he goes through the same character arc that each and every kuudere embarks on, but hey that\'s better than the majority of the other characters. He starts off cold and distant believing that everything needs to be done by himself. He\'s like this because his father (Matsuda\'s only real family member) is always working so he\'s always been alone and did everything solo. Yes, the lone wolf troupe. Over the series Matsuda learns being with friends is valuable. This does breed my favorite quote in the series let me paraphrase. ""If you want to go quick go alone, but to go far one must go together."" Through the power of friendship he wins his final match, wowie.The final character of note is team ace Yusa, a player when first joining the team was told by his coach to never lose again. As his driving force to never falter, plus his ambition to date Rika, (MC Ryou\'s sister) Yusa cannot lose again and has to become a triple crown winner in nationals. Yeah, this dude has some major expectations put onto his shoulders. I liked his VA work him saying ""Come On!"" always got a laugh out of me with the weird pitch it was at. In the beginning of the anime he\'s presented as a total asshole but he was like that to push his team to be better. During the final match between Yusa and Ryou, (which dang the animation was pretty good!) Yusa kept his promise and we get to see Yusa with Rika a year later in the aftermath, how cute. Imagine playing hard to get so badly and still getting the ace, only Yusa the simp would follow that pussy to that extent...Love All Play isn\'t worth much of a watch. Even from a sports simps pov it\'s mediocre at best and was difficult to watch most of the time cause I was bored. It didn\'t help that the OST was cheesy and generic, wish I could turn it off at times. In contrast the sound design of the badminton being played was exceptional, give whoever did the sound design a raise!In all, the lesson to learn is, don\'t force 2 years of high school sports into 24 episodes you\'re setting yourself up for failure, simping does work if you\'re a generational talent, and of course friendship is magic, good riddance, don\'t need to have this series in my head space no more. energetic, as you\'d expect they love playing doubles, that\'s their strength.

Skipping months ahead at times, games not even in a slideshow just barely glossed over in a few words that informs us who lost or won what (no joke, some episodes do away with 2-3-4 games like that), and then it\'s already the next tournament, and we barely even blinked. And oh, yeah, there\'s also some girls sprinkled in here and there as if to tease some romance ""subplot"" that never really /is/.It\'s a shame, really. Most of the cast is actually likeable, and an anime using the sport as just a backdrop for a coming-of-age story wouldn\'t necessarily be bad: that\'s more like what this felt it wants to be. At times. But that\'s still better than how often it felt like a sport anime, which is basically never. There are some likeable characters, even some relatable situations and circumstances (for example, Sakaki\'s family and their restaurant and the way Matsuda gets ""caught up"" in that was rather nice)... But then there\'s also the ""star player"" of the series, who has a princely pretty face, but for the most part just a total prickly douche personality to go with it, and he never gets any better. Everyone also seems way too ""wide"" up to, way too ripped in the scarce few fanservice shots we get, which is weird in itself as that kinda bodybuilder build is not really the right build for badminton players, especially in highschool... Then it\'s exacerbated by how it also seems rather inconsistent when they do wear clothes, which is of course most of the time.I tried really hard to like this one, and I actually feel bad for giving it such a low score. But when I\'m happy for the last episode because it means the creators won\'t be able to drag it out any more, or potentially make it even worse......

It\'s fast-paced, interesting and it\'s played on such a small court compared to others (other than ig tennis, but tennis is dead boring for me to watch). I had high hopes for this. The only other badminton anime I\'ve watched is Ryman\'s Club and even that was disappointing in the sport aspect. In fact, Run with the Wind, an anime about running, was...more interesting and had higher quality overall.Love All Play is predictable, boring and a copy of just about every other sport anime. Actually, that\'s just an insult to other better sports anime. It\'s a worse copy of them, I should say.We have the same characters (personality wise and motivation wise), an injury almost every 5 episodes, a predictable plot, and way too many characters for a 24 episode anime. I couldn\'t even tell you what happened in those 24 episodes and I\'ve literally just finished it. The pacing was off, the actual badminton scenes were boring and some of the characters are just plain dislikable. Forget being a copy of other characters, I\'ve watched over 150 anime now, so seeing a tsundere, a ""sunshine"" main character, an over-energetic and aggressive character etc. is nothing new to me, but other anime still manage to make it work? They have to compete with God knows how many other anime, manga and animation that have the same characters, but even new releasing anime only anime are better.This is a waste of time. I wouldn\'t recommend even trying it because it would just be a waste of 20 minutes. I watched all of it in order to write an accurate review, so I beg you listen.But there are 3... decent aspects of the show (hence the 3/10):1. In line with most of the new gen anime, Love All Play, unsurprisingly, has a crisp, clean animation style. It\'s pretty, the colours are bright, the character styles are cute ig. It\'s nice. (It does however fail in about every aspect when it comes to animating the actual sport - the angle at which every frame was at when they were playing was horrible for staying engaged)2. The romantic subplot was better than the entire anime overall. In fact, it probably would\'ve gotten more than a 3 if this was a purely romance anime with sport as the subplot.And 3. It, thankfully, finished on a realistic note. I\'ll give it that. The MC doesn\'t take the win at the end of the first (and hopefully only) season: ACCURATE. Only plot thing they did right. Unless the sport anime is about a prodigy that always wins and we go through a journey where he loses for the first time ever, fine, that\'s different. But every single sport anime that starts with a decent/beginner sport player, aiming for the top, is required to lose once. No, at least twice. It\'s the standard. The struggle needs to be there. You need to taste defeat before winning because that\'s how everyone else at the top got through it. You get better by playing and losing against someone better than you. I don\'t care how many sports anime I watch, this is the only correct sequence when tackling this kind of development/journey. It\'s the only accurate one and the only one I will hold to realistic standards lol.Though writing this now, I\'m not sure whether Love All Play should get props for doing what is the expected thing to do in an anime about a character aiming to win.Some characters were more interesting than the main character ngl. I was a fan of the one with glasses, who eventually became the brains behind the team and acting like a second coach. Now THAT, I would watch. Yusa was cringe. Mizushima was average and boring and at no point was I hoping he\'d actually win (ik, sad). I didn\'t feel anything for any of the characters, the story didn\'t one engage me. It was just so lackluster.But hey, at least it was easy to look at.Don\'t watch this. There\'s always something else to watch. Beyond ""calming"" and ""easy to watch"", which I believe some people will describe this as, I can\'t think of a single sport anime that is meant to be or is calming. It\'s sport. It\'s going to have angst, struggle and ugly moments. It\'s meant to be difficult, overwhelming and rewarding. Especially if that\'s the main genre. Especially if the aim is to be at the top. Sport isn\'t mean to be in the same sentence as Slice of Lice unless it\'s a subplot. Love All Play is endlessly boring, repetitive and doesn\'t even scrape the surface of the word decent. more interesting and had higher quality overall.Love All Play is predictable, boring and a copy of just about every other sport anime.

Love All Play is endlessly boring, repetitive and doesn\'t even scrape the surface of the word decent.', ""This show has everything it should take to be a quality anime.With a popular voice actor as the main character, a quality art style and a refreshing main character, I had high expectations for this show. As a huge fan of Haikyuu, I was excited to see how Love All Play could somehow make an unseemingly boring sport interesting to viewers.Point blank answer: it doesn't.Early on, the show attempts to establish a friendship between five first year students: the optimistic main character, Kageyama 2.0, the angry passionate one, and the most stereotypical set of twins you've ever seen. Outside of the fact...that the characters were blander than white rice, each time it seemed like they were about to be given even an ounce of growth, the show timeskipped so that we didn't even see it.In the blink of an eye, Mizushima, a character with absolutely zero talent in his first year is suddenly able to combat the number one player in the league. Where other sports anime like Haikyuu spend full seasons and arcs on training, Love All Play barely spends more than 10 minutes of an episode on it. This leads to an utter lack of belief when the characters are suddenly amazing. Moreso, I don't want to cheer them on. Instead, I'm left laughing each time Mizushima or Kageyama 2.0 loses.This show was a waste of a budget.The producers clearly paid attention to shows like Haikyuu and Run with the Wind, both shows that took sports that most people would consider boring and lackluster yet somehow captivated their audiences. These shows both spend lots of time on development, giving you moments of watching each individual character train hard enough so that they earn the right to win. In Haikyuu, the main character Hinata starts off as a near talentless pupil. Even leading up to season 5, Hinata is only just starting to hit his stride in growth. Yes. It took 4 full seasons of us watching Hinata grow so that we can watch him fly. Yet Love All Play thinks they can captivate us with a 5 minute training scene followed by yet another crappy and boring round robin sequence. Worse than that, right as you start to think the characters will get some growth, the show will hastily cut to yet another tournament without any true build up. The pacing in this show is absolutely horrendous and that leads to a severe lack of depth.Do not waste your time watching this show.I'd rather rewatch Haikyuu another 10 times rather than watch a single episode more. that the characters were blander than white rice, each time it seemed like they were about to be given even an ounce of growth, the show timeskipped so that we didn't even see it.In the blink of an eye, Mizushima, a character with absolutely zero talent in his first year is suddenly able to combat the number one player in the league.

Piss off.To wait more than a decade for a relatively unknown and underground work to get adapted, I really question who was in the right mind to green-light this project, given that there were already better alternatives like Liden Films\'s repertoire of badminton anime. This is novelist Asami Koseki\'s only work that was in Poplar Publishing (which publishes very old kids IPs from the 90s to the late 2000s) that was seralized from 2011 to 2014, and I\'m just gonna assume that the sales figures for this were decent to OK (since it\'s ""big"" enough to get an anime adaptation), or...is that some big shot wanted to see this come to fruition, and such is the case of Love All Play here. The only problem: Liden Films has redefined what to expect for badminton anime going forward with Hanebado! and Ryman\'s Club, and animation prowess certainly beats story elements to a point where the current trend has been stuck ever since.Love All Play presents itself as your sterotypical school sport, chock full of characters that are meant to grow on you as the series progressed from start to finish, and in the space of 24 episodes covering the entirety of the 4-volume novel (which is best assumed since this is a one-and-only job), it certainly has done that. The issue is that why is this only released now is just as baffling, as if it was released right at the tailgate of the novel\'s end in 2014 would be just about perfect to have an anime adaptation on it, but given how long this took to get one, I would assume that it\'s the connection to the recent Tokyo Olympics (which sure isn\'t the case) to then finally have a use case for this anime to come out, it sure was ""years in the making"" that got stale when it came out, and staying the same when it finishes this season. And even if it was released in the past, it would\'ve been doomed from the start to be largely forgotten in time to come.Just about the only good part of the show was in its characters, which in their portrayal, were actually period-correct to the time when the novel came out: the bunch of newbies entering high school for the first time, being rookies at a sport for the first time, hanging out with friends and family, and especially the matches which help everyone progress a step further. And to be fair, this is old-school storytelling at its finest, though these days people (even myself) don\'t really care for the allure of the oldies and classics, unless if it\'s a well-regarded one (e.g. Rumiko Takahashi\'s Urusei Yatsura (All Stars) next season). And here to tag the story is the new group of rookies with Ryo Mizushima, Shohei Sakaki, Koki Matsuda, Taichi and Yuji Higashiyama, and Akira Uchida, the 6 newbies who found themselves being chosen by their school Yokohama Minato\'s badminton team, going through the normal pacing of practice after practice to improve and make themselves useful in making their school a household name from the ashes of sunkenness. Oh, and also enjoy their youth. I do find that the badminton team seniors, mostly Kento Yusa and Yusuke Yokokawa are both an annoying dirtbag and a respectful Senpai respectively, though overtime they do show well of their camaraderie with one another that\'s been in the works since they joined the badminton team. But the whole love interest section of the boys being cheered on by their classmates which raises the aspects of romance, while that is also period-correct to the setting, it unfortunately becomes a sore sight that I\'d wish the focus went onto the actual badminton instead of the slice-of-life elements. But then again, this is school life at its most humble, so it\'s there. And most certainly is the whole ""school goddess"" thing of Ryo\'s sister Rika being the flower worth only the attention of Yusa. Again, no faults there, it\'s just how everything is brought up in the dailyness of school life.If this anime came out in the mid-2010s, then Nippon Animation and OLM\'s Team Yoshioka\'s collab would\'ve served a nice niche since there wasn\'t anything to compare to at the time. But this is the 2020s, and it looks awfully outdated by today\'s standards with such a lack of emphasis on the badminton segments, which is the core function of the show. Even the OST sounds unimpressive at best (though I loved the 1st Cour\'s OP, that was really nice coming from composers from sumika).It\'s all-in or go home. Wholesome camaraderie aside in a competitive sports show that exists only on the school level, there\'s just not much going for Love All Play now, and I\'m willing to bet that this show would be easily forgotten, both in its source novel and the anime in time to come, which is never a shame. What\'s a shame is that I felt like I\'ve wasted 6 months of time watching this mid-tier show that should\'ve came out a pretty long time ago, and then only to be left in its forgotten state. It\'s just boring by today\'s standards, and I want my precious time back. is that some big shot wanted to see this come to fruition, and such is the case of Love All Play here.

Miss Monochrome The Animation 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31560/Miss_Monochrome_The_Animation_3,"['I seriously did not know there was a third season for Miss Monochrome: The Animation, but after I saw the listings of anime for Fall 2015, I knew I had to watch it. I know I am pretty late to review it since it’s 2016 but who knew it would come out so soon after the second season?Anyway, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3’s storyline takes place right after the second season.  In this season, Miss Monochrome’s album has finally been released and she is now preparing her tour to become more famous. From my point of view, it seems as if this season...was similar to the first one. Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3 brings that over-the-top comedy back with a new reference in each episode. I was really surprised to see that they brought this element back but in the back of my mind, knowing how each episode was set up made it feel repetitive. With that being said, the story may not feel like it progresses, but it does. Speaking about references, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3 references events that happened in the first and second season. If you haven’t seen the first and second season, I advise you to do so.There’s not a lot to say about the characters. There’s no major addition or anything of the sort. Yayoi is still the same overambitious klutz, Maneo is still trying to do whatever he can to help, Miss Monochrome is still trying to become famous, and Ruu-chan is being Ruu-chan. Mana and Kikuko make an appearance from time to time but not as often as before. The backup idol group for Miss Monochrome, Caramel, gets a little more air time though.Needless to say, the art style of Miss Monochrome was enhanced. The character designs look more detailed and the environment is a little more vivid as well. The 3D CGI for Miss Monochrome has improved dramatically such as the lighting and detail. If you were tired of seeing the same old outfit Miss Monochrome had on, do not worry. Miss Monochrome has a different outfit in the new ending which makes it refreshing to see.Something that should be noted is that there are two opening and ending theme songs now. The first opening and ending theme songs are “Black or White” and “Step by Step”. Both first OP and ED theme songs were the same from the second season, but had a few new animations included. On the other hand, from episode 10 and on, the opening and ending theme songs are “Miss Monochrome Taiso” and “Kimi to Boku”. I really wished that they changed the opening and ending theme songs in the beginning. To me, it didn’t make sense that they would put a good theme song near the end of an anime; I found it to be very disappointing since I was only going to hear it for three episodes.There’s no doubt that I enjoyed Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3. There was always something to look forward to in every episode. Be it a random promotion for a game or subtle fan service, it was all fun to watch. However, I disliked how this season didn’t show some characters in the previous seasons and incorporate them into the story. I was really hoping to see Akiko, the famous guitarist, to make an appearance, but she didn’t sadly. We got to see more of the story side in the second season, however in this, it’s very similar to the first. A lot of random references that incorporate into the story that just so happens to make a plot. To me, it felt repetitive, the randomness was cool and all, but like I said, I knew how each episode were set up.Overall, this season seemed to be better than the second but not as much as the first. Maybe we’ll get to see a season 4? I don’t think that this is the end of Miss Monochrome’s journey to idol hood, but who knows what Miss Monochrome will do next? was similar to the first one.

So I will just talk about how good 3rd season is and what it offers.Narrative. Probably the best in the entire series. It is still the same thing with Miss Monochrome and her quest to be like Kikuko, but the ""fillers"" here were fun and the plot actually got somewhere quite quickly. For the most part, it looked as if improvement was visible and something to praise about. Same with the characters, though, the new characters weren\'t used a lot so they ended up being relatively something I didn\'t care for. It is a little shame but this is...quite short after all.Audiovisuals are the same as the 2 seasons prior.

I am a little disappointed that they decided to use the opening and ending from the second season up until the last few episodes. It's also got similar wacky stuff that honestly make more sense than in the first two seasons. Or maybe it's because I've become used to it at this point. I'm not exactly sure anymore.There really isn't much to say. I feel like I don't like this season as much as the previous season...because it's no longer a novelty to me and it makes me feel bored, but I still enjoy it for what it is. Also, there was one episode where Miss Monochrome becomes a bit of a jerk and I felt like that was out of character for her. And they brought back Ru's ability to talk, which I'm not the biggest fan of. Still, I recommend it, as it's a continuation of the second series, and it's a nice way to end the story. because it's no longer a novelty to me and it makes me feel bored, but I still enjoy it for what it is.

My hopes were up with that it was a spinoff of Lucky Star, but those positive thoughts were dashed swiftly.Being about the families struggles to maintain any money for food, with an otaku shopper, you think it would be a fun few minutes, but the overuse of similar jokes over and over again drew thin, and eventually it became a chore to finish. Also, the ED joke was funny to begin with, but wore down as all the jokes did. Though the ED was a nice tune.Since it was a Lucky Star spinoff, you would expect a cameo,...but alas, those were disappointing as well.The few positives this show had was the aforementioned ED song, though they were sub-par, the *cameos* of the Lucky star gang, and the art was above average.Final thoughts would be that it is dissapointing, but if want to waste 30 minutes, as the show varies from 3-5 minutes long, go right ahead, but there are MANY better shorts out there than this one. but alas, those were disappointing as well.The few positives this show had was the aforementioned ED song, though they were sub-par, the *cameos* of the Lucky star gang, and the art was above average.Final thoughts would be that it is dissapointing, but if want to waste 30 minutes, as the show varies from 3-5 minutes long, go right ahead, but there are MANY better shorts out there than this one.', '""It\'s 9 p.m. on Monday!

Cruel, heartless poverty. The sisters Hinata and Hikage live a life filled with unflattering things, like tofu substituted meat, skim milk, skim milk, and convenience store dinners. This show is a glimpse at sections of their life, filling the viewers with a sense of overwhelming pity.For Hikage, the younger sister, she is an endearing elementary school student who puts up with her sister\'s wasteful spending, using precious dollars on unneeded things like light...novels with ridiculously long titles and promotional items. Her cries of dissatisfaction are drowned out by the sounds of her growling stomach, giving her the unpleasant reminder that another day of meatless dinner awaits her. She goes to school, where she lives a relatively normal elementary school life, where her dear friends offer a respite to the battlefields of the supermarket. Her teacher, Kirito-sensei, being the sporting guy he is, attempts to help Hikage, as long as it has nothing to do with financial problems. However, the ever wise Hikage denies his advice, citing ""love problems."" This Kirito-sensei seems nowhere near as successful with women as his alternate world counterpart is.Hikage\'s sister, Hinata, works in a book store to rake in meager allowances to sustain both herself and her sister.

Seeing Hikage in distress upsets her however, and always tries to make it up to her, offering enticing things like sharing her limited edition goods, and sweet words to make her forget her growling stomach.The ending song is tragically cut short for many of the episodes, given the studio\'s dire financial situation.

It's not the season two that many have been hoping for—though, the OP would suggest otherwise—but there's no reason you wouldn't enjoy it if you enjoyed Lucky Star.Despite not still being produced by KyoAni, Miyakawa-ke retains the overall feel of Lucky Star, most likely due to the number of returning staff members: Yamamoto Yutaka is the director, having previously directed the first four episodes of Lucky Star, of which he did a fine job, episode one's infamous first half notwithstanding. Rest assured, you won't be sitting through five minutes of meandering food discussions...here. The visuals, too, are on point, featuring the light but vibrant color palette you've come to expect from the franchise, and the same kinds of adorable character designs that are consistently well drawn.However, even with the shorter episode lengths, this show tends to follow a slower pace. While Lucky Star was more reliant on nonstop punchline set-ups, Miyakawa-ke instead uses more focused linear plot structures. That's not to say there aren't any punchlines at all, but each episode typically deals with a single scenario or idea for its whole duration, rather than being comprised of disconnected instances.Oddly enough, the Miyakawa sisters are the only two returning characters who ended up being portrayed by new seiyuu for this series; you might have forgotten that they did actually have two brief appearances in Lucky Star, though their roles were so small that it hardly matters. Hikage's new seiyuu, in particular, is an unusual one, this being her first and only role. Her non-anime-sounding voice gives Hikage a unique charm, so it's a shame that she hasn't done any more voice work since.Hikage is also by far the more likable of the two sisters. She's a lot more perceptive and cynical than your typical nine-year-old, no doubt a result of the harsh state of poverty that she lives in. Miyuk-...er, I mean, Hinata, on the other hand, is mainly there to create problems for her little sister—these problems being the main sources for the show's gags. Her incompetence may get frustrating, as she continues to make the same selfish decisions over and over throughout the whole show, only redeeming herself on occasion. But, to be fair, the entire premise banks on her acting in this way. Hikage wouldn't be so endearing if she didn't have to constantly struggle due to her older sister's lack of self control and bad spending habits.You'll find that the premise of Miyakawa-ke is very simple—perhaps too simple. As it is, there's not a whole lot of variety to the series. With that in mind, the show's length really works to its advantage—any longer and the creators might have run out of new ways to tell the same jokes.Maybe that's why the ending is so satisfying, despite the fact that not all of the source material could be covered. It stops before getting old, and ends things on a pretty good note. If Lucky Star left you wanting more, you owe it to yourself to give this small series a shot; certain cameos will probably make you smile. However, if you're not amused by the first episode, you probably shouldn't bother to continue. here.

Most reviews were saying that they were disappointed and blah blah like being a lucky star spin off or something like it.... Each episode were only of 4 minutes and they must've expect something big...Well, In my view I like this anime. Pretty funfull to watch. I liked the ending song and the story too.Very good to watch just 4 minutes per episode and you wont regret watching it either.... "", 'Most Lucky Star fans all expected to have a 2nd season, but is left with a Lucky Star spin-off. Is it more satisfying than having a 2nd season? Well.....let\'s see about that.Story: The plot is nothing special since the series is very short having each episode to be around 4-5 min. It\'s just about the daily life between two sisters named Hinata and Hikage. Rate: 5/10Characters: The two main characters are just the two sisters. We have the younger sister named Hikage who is mostly the mature one trying to tell her older sister to not spend lots of useless stuff. Then, we have the...older sister named Hinata who is pretty much the main problem for having the whole family to have financial problems due to her habits of spending things. Rate: 6/10Animation: The only thing I would give praise would definitely be the animation. I am really happy that they kept the Lucky Star animation style. You could probably tell that the style for the sisters does resembled other characters from the original Lucky Star series. Like Hikage who looked like Kagami and Hinata who looked like Miyuki. Rate: 8/10Sound: Sine the series is soo short, there\'s not an OP song, but left with only an ED song. The ED song was really catchy since it talks about the two sisters being poor and poverty. It\'s not a memorable song, but a catchy one. Rate 7/10Overall/Enjoyment: The Lucky Star spin-off series was actually ok, but is a bit enjoyable. It does have that Lucky Star feel to it, but since its really short I wished it would be a bit longer or just more episodes. Well, at least we have ""another"" Lucky Star series.

It may not have a story but its funny and it has quirky and cute characters. But this ""spin off "" is the opposite. So lll explain in a mini view!Story ~3It had potential to be something giving the idea but it really waste it. Its not dull but annoying. The comedy feels force and the situations take a stretch. In other words its 30 minutes of annoying crap.Characters~3Everyone minus the main 2 here and characters from the main show Lucky...Star are meh. The older sister,Hinata is very annoying and is literally the cause of problems financially. She is selfish and dose a bad job at taking care of her sister. The little sister,Hikage is decent and sympathetic because of Hinata is doing a crappy job of taking care of her. Overall the characters at best meh (minus the ones from the main series and Hikage)at worst annoying.Animation and art ~7To be positive the animation is very nice,the designs are cute,and fits Lucky Star but upgraded.  Im glad the animation looks nice because if you\'ve seen LS it has terrible animation admittedly. So all in all its nice and looks smooth.Sound ~4The op is amazing! Its very upbeat and cute. Outside of that sound is meh minus the voice acting. Its good in Japanese and it souunds nice. There is no dub for this OVA at the time of writing this. That`s all I have to say on the sound since there is nothing to talk about minus the op.Enjoyment~2I really don\'t like this show. It had good ideas but wasted mainly because of the poor choices of the Hinata. She was awful. But everything else was meh minus the op and animation. So honestly this was eh at best if the pink hair brat didnt make those choices. It may sound like Im nitpicking but.she is a terrible example of a sister and a main character.Overall~3The show is not that good. Stick with Lucky Star if you want a good comedy that has some merit unlike here. Star are meh. The older sister,Hinata is very annoying and is literally the cause of problems financially.

I watched Lucky Star before, but enjoyed this anime on its own. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes real settings [not those unrealistic well-off situations where the conversation between the characters is about how much they will expend, rather...than how much they CAN expend and on what to do it!]. Enough said! For the record: I signed on to MAL solely to leave my support for this anime and its style/genre [plus the ED theme!]. than how much they CAN expend and on what to do it!]. Enough said!

I like it. In fact, it\'s become a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine considering the short length of both the number of the episodes and the episode duration. I liked it for what it is, and I get it\'s just a comedy not meant to be taken seriously. I get that, and for that, I...can say that I like it to an extent. The animation, while nothing stellar or special, does its job fine. The soundtrack...I\'m not even sure if there was one, because I don\'t remember it. It must have been really bland and forgettable. The characters interactions are pretty funny, even though the corny jokes do get used over and over again. I get that this is a comedy, and it knows what it is and doesn\'t try to be anything more, and I respect the show for that. Yes, it\'s a cute little show that\'s easy to digest considering how short and sweet it is, and if you want a nice little low-key comedy to watch for about an hour, feel free to watch this, as all the episodes are five minutes long, so you can\'t really call it a time waster.However...I need to confess and throw all of these things out there NOW. There is SO much wrong with this anime, it\'s not even funny, even for fiction, and I feel it to be my duty to bring those issues to light. For one thing: How and why the ever loving FREAK does NOBODY call child protective services on Hikage, especially considering their circumstances?! She\'s basically told a whole bunch of people about her situation, yet everyone treats it like a big fat joke! Even the teacher doesn\'t take her situation seriously enough to call CPS so they can put Hikage in a home where competent people would actually take care of her! Speaking of competent, I really really hate Hinata. Her moe voice is annoying, she constantly adds ""nay-ee"" to the end of her sentences (does anyone else think it sounds like neigh? The sound a horse makes? Maybe she\'s secretly a horse!), and by freaking God, she spends way more on useless stuff than actual necessities for herself and her sister! Does she seriously have no sense of responsibility at all?! I may spend a bit too much money on anime and manga myself, but even I know better than to place anime above all else, especially when I\'m potentially in a dire situation! My big sister always took care of me when my parents were trying to find a house and she never spent money on useless stuff! She always took me food shopping whenever we needed it and even helped cook dinner and paid bills because my mom asked her to! She didn\'t want to, but she did it anyway for my sake, and I\'m grateful to her for it, even though we fight like cats and dogs! If my sister were anything like Hinata, she would have been arrested and charged with child neglect and I\'d be taken to a foster home if that were to happen, even though technically I\'m too old to be put in foster care. I have no idea how child neglect laws are in Japan, but we Americans would be throwing a hissy fit at Hinata for being incompetent and not putting her sister above her own stupid and selfish desires, she\'s so freaking incompetent! Also, how do they even manage to keep a house if they\'re so poor? Why is Hinata taking care of her sister when she herself has school?! Did she drop out like others have? if she did, that would have been realistic because you can\'t balance both a job, school, and taking care of a family all at the same time. That\'d be too much for her to handle, especially if she doesn\'t know the process behind paying mortgage? AND WHERE THE FREAK ARE THEIR PARENTS?! Did they die? Did they abandon them? Are they divorced? Why is this not explained?! If they\'re alive, they should be living with them, not living on their own! If they did abandon them, than that in itself is child abuse and neglect!*sigh* Okay. Finally got all that out of the way. Sorry guys. I just had to get all this out.

But to have an anime with the same or even half the length of these specials is something I\'m not exactly looking forward to. Nevertheless, Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku wasn\'t all that bad, and I managed to get my fair share of enjoyment out of it. Even though the video quality was so poor, you could barely see their mouths move.Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku is a ""spin-off"" show based on Lucky Star. To say spin-off is stretching it, though, as the mini-anime doesn\'t have anything...to do with the original one, other than two minor appearances of some of the main characters... In the background. It revolves around two sisters, the older one Hinata, and the younger sister Hikage. They suffer from poverty, and the fact the oldest one is both a spender and an otaku doesn\'t help either. And... that\'s it, really. Just like with Lucky Star, there is no actual storyline. Just 2 characters going through their lives and facing their hardships. It is funny how the youngest is far more responsible and mature than the older one, and the fact that the anime store clerk makes an appearance made me laugh, as well as the sneaky appearance of Konata, Kagami and Tsukasa. But really, that\'s it. There isn\'t anything really special about this anime. I personally wouldn\'t even call this an anime, but rather a special you expect to see on the Lucky Star DVD/BDs, as they\'re only 4 minutes each, not counting the ED.A few pointers is the art and the sound, which is (thank god) pretty much the same as the original Lucky Star series. It doesn\'t make up for the lack of proper character development, episode duration and overall amount of episodes, but at least it feels like it belongs in the Lucky Star universe. Also, the whole poverty concept they went with is pretty funny, although kinda harsh when you think about it. I mean, 2 sisters living together with barely any money. They made it look fun, but really, it\'s something you don\'t want to be facing. At least they live through it with a smile on their face.In conclusion, it isn\'t that bad for what it\'s worth. For its short duration, the total duration of every episode combined is 40 minutes, which is less than 2 episodes of a ""proper"" anime. If you want to give this a go, go ahead, you won\'t be wasting too much time if it isn\'t your cup of tea. I do recommend waiting for the DVD release, which should happen somewhere at the end of October (2013) if it hasn\'t happened yet, as the stream releases are of very poor quality. Pretty funny if you think about it, an anime about poverty with a poor quality release... Oh well. If you\'re bored, give it a go. If you\'re really bored, watch this and then rewatch Lucky Star while you\'re at it, and pretend the mini-anime is actually a Lucky Star special series. Like I said, it all does sorta fit in the whole LS universe, and for what it\'s worth, I do recommend giving it a go if you\'re a fan of Lucky Star. Even if it\'s just to see Konata and her friends having a pointless conversation in the background. to do with the original one, other than two minor appearances of some of the main characters... In the background. It revolves around two sisters, the older one Hinata, and the younger sister Hikage. They suffer from poverty, and the fact the oldest one is both a spender and an otaku doesn\'t help either. And... that\'s it, really. Just like with Lucky Star, there is no actual storyline. Just 2 characters going through their lives and facing their hardships. It is funny how the youngest is far more responsible and mature than the older one, and the fact that the anime store clerk makes an appearance made me laugh, as well as the sneaky appearance of Konata, Kagami and Tsukasa. But really, that\'s it. There isn\'t anything really special about this anime. I personally wouldn\'t even call this an anime, but rather a special you expect to see on the Lucky Star DVD/BDs, as they\'re only 4 minutes each, not counting the ED.A few pointers is the art and the sound, which is (thank god) pretty much the same as the original Lucky Star series. It doesn\'t make up for the lack of proper character development, episode duration and overall amount of episodes, but at least it feels like it belongs in the Lucky Star universe. Also, the whole poverty concept they went with is pretty funny, although kinda harsh when you think about it. I mean, 2 sisters living together with barely any money. They made it look fun, but really, it\'s something you don\'t want to be facing. At least they live through it with a smile on their face.In conclusion, it isn\'t that bad for what it\'s worth. For its short duration, the total duration of every episode combined is 40 minutes, which is less than 2 episodes of a ""proper"" anime. If you want to give this a go, go ahead, you won\'t be wasting too much time if it isn\'t your cup of tea. I do recommend waiting for the DVD release, which should happen somewhere at the end of October (2013) if it hasn\'t happened yet, as the stream releases are of very poor quality.

It can barely hold a candle to Lucky Star.  The series is about a really poor family of sisters as they talk about how poor, and hungry they are. Meanwhile, the older sister is an otaku that show no resistance to splurging on anime merchandise. That's basically every episode.  I found myself wishing the last episode would just arrive.The artwork was actually quite good, but not outstanding either.  The artwork is close to the original cute, simple artwork of Lucky Star. In fact, there is at...least one scenario where the two animes take place at the same time, and place.  It also has other smaller reference to Lucky Star.The sound is okay, I don't really recall any background music at all during any of the episodes. The ending them was also just okay. I found the two main characters voices kind of annoying at times too.I found almost all of the characters very similar to each other. They all seemed to lack in personality.  I found this kind of sad regarding the show only had like seven characters.This is one I've been waiting… the humor. I was so glad this series was short. Those jokes were terrible. It was the same thing every episode. I was expecting hilarious, random humor. What I got was a little girl complaining about food problems. Meanwhile, her older sister spent all their money on anime. This was the same thing rewrapped in every single episode. It was saddening.

The only assumption I made was that it was going to be as cute and situational as Lucky Star, but I was dead wrong.This anime has a very unique setting of being unbearably depressing while not actually trying to be. You can tell it was trying to make humor out of being relatable to budgeting families and people with not much extra money to spend, but the entire thing is just...one, long drudge of the protagonist being miserable and unhappy. This anime actually put me in a worse mood than when I started, wholly for the fact that it\'s that much of a downer. It\'s especially ironic considering Lucky Star featured at least a few jokes about characters mentioning something happy and then stating several negative things, ruining the mood for comedic effect. Because that\'s what this anime is, except without the punchline.In every aspect besides the story, it\'s a great anime. The animation is relatively beautiful and smooth, the sound is pretty good, the characters are visually appealing, it\'s got all the surface charm of Lucky Star, if not even a little bit better than Lucky Star\'s production quality.If you\'re a huge fan of Lucky Star like I am, I\'d recommend this, not because it\'s ""like"" Lucky Star or even has anything to do with it, but just because it almost ""feels"" like Lucky Star. In an apt comparison, this is sort of the tofu version of Lucky Star.

Now, it's time to review it in an animated form.The spin-off follows the Miyakawa sisters: Hinata, the elder one & otaku, and Hikage, the elementary student. Because Hinata wastes much money on the weeb shit of hers, the Miyakawas are poor. That's the only joke. Or is it?The most common misconception about Miyakawa-ke is that there is only one joke. Well, it's not even a comedy in the first place (check genres), but okay. In reality, the anime often transforms 'the only joke'...and does experiments with humour, which I find quite imaginative. It wouldn't have worked if Miyakawa-ke was full-length, however, every episode is about 5 minutes in total.The story is non-existent, as expected, and that's not bad at all. Lucky Star is relaxing for that reason. But Miyakawa-ke is more dynamic and fast-paced—this is no surprise because it's a five-minute anime. Then why 2 for a story, you ask? I noticed the progression.By 'progression', I meant characters. In the earlier episodes, Hinata tends to waste her money solely on otaku things, which makes her mildly unlikeable. However, as the series progresses, she really starts caring for Hikage's happiness, resulting in heartwarming moments of her acting as if she was the mother in the Miyakawa family. Speaking of Hikage, yes, she is the *main* main heroine, at least it feels that way. She is mature, which is highly realistic for a child raised in a poor family but reveals her childish identity in some actions.The side characters are well-developed for a short anime.The visuals are great, pure moe attitude. OP is surprisingly better than Lucky Star's one and is catchy. ED is ironically sad and fun in its own way, it's good. The voice acting is also gorgeous for a moe anime.To sum up, this anime is good. It's average in the beginning and has its own flaws, compared to Lucky Star, but improves as the episodes go. It's refreshing and cute, sometimes actually sad, a few times unlikable, yet is enjoyable overall.Watching this, don't expect another Lucky Star. Yes, the art style is the same, however, the topics in humour and dialogues are different. If you still want another Lucky Star, no wonder you'll end up disappointed. Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku is neither a sequel nor a side story, it's a spin-off.Thank you for reading my review. and does experiments with humour, which I find quite imaginative.

Obviously our perspectives are probably different.But, I don\'t think some people understand or appreciate how great/fun this short show is! Well, I don\'t even understand it myself very well... Yet, this is what I think. Like the lyrics of the Ending song ""we are not miserable - we are just poor""... Well myself and this review it is ""I can\'t logically tell you why I give this show a 8/10 - but I can simply FEEL it to be a good show""!The show is 8/10 because it does well in what it presents. Personally I enjoyed it a lot, so...I think it is a 9/10 but that is the extreme bias of my review showing. For another person it may be a 7/10 or a 6/10, but I refuse to admit this show is anywhere at or below a 3/10...unless you say it\'s too short.9 for story not because it has a great, complex, thrilling, etc. plot but because it is simple and keeps to itself all the way through. It is a slice of life of two sisters, a 4th grader and an older sister. The 4th grader is too concerned about the finances of their small impoverished family because the older sister is an otaku who can\'t control their spending well. Contrary to some people, I don\'t think the older sister is terrible, her actions are unnecessarily expensive but it is true that both sisters love each other very much, and to me that makes this show heartwarming. In my opinion, a lot of animes which are said to be ""wholesome"" are not very wholesome but rather cute or something that is a little superficial or degrading. However, Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku is truly a wholesome anime! The main character, the little sister, is great not only because she is a moe cute anime girl but also because she is actually smart for her age and attempts to be responsible for the sake of her family\'s lifestyle. Since the show is a slice of life, she reminds me of some kids who could or already do exist like her. She is a realistically depicted person (as far as anime goes) because they are a human, she may be an intelligent child but she is also still a child.8 for Art because I like lucky star\'s art style. Some scenes are slightly too stale (as in the frame stays the same while the audio keeps on playing) for a little too long. But other parts are well enough animated and are consistent with the show. I like the designs of the characters too.7 for Sound. I chose 7 arbitrarily since I guess if I was more objective (whatever that could entail to) then both art and sound would be 5 or a 6. But since I think both the art and sound compliment each other well and fit into the story of the anime and since it is a Lucky Star spinoff, I think the sound is A-o\'Kay! Anyways, the biggest complaint from other views is probably related to the voices from the main cast\'s voice actresses. As far as I can tell, those two people have mostly only voice acted for this show. I don\'t know much else...but what I do know is that I actually like these voices. They are probably not great in industry standards, but since I don\'t understand Japanese very well and I prefer more unique voice performances, I think the two VA\'s did a good job. I think both the VA\'s also did a good job at capturing the characters of the show, perhaps other VA\'s could have done a better job but that better job would\'ve been more generic I bet. So, the main cast\'s voices actually suit their characters nicely as they sound a little more realistic yet cartoony and charming enough for a lighthearted show with moments of some sadness, mainly from the light-stomachs of the sisters.I gave 8 to characters and 9 to enjoyment. 10 I reserve for master-pieces. Like many reviewers or people in general, I haven\'t bothered checking up if there are \'proper\' ways to review these shows. So, I give a 9 for my personal enjoyment since I think that\'s what mostly matters. To be more fair, the show I believe deserves an overall score of 8.

Then the original director of Lucky Star thought it'd be neat for them to get their own spin-off. The conception of this feels exactly like how Lucky Star would handle a spin-off. They chose characters you barely saw in the entire series. Let's look at it.Hikage is always hungry, Hinata is a selfish douche- I mean, she always buys stuff for herself...no, yeah, I...was right, she's a selfish douche. She doesn't care at all about her little sister starving most of the time and only buys things for herself. Why parental services haven't moved Hikage into a home where she isn't malnourished is beyond me. But, that's the whole dynamic. And everything that happens in-between will, more often than not, bring up Hikage's hunger. But, besides that, the rest of what you will find here isn't too repetitive and is pretty entertaining, given its short runtime. If it were a longer series, the writing would get stale pretty quickly. But, they knew what they were working with.The voice acting is pretty solid. If you enjoyed the first four episodes of Lucky Star, you get a nice return to formula with Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku since the original director helped with all of the shorts here. Pacing is pretty good, for the standard it takes heed from. Scenes will abruptly jump sometimes, as you would expect, but it's not a bad thing if you enjoyed Lucky Star, as it's about the same amount of jumping. Soundtrack is pretty nice to listen to. The original characters introduced are pretty welcoming, almost making the spin-off feel like its own anime altogether that simply shares the same universe as Lucky Star. What I consider a spin-off is when at least one primary character is involved in it. But, spin-offs can also be, well, spun off of a minor character as well. Or, hell, even characters you only saw once in the entirety of Lucky Star.The same voice actors, who did these very minor characters, returned for this spin-off. The dedication here is just fantastic and is easily the biggest positive this anime gets, alongside the majority of the staff being from Lucky Star. Really, only Kyoto Animation is absent, but due to the simplicity of the art style, Ordet and Encourage Films did a stellar job of copying it. It was easy enough with the same art director as well. If somebody told you Kyoto Animation also came back, you wouldn't feel weird if you forgot it wasn't done by them.Overall, take this one lightly. It's a spin-off done with limited resources, but amazingly, the majority of the Lucky Star crew came back for it besides Kyoto Animation, who are understandably busy with loads of anime that require loads more time to produce. And their absence isn't detrimental to the quality of Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku at all. What you have here is a nice treat for hardcore Lucky Star fans that is short enough where you really shouldn't scoff it if you enjoyed Lucky Star a lot. The repetitive jokes and scenery will get a bit tiresome, but the new soundtrack and characters will compensate for that.If you're not expecting a full-fledged series, you have something funny here. I'd love to see it continue, simply because a single half-hour isn't enough for it with the effort it received. I could say the same about Lucky Star, but that anime finished just fine and has a good amount of episodes, way more than any other anime ever gets these days. Twelve is about the maximum due to how much time is spent on the animation, so for this anime to even get a half-hour with its resources is astounding. was right, she's a selfish douche.

I'd love to see it continue, simply because a single half-hour isn't enough for it with the effort it received. I could say the same about Lucky Star, but that anime finished just fine and has a good amount of episodes, way more than any other anime ever gets these days. Twelve is about the maximum due to how much time is spent on the animation, so for this anime to even get a half-hour with its resources is astounding."", ""The Miyakawa Family's Hunger, despite being a spin-off of Lucky Star, one of my favorite anime of all time, is a bit of a letdown. Given how short the anime itself is, let's get right into the various reasons why. First, the story is set up with these sisters living together, the older sister taking care of the younger one, though she is such an uninhibited otaku that her younger sister is often on the brink of starvation. Now, it's clear that the show has written her as deep down being a good sister, or at least wanting to be, but the fact that her...sister is starving so often and has to scold her about her use of money just makes the whole situation come off as some kind of tragedy. I get it's supposed to be funny, but it just isn't. I think there actually were ways to make it funny too, which makes this anime all the more unsatisfying. The art's good though, measuring up to the same quality as Lucky Star, with those same excellent watercolor backgrounds. The sound is also of a similar quality, so no complaints there either. The characters come off as very flat and uninspired, like they had this idea and ran with it, forcing these characters to fit the idea so neatly that they lose any sense of humor or relatability. Overall, the best part by far is when the girls from Lucky Star show up in the background. The Miyakawa Family's Hunger is an underwhelming experience that left me feeling thankful the episodes are only a few minutes a piece. sister is starving so often and has to scold her about her use of money just makes the whole situation come off as some kind of tragedy.

Those saying that are just losers who quits the anime when it's in the lowest, just like people who quits the VN trilogy because of Extra. This adaptation is just as decent as it could be, and it's really good.S2 has managed to bring some of the crucial part of the series to another level, despite setbacks that I can say forgivable due to the reality of the anime ground. Especially the most anticipated battle where half of...the season is dedicated to it - and that's despite speculation that it would be sped up horribly as claimed by those false reviewers. It's doing fine by itself - very good battles and epic drama in it.Yes, I could admit it can be better, but the anime is fine, I repeat, fine to watch it if you enjoyed the VN enough. No need to be shy and hesitative just because you hear things are wrong. It done its justice to the VN its own good way. the season is dedicated to it - and that's despite speculation that it would be sped up horribly as claimed by those false reviewers.

This is no train-wreck adaptation like Chaos;Head and Chaos;Child. The MLA anime is legitimately good, season 2 especially. I'd honestly put season 2 above the anime of Robotics;Notes and Higurashi DEEN.Anyways, let's get into the pros. As was the case in season 1, the mecha animation was absolutely phenomenal. It's eye candy to look at. It's what makes the anime worth watching for anybody. Moreover, the pacing is pretty good for the most part. They didn't try to do a rush job and adapt the whole thing...in one go. They paced the whole story out such that if they were to adapt everything, it'd be done in 3 cours. Hopefully, we get that 3rd season some day.That being said, season 2 had some unfortunate issues. As was we all know from season 1, the MLA anime demands prior VN knowledge from its audience via Extra and Unlimited. But because they didn't adapt Extra earlier, season 2 made some... interesting adaptation decisions. They rushed through one of the most impactful parts of the VN in chapter 7 because it was very reliant on its audience having gone through Extra. Episode 3 in particular was just unbelievably disappointing. Instead, however, they lengthened chapter 9, opting to adapt the manga at 2 chapters per episode for Sadogashima, meaning 4 episodes spent on what only took 2.5 hours in the VN. While this did mean that Sadogashima was handled superbly, parts of chapter 7 were handled very poorly. Additionally, as was also the case in season 1, we still have the rather stale and lifeless character designs and colour palettes. The 2D animation did improve between the two seasons but it was still not exactly the greatest thing in the world.Anyways, if you've already played through the trilogy, the Muv-Luv Alternative anime is absolutely worth watching. Don't let the cynicism of the fandom fool you. Honestly, if it weren't for how poorly they handled episodes 3-4, I think this would definitely deserve a higher score. in one go.

As a matter of fact it is actually a much superior product that the disappointing gundam AUs of the 2010s. This is definitely the mecha show of the season and it certainly feels that way vs that new Gundam show that is more like a parody.What people expected to be the berserk 2016 of VNs due to low funding, actually had phenomenal mecha action and sound mixing. I promised you the action does feel like it has proper build up, and you can really feel the tighter stakes and thrills....The sound doesn't feel like background noise and endless beam spams like the Gundam shows, but actually has the rhythm as they are building up to larger and larger stakes. It makes you feel like you are actually playing a video game vs watching a cutscene. The CGI rarely has blemishes like the regular 2d mechs where you can pause and see the bad drawings. Overall very well done for such a niche studioThe plot is definitely top notch and doesn't suffer from being proedictable. There is great surprises and you can really feel the trauma. There is definitely a ton of highs. They really did flesh out Takeru. Kouzoki for the most part does most of the talking for the series.Overall, this is still definitely worth watching even if you haven't played the VNs. I do recommend watching Total Eclipse and Schwarzesmarken for more background knowledge.

Yes, it may not be a perfect adaptation of an 80 hour long VN series, but it doesn’t need to be. No anime can be. The purpose of these types of adaptations is to drive up interest in the VN and to give you just enough of the story for it to be a competent story on its own, but enough that you want to seek out the VN to play. MLA anime, particularly season 2, did that perfectly for me and was one of the most enjoyable...shows this season.I will admit, season one of this anime had some rushed pacing and subpar direction at times. Even as an anime only I felt it was missing something. Season 2 has corrected a lot of those mistakes and from the very first episode it was apparent that pacing had been fixed, direction was fixed and that we would be in for a treat this season. The biggest improvement over that first season is for sure the pacing. There were times last season when it was hard to really care about what was going on because of how fast everything was going and how much was being omitted from the story. MLA S2’s pacing is much slower and allows you to get fully invested in the characters and their situations. I feel like this really benefited Takeru and other characters like Sumika, Meiya and others who play large roles in this season.The story on its own is also just much better in this season than in season 1. There’s some genuinely “wtf” plot twists that we got in this season that legitimately stayed with me for weeks. I think we really got a much more candid look at the brutal nature of the war between humanity and the beta in this season. In season 1, we often just got descriptions and heard kind of an idealised version of things, but it’s very apparent in this season that this is not just some heroic everyone comes home at the end type of war. People are dying and sacrifices are being made and because of how well paced and directed the season is, you feel the weight of every loss.Speaking of the brutal reality of war, it’s hard to discuss a war anime without discussing the action scenes. While not on the level of 86 or other top tier mecha anime, I think the production qualities of MLA S2 were substantially improved upon from the first season and there’s some pretty solid looking fight scenes particularly during that last little arc of the season. I was pretty impressed.So, what’s the deal? Should you watch MLA or read the VN? I can only go off of what I am doing which is both. I believe that anime and VNs are different mediums and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Yes, the anime omits things, any anime adaptation of a VN will, but at the same time the voice acting, updated character designs and the fact that some episodes of the anime actually surpass the VN make the MLA anime worth a watch as well.

Then again without her having such oxymoronic role then this would have been a bore.Overall- Even though this was still your usual apocalyptic theme anime, it was still worth it, so the question is , will there be another Muv -Luv spin-off???? Well if there is then it\'s probably worth waiting.So, my judgment for this sequel.....it\'s a good, and that\'s that. the art, sound and enjoyment cu\'z there just no need when the story plot of the franchise was still depended as to how the franchise started.Character- For the male MC, Shirogane, Takeru, to show his fear and despair is good cu\'z it show his human side, beside he wasn\'t suppose to be in that world in the first place, he simply was just isekaied in another world that is under treat from Extra Terrestrial  Species called ""BETA"", but given that he has stayed in that world simply intertwines his relationship with his world to the world where he got in.....so even if he does go back to his world who ever dies from the world he came from will happen to the one he know in his home world.Yuuko Kouzuki- Now she another  character here to which it wasn\'t know if she\'s the good girl or the bad one given her willingness to get her hands dirty.

I thought some elements were ok at best from its music and animation. When you watch this and the first season as a standalone mech anime its a very run of the mill human vs alien conflict. If you're familiar with the source material that being the visual novels then this season is gonna make you feel like a kick to the jaws.Where do I even begin? To describe my disappoint would be like if it the Harry Potter books were getting a film adaptation but...instead of adapting from Sorcerer's of Stone to Deathly Hallows. It would be just be adapting the first two books and end it right there rather then of the rest of the story. Skipping all potential story arcs, conflict and end results. Which what this second season feels like.On a positive side of things, Sadogashima is the biggest highlight for me. All the action and drama that ensues is probably my favorite part of the whole thing. Everything else after that just sort of ends. You could argue that this potentially setting up for a third season and I'd be ok with that and I hope this is not the final season.But if you're going to adapt the entirety of Alternative. What about Takeru going back to the other world? The BETA threat and the main HIVE? Sumika and the sudden revelations of why she's traumatized about Takeru? The prevention of ALTERNATIVE 5!?!?Is all of this going to be resolved? No, then what's the point? That aside. While trimming down and changes to adaptations are very common place in these things it will either work out fine or it won't work at all. It feels like there's a lot of stuff that's missing that to those who're watching this will be pretty lost.There's a ton of exposition in the VN and while it may seem like a drag it does however tell you important things on why this is a big deal. I didn't think 12 episodes could even convey all the important key plot points.I dunno if I can really recommend this if you're not familiar with MUV-LUV at all. If you enjoyed this adaptation, more power for you I'm glad you got something good out of it. I won't judge you even if you don't know MUV-LUV at all.Before I end, what's even the point of adding a new character to the story if they have little to contribute to the plot?

The mech visuals are good as always, and they even got the classic VN OP singers back to sing the OP for this season. It's less confusing for newcomers due to reaching the more exciting part of the story that also does not rely on unadapted material that much and has many fights, the character animation is more consistent with far fewer weird-looking moments, and the aforementioned good mech animation is used for those large-scale fights to its fullest potential. Season 1 was already notably better after the first three episodes, but this...season blows everything in season 1 out of the water. They really did well with adapting some of the key moments of the original story here, even on an emotional level.Even though a season 3 is unlikely (season 2 was announced right after season 1 ended), I prefer the two-thirds of an MLA adaptation that we have through these two seasons, to rushing everything in 1-2 cours like we thought they would. To any VN readers who are thinking about watching this or dropped the show early on in season 1, trust me, it really DOES get better after the first few episodes in season 1, and especially in this season. For newcomers, I would first and formost recommend reading the visual novel or officially translated manga first if you want to understand all the details and get a more complete experience.

Why not just do it well?I still have voice acting issues as well, especially the guy who voiced Takeru. He's the MC yet they picked a guy who basically just finished acting school and in fact this is his first gig. Granted he's a bit better than in season 1 but that's not saying much. He still lacks...the authority to be Takeru.I also feel the VN spent a bit of time talking about the meaning to be Japanese.

It\'s a simple premise, but up until the latter half of Season 2, the plot and the pacing felt whack and derailed. Sure, the whole thing about alternate realities and jumping between timelines to save the world is interesting, but if I...want to watch something like that, I\'d watch Steins Gate. I get that it\'s a melodrama still, but a lot of times it feels like I\'m watching a different show. It\'s things like this why Season 1 was such a massive let down, and at worst, felt incredibly misleading. Muv-Luv has a great worldbuilding, has these really cool Mechs based on real fighter aircraft, and the BETA. Why are they not the focus?!When we do eventually get to the part about retaking Sado though, everything picks up and the show instantly becomes much more enjoyable. There\'s still melodrama that would get people a NJP, court martial or even killed should it happen in real life, but it\'s not detriment to the story and actually adds more. This is how the show\'s melodrama should have been handled.The climax of the battle is exactly something that you would expect from a show with a premise like this. It\'s perfect, it\'s bittersweet and the emotional impact felt deserved than forced.Characters: More enjoyable this time aroundThe MC in Season 1 was not likeable, like at all. Seeing him suffer in the first half of Season 2, his shit getting kicked in and suffer some more was honestly quite satisfying and lowkey funny. But, because of what he went through, he was able to overcome and grow up as a character. He\'s still an angsty anime teenager, but he isnt as insufferable that you are actually able to root for him to succeed during battles.The original 207B cast and the addition Sumika are still meh, but putting more focus on the Valkyries, in particular the squad lead and the rest of the leadership is such a welcome one. Despite not having as much screen time, the aforementioned Valkyrie characters are enjoyable. They act their part as the seniors and as combat veterans without feeling like bland, generic military characters. If anything, the Valkyries should have been part of the main cast instead of being the supporting ones.Visuals & Audio: Hype, hype and even more hype?!Evan Call, the music composer for this show is a peak hype machine. The battles wouldnt be as impactful if it were not for Evan\'s music, and that new track that plays during the Sado battles for a few episodes simply out-hypes ""Not Yet Dead"" from Season 1. The new Opening is also hype and hopeful, which fits the show a lot more than Season 1\'s Rinne by VWP. The ending music though, also by VWP is simply beautiful and bittersweet, it perfectly captures the vibes and emotions when it\'s played on screen.The animation and CGI are about the same as Season 1 when it comes to ""quality"". There is no sense of weight and realism, it\'s fast paced and a spectacle, but it is very enjoyable. There is a very short scene in Episode 8 where we get a cockpit view POV inside the Mech during combat, it\'s  delicious, it\'s hype and it gives us a tiny glimpse of just how fast faced and how much reaction time is such a big thing when it comes to close ranged TSF fights.Personal Enjoyment: Stop teasing and give us the goods!I say this as a Muv-Luv fan, the setting is wonderful, the worldbuilding is intriguing, the TSF / TSA designs are fantastic, and the BETA are disgusting and uncanny. The show is at its peak when we get these. For the casual viewer, these are what they probably expected, so give it to us! I don\'t care if the adaptation is faithful / unfaithful to the VN, dont waste our time by giving us these filler stuff that feels deralied to the main story.When a good portion of the show are anything but the mentioned above, it feels like we\'re being teased in a bad way. It takes away from the atmosphere, the urgency and when you literally forget that there is an alien invasion going on where billions are already dead, that\'s not a good thing.Summary: Stick to the premise!If Season 1 was a cold unseasoned bagel, Season 2 is like eating left over cake for lunch. It could be better, there are more nutritious food to eat, but you\'ll get by for the rest of your day. You could skip the cold stale bread and only eat the frosting and the toppings and still enjoy it, but that alone could leave you wanting for more. The latter half of Season 2 is a fantastic example of the show\'s premise being fully utilized as humanity\'s desperate struggle against an unstoppable, existential threat - they really should focus on this way more.Should a Season 3 exist, it can only get better from here. want to watch something like that, I\'d watch Steins Gate.

Narue no Sekai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/840/Narue_no_Sekai,"[""I recently purchased the collector's boxset of this for a very good price, having not seen a single episode before. I was able to get through all 12 eps in a day; for someone who can barely stand five eps of anime per day sometimes...well, that says something I guess. Now, let's get down to it.Story 6/10Nothing really new here. The World of Narue is, at first glance, a rather bland romantic, high-school comedy involving 14-year olds. The difference here lies in simple execution; each episode brings something new, but adds a nice degree of continuity to the story as a whole. As it develops,...Kazuto and Narue have to deal with a lot of obstacles as a new couple; the biggest of which is Narue's status as an alien. As in any rom-com, they meet new friends, learn new lessons, share new experiences, etc etc.Art 7/10Can't really compare the manga since I haven't read it, but Studio Live's anime production does a decent job to say the least, with 3D help from Gonzo (who seem to always do well when they're not PRODUCING shows). I didn't notice any major issues with the animation.Sound 7/10Takayuki Negishi (Card Captor Sakura) offers his music-making talents for the show. The show benefits most, however, from the rather famous music production studio of Lantis, who have worked on dozens of notable titles.Character 9/10Like most romantic comedies, the biggest key to success is characterization, and development of such; relationships, motivation, plausibility, etc. I believe this show does an oustanding job of showing how two people have to overcome various hardships due to their ethnic diversity (not just one example in it, either). I almost melted more than a few times at various scenes with Kazuto and Narue, especially with Mamiko Noto's usual A+ performance as the heroine. Being an alien must be tough, though...Enjoyment 8/10What can I say, I'm a sucker for a romance that actually WORKS. I enjoyed pretty much every episode of this to an extent, despite how cliche-riddled it can get. It should definitely get filed on any anime enthusiast's shelf as a good &quot;pick-me-up anime.&quot;Overall 8/10This show is probably severely underrated. Simply put, if you like these kinds of shows, then you're welcome to join me in Narue's world. Download the 12 episodes of it, or buy it at a very reasonable price (should be just over $20 on DVD Pacific).

It’s not so bad to have anime clichés in your anime, it’s how you use them. This series uses them in the most boring manner imaginable.The anime plot is pretty basic. Girl saves boy, girl is alien, girl and guy get in to wacky adventures, guy wants to pork said alien. Shocker, the boy is a fucking otaku and the girl is a walking doormat. Narue is the alien and Kazuto is the bitch, I mean boy. There are no plot twists and...from there it turns into a slice of life. There isn't much sci-fi going on despite its premise. If I had to compare this story to any other anime it would be Oh! My Goddess. The girl is a reason why the I’m not completely opposed to the feminist movement. She’s exactly the type of girl meant to appeal to otaku fetishists. Not to mention the mechaphiles. There’s a ship that turns into a woman. Feel free to stop reading the review now if that was enough to seal the deal. The only people that are going to be watching a show with a story like this are either otaku idealists or young girls who find this show cute. The biggest problem with romantic comedy/slice of life type of shows is their endings. This anime takes the cake. It just…ends. In the same vein that I hated Kare Kano for just ending. How does it end though? In the most otaku’s wet dream imaginable. A cosplay contest to please her man.The art is nothing special. There are no great fight scenes, no amazing romantic kiss scene...everything is just mediocre. All the characters look like stock anime characters. In short, make sure to drink some coffee before you pop this in the DVD player. I looked up the character design and it looks like some guy named Takaaki Hirayama did the character designs. What else has this guy done? Motherfucking Mamotte Shugogetten, another “let me please you because I’m willing to do whatever for you” anime.As far as sound goes, this anime goes nowhere. Narue’s soundtrack sounds a lot like that of a visual novel. It’s pretty bland and does nothing to bring up any emotions. The Japanese track for this is not half bad. A lot of the seiyuu aren’t high-pitched annoying, just there. I knew I’d heard Kazuto’s voice somewhere before though..somewhere bad.. MOTHERFUCKING MAMOTTE SHUGOGETTEN! Mr. Daisuke Sakaguchi is just one of those guys I will never ever accept his voice after series like this. As for the English dub, it’s flat. Nothing special, it gets the job done for a series like this.I hate everyone in this series. Everyone. I hate to rag on series as if they’re terrible, but everyone is so mediocre. The only highlight of this whole series is the ship woman. She wants to get married. If you had to see one episode of this series, it’s the ship relationship episode. I for one do not condone mecha-human relationships. It’s wrong and immoral and God would not stand for it.I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. It’s not that this show is bad, it’s just mediocre, and mediocrity is what really sucks. However, I know people will watch this because of its‘ moe♥moe kyuun aspect. However, those people don’t read my reviews..well no one really does, but you get the point. Don’t buy it, don’t download it, just pretend you never read this or even heard of the series.You can read more of my reviews at kanjiiz.wordpress.com from there it turns into a slice of life.

The World of Narue (or Narue no Sekai) fits squarely into the third category. This somewhat pleasant sci-fi romantic comedy manages to retread  overused material without being offensive. It is also so pedestrian that it fails to be memorable.Right from the get-go, the show proves to be completely unambitious. The story follows the relationship of  Kazuto Iizuki and Narue Nanase. Events unfold very typically: boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl turns out to be an alien (weird so call such an event typical, but...in anime, it is). What follows is a string of misadventures and shenanigans that's only focus is to put the couple in weird situations. Often these situations will somehow end up showing the devotion they have for one another. There really is not much of a moving plot in this show, rather things just happen.The show never takes itself seriously (or at least not too seriously), which actually is a good move by the staff. Given that the material is so tired, it would take exceptionally good writing to carry the show dramatically, something World of Narue is definitely lacking. Instead, the show opts to retain a light atmosphere and fool around its entire run. This actually makes the show enjoyable if you are willing to turn your brain off, and watch the characters' silly antics. The sci-fi elements in the show are rather silly, featuring beautiful woman androids that control ships and space ninjas. Most of  the characters also seem to take things in stride, even the weirdest, most outlandish situations. All this comes together to give the show a campy feel, which makes the show's gigantic gaps in logic easy enough to accept so long as you don't think about them too much.There are a few times the show actually does attempt serious drama. More often than not these moments involve Naure and Kazuto relationship, putting the couple through spats of jealousy and dangerous situations. However, there are some that involve other characters, like the arrival of Naure's older yet younger sister (it's complicated), and the love affair of a runaway military android. These attempts at drama are brief, forced, and lack impact; so it is good the show does not take itself serious most of the time.The characters themselves, again, are more or less familiar anime archetypes. Narue is the nice and caring, but weird leading lady. Kazuto is the well meaning dork who is always accepting of Narue. Narue's father is the typical clueless parental unit; Kasuto's friend Maruo is carefree... the list of typical character traits goes on and on. There is a bit of a stand out in the UFO obsessed Hajime Yagi, whose alien centered rambling is always entertaining; and also in Kanaka, Narue's mischievous older/younger sister. Even still, there really is not anything remarkable about these characters; there is little in way of complex characterization, and because of that none of the characters are particularly memorable.Visually, and I'm starting to feel like a broken record, the show fails to distinguish itself. This is pretty much as generic as an anime can look. Characters are generally cute, in their big-eyed expressiveness, but the same can be said about any slice-of-life anime. Backgrounds consist of the usual urban landscape, and school classrooms and hallways. Likewise, the music is the usual bubbly stuff that plays in the casual moments of most anime, with a typical sci-fi score for the space and action scenes.This animated adaptation of a manga is the perfect picture of an inoffensive but completely uninspired show. Everything you will see here, you have seen elsewhere; possibly even better. I really wish I could say more, but there is nothing left to say.

World of Narue seemingly mixes around sci-fi, romantic comedy and slice-of-life in its focus on our female alien lead Narue who gets a human boyfriend named Kazuto as they try maintaining a normal relationship despite Narue's alien origins leading to sometimes hostile, sometimes bizarre situations. There are some aspects of its storytelling that aren't executed well such as its implementation of action with the two incidents with alien ninjas and the sudden developments that lead Narue and Kazuto into becoming a couple.On the plus side though, the series does offer a decent amount of depth...and development with its characters and premise as we do get a sense of how complicated Narue's life is with her alien origins and how her father decided to wind up living on Earth. Additional characters are introduced among both humans and aliens who also get some fleshing out in regards to their life on Earth and connection to Narue.The comedy to the series mostly comes from the chemistry in Narue and Kazuto's relationship, as well as some of the bizarre predicaments they sometimes get into thanks to alien technology that is employed. For the most part though, I was indifferent towards this. There are also some otaku bits shown at points in the series such as Kazuto's interest in a magical girl anime and some fan service with Narue, but these don't detract too much from the series at all for the most part.The visuals for the series are rather standard for an early 2000s anime. Characters are drawn with conventional designs and scenic shots are nicely drawn with a decent amount of detail, though are nothing out of the ordinary. Animation shortcuts are milked at points in the series with still shots and jump cuts, though CG animation is employed at points whenever alien spaceships or gadgets are used. The average presentation doesn't detract from the series too much given its premise, but it doesn't stick out too much either.Overall, the series is a decent time-killer with what it offers up with its light romantic content as it is charming and offers decent focus on its cast without overdoing things with its sci-fi approach. It's a pretty cheap addition you can make for your anime collection as well as I got my copy of the complete series for only $10. and development with its characters and premise as we do get a sense of how complicated Narue's life is with her alien origins and how her father decided to wind up living on Earth.

She finds a boyfriend and have various encounters with both human culture and alien elements.Story:8A very unique story. This series concentrates on mainly trans-species/planetary love and slice of life and school life. This is in contrast to DearS and Chobits, where the non-human knows nothing and act blur, needing a human guy to teach em stuff while they act cute. Narue and her companions from space seem to have blended well into human culture (a little...too well in fact).The story is quite focused on romance, and have about 3 pairs of couples included, instead of the usual 1. All 3 are not human-human relationships and therefore there are obstacles that occurred. However, romance was formed a bit too easily, more emphasis was placed on how the guy and gal cherish each other. Therefore, if you are looking for a build-up to romance story (eg. ToraDora, Lovely Complex) this series may not be for you.Slice of life was quite unique, given the supernatural equipment that the characters had. Somehow I felt the slice of life elements to be similar to Wagaya no Oinari-sama. School life was portrayed in quite an interesting manner, but in the later episodes school was not focused much upon.There were hardly much action scenes, and I felt that the producers made the right decision. The action scenes featured were somewhat of a lower quality compared to slower scenes.The ending was kinda un-conclusive (according to MangaUpdates this anime is until vol.4 of the manga) which can be understood. However, there isn\'t much of a closure (which B Gata H Kei managed well) as well, which is a bit disappointing.Animation:6The colours were a bit dull, even though this show was produced in 2003. Also, the action scenes were a bit... in slow motion and doesn\'t look very realistic. But the art was consistent.Sound:8Not a great variety of sound effects (eg. bgm) featured. However, the bgm was used well, and helped to create the mood for the scenes.A highlight of this show is the OP AND ED.The OP ""Shooting Star"" by CooRie was done amazingly, and is definitely one of my fav OPs ever (It tells of the determination of a person to treasure and maintain a relationship despite difficulties)... one that can match the level of ""Shooting Star"" by Kotoko in the series Onegai Teacher.The ED ""Ice Cream"" by Saeko Chiba is a sweet song about romance, about how the person accidentally fell in love without being mentally prepared first.Both were so great that I watched all the 12 eps\' OP and ED without skipping, which is seriously rare.Character:6Characters were slightly less spectacular in this series. Some character development and character interaction were done, and done well, but I felt that too little emphasis was given to Narue and Kazuto (her bf).The content was spaced out quite evenly among the main characters and some extra characters, but Narue is supposed to be the most important character in this series. Yet, there wasn\'t that much content about her. Narue\'s sister had some unfinished development as well.The characters\' personalities were done well. Unique traits were emphasised over and over again. Eg. Narue being very very thrifty (money-pincher?) Most importantly, the personalities they had were put to good useEnjoyment:9After the first few eps, which were kinda slow, I began to be addicted to the series. There were tons of emotional and touching moments. But, some problems were resolved a bit too easily... The romance in this series is really unique and great as well, similar to Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, although this series has more couples being focused on.Overall:7Take note that this anime is NOT MEANT TO BE CONCLUSIVE as it only ends at vol 4 of manga. While I\'m writing this review, I believe the manga is still ongoing at vol 7. This anime is sweet and light, but at times a bit tear-jerking.I recommend it for people who enjoyed romance series like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, where there is little build-up to romance but more emphasis after the boy-girl relationship is formed. too well in fact).The story is quite focused on romance, and have about 3 pairs of couples included, instead of the usual 1.

This isn’t to say that the characters don’t develop.There’s a chapter with Narue’s sister Kanaka making friends with Hajime, a bizarre story where Kazuto turns into a cat (and travels in time), and a cosplay episode. They even manage to fit two beach episodes in! Well, a beach and a pool episode, It had little  comedy, romance, this anime more about  sci-fi.The last Ep was yes bad. "", 'Story (5): The story was pretty basic and didn\'t really go anywhere by the last episode. The adventures Narue and Kasu had we\'re entertaining, but that\'s literally it. The episodes felt like filler and didn\'t follow the story synopsis very much. The adventure part yes, and the ""fighting space invaders and androids"" for like 2 or 3 episodes. The rest of them were just random episodes of them just doing different things.Art/Animation (7): For it\'s time this was pretty good. I like the colors, and animation was decent! I will say that the characters designs were pretty generic though.Sound: (7): I enjoyed the...ambient piano soundtrack through the series. The OP and ED were solid aswell.Character: (5): These characters aren\'t very interesting unfortunately. They get the job done i guess, but personality wise and design wise, they just kinda fade into obscurity. Quite forgettable! Hajime was probably the most entertaining character due to her being obsessed with exposing Narue for being an alien and was funny.  BUT 100% I absolutely thought that the 3 school girls who we\'re bullies with straight up annoying. I hated seeing them, luckily only for a few episodes.Overall (6): i can\'t really recommend anyone to watch this due too the fact that it doesn\'t have enough going for it. Not much story, the villains are one-dimensional and barely there, characters are forgettable and are okay for getting the job done. It has some funny moments and the show is still entertaining to watch, just don\'t go into it expecting a ton from it. It is still a cute show but it has it\'s own issues.6/10. It is fine. ambient piano soundtrack through the series. The OP and ED were solid aswell.Character: (5): These characters aren\'t very interesting unfortunately.

It is fine.', '""Don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover"" That\'s what we are all told,  There are times where this advice is useful like watching Madoka, Gakkou Garashi, or even Yurikuma Arashi based on the openings alone. But for every action there is an equal/opposite reaction and that is the casw with me. I always have the luck of watching a show with a great opening but the actual show itself is soooooooo bad. This is one case. I will try to make this review as short as possibleNarue no Sekai(the World of Narue) is pretty much Onegai Teacher but it\'s not as cringey. There is...guy named Densuke i mean, Kazuto and she meets the grown up version of Chiyo chan from Azumanga Daioh  who was actually an alien the whole time and changed her name to Narue.And this is a story that is about love, at least you think it is. But actually this story for some reason is about annoying people, annoying little sisters,annoying animals, and very annoying voice actors. Not to mention really stupid situations. Throughout the whole show instead of building romance of the two your supposed to care about but the show fails on making it look like there was relationship in the first place going on.INstead we got cosplay competitions and the good ol date stakeout. And then there is some background episodes that really don\'t freaking matter because they don\'t even try to make Narue interesting to the point where we want to know about her powers and her annoying AF sister.But that\'s only the beginning.The art is okay it\'s not great but it\'s not Isuca so that\'s all that matters. It really just doesn\'t age well.This show came out in Spring 2003 and it really didn\'t stand a chance against Kaleido Star , Technolyze and freaking Wolf\'s Rain which aired the previous year.The special effects are nice but they are still special effects. The actual animation is Sky Wizards Academy level.(which is a compliment on Narue \'s part since this came out in 2003 and Sky Wizards Academy came out in 2015.well anyways. What I don\'t understand is why this show has so many panty shots. This show is not an ecchi at all but still there are so many useless panty shots.The actual 3D in the show is good. Oh i\'m not talking about the show, i\'m talking about the opening because it\'s freaking amazing, actually it\'s the entire reason that I watched this show from beginning to end just to watch the opening speaking of whichThe OpeningThe opening of the show is amazing because it takes everything nice and puts it together. First the 3D is amazing and the overlay of the snow effects and the colors for the different seasons of year look amazing . The magic alien effects are great too. I even like the little bit that introduces all the minor characters because they are in snycThe music . Wait there was music? Oh I didn\'t know because I was busy gushing over the OP and ED themes. The ED is one of the best endings I have ever heard. Because it hits the ball in the right places in its genre alone. It\'s not some bubblegum pop crap. It was full of guitars and wind instruments and it was amazing. The same thing goes for the OP, holy crap. The OP would not have been the same without it and I would be here all day talking about it.I almost forgot to talk about the voice acting for the dub. It is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very bad.The best voice actress is Veronica Taylor who did a lot of work on Sailor Moon and even Ikki tousen, ironically.I thought she did a good job because she didn\'t have to do that much work.Her acting counterpart only has a limited amount of emotions, Happy,Sad, Slightly Annoyed,Loving, and Sweet. And that\'s it. Everyone else has the same amount of limited emotions, but they fail epically.The voice actor for Kazuto is very awkward but when he is not supposed to be awkward he is still awkward,The girl with the glasses sounds like she doesn\'t want to be in the recording booth. and the comic relief character has the most aaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyyying acting I have ever seen.And everyone else realized that they did not want to be there.I know because their acting shows it.I am really waisting my time talking about the character because if they are not boring, they are annoying.Kazuto is a very terrible person. This guy gets himself in bad situations but doesn\'t do anything about it and expects for Narue to  get him out. Also, there are times that other girls try to take Kazuto away from Narue and he just lets it happen. He doesn\'t comply with Narue at all and she has to do just about everything.Speaking of her, Narue as a character is all right, but she just has so many things against her since almost all the characters are complete freaking idiots.Her father is a complete pushover, her boyfriend is a complete c*nt, and don\'t even get me started about her OLDER YOUNGER sister.I don\'t hate the show, I just hate the fact that I actually bought the show on DVD because the opening and ending alone are phenomenal. But that\'s it. The show is just not remarkable. Like the interesting cover of a terrible book AKA""The Maze Runner Series"". It looks good , but still not worth 10 hours of your life.Overall-5There is also another show that I unfortunately trick myself into watchingI may get to that soon. guy named Densuke i mean, Kazuto and she meets the grown up version of Chiyo chan from Azumanga Daioh  who was actually an alien the whole time and changed her name to Narue.And this is a story that is about love, at least you think it is.

Mahou Shoujo Site,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36266/Mahou_Shoujo_Site,"[""The term “edgy” gets thrown around as some sort of criticism by people who like to sound smart and mature, because they engage with a medium for people half their age. Personally, I don’t use the word as a criticism, because I often enjoy edge a lot. I think there’s a level of edge that gets enjoyable, because it passes so many levels of believability that I don’t believe it was meant to be taken seriously in the first place. That’s where Mahou Shoujo Site comes in.A more accurate term to describe this anime would be “campy”, but fucking nobody uses that term so I’m...not gonna bother. This anime has knives so therefore it is edgy ha ha ha never saw that joke coming did you.You may be thinking that this is a matter of “turning your brain off” to enjoy something--ignoring the flaws to indulge in the positives. This is also false. I don’t believe in such a concept. In fact, I present the opposite: you should keep an open mind and keep your brain turned on to understand why a creator would make such a thing in such a way.“Mahou Site is sooooo edgy!!! It’s just a bunch of shock value!!!”Wow, it’s almost like that was the fucking point or something. Some people like edgy schlock like this. Why? Who knows. Maybe I’m just some sick fuck looking to get off. Or maybe it’s because I don’t always need a compelling narrative to pick my brain. Look, I’m mentally challenged enough. I don’t need my damn cartoons to enforce that. Sometimes, I like to keep it nice and simple. There are girls in this anime, and they get hurt a lot. It’s not real, so I don’t need to take it seriously. And that’s about it. At no point did I ever get the impression that Mahou Site was supposed to be taken seriously. It wasn’t even trying to take itself seriously half the time, and I can explain this just by looking at the first episode.Asagiri, the main character, thinks about throwing herself in front of an oncoming train, but hesitates at the last minute. As she sits on the ground in her despair, office men on their way to work mutter to themselves how it’s too early in the day to deal with this kind of bullshit, that they were slightly inconvenienced by her attempted suicide.This is the best thing that happens to her on this day.She goes to school and gets thrashed around by some bullies. Then she goes home and gets thrashed around by her brother. Her only salvation is taking care of a stray cat, which the bullies kill on the next day, right before they send in a JoJo character to come rape her.So, in fifteen minutes, we’ve already covered suicide, bullying, rape, animal murder, and domestic abuse. Some would tell you this is all an act to make you pity the main character, and while you’re free to do that, I don’t feel that any attempt was made at making Asagiri a likable character, and here’s why:Aya Asagiri is not a character at all.You see her in an ordinary day, where she lives through incredible amounts of horrifying things, but at no point do you ever get a sense of who this person really is. Her entire character is defined by the things that happen to her. And, at the expense of making my most callous remarks to date, there is simply no logic behind her survival. She hesitates to end her life, but why? She doesn’t have anything to live for. No friends, no dreams, not even a conviction that “it gets better”. Aya Asagiri walks this fictional Earth only to suffer. Anyone who’s depressed, suicidal, victims of bullying, etc. all put up with it for some clear, emotional reason. Aya does not, which is what separates her from being an actual character you are meant to take seriously, as opposed to an avatar for projecting suffering onto.In regards to the graphic loli suffering plastered on the screen, it’s all there just for you to gawk at. Maybe you have some weird fetish, or this kind of thing is just amusing you. You do you. Personally, I find it funny. Mahou Site is cute. It’s a level of edge that comes around to being endearing, because it passes so many levels of believability. Even disregarding my argument about Asagiri not being a real character, the things that happen to her are so extreme that I can only see the thinnest lines of logic. Knives in her locker, that’s believable. Glue on the chair in the class, that’s believable--the recent season of 3-gatsu kinda covered that. But setting up a rape in the back room and watching it? Look, I’ve already proven that I’m not the greatest person, but this is crossing a few lines of sanity here. Not to mention that the older brother beats the shit out of Asagiri right in her bedroom. What the hell kind of soundproofing did they do to their house to keep the parents from not hearing all of the screaming and gasping and thumping? I just moved into a new basement with a thin roof, so it’s very creaky and I can hear everyone talking and having sex, so I’d like to get in on this.Shit, I’m already 900 words into this review for a website I don’t even like using and I still haven’t even scratched the surface of how silly this anime is. How about the fact that one of the magical girls is some bizarre fetish idol group that wears dog costumes and calls their fans their “masters”? Or the magical girl that has some weird, old-ass, masochistic butler who praises her existence so much that he lives to be stepped on? How about the scene where the brother… you know what, no. I can’t spoil that episode. It’s too good to be sullied by this review.All that I’m trying to say is that Mahou Site is wacky. And if you have a problem with that, then that lies with you alone. If you’re disappointed that this author isn’t making high art, that’s fine. And although I can’t speak on behalf of this person, I don’t believe they were trying to make high art in the first place. To dismiss Mahou Site as worthless simply because it is not to your standard is not a weakness of the anime or the creators, it’s a weakness of your own for not being able to accept things outside of your comfort zone. Look, I’m not trying to sound pretentious. I’m not perfect. I dropped Tada-kun after one episode because it bored me to tears. I don’t like anime that have natural characters in a natural setting, and they don’t do anything in particular, but it’s a romance because of course it is. There’s no real reason for that, I just don’t like them. But, I never got the impression that Tada-kun was a bad anime. It was just an anime that wasn’t for me.If you wanna see something from Spring 2018 that’s super edgy and DOES try taking itself seriously, go look at Devils Line. However, I won't go into detail about that because this is a review for Mahou Shoujo Site and not Devils Line. You can ask me about it if you want. That’s all I have left to say on the matter.If you're interested in the story itself, it's not much on paper. Girls get magical items called Sticks, and they use them to do things, and they have to prevent some sort of doomsday. Some people, aka dumbasses, will tell you that this is a Madoka ripoff, but it's really not a unique formula to begin with, as many action series, anime or otherwise, have some sort of doomsday plot. Overall, I don't really have anything to say about the story itself because it's not anything special, but the way it's told is very fun, and that's what's most important.Now, all this being said, does this mean I have no complaints about Mahou Site? Not true at all. It could’ve been better in a lot of ways. As much as I’ve said that the anime shouldn’t be taken seriously, there were admittedly some moments where scenes get heavier and more emotional, and it doesn’t pay off too well as they not only drag on for too long, but the characters aren’t engaging enough to get behind.I also would’ve preferred more action in this series, since it involves a bunch of magical weapons and abilities. While there are a few big, key fights to be seen, the anime plays more like a drama than an action thriller. I suppose this could be more of a preference, because both elements blended together fairly well, but it should be kept in mind that it’s not super action-heavy.Moreover, Asagiri develops into a character that’s just annoying and even more non-sensical than when she had no personality. Hearing her try to plead with others to not harm the ones who’ve caused her grief is just strange and unsatisfying. I was hoping she would have some super badass moment where the gloves come off and she unleashes a rage that reciprocates all of the wrong that’s been done to her in the past, but instead she insists on playing the good girl. It’s boring. People don’t like Guts because he had a shit life. People like Guts because his shit life hardened him into a living badass, so you know that when goes into battle, he does NOT fuck around.Fortunately, the other characters manage to pick up the slack. They’re not amazing, but they’re enjoyable enough to keep the show on its feet. Yatsumura works great as the #2 of the show, and the side characters are about as weird as they come. I already mentioned the fetish idol, but I didn’t mention the girl who felt the need to state that she had big tits like four times in one episode, or the girl whose Magical Girl weapon is a knife that cuts herself to heal others, and that she’s okay with it because she was “already practicing self-harm.” But the real star of the show is the bad boi Onii-chan, whose personality is so off-the-rails that you could tell the author wrote him with a smile on their face. It helps a lot that star actor Nobuhiko Okamoto delivers him with tons of conviction. And I’ll say it again: this character has the greatest scene in recent years.The soundtrack had no notable pieces, but the voice acting was good all-around. I already praised Okamoto, and I’ll do it again because he was great. Newcomer Yuko Ono does a solid job as Asagiri, nailing the despairing moments well along with having a wispy, wimpey voice without sounding like a dying mouse. Yuu Serizawa also delivers with the character of Nijimin, who has some rather severe shifts in tone that happen quickly, and both sides are done well. The OP grew on me a bit--it’s not much more than a standard rock tune with a bit of an edgy streak to it, but it gets the job done. Same with the ED, but less so. Rather, they are carried with their visual presentation--the OP has a cool camera effect that looks like it’s being played through a broken screen or lens. The ED is……… uh, it’s something. Something about two girls doing a live-action dance on a school rooftop while a bunch of sperm cells float around in the background. Yeah, I dunno.Art and animation--ugh, can I go now? I just wanted to dunk on people who were talking shit about me liking this anime because apparently edgy = bad or some stupid bullshit. Look, I’ll just leave this 7/10 score right here, and that should tell you the art is good but not amazing. Alright?Alright, kids, what have we learned today? We learned that watching violent cartoons is okay, there’s no such thing as turning your brain off, and that if you have no personality then you should kill yourself. Alright, cool.

This anime has knives so therefore it is edgy ha ha ha never saw that joke coming did you.You may be thinking that this is a matter of “turning your brain off” to enjoy something--ignoring the flaws to indulge in the positives. This is also false. I don’t believe in such a concept. In fact, I present the opposite: you should keep an open mind and keep your brain turned on to understand why a creator would make such a thing in such a way.“Mahou Site is sooooo edgy!!! It’s just a bunch of shock value!!!”Wow, it’s almost like that was the fucking point or something. Some people like edgy schlock like this. Why? Who knows. Maybe I’m just some sick fuck looking to get off. Or maybe it’s because I don’t always need a compelling narrative to pick my brain. Look, I’m mentally challenged enough. I don’t need my damn cartoons to enforce that. Sometimes, I like to keep it nice and simple. There are girls in this anime, and they get hurt a lot. It’s not real, so I don’t need to take it seriously. And that’s about it. At no point did I ever get the impression that Mahou Site was supposed to be taken seriously. It wasn’t even trying to take itself seriously half the time, and I can explain this just by looking at the first episode.Asagiri, the main character, thinks about throwing herself in front of an oncoming train, but hesitates at the last minute. As she sits on the ground in her despair, office men on their way to work mutter to themselves how it’s too early in the day to deal with this kind of bullshit, that they were slightly inconvenienced by her attempted suicide.This is the best thing that happens to her on this day.She goes to school and gets thrashed around by some bullies. Then she goes home and gets thrashed around by her brother. Her only salvation is taking care of a stray cat, which the bullies kill on the next day, right before they send in a JoJo character to come rape her.So, in fifteen minutes, we’ve already covered suicide, bullying, rape, animal murder, and domestic abuse. Some would tell you this is all an act to make you pity the main character, and while you’re free to do that, I don’t feel that any attempt was made at making Asagiri a likable character, and here’s why:Aya Asagiri is not a character at all.You see her in an ordinary day, where she lives through incredible amounts of horrifying things, but at no point do you ever get a sense of who this person really is. Her entire character is defined by the things that happen to her. And, at the expense of making my most callous remarks to date, there is simply no logic behind her survival. She hesitates to end her life, but why? She doesn’t have anything to live for. No friends, no dreams, not even a conviction that “it gets better”. Aya Asagiri walks this fictional Earth only to suffer. Anyone who’s depressed, suicidal, victims of bullying, etc. all put up with it for some clear, emotional reason. Aya does not, which is what separates her from being an actual character you are meant to take seriously, as opposed to an avatar for projecting suffering onto.In regards to the graphic loli suffering plastered on the screen, it’s all there just for you to gawk at. Maybe you have some weird fetish, or this kind of thing is just amusing you. You do you. Personally, I find it funny. Mahou Site is cute. It’s a level of edge that comes around to being endearing, because it passes so many levels of believability. Even disregarding my argument about Asagiri not being a real character, the things that happen to her are so extreme that I can only see the thinnest lines of logic. Knives in her locker, that’s believable. Glue on the chair in the class, that’s believable--the recent season of 3-gatsu kinda covered that. But setting up a rape in the back room and watching it? Look, I’ve already proven that I’m not the greatest person, but this is crossing a few lines of sanity here. Not to mention that the older brother beats the shit out of Asagiri right in her bedroom. What the hell kind of soundproofing did they do to their house to keep the parents from not hearing all of the screaming and gasping and thumping? I just moved into a new basement with a thin roof, so it’s very creaky and I can hear everyone talking and having sex, so I’d like to get in on this.Shit, I’m already 900 words into this review for a website I don’t even like using and I still haven’t even scratched the surface of how silly this anime is. How about the fact that one of the magical girls is some bizarre fetish idol group that wears dog costumes and calls their fans their “masters”? Or the magical girl that has some weird, old-ass, masochistic butler who praises her existence so much that he lives to be stepped on? How about the scene where the brother… you know what, no. I can’t spoil that episode. It’s too good to be sullied by this review.All that I’m trying to say is that Mahou Site is wacky. And if you have a problem with that, then that lies with you alone. If you’re disappointed that this author isn’t making high art, that’s fine. And although I can’t speak on behalf of this person, I don’t believe they were trying to make high art in the first place. To dismiss Mahou Site as worthless simply because it is not to your standard is not a weakness of the anime or the creators, it’s a weakness of your own for not being able to accept things outside of your comfort zone. Look, I’m not trying to sound pretentious. I’m not perfect. I dropped Tada-kun after one episode because it bored me to tears. I don’t like anime that have natural characters in a natural setting, and they don’t do anything in particular, but it’s a romance because of course it is. There’s no real reason for that, I just don’t like them. But, I never got the impression that Tada-kun was a bad anime. It was just an anime that wasn’t for me.If you wanna see something from Spring 2018 that’s super edgy and DOES try taking itself seriously, go look at Devils Line. However, I won't go into detail about that because this is a review for Mahou Shoujo Site and not Devils Line. You can ask me about it if you want. That’s all I have left to say on the matter.If you're interested in the story itself, it's not much on paper. Girls get magical items called Sticks, and they use them to do things, and they have to prevent some sort of doomsday. Some people, aka dumbasses, will tell you that this is a Madoka ripoff, but it's really not a unique formula to begin with, as many action series, anime or otherwise, have some sort of doomsday plot. Overall, I don't really have anything to say about the story itself because it's not anything special, but the way it's told is very fun, and that's what's most important.Now, all this being said, does this mean I have no complaints about Mahou Site? Not true at all. It could’ve been better in a lot of ways. As much as I’ve said that the anime shouldn’t be taken seriously, there were admittedly some moments where scenes get heavier and more emotional, and it doesn’t pay off too well as they not only drag on for too long, but the characters aren’t engaging enough to get behind.I also would’ve preferred more action in this series, since it involves a bunch of magical weapons and abilities. While there are a few big, key fights to be seen, the anime plays more like a drama than an action thriller. I suppose this could be more of a preference, because both elements blended together fairly well, but it should be kept in mind that it’s not super action-heavy.Moreover, Asagiri develops into a character that’s just annoying and even more non-sensical than when she had no personality. Hearing her try to plead with others to not harm the ones who’ve caused her grief is just strange and unsatisfying. I was hoping she would have some super badass moment where the gloves come off and she unleashes a rage that reciprocates all of the wrong that’s been done to her in the past, but instead she insists on playing the good girl. It’s boring. People don’t like Guts because he had a shit life. People like Guts because his shit life hardened him into a living badass, so you know that when goes into battle, he does NOT fuck around.Fortunately, the other characters manage to pick up the slack. They’re not amazing, but they’re enjoyable enough to keep the show on its feet. Yatsumura works great as the #2 of the show, and the side characters are about as weird as they come. I already mentioned the fetish idol, but I didn’t mention the girl who felt the need to state that she had big tits like four times in one episode, or the girl whose Magical Girl weapon is a knife that cuts herself to heal others, and that she’s okay with it because she was “already practicing self-harm.” But the real star of the show is the bad boi Onii-chan, whose personality is so off-the-rails that you could tell the author wrote him with a smile on their face. It helps a lot that star actor Nobuhiko Okamoto delivers him with tons of conviction. And I’ll say it again: this character has the greatest scene in recent years.The soundtrack had no notable pieces, but the voice acting was good all-around. I already praised Okamoto, and I’ll do it again because he was great. Newcomer Yuko Ono does a solid job as Asagiri, nailing the despairing moments well along with having a wispy, wimpey voice without sounding like a dying mouse. Yuu Serizawa also delivers with the character of Nijimin, who has some rather severe shifts in tone that happen quickly, and both sides are done well. The OP grew on me a bit--it’s not much more than a standard rock tune with a bit of an edgy streak to it, but it gets the job done. Same with the ED, but less so.

For me, the biggest example of that, is the latest edge cancer to pound the anime community known as: Mahou Shoujo Site.It is inevitable that within a community, when some concept does something to “break the mold” in a unique way and becomes a mega hit, there will be a ton of copycats spawning from it, to get a slice of that sweet...sweet dough. In Western Animation, films like Shrek, as well as cartoons like Ren & Stimpy and South Park made such big impacts that they inspired a jillion ripoffs continuing to this day, all misunderstanding what made their originals work. In anime, we’ve seen this a lot recently when shows attempt to make money by blatantly taking the template from a successful series. It has come with the success of the high school battle harem genre, the survival game genre, Sword Art Online, and of today’s subject: Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Not the earliest example of moe gone dark (When They Cry beats it by about half a decade), but certainly a modern landmark.Madoka Magica, a show using the disguise of a typical Mahou Shoujo praised for its artistry, emotional depth and willingness to go to dark places in showing its characters confronting mistakes they wished to undo, was a mega success, and other creators’ response to that was “if we take a Magical Girl show, and add dark elements, it’ll be a hit”. Shows like Yuki Yuna, Selector Infector WIXOSS, Magical Girl Raising Project and today’s subject: Mahou Shoujo Site, are a result of that bandwagoning.Having seen Yuki Yuna about two years ago, it felt like it went too safe with its content, not being able to properly explore the darker elements the same way Madoka did and not greatly delivering on the lighthearted fun at its front. At the time, I thought maybe if one of these shows would be more willing to handle darker themes, it could have interesting things to say about life and expectations. I was WROOOOOOOOOOOOOONG.Mahou Shoujo Site might, flat out, be the most thoroughly reprehensible, apathy inducing, tryhard, edgy, unpitiable, lazily produced, tonally deaf, inhumane, DISGUSTING pile of shit that I have ever come across. It sucks ass! It sucks balls! It sucks ASS BALLS!And it all starts from one of the worst first episodes I have ever seen for ANY series, let alone anime, one that was so bad it encouraged me to see this to the end just to tear it to shreds.The entire episode was nothing but torture porn, shown with a shy cute girl, to instantly draw sympathy dealing with a list of edge tactics like it was some sort of fucking checklist. These range from her contemplating suicide, to being emotionally/physically tortured by school bullies, to being viciously beaten by her psychopathic brother, having a cute kitten she saved be thrown in front of a train/delivered to her, and being nearly raped by an upperclassman while said bullies just snicker and watch. Eventually through the power of plot convenience, she obtains a magic gun that accidentally kills several of said bullies, only for her to be backed into a corner by another character threatening her with a razor blade. That character then gets stopped by an edgy sociopath girl who could control time.Using so many edge tactics would be laughable if it wasn’t so thoroughly DISGUSTING to watch. All of this torture throughout the first episode is handled in an overtly methodical way, not representative of genuine human fault but a lazy writer using every edgy thing he discovered as a means of forcing audience sympathy. It doesn’t work, not even in the slightest. Gore, violence and cruelty all have their place in a meaningful narrative when they underlie an interesting story or human drama, but going on episode 1 alone, more care seemed to be placed on the tools of edgelords compared to the basic essentials of story, character, or presentation.And yet, despite this awful first episode, it never tried to go further in darkness, but remained brain dead, single minded and bizarrely bipolar with edge to the end. The show was too lazy to even go to the same extremes again. People like me who wanted to watch this to see how much more torturous it could get were met with a barely functional Madoka plagiarist trying to wring earnest interactions out of fetishes with no sense of tone, pacing, or comradery.Everything from Episode 2 onwards is introducing a powerful world ending conflict (the nature of which was blatantly stolen from you know what), while other characters are slowly but surely brought in to put on their edgiest Yandere smile before becoming party members in the inevitable quest.There are many, many, many problems with the writing of this show but for me, the biggest one is tonal cohesion. It can be seen as a problem in a large amount of anime from Fullmetal Alchemist to The Ancient Magus Bride that there are silly comedy moments in addition to the handling of darker themes. However, shows like those keep their overall presentation at a respectable middle ground where either comedy or drama could work when needed, because they care and understand about character building causes for conflict or human drama. The one thing I wasn’t expecting Magical Girl Site to pull was have so many moments where “comedy” arises, whether through one character taking on an appearance with gag boobs, a reference to “apple butts”, comedy credits stingers with the sister-molesting older brother, XD chibi expressions, a girl who frequently gets off to smacking her old butler on the ass, magical mind control panties, or a Beach Episode.Yes, you heard that right. A BEACH EPISODE. A show where everything I mentioned in the first episode occurs, where a character cuts herself in order to heal people with blood, and where another character says “God has never abandoned me before” crazy eyed while bleeding from the mouth and nose, has time for a beach episode. The sheer extent of the whiplash is what really takes me out of anything the show attempts. Whatever humor exists here would be horribly unfunny even in a comedy show, but putting it in a show where nearly every girl deals with cold blooded torture and bleeds from some part of their body when using their power makes any attempts at wacky humor feel like incomprehensible tonal homicide. And not intentionally to create false ease like say, Higurashi. The humor mainly exists to fulfill more of the author’s obvious fetishes.And it’s not just the humor that detracts from the show’s tone, it’s the forced togetherness of the End of the World conflict (pretentiously called The Tempest) that brings it down to the dark depths of anime hell. In a show where crazed maniac girls are commonplace holding death grudges against one another, none of the many relationships feel like they build to comraderies. They just happen because the plot type demands it. Most egregiously with one of the bullies from Episode 1 that remained alive. Said character gets an incredibly disproportionate reason for starting her less than human bullying streak, nearly kills the protagonist at a latter point, and then just because the protagonist doesn’t kill her back, they become buddy buddies to stop the end of the world. WHAT?! Sure, there’s a realization there but that’s barely a redemption arc and it is unforgivable to try and move our sympathies to a girl who gleefully tortured the shy and ineffectual protagonist in Episode 1 because of a ctrlCctrlV broad conflict.Several other character relationships go the exact same way, with characters at each other’s throats becoming close friends without any sort of proper pacing to get to that point. What could’ve been developed drama of troubled characters finding it within themselves to work together becomes sullied by a forced need to have the “band together against the apocalypse” involving way too many characters who get no time to let conflicts hold. For a show proudly putting its foot down to say “we’re willing to go to DARK depths of what people suffer in life” without time to care about anything, going Team Force Friendship is about the most cliché thing it could possibly do. It’s DiC Sailor Moon putting on the mask of Elfen Lied and Mirai Nikki just to appeal to the edgelord crowd, forgetting that it drove out all likability in only the first episode!Then there’s the power system and eponymous Magical Girl Site system itself, which like many elements of this show, are also f*cked beyond belief. First off, every weapon used by a girl in this show is called…….a Stick. Yup, a Stick, like a tree branch or something. It’s used here to describe anything from heart guns to necklaces to yo-yos to magic controlling panties. Unless you named the weapons Ding Dongs I don’t think there’s any way the author could’ve put less thought in. Serious scenes where characters call their weapons Sticks come off as more silly than fierce. I could just now imagine one girl picking up a tree branch and attempting to wear it underneath her skirt, insisting that it is called underwear, in a world where magic panties are considered Sticks.Finally, the whole Magical Girl Site concept. “Scary” face papercut people in some weird pocket dimension hack computers to give random girls magical girl powers for what seems like no reason, but eventually is revealed to relate to the completely forced apocalypse. The one who gather the most arbitrary negative energy gets to survive while everyone else dies. No specific idea is handled with the Magical Girl recruiting, since they didn’t even nick Madoka’s “wish for a price hope/despair” routine, just the enemy identity idea stolen in every series ever featuring fights against inhuman monsters, with no time to sink in because of awful pacing. Most of the origin stories for the girls don’t get an exclamation at all for the site being there, like the writer was too lazy to care about why they had their generic or fetish powers. The site itself doesn’t connect to the conflicts of any character even semi-well, with this antagonist force not getting any justification for their appearance, random ass powers or Halloween play paper cutout appearance.In that sense, the show’s script is emblematic of everything regarding this series. Illogically lazy. Not bothering to commit to any unique ideas, it instead nicks them from a source most people would recognize, but lacks any sort of tonal cohesion, proper pacing, variety, understanding of human drama, effort or passion. It doesn’t even conclude itself properly, giving fuck all to any sort of viewer payoff as well. It’s pure phoned in tripe, creating a torturous 1st episode only to wring further relationships from the foundation of a used toilet paper tower on a raft in the ocean, during a thunderstorm.Naturally this laziness extends to the animation as well, from the studio’s 2nd ever project. With no effort blasé character designs, bleh grey and black backgrounds (except during the beach episode), and absolutely nothing resembling flow in fight scenes, this is about the lowest effort one can put into a TV anime, sans excessive CGI armies or characters moving like a PowerPoint presentation. Even the few attempts at visual flourish are either “paint everything blue or red”, or sunset scenes. Action, as I mentioned before, has no flow in any capacity, even doing things like using action lines over colored backgrounds that I thought we grew out of in early  Pokemon. Fundamental things are done terribly, like crows not bleeding when they are cut in half, or photoshopped meatballs being over characters’ heads in one occurrence. And there’s also the wonderful images of many Yandere faces, a psychotic grown man putting on little girl panties, and the ED having sperm fly everywhere. A show like Hand Shakers looks godawful in its own way but I could at least tell that the staff at Studio GoHands were TRYING to do something unique and inventive, despite it backfiring in every conceivable way. A show like this does about the minimum effort possible to be considered passable in some capacity, and absolutely suffers for poor art design because of it. So it’s a shame for however many Japanese animators spent long days and nights on it.The sound is also low effort, so low effort that I barely have anything to talk about. Suppose I could mention that the one girl who runs fast does so with an obvious stock sound effect, or the fact that this show’s entire reason for being adapted hinges on promoting the idol group I⭐️ris. You heard that right, even the STUDIO only made this to profit off a contract for a promoting idol group, one whose insert in the series wasn’t even memorable by Idol standards. Because anyone who gave a crap about artistic integrity or creativity stayed as far away from this as possible.Finally, the characters. What “characters”? This show has none! All it has is inhumane gleefully cruel excuses for the author to jot down his fetishes and edge checklists. These characters all have names and unique hair types, but without any distinguishing character features to them, the “character” element fades in the background. Already Episodes 2-12 are forced to work with Episode 1’s broken foundation, and when it does have to try and “develop” anyone from that episode, it has nothing to work with and leads to nothing properly worthwhile. The pacing’s jank so any chemistry between devices feels tenuous at best and completely unbelievable at worst.The lack of effort isn’t just present for what the show lacks but for what is present as well. Of the nine girls (eventually ten) that it puts in the “Hero Group” role, six of them have edgy Yandere moments at different points, which is not only lazy but barely distinguishable or built up. Higurashi didn’t make every single girl a Yandere, and for the ones they did, they built up the element, however well. It even uses the “my parents were killed by a psychotic man” backstory twice, one of which gets revenge so fast that we have no reason to care for the endeavor. And when those in the show are not being psycho Yanderes (including the evil for the sake it older brother), they’re either completely cliche or fulfilling a sick fetish for the author with no substance or identifiable goal. Whether it be the gag boobs girl, the apple butted idol who controls people with magic panties, a girl who cuts herself frequently to heal people through the mouth insisting she’s not emo, a girl whose only trait is “runs fast”, or a girl whose main trait is smacking about an innocent old butler. Every Magical Girl bleeds from a different part of their body as well, so anyone with a bleeding fetish can rejoice in knowing that bleeding from body parts will be a continual process that is never confronted as a problem because the show is that lazy!The ONLY attempt at anything resembling a character arc is protagonist Aya, who learns to get over her shyness, make friends with other characters, rebel against an immediate plan following a character death, and organize a beach visit for everyone! On paper it’s acceptable growth, but in practice, the terrible writing and relationships that aren’t given any time to rest, making many of her choices feel forced. This includes her forgiveness of the bully girl who viscerally tormented her prior and during the series start. It’s a cliché path hampered down by the creator’s laziness as well as awful plot rolling. No one else has anything CLOSE to that attempt, which I should stress was unsuccessful.Enjoyment and ConclusionOne could easily say “why did you even talk about this show if you knew you were going to hate it from Episode 1”? Simply put, anime tends to inspire me in its ambition. Whether a show is a masterpiece or a dumpster fire, I’m usually enthused by its wide variety across genres, different strengths and screw-ups, passion projects and inventive concepts using animation. I admire the storytelling potential present in an anime series, whether it be from the classics period or the modern age.The reason I single out a show like this is because it is the antithesis of everything worthwhile in an anime, or any form of art period. Rather than putting effort to make their series high quality, the author did nothing more than rip off popular trends to steal away a direct audience, not having to keep tone so he can throw his sick fetishes into an angsty Yandere-full horribly contrived setup. It’s a show the studio put out, not to share an inventive idea with the world, but to promote an idol group with the bare minimum in every capacity.This isn’t misguided passion, or even the type of hilarious straight faced terrible idiocy one could find in Ousama Game. This is a product, assembly lined from checklists and trends that shouldn’t persist, forgoing the artistry its inspirations held high, and is impossible to enjoy because it was neither consistently in straightfaced “crawling in my skin” nor smart enough to be a parody of itself. Laziness begets laziness when it comes to this, spitting on the potential of anime storytelling for something less substantial than starring out a smoked window for 4 hours. This fetish fueled, plagiarized, lazily produced tripe isn’t even remarkably bad. It disgusts me in having nothing but contempt for the concept of effort. It’s boringly awful in every way, but complete failure all the same that I could never recommend to anyone. sweet dough. In Western Animation, films like Shrek, as well as cartoons like Ren & Stimpy and South Park made such big impacts that they inspired a jillion ripoffs continuing to this day, all misunderstanding what made their originals work.

The humor mainly exists to fulfill more of the author’s obvious fetishes.And it’s not just the humor that detracts from the show’s tone, it’s the forced togetherness of the End of the World conflict (pretentiously called The Tempest) that brings it down to the dark depths of anime hell. In a show where crazed maniac girls are commonplace holding death grudges against one another, none of the many relationships feel like they build to comraderies. They just happen because the plot type demands it. Most egregiously with one of the bullies from Episode 1 that remained alive. Said character gets an incredibly disproportionate reason for starting her less than human bullying streak, nearly kills the protagonist at a latter point, and then just because the protagonist doesn’t kill her back, they become buddy buddies to stop the end of the world. WHAT?! Sure, there’s a realization there but that’s barely a redemption arc and it is unforgivable to try and move our sympathies to a girl who gleefully tortured the shy and ineffectual protagonist in Episode 1 because of a ctrlCctrlV broad conflict.Several other character relationships go the exact same way, with characters at each other’s throats becoming close friends without any sort of proper pacing to get to that point. What could’ve been developed drama of troubled characters finding it within themselves to work together becomes sullied by a forced need to have the “band together against the apocalypse” involving way too many characters who get no time to let conflicts hold. For a show proudly putting its foot down to say “we’re willing to go to DARK depths of what people suffer in life” without time to care about anything, going Team Force Friendship is about the most cliché thing it could possibly do. It’s DiC Sailor Moon putting on the mask of Elfen Lied and Mirai Nikki just to appeal to the edgelord crowd, forgetting that it drove out all likability in only the first episode!Then there’s the power system and eponymous Magical Girl Site system itself, which like many elements of this show, are also f*cked beyond belief. First off, every weapon used by a girl in this show is called…….a Stick. Yup, a Stick, like a tree branch or something. It’s used here to describe anything from heart guns to necklaces to yo-yos to magic controlling panties. Unless you named the weapons Ding Dongs I don’t think there’s any way the author could’ve put less thought in. Serious scenes where characters call their weapons Sticks come off as more silly than fierce. I could just now imagine one girl picking up a tree branch and attempting to wear it underneath her skirt, insisting that it is called underwear, in a world where magic panties are considered Sticks.Finally, the whole Magical Girl Site concept. “Scary” face papercut people in some weird pocket dimension hack computers to give random girls magical girl powers for what seems like no reason, but eventually is revealed to relate to the completely forced apocalypse. The one who gather the most arbitrary negative energy gets to survive while everyone else dies. No specific idea is handled with the Magical Girl recruiting, since they didn’t even nick Madoka’s “wish for a price hope/despair” routine, just the enemy identity idea stolen in every series ever featuring fights against inhuman monsters, with no time to sink in because of awful pacing. Most of the origin stories for the girls don’t get an exclamation at all for the site being there, like the writer was too lazy to care about why they had their generic or fetish powers. The site itself doesn’t connect to the conflicts of any character even semi-well, with this antagonist force not getting any justification for their appearance, random ass powers or Halloween play paper cutout appearance.In that sense, the show’s script is emblematic of everything regarding this series. Illogically lazy. Not bothering to commit to any unique ideas, it instead nicks them from a source most people would recognize, but lacks any sort of tonal cohesion, proper pacing, variety, understanding of human drama, effort or passion. It doesn’t even conclude itself properly, giving fuck all to any sort of viewer payoff as well. It’s pure phoned in tripe, creating a torturous 1st episode only to wring further relationships from the foundation of a used toilet paper tower on a raft in the ocean, during a thunderstorm.Naturally this laziness extends to the animation as well, from the studio’s 2nd ever project. With no effort blasé character designs, bleh grey and black backgrounds (except during the beach episode), and absolutely nothing resembling flow in fight scenes, this is about the lowest effort one can put into a TV anime, sans excessive CGI armies or characters moving like a PowerPoint presentation. Even the few attempts at visual flourish are either “paint everything blue or red”, or sunset scenes. Action, as I mentioned before, has no flow in any capacity, even doing things like using action lines over colored backgrounds that I thought we grew out of in early  Pokemon. Fundamental things are done terribly, like crows not bleeding when they are cut in half, or photoshopped meatballs being over characters’ heads in one occurrence. And there’s also the wonderful images of many Yandere faces, a psychotic grown man putting on little girl panties, and the ED having sperm fly everywhere. A show like Hand Shakers looks godawful in its own way but I could at least tell that the staff at Studio GoHands were TRYING to do something unique and inventive, despite it backfiring in every conceivable way. A show like this does about the minimum effort possible to be considered passable in some capacity, and absolutely suffers for poor art design because of it. So it’s a shame for however many Japanese animators spent long days and nights on it.The sound is also low effort, so low effort that I barely have anything to talk about. Suppose I could mention that the one girl who runs fast does so with an obvious stock sound effect, or the fact that this show’s entire reason for being adapted hinges on promoting the idol group I⭐️ris. You heard that right, even the STUDIO only made this to profit off a contract for a promoting idol group, one whose insert in the series wasn’t even memorable by Idol standards. Because anyone who gave a crap about artistic integrity or creativity stayed as far away from this as possible.Finally, the characters. What “characters”? This show has none! All it has is inhumane gleefully cruel excuses for the author to jot down his fetishes and edge checklists. These characters all have names and unique hair types, but without any distinguishing character features to them, the “character” element fades in the background. Already Episodes 2-12 are forced to work with Episode 1’s broken foundation, and when it does have to try and “develop” anyone from that episode, it has nothing to work with and leads to nothing properly worthwhile. The pacing’s jank so any chemistry between devices feels tenuous at best and completely unbelievable at worst.The lack of effort isn’t just present for what the show lacks but for what is present as well. Of the nine girls (eventually ten) that it puts in the “Hero Group” role, six of them have edgy Yandere moments at different points, which is not only lazy but barely distinguishable or built up. Higurashi didn’t make every single girl a Yandere, and for the ones they did, they built up the element, however well. It even uses the “my parents were killed by a psychotic man” backstory twice, one of which gets revenge so fast that we have no reason to care for the endeavor. And when those in the show are not being psycho Yanderes (including the evil for the sake it older brother), they’re either completely cliche or fulfilling a sick fetish for the author with no substance or identifiable goal. Whether it be the gag boobs girl, the apple butted idol who controls people with magic panties, a girl who cuts herself frequently to heal people through the mouth insisting she’s not emo, a girl whose only trait is “runs fast”, or a girl whose main trait is smacking about an innocent old butler. Every Magical Girl bleeds from a different part of their body as well, so anyone with a bleeding fetish can rejoice in knowing that bleeding from body parts will be a continual process that is never confronted as a problem because the show is that lazy!The ONLY attempt at anything resembling a character arc is protagonist Aya, who learns to get over her shyness, make friends with other characters, rebel against an immediate plan following a character death, and organize a beach visit for everyone! On paper it’s acceptable growth, but in practice, the terrible writing and relationships that aren’t given any time to rest, making many of her choices feel forced. This includes her forgiveness of the bully girl who viscerally tormented her prior and during the series start. It’s a cliché path hampered down by the creator’s laziness as well as awful plot rolling. No one else has anything CLOSE to that attempt, which I should stress was unsuccessful.Enjoyment and ConclusionOne could easily say “why did you even talk about this show if you knew you were going to hate it from Episode 1”? Simply put, anime tends to inspire me in its ambition. Whether a show is a masterpiece or a dumpster fire, I’m usually enthused by its wide variety across genres, different strengths and screw-ups, passion projects and inventive concepts using animation. I admire the storytelling potential present in an anime series, whether it be from the classics period or the modern age.The reason I single out a show like this is because it is the antithesis of everything worthwhile in an anime, or any form of art period. Rather than putting effort to make their series high quality, the author did nothing more than rip off popular trends to steal away a direct audience, not having to keep tone so he can throw his sick fetishes into an angsty Yandere-full horribly contrived setup. It’s a show the studio put out, not to share an inventive idea with the world, but to promote an idol group with the bare minimum in every capacity.This isn’t misguided passion, or even the type of hilarious straight faced terrible idiocy one could find in Ousama Game. This is a product, assembly lined from checklists and trends that shouldn’t persist, forgoing the artistry its inspirations held high, and is impossible to enjoy because it was neither consistently in straightfaced “crawling in my skin” nor smart enough to be a parody of itself. Laziness begets laziness when it comes to this, spitting on the potential of anime storytelling for something less substantial than starring out a smoked window for 4 hours. This fetish fueled, plagiarized, lazily produced tripe isn’t even remarkably bad. It disgusts me in having nothing but contempt for the concept of effort. It’s boringly awful in every way, but complete failure all the same that I could never recommend to anyone.', 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""People say my life has hit rock bottom, but I do not believe any of that.""-Our main bro while fapping to anime porn in episode 3.This series has some serious issues. By this, I don\'t mean ""flaws"" or ""cons"", I mean real issues. This is the peak of insanity.""Every day, all I think about is dying.""...Our main character, who is the most pathetic looking girl imaginable, seems to be living in a world which is pretty much a fucked up place. All her school budies are literally evil bullies whose favorite past time seems to be kicking her ass and destroying her life while smirking in the evilest way possible. At home, however, her role in the family seems to be the one of a boxing bag. Sometimes they do strangle her too. After witnessing this, I thought ""woah, it\'s only a matter of time until she gets raped and gets her organs sold."" ....And exactly 4 minutes later some dude forces himself in her. Oh, and btw, she has one thing in the world she actually likes. A cat. So naturally, some asshole just had to come and kill it because fuck this girl specifically. Did I mention they told her her cat is dead whilst she was getting raped? Well, now you know. Amazing.At this point, it should be mentioned that this series should not be watched by people who can\'t tolerate with violence and fucked up shit because this is pretty much as far as anime can go with darkness. This series is mature and gore in a way which is mainly only accomplished in manga series.""Every living thing that harms you, should disappear.""Just so happens to be, our heroine gets the access to a mahou shoujo powers via the power of the internet and starts her rampage towards every living thing, except cats. Sweet, sweet revenge will be served. It\'s satisfying as hell, and presented in a manner most similar to Lute Ryner\'s murder phase seen in one of the most epic anime series ever made, DenYuDen. Mahou Shoujo Site completely abandons moral values, social norms and heroism. It only cares about chaos and resolve. When it comes to series similar to it, it achieves exactly as much as shows such as Madoka Magica, Elfen Lied and Higurashi no Naru Koro ni, but being much more direct with its twisted world and characters, giving exactly as little value to human lives as the Gods seen in Gantz. At this point, I am impressed. Some people will of course meme that the show is edgy, mc the epitome of victimhood and some characters one-dimensional baddies. I get it. One can kill all the good things this show has to offer by clinging onto these thoughts. My advice, if you can, don\'t let general consensus ruin the fun.The series also comes with the best live action ED seen since the 2nd season of Arakawa Under the Bridge. I just love seeing them girls dancing all around the place while animated sperm flies everywhere. When I saw that I thought this series is definitely 10-worthy and not a 9/10. A goddamn masterpiece. I highly recommend Mahou Shoujo Site for anyone who has the tendency of liking chaos and the fucked up stuff.

A lot of the time these shows would often have a lot serious topics, and themes that ultimately goes nowhere thanks to they awful tone shifts and because of this a lot of theses edgy shows ending up very pretentious as a result. The real problem with theses edgy shows that like with ecchi...and harems they have the high chance of seeing well which sadly attracts the lowest common denominator where the audience in that group would only a show because it’s dark themes and violence.Akame ga Kill is one of the worst examples of this because not only the show itself didn’t function correctly as thanks it’s non-existence worldbuilding, plot holes, cringe-worthy storytelling, embarrassing production values, horrid characters designs that don’t fit with the setting of the show and pathetic characters but the show had no had no idea of what a mature show should be. There are other edgy anime like Future Dairy, Elfen Lied, and that I want to talk about but I will save theses edge feasts for another time. Personally I really despite anime that are edge because not only do these shows would forget to tell a story but they also would go out of the way to shock the audience with the edge and tonal shifts.So what does this have to with Spring 18 Magical Girl Site you may ask? Well, I will tell you to know. Magical Girl Site is one of the most cringiest edgy anime I have ever seen because not only it’s generally a horrible but it cannot even use it’s edgy/dark content correctly. While Magical Girl Site isn’t the worst anime, I have seen it still an anime that I hate.Story.The story follows a middle school girl named Aya Asagirl who has problems with both her school and home life thanks to the aggravated bullying and physical abuse. While browsing online a website pops up on her computer featuring a creepy-looking person. The person appears to take pity on her and announces that she has granted Asagiri magical powers. She clicks yes and on the following day a pink toy looking gun shows up in her school locker and there Aya must learn to deal with her new magical power as well finding the meaning of the countdown clock on the website.Am just going to say it right now the story for Magical Girl Site is abysmal.Ride of the bat this anime makes an awful first impression where the audience are awkwardly thrown into heavy and sensitive themes such as child abuse, rape, depression and torture without any reason apart from poorly establish the protagonist for the story.Besides of all the dark edgy shit that goes on in the story this is just your typical magical girl where characters in the show will have mini characters arcs as well being a boring survival type of show where only one magical girl can survive. This is the least of my issues with the show. The real issue of this show that ended up killing the anime was its portrayal of heavy and sensitive themes. This is by far the most disusing anime I have seen because it too all of the sensitive and heavy themes such as rape, child abuse, depression, torture, and bullying and doesn’t treat them with respect as the show constantly went over the top and edgy about them. I liked shows where they address and tackle sensitive and heavy themes but this show clearly did not have a clue to present its sensitive themes and because of this me and majority of anime fans literally got sick while watching. After watching the first three episodes I was physically being ill thanks to this show physically abusing the poor little girl. What makes this worse is how Aya the protagonist doesn't do a damm thing about it because honestly, this show could have gone for a different direction if the writers simply allow Aya to move into the foster care home away from her school and school after episode 1 as soon she gets the pink toy gun and the plot could have moved along a bit differently but no we can’t have nice thing thanks to this show stupidity.The pacing of the show is pretty inconstant overall as either go way too fast or way too slow. While it’s not as bad as Record of the Garncrest War it’s still a big issue that kills the flow of the series as well as all the events that happen in the show.What really pissed me off about the show that the show had the balls to have a poorly directed beach episode aka episode 8. Not only that episode killed the tone of the series up to that point where it’s very dark, but the show at no point had a piece of dialogue that stated the girls are going to the beach to have some cool time. I understand the show was trying to throw the audience of its sudden tone shift, but this was the worst way to do as it feels so lazy and forced.Speaking of Episode 8 this was the same episode that features the worst man to man confrontation I have ever seen in anime as not only it was all over the top but the direction/writing was horrible.Episode 9 is even worse as the show decides to takes all of its physics and logic and ultimately throws out the window in favor of shock value.(Spoilers ahead)The way that Nijimi died in the show was horrible because not only it featured horrible directing but the way Nijimi was able to live for that along to even able to stab Kaname in the throat with an edge of a glass bottle after being cut by Ringa sword which Kaname our comically evil villain was using. It's was bad enough that she didn't get decapitated immediately from the way that was cut by Ringa sword but the way the show didn't even bother showing us the amount of blood that Nijimi while she was on the floor. What makes this episode baffling compared to any other episodes in the series is her death could have been easily avoided if Nijimi actually controlled her temper like in the earlier episodes in the series where despite having temper issues she still smart enough to not allow her temper to take over. Ridiculous...(End of spoilers)Overall the story for Magical Girl Site was beyond awful and sickening.1/10Characters.The characters in Magical Girl Site are all one-dimensional edgelords as they are all tropey as hell as well being very unlikeable fools.The main protagonist Aya is your shitty damsel in distress type character who everyone treats like trash for no reason other than to give her a sad backstory.Tsuyuno is the boring ass monitor with dark pastNijimi is a cute but tempered idol who would stop at nothing to kill the person who killed her best friend.Sarina is the loud mouth bitch who refuses to listen to people even if it important.Rina is a very intelligent girl who is very clumsy.Kosame is the stoic edgelord who has the edgiest power ever where she gets to heal someone by cutting her own skin.The other characters aren't much better at in fact some of them are even worst.Kaname is probably one of the most contrived villains I have ever seen in my life. Not only he such a disgraceful human being where he actively liked beats her own sister up Aya for stress relief but the way he literally became one of the main villains in the second half of the show was retarded!!!Overall like with the story itself the characters are utter shit.1/10Visuals.The visuals are okay, but it doesn’t matter when you have absolutely no substance to back up your visuals.The character designs for the main characters are pretty good overall and recognizable however the character designs for the side characters just were just awful and unappealing to look atThe animation is okay for the most part, but there were times where the show had fair of still frames and choppy movement for some fights.5/10Sound.Thankfully the soundtrack for Magical Girl Site is the best part about this the series as it does a good job at capturing the dark nature of the series.The opening and endings theme on the other are just forgetful and the voice acting overall is alright for what it was.Overall the soundtrack is decent overall.6/10Final Thoughts.So that's is Magical Girl Site. A broken edgy mess of a show that doesn't even respect its audience.The story is horrendously written that is filled with horrible pacing and directing. The characters are all unsympathetic idiots who are edgy for the sake of being edgy. The only decent things about this show are the visuals and music other than that this show is a broken mess that barely functions.Easily the worst anime from spring 18 season by far and I strongly recommend you to avoid this edge feast as possible.Final Score 1.5/10 and harems they have the high chance of seeing well which sadly attracts the lowest common denominator where the audience in that group would only a show because it’s dark themes and violence.Akame ga Kill is one of the worst examples of this because not only the show itself didn’t function correctly as thanks it’s non-existence worldbuilding, plot holes, cringe-worthy storytelling, embarrassing production values, horrid characters designs that don’t fit with the setting of the show and pathetic characters but the show had no had no idea of what a mature show should be.

It is genuinely so bad at being a serious show that it becomes enjoyable in its own ridiculousness. The studio is genuinely trying to make a good thriller, and that\'s why this is so entertaining. Think you know edgy? Think you know insane? Think again. Then think again again because every episode gets *edgier and more ridiculous* than the last.The ED is SPERM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WHILST LIVE ACTION IDOLS DANCE. How do you top that? Well, the show manages to, with another live action ED involving idols dressed up as dogs. Here\'s hoping for episode...5 the bitcoin idols turn up. The plot follows suit in one-upping itself in preposterousness but I want to refrain from spoilers because this is an experience you can only have once. However, let\'s be clear, the number of times I went ""WHAT??"" at the show is more than I can count on my fingers and toes. We\'re only at episode 4.I like how funny this show is. Fantastic comedy. If you can tolerate blood etc. then I highly recommend this show as a great example of absurdism, and what *not* to do if you ever happen to write a serious story. Grab a beer, watch this with friends, enjoy it for what it is. 5 the bitcoin idols turn up.

It\'s an ""edgy"" anime with a low score. But this anime\'s been called edgy countless times and it\'s used as a reason to show why it\'s bad. I don\'t really agree with this.Ok, so, the story of Mahou Shoujo Site revolves around Aya and her miserable life and a website that can turn people into magical girls. It had the potential for some good psychological depth...but that potential was kinda wasted. I feel bad for a lot characters, especially Aya, but I wish more depth could\'ve...gone into them. And in the last episode, there\'s a scene that\'s confusing. Aya was unable to perform a certain action before but then she suddenly can. Yes, I get that it sucks when an anime\'s potential is wasted. Yes, it sucks that some things are inconsistent. But a show can still be enjoyable despite that. Mahou Shoujo Site is interesting and keeps us watching to see how it\'ll end. Not everything was wrapped up...and it could\'ve ended better...but it was still enjoyable to watch because of the tension-heavy scenes, fights, and the want to know more about the Tempest and everything else.As for the characters...I believe Tsuyuno was a relatively good one. I found myself liking her and she at least changed. She went from living for the sake of revenge to living for someone else. Aya and Tsuyuno basically lived for each other and I like how the anime showed this. Our main character went from a shy doormat to a person who speaks more freely and is determined to keep her friends safe. Rina and Sarina both changed as well as so there\'s that. I honestly thought Sarina would remain a bully with a dumb sense of logic but she didn\'t. I\'m glad. Rina went from freaking psycho to just a little crazy (yet caring) in a way. Nijimin was likable to some extent but I think her backstory could\'ve been timed better. The others weren\'t there for long so they didn\'t get much development which sucks because I actually liked Sayuki and Kiyoharu a bit.The art was nice, especially the parts when the magical girls used their powers. The animation itself wasn\'t too bad either. It was good enough to not distract me from watching it and instantly make me think ""Oh wait, it just looked really weird right there"".The sound was good too. Not a single moment felt weird because of any out of place music. Each one is timed well. It definitely added to the sadder parts of the show. The opening was good and really fits the magical girl genre in my opinion. The ending song didn\'t sound bad but I have to admit that the visuals were weird (and not because it was a live action).Story: 8Art: 9Sound: 10Character: 8Enjoyment: 10Overall, Mahou Shoujo Site did some things wrong...but it also did some things good. Because of this, the show was enjoyable despite the flaws it had. Overall, I give it a 9. gone into them. And in the last episode, there\'s a scene that\'s confusing. Aya was unable to perform a certain action before but then she suddenly can. Yes, I get that it sucks when an anime\'s potential is wasted. Yes, it sucks that some things are inconsistent.

The anime is about a girl being abused everywhere she goes, from school to home.This anime is not for the light-hearted of viewers... this is gory and kind of ironic because of the Magical Girls theme. I mean it is anime... anime logic...The anime is fucked up and meets its dark theme. It might take some of the serious themes lightly, well its fucking anime so get over it.If you like this anime, then you should...also watch Madoka Magica, and other animes I forgot the names of.From what I've seen so far, this anime is amazing.Stay open-minded, stay cool! also watch Madoka Magica, and other animes I forgot the names of.From what I've seen so far, this anime is amazing.Stay open-minded, stay cool!"", ""Just about anyone could have made Mahou Shoujo Site. I say this with an open mind because it really comes down to a bunch of grimy ideas mixed together at once. Before I get to the who, what, how, where, and why, you really need to be aware of what’s ahead.  As someone who have read the manga, I say with regret that Mahou Shoujo Site (Magical Girl Site) ended up being one of the worst shows of Spring 2018. It’s actually a bit demoralizing considering that there aren't many big magical girl hitters this year and it already set the bar very low.Forget...the happy moments you’ll find in some magical girl series, there’s little to none in Mahou Shoujo Site. What you will find is a misfortunate girl named Aya Asagiri who has been bullied throughout her life. The thought of suicide often come across her mind and it doesn’t help that she has a dysfunctional family. Her life does change in the most peculiar way possible after acquiring a magical power from a mysterious website. Thus, Aya’s life as a magical girl begins.Alright, I’ll be honest here. Watching Mahou Shoujo Site at first felt like a guilty pleasure. I’m a sucker for dark, grimy series that tries to deconstruct the magical girl theme. At first glance, the show seems to explore the worst traits of humanity. The pilot episode features merciless bullying, family abuse, and even an animal killed off-screen. If we take a closer glance at Aya’s life, you can see that positivity is nonexistent. The first episode also establishes that Aya feels helpless because of her fragile personality and living conditions. It’s almost if the world is fighting against her and there’s always that thought of ending suffering by suicide. Indeed, this series deals with some sensitive issues that can be relatable in the real world so be aware of that. There’s no easier way to say it but bullies can cause emotional distress so distasteful that certain individuals just wants to end it all. However in Aya’s case, it’s just the beginning. After becoming a magical girl, she uses her powers to take revenge against Sarina Shizukume, the leader of a trio of bullies that has been tormenting her life. So what does this really mean for the show’s purpose? It basically means that humans have way too many flaws. Revenge is a common theme in dark magical girl shows so this isn’t something new. However, Mahou Shoujo Site’s execution of this formula fell flat because it feels unbelievable. A kind girl like Aya actually comitting a sin? That’s about as edgy as it can get. In fact, Mahou Shoujo Site loves to capitalize on every moment in attempt to make them unique. What ends up happening is the same formulatic execution over and over. Characters committing sin and trying to get even with someone is almost a norm in this anime. If that’s not your cup of tea, then this will be a very grueling experience.If you haven’t figured out the show is depressing to watch by this point, then maybe this could end up being a different experience for you. For me, this didn’t change especially after meeting the other characters. It seems that every magical girl in the show suffers from some sort of tragic past. The real question though is if we should feel sorry for them? Honestly, there’s two side of the coin to this. On one side, it’s easy to pity them because the magical girls chosen by the Magical Girl Site suffered so much in their lives. However, most of these magical girls show their personal flaws as they would do anything to escape their personal hell. This includes using their powers to torture, manipulate, or even kill. Characters such as Tsuyuno, Rina, and Nijimi have proven that they would do anything to achieve their goals. In essence, hardly any character in the series ends up being likable because of their flaws. The worst of all is Aya’s demented brother, Kaname. He abuses his own sister in any way possible for the pure joy of being in control. Throughout the series, Kaname shows a disturbing God-like complex that seems to be his own personal way of relieving stress in the family. It brings out the worst of this series whenever he appears on screen. Hiding behind his fake mask is a demon that is anything but acceptable in society. At some point of the show, I stopped taking him seriously because how fake the character is presented. He became more of a meme that exposes the worst of humanity. In fact, this anime presents men in disgraceful ways. Kaname’s father and the bully that nearly rapes Aya in the beginning of the series are two other examples. I’m not sure if that was the show’s intention in the first place but still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.With 12 episodes, are there any reasons to watch this anime? Well to be fair, the anime is actually faithful to the series’ central themes despite omitting certain plot points and characters. Also, the administrators of the Magical Girl Site may pique the curiosity of the viewers. It may cause viewers to wander what their true intentions and how it ties to the overall story. Aya also does mature more as a character as she becomes more confident through her friendship with others, in particular Yatsumura. There’s even some minor shoujo-ai elements although don’t expect anything too serious. Sadly, none of these really saves this abomination.I’ll give some credit to Production doA for making the bold attempt to animate this series. It isn’t easy with how grim and dark is. The magical girls are designed with noticeable characteristics especially with their exotic-looking eyes and feminine features. Furthermore, every magical stick the characters uses are distinctive despite how ridiculous some of them are. However as a series with magical elements, it fell short in making a favorable impression of battle choreography. The camera angles is all over the place on some fighting scenes. The only noticeable part is how characters react which is extremely predictable. To no one’s surprise, the anime also contains fan service such as with a beach episode. However, most of it is overshadowed by the cruelty of character behaviors. I honestly felt uncomfortable watching some of the early episodes. You’ll probably get used to it once you make it through half the series. The character voices tries to carry some episodes but usually feels forced and unrealistic. Kaname is a good example that becomes a recurring joke of a bad villain. The only character that seems believable is Aya because of her fragile voice. The theme songs contains fast tempo with dark eerie lyrics and dark metal tunes. It works for the series but doesn’t really make a favorable impression in the end. That ED theme song with the live action dancing is a thing of beauty though.I tried. I really tried to enjoy Mahou Shoujo Site but it just ended up being a trashy horror bomb. It tried way too hard to make itself looking cool by using ideas of graphic abuse and sexual assault. What ends up happening is a series with one dimensional characters and unnerving story. There are good magical girl shows out there but Mahou Shoujo Site is nowhere near that category.

Stay away from this series and burn it with fire."", ""Mahou Shoujo Site is absurd but its also an argument against absurdity. If that sounds like I made a contradiction that's because it was intentional. The absurdity within the show is also intentional. The show uses contradictions as a tool to highlight absurdity. It uses contradictory imagery and the main character also acts in seemingly contradictory ways. Although the show contains absurdity it also rallies against absurdity by having its characters fight for meaning in a meaningless and cruel world. Despite being absurd, Mahou Shoujo Site has strong morals and a positive message.Mahou Shoujo Site uses contradictory imagery masterfully to juxtapose negative and edgy concepts...with positive and hopeful ideals. Take the main character for example, she is shown in the opening theme song aiming a gun at her head and then disappearing into thin air after pulling the trigger. This imagery suggests suicide, however upon further inspection we find that the gun is shaped like a heart and instead of causing death it causes the person getting shot at to teleport to a different location. The main character is capable of using this as a weapon but she instead chooses to use it as a tool to assist her comrades. Another character cuts her own wrists with a box cutter knife, however she uses the blood from her cuts to heal her friends. This turns the symbolism of wrist cutting from selfish and masturbatory to selfless and sacrificial. Using imagery that turn suicide and self-harm into positive things is a tremendously absurd contradiction. Showing traditionally bad things in a positive way like this highlights the goodness of the characters despite their cruel and unusual circumstances.The imagery is great but the characters also act in seemingly contradictory ways. All of the magical girl characters are shown or implied to have been gifted their powers due to intense suffering they have faced. The logical course of action for most of these girls then, is to carry out acts of revenge. This is most clearly seen in the main character's best friend, Tsuyuno. Tsuyuno doesn't understand why our main character, Aya, refuses to carry out similar acts of revenge. Aya's refusal is the core contradiction of her character and is what leads to her success as a magical girl. Aya not only refuses to carry out revenge but she actually forgives and co-operates with her former bullies. Willingness to co-operate, even with those who wronged you or who have the ability to betray you, takes a lot of trust. Aya's trust may seem naive however it is continuously positively reinforced by the events that happen in the show thus cementing Aya's trusting and co-operative actions as a positive message.Aya's actions also teach a positive message relating to free will. The villains want Aya to accept her fate as an unfortunate soul and use that negative viewpoint to spread more negativity. The bullying that lead to Aya being gifted her powers was senseless and cruel. She would be completely justified in reciprocating these actions. However, Aya believes that doing so will be an acceptance of her unfortunate fate. Aya rejects this fate and uses her own free will to shape her destiny. She does this by setting her own moral rules such as not killing or taking revenge.While Aya is rejecting her unfortunate fate, Tsuyuno is so dedicated to revenge that she struggles to find any meaning in life beyond her own personal acts of vengeance. Tsuyuno is still shown to be a good person despite her negative outlook. Tsuyuno acts cold, calculating and pragmatic which is a foil to Aya's more naive and idealistic outlook. However, Tsuyuno has a strong moral framework and her hatred of bullying is what lead her to save Aya in the first place. Tsuyuno's conflict is compelling because she is a good person who is simply morally confused about how to find meaning in her life beyond her senseless and cruel suffering.If the other characters are struggling with how to cope with their senseless and cruel suffering, then Aya's brother, Kaname, is the personification of that senselessness and cruelty. Kaname faces pressure from his father and from society to succeed academically. Instead of taking on the burden of this pressure himself, he vents his frustrations by abusing Aya. After Aya gains her magical abilities, Kaname loses the outlet for his angst. Kaname uses manipulation to gain power and control that he lacks in his own life by tricking one of the magical girls into giving him her power to command people. He uses his new power in insanely cruel ways. It's honestly quite difficult to understand Kaname's motivation as a character because he is just so absurd. Kaname's presence is a reminder that no matter what outlook you have on life that senselessness and cruelty will always still exist and that they need to be stamped out wherever they may be.Using absurd imagery and storytelling to teach an overall positive message is a good thing. However at times the absurdity of this show can go too far. Some of the character's backstories are just so unbelievably absurd that they can border on becoming comedic. I could argue that being so absurd is actually an accomplishment but having a character's suffering be so ridiculous that it causes me to roll my eyes or laugh just does not give me a positive reinforcement as a viewer. The show also has some fetishistic imagery which limits its accessibility to more casual fans (assuming the edgy imagery didn't already do that). Some of the magical girls have man-slaves and Kaname is shown wearing women's underwear in one particularly absurd scene.Overall, Mahou Shoujo Site has a very clear and simple message: be a good person and fight against evil. It also teaches to not let your suffering control your life and to use your free will to do good. These aren't unusual messages for a magical girl anime to have but the absurd way of delivering these messages is what sets Mahou Shoujo Site apart. Although Mahou Shoujo Site pushed the envelope as far as possible for the cruelty in the character's suffering and absurdity of some of the story events, they never diverted from the strong positive message at the foundation of the show. I really appreciate the decision to stick to a positive message because with such an absurd premise and events they could have easily went for a more nihilistic route in which case the show would just be edgy for the sake of edge.In conclusion, contradictory imagery and seemingly contradictory character actions show that people can be good even in an absurd world, Tsuyuno's struggle to find meaning in life beyond avenging her own suffering is a great moral conflict, and Kaname's unbelievable cruelty is a reminder that evil will always persist and is worth fighting against. All of these aspects highlight a strong moral message however the show is also quite absurd. Lots of edgy and fetishistic imagery is used throughout the series and can be very off-putting for a lot of people. If you are put off by such images you should not watch this series. For everyone else, Mahou Shoujo Site presents an interesting and fun absurd story that has a strong, magical girl-based moral backing. with positive and hopeful ideals.

I distinctly remember one of those days where I was forced to trap myself in the bathroom for hours on end obeying the tyrannical dictate of my unruly stomach. I suffered an attack of explosive diarrhea. Multiple attacks, actually. It was more of a skirmish to be fair. When I thought that I had finally overcome myself and reigned sovereign over my body once again, the unfortunate reality...was that the worst had yet to come. I felt a sickening fullness coursing my torso. I hurried to the sink. Before, clean and spotless; now covered in the half-digested contents of a hearty, delicious breakfast. Vomiting relentlessly, I began to instinctively apply internal pressure to my system to force the rest to come out. And, well....let\'s say it did certainly come out, from the other end.As harrowing as this tale is, none of what I described is sufficient material to complete this comparison. Mahou Shoujo Site is one of the most vile, repulsive, putrid, horrendous, disgusting, stomach-queasingly, jaw-droppingly awful pieces of garbage I\'ve ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes upon.To start, none of these characters are remotely likable. The writing is insufferable. The plot is deranged. The only reason you would want to watch this show is to see people suffer, and hey if that\'s exactly what you\'re looking for in your media then more power to you, but there\'s nothing of substance to even evaluate from this show beyond that. Nevertheless, since I went through the self-inflicted tragedy of watching this show beyond the first episode, I will continue trying to understand and put to words the atrocities that I\'ve witnessed.Our hero is a complete outcast, at school and at home. Well, ""home"" doesn\'t really work as a concept here. There is no place for her to call home. Everywhere she goes she is subject to constant dehumanization. She is made to feel inferior by all. Bullied at school, abused at the house she lives in. So, to further elaborate on what I said earlier and maybe rectify it a little, Aya is not just a complete outcast to her peers and family but is someone who\'s treated as if they aren\'t even human. Actually, not even animals are treated this cruelly. She\'s no different from a toy, less than a living being. Now, there\'s nothing inherently wrong with this setup. I mean, a lot of people genuinely do live through these types of experiences. I was curious to find out how the show would take this and transform it into something bigger. Perhaps it\'d be as a platform to express an empowering message of hope against all odds. Or, I could see it becoming a more of a revenge plot focused on bringing justice to those whose purpose serves only to spread suffering, but I\'d be disappointed if this were the case as revenge plots tend to be repetitive, disjointed, uninteresting, and generally just suffer from a severe dearth in quality writing. How about instead of following those traditional paths, we pave something genre-defining that moves the hearts of many in a way never-before-seen, something that defies expectations, crafts characters with real human motives and personalities, and/or ignites a fervor of discussion merely around the splendid presentation of its themes?Well, as you\'ve already surmised, had this show done any of that I would likely consider it worthy of recommending to a few. However, this show has no powerful message or meaning that extends beyond itself. This show has no ""satisfying"" revenge plot. There are no endearing personalities. And, really, what themes did this show try to present beyond ""look at these characters suffering! depression, anxiety, torture, you relate to that, right?"".  WHY DOES THIS SHOW HAVE A BEACH EPISODE?? What is it even trying to say at this point? I left to go on a desperate search for a reason to all the chaos and died from dehydration while looking for the slightest clue.Anyways, I\'ve said a lot and I\'ve said nothing at the same time. I hope you enjoyed reading this! More than I enjoyed watching this show at least... was that the worst had yet to come. I felt a sickening fullness coursing my torso. I hurried to the sink.

I hope you enjoyed reading this! More than I enjoyed watching this show at least...', '(No specific spoilers are mentioned in this review, however the overall direction of the anime will be mentioned through vague descriptions and thematic comparisons to Madoka Magica which I presume everyone here has at least watched since this is yet another grim-dark magical girl anime.)You may have stumbled upon this review wanting to check if anyone would have given the likes of Mahou Shoujo Site a perfect score of 10 and whether a review like this was written on the premise of satire. This will be my first review, so satire is completely unintended.The grim-dark magical girl genre is nothing new, but for as copy-paste...as most people normally give it Mahou Shoujo Site is the much needed exception that would be highly praised if it were any other anime.I can sum up this genre easily, the main character is a cute morally-good girl who becomes a magical girl, becoming a magical girl comes at a sinister price, beloved characters die pitiful deaths, the once happy-go-lucky world turns into death and despair, cue nitty-gritty to the teeth style climax that resolves in borderline happy/unhappy resolution. This is the culture-shock style formula that propelled the likes of Madoka Magica to be a major hit along with the typical wave of criticism of proposed copy-cat titles that try to ride the same ""hype train."" This isn\'t the case here, because Mahou Shoujo Site itself makes its own spin-off of the spin-off genre by playing around the formula and putting its own stake in the medium.Before watching Mahou Shoujo Site my prior experience with Dark Magical Girl anime consisted of Madoka Magica, Magical Girl Raising Project, and Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero, and while I can admit each one has it\'s strengths the genre itself isn\'t something I could ever call myself a fan of, rather I\'d prefer my magical girls to be on the bright and happy side of the spectrum. If you\'re like me you may find this anime much more pleasant than the first few episodes may have you believe from the start. For myself I started Mahou Shoujo Site thinking I was about to be put on another distressful roller-coaster ride only for it to end with me feeling like I had fallen in love, because despite how edgy, obnoxious, and cliché this anime wants to appear on the outside the inside carried a lot of the same passion and love I\'d find elsewhere.I can understand why most other people would review this anime negatively, but I can\'t really agree with them either. To me saying the edginess of this anime is what ruins it would be the equivalent of saying the fact Madoka Magica has cute magical girls in it is what ruins it. Yes, both factors are equally prevalent in both anime, but those aspects aren\'t the key features of either anime, rather their only purpose is to specifically lure the audience into a false sense of the true nature of that anime\'s setting, plot, and characters. It\'s just in Mahou Shoujo Site\'s case instead of using cute magical girl designs along with a cute anime style as way to deceive the audience in believing the anime is cute and happy before turning dark and morbid it does the opposite by first painting a world that\'s so morally dark and volatile that the viewer can\'t help but doubt any kind of positive outcome to come out of any conflict or personal motive of the anime\'s characters. That\'s not to say Mahou Shoujo Site is a bunch of fluffy bunnies and rainbows under the surface, but it puts a lot more care and faith into it\'s characters and conflicts much more than you\'d find in any other dark magical girl anime that carelessly kills off and tosses away its characters as if they were last week\'s garbage for shock value. That\'s the point most viewers have failed to noticed here, that the edginess is a deliberate factor meant to hijack their expectations from the reality of the anime\'s actual content.Despite comparing Mahou Shoujo Site to Madoka Magica I wouldn\'t say it should rival it in greatness as it\'s own classic, rather I used it as a reference like all other reviews that try to compare it to any other dark magical girl anime. That said my review score reflects my personal enjoyment of this anime and I\'d recommend it to anyone who is able to stomach gore and blood and can keep an open enough mind to look past the edgy exterior as a design choice rather than a reflection of it\'s core. If you\'re looking for something similar to a small bright candle that refuses to be snuffed out in a big dark and damp cave, something that can be happy or positive despite the odds and circumstances trying to suffocate it, something that\'s 𝐧𝐨𝐭 meant to be taken as a serious train-wreck that tears at your heart-strings screaming tragedy over your dead waifu then this might be the anime for you if and only if you can keep an open enough mind for the first few episodes that paint a picture of anything but.Lastly Aya Asagari and Tsuyuno Yatsumura will forever be one of my favorite character pairings of all time. as most people normally give it Mahou Shoujo Site is the much needed exception that would be highly praised if it were any other anime.I can sum up this genre easily, the main character is a cute morally-good girl who becomes a magical girl, becoming a magical girl comes at a sinister price, beloved characters die pitiful deaths, the once happy-go-lucky world turns into death and despair, cue nitty-gritty to the teeth style climax that resolves in borderline happy/unhappy resolution.

It was truly a treat for me and I'd imagine it'd be a treat for anyone like me too.Those that say MSS is edgy for the sake of being edgy have got this anime all wrong. Sometimes truly horrible things happen to at the hands of people who aren't so great and that's just reality for some us.And if you're one of those people I 100% recommend this anime to you. "", 'Magical Girl Site is what you get when you take Madoka Magica and mix it with Higurashi, but then remove all of the interesting story elements. It is a grim-dark, edge-lord misery porn revenge fantasy with no real substance to back it up. Oh, also while we’re making this comparison, get rid of any interesting character development from Madoka and any well executed moments of levity from Higurashi. Because you know, it doesn’t really matter if you actually care about any of the characters that are having horrible stuff happen to them and you totally don’t need any nice moments to break up the misery,...right?So this series is bad. Really bad. While I’m not going to go into any particular details, people should know what they might be getting into. This series tries so hard to be as dark and messed up as possible that it contains severe and extremely violent bullying at school, heavy physical abuse at home, the murder of a pet, and an attempted rape that comes very close to actually happening. And this is all in the first episode, all to the same girl. Sorry to be a bad, lazy reviewer and continuing to compare this to other anime, but it’s basically like taking all of the bad things that happened to three of the main girls in Elfen Lied (Lucy, Nana, and Mayu). Make all of that stuff happen to one person and instead of spreading it out over multiple episodes, cram it all into one episode; the FIRST episode!You may be thinking, “Well, that almost sounds so horrible that it could be amusing!” You know, the whole “so bad it’s good” thing. That was honestly what I was hoping for after the first episode. However, then the second episode came and it was just kind of.... boring. The ridiculous levels of stupid overly-edgy crap dropped off quick. Episode 2 brings in hints of the actual overarching “plot” of the series and it’s very underwhelming. Those behind the mysterious website that gives the girls their magical powers are coming and you better be ready! The “plot” gets more convoluted as the series goes on to an almost laughable degree. And while all of this “stuff” happens, we just continue to have no reason to care at all about the characters.If you’re not already convinced that you shouldn’t waste your time on this series, here are my category breakouts:-----Story - 1 out of 10-----Again, one of the worst things about this series is its total lack of any interesting story. The plot that develops is so meandering and nonsensical that it’s nearly impossible to ever legitimately enjoy any of it. The twists are uninspired and (again) make no real sense whatsoever with no foreshadowing to support the reveals. The pacing is all over the place with spans of episodes having no real development and then just full-on info dumps in other episodes. It’s all around bad.-----Art - 3 out of 10-----While not completely abysmal, the art isn’t good either. This anime could have been shown to people 10 years ago and they still wouldn’t have been impressed. I guess you could laugh at the stupid facial expressions and the total edge-lord imagery; like, “OMG! The main magical girl bleeds from her eyes when she uses her powers!” But in the end, it’s just flat and uninspiring. Some could say that the stupid facial expressions and the general art/animation quality in the first season Higuarshi was worse than this. However, Higurashi is over 10 years old at this point. The art and animation also had very good direction despite its shortcomings and had life to it. Higurashi also wasn’t just empty shock visuals in most cases because the characters actually had the ability to get people invested.-----Sound - 3 out of 10-----I suppose this is as good a place as any to mention the opening and ending sequences this anime. God, they are some of the worst credit sequences I’ve ever seen in all of anime. The opening is mostly just an over-filtered mess of crap. The ending, however, really takes the cake. It has a bizarre sperm-going-to-egg thing which I guess is meant to be artsy (and the motif does show up in the series proper), but it totally doesn’t work. Then it has the absolute worst integration of live-action sequences in anime ever, period. So bad. And then there is a special one-time ending sequence based on the idol magical girl character which is one of the cringiest things I’ve ever seen, as a live action version of the character performed a bad idol song. The opening and endings aside, the sound is mostly just passable, like the art. While the score isn’t good, it’s also not distractingly bad. The voice acting is also mostly passable although it is legitimately bad at times.-----Characters - 2 out of 10-----Now, I could really overlook a bad story and poor production. But characters, I just cannot get into a show without connecting with or being interested in its characters. Magical Girl Site has complete crap for characters. They’re flat, seem to have no real point in life, and have no way of pulling sympathy from the audience. They’re just there as a vehicle for having bad stuff happen to them. As mentioned before, they do nothing to try to actually develop these characters so that you actually care about them or what happens. Maybe they’re banking on people automatically feeling bad for the characters because what happens to them legitimately sucks? It all just comes off as extremely lazy.-----Enjoyment - 2 out of 10-----I was really hoping for something that would at least be crazy, stupid fun. But in the end, this just ended up being stupid. The first episode had some stuff that made me laugh more than I ever should at this kind of content. Then from there it gets so bogged down by its bad story and worse characters that I couldn’t even enjoy it ironically. I just ended up being bored and rolling my eyes or raising an eyebrow at every twist. From about the midpoint onward, I did get a few more big inappropriate laughs: a very dumb, edgy phrase said when a magical girl with a box cutter magic item explained its power; a situation with a guy wearing panties; and one of the final scenes in the series involving two guys…. Really though, if it wasn’t for my morbid curiosity and the fact that I was watching this week-to-week as part of the 2018 Anime Watching Challenge, I would have dropped this by the third episode.-----Overall - 2 out of 10 (Conclusion)-----I would say that this is the worst “proper” anime that I’ve ever finished (the only “anime” I’ve ever given a 1-score to is Forest Fairy Five, but I refuse to call that a “proper” anime). I’ve probably watched plenty of stuff that many would consider to be objectively worse than this, but most of those things are so short that the quick burst of weird badness is far more interesting to me and easier to swallow than this load of crap. This is just a contrived mess with no real point to it. All that saved this show from getting a 1 from me were those moments of unintentional comedy and WTF moments that were so out of left field that I couldn’t do anything but find them to be interesting. But this is just my opinion.Do I think some people can enjoy this? Maybe. What kind of people would enjoy Magical Girl Site? Honestly, that’s a hard question for me to answer without potentially offending fans of this series. This could be a good thing to watch if you really want to explore how to not develop a story, its world, or the characters within it. Or if you are just so absolutely sick of cute school girls that you want to “destroy something beautiful” then maybe this can be a breath of fresh air. And some people may actually connect with these characters somehow and just automatically feel bad for them because the viewer went through similar situations. But for anyone else? You really don’t need to waste your time. If you want to see some stupid over the top edge-lord crap just to laugh at, watch the first episode then drop this crap. For anyone else or if you have completionist syndrome and wouldn’t be able to drop it, do yourself a favor and just don’t. Stay far, far away. right?So this series is bad. Really bad.

But there is something with Magical Girls and a dark and morbid story that really tingles my weird taste in anime.Mahou Shoujo Site is another anime that I did not expect much to blow me away in the Spring Anime 2018 lineup together with Hinamatsuri. I just thought that this is a mixture of...totally contrasting genres and since I love opposing genre mashups I would give this a try. And after watching the very first episode, it swept me away like a tempest at the end of days! I could not get enough of it that I have started reading its manga and the other work of Kentarou Satou Mahou Shoujo of the End (You should read this). This meant a lot for me since I am the type of person that is really picky when it comes to story and Mahou Shoujo Site did not disappoint... well I\'ve never really set a huge expectation to it, to begin with.The anime does not adapt the manga on a 1:1 ratio. It omits some parts and rearranges the story to fit the 12 episodes seasonal format. Surprisingly, I did not feel that it was badly adapted; moreover, I felt that the anime developed an identity of itself that it can stand toe to toe with its manga counterpart. I am glad that it did not have the adaptation disease that Tokyo Ghoul had.Outstanding Story of bullied, abused, mistreated unfortunate girls who receive special items to help redeem their lost life and happiness.Art is Great (9). The art felt magically eerie and I absolutely love it! The way that it mashes cutesie magical girly stuff with grunge darkness surprisingly works well. And I should not forget to mention how they combine live-action, 3D CG, traditional hand-drawn animation at the ending of the episode that makes me cringe for a bit then appreciate it after watching it. It is well represented in this aspect.Sound is Outstanding (10). ""Changing point"" by i☆Ris is one of the best opening songs for the Spring Anime 2018 lineup. It perfectly hypes me up to watch the episode and goes well with the dark theme of the story.""Zenzen Tomodachi"" by Haruka Yamazaki tremendously adds to the eerie cringe of the ending animation. I couldn\'t even skip the ending song even if I want to. It is what I can describe as a satisfying cringe.""...Watashi dake Mitete♡ (...私だけ見てて♡)"" by Nijimi Anazawa (Yuu Serizawa) the ending song for the 3rd episode is another surprise for me. It is not as a cringe-fest as the main ending theme but it felt out of place at the beginning after it was over it felt ""Yeah it was a perfect ending theme for this episode""The overall sound and song choices for Mahou Shoujo site scarily fit the theme of the story well.Characters are Great (8). As for the characters in the story, the main protagonist of Aya and Yatsumura-san is one of the best yuri team-ups that I have ever seen and I was not even aware of it at the beginning. Both of their backstories fleshes out their characters more which in turn makes them endearing and easy to relate to characters.I also want to give a special mention to Sarina\'s character in the story. I strongly believed that she is just a one-off character that would eventually die at some point earlier in the story, but I got surprised by how she developed into one of my favorite characters in the whole Mahou Shoujo Site story.The supporting characters are good, but not great enough to hold their ground. They are more developed in the manga compared to the anime.Overall, this anime is not for everyone\'s liking and I know that. But if you are into the eerie, bizarre, and good cringes, I would definitely recommend this anime to you in a heartbeat! One of the best Spring Animes of 2018.I would give Mahou Shoujo Site 9 magical sticks out of 10. totally contrasting genres and since I love opposing genre mashups I would give this a try.

Full of unanswered questions the story instead opted to fill in plots of childish ecchi and bdsm shock porn.Characters are stock with some social-political statements being the only reason we even meet them.I did at times start to like some yet we never learned anything about them to build any attachment.This show is clearly a cash grab built off tropes and shock value, its lazy and half assed. that was ultimately wasted , poorly written and even worse in execution, which honestly is what upset me most about the ending was just how little anything was answered or even given attention too.

Do you ever want to suicide but you dont have any courage to die?2. Have you ever been bullied but never had any courage to tell anyone else?3. What is the meaning to be stronger to you?4. You always get bullied day by day, but magicaly you had a power to stop time, but when you using those power your aged will shortened by 1 or more years. What will you do?5. Last but no least.

The story is about unfortunate random girl that had a magical power by random tools that they got from \'Magical Girl Site\' with random masked admin. If you are low hearted people you\'ll get torment by watching terrible things from the very beginning of the story. For me, this anime doesnt suit for anyone who had mahou shojo fetishes. Why? i dont want give much spoiler here, so watch the show from the beginning to the latest one. (IF YOU ARE WEAK, DONT WATCH THIS ANIME!)ART : The art was impress me, remembered that production doA who produce this show.Note :  this anime was the second project by doA, the first one was the movie of Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka? i could tell it was amazing the PH that produce a cute loli movie had such horror project like Magical girl site that containt 70% of violence and blood.If you never skipped the opening theme for the first to the latest episodes, you\'ll see naruto 2nd opening theme (haruka kanata) animation, tokyo ghoul first opening, Uchiha  Itachi that sit in the chair when sasuke is about to fight itachi for the last time, and many more other anime reference in this opening.SOUND : The opening theme is Changing point by i☆ris, most of i☆ris personel take a voice role in this anime, like Serizawa Yuu and Yamazaki Haruka. obviously, only Yamazaki Haruka sung for ending theme, special for 3rd epsiode ending theme was sung by Serizawa Yuu.

This is then followed by multiple Dunning-Kruger inspired reviews that vary in intellectual quality but are all easily spotted by their superfluous use of the word ""edgy"". Why horror is the only genre ""haunted"" ( dohohohoho I make joke ) by this oddity is anyones\' guess.But anyways, on to the anime in question itself:...Mahou Shoujo Site. Some people will immediately compare this show to Madoka in the trendy line of ""Dark"" magical girl series. However, this is somewhat of a mistake. Madoka was a Thriller that intended to rewrite the rules of what a mahou shoujo could be. Mahou Shoujo Site is a Horror that never really cared about those rules to begin with. Aside from including magical girls and having a plot that isn\'t about spreading love n\' peace, the two shows have little in common. In some ways MHS can\'t even be considered a magical girl anime, or at the very least has a very different take on what makes someone ""magical"". The magical sticks the girls are given function more like weapons in that technically anyone can use them. This makes for a unique plot device in that the sticks are often stolen, sometimes by people who aren\'t even ""magical girls"" and used for various effects. The girls themselves do not gain any magical power that is unique to them as an individual. This further drives the point that MHS should not be directly compared to other mahou shoujo series.What we are seeing here is more or less a blood and shock show that just happens to include the premise of magical girls rather than the other way around. In truth it makes far more sense to compare this show to things like ""Another"" or even Danganronpa, as those would give you a much better idea for the atmosphere and tone that MHS is going for.Mahou Shoujo Site is indeed very dark. Almost comically so, with an unusually high number of characters being completely insane for no apparent reason with the only real exception being the main character. This drives home the first point that needs to be understood to enjoy this anime: you can\'t take it too seriously, because it isn\'t trying to be serious. What the show is trying to accomplish is more or less placing an innocent character in a hopeless situation and then exploring the more twisted underbelly of human psyche from there. Characters in this show die. Characters have their bodies torn up with their blood and guts strewed all over the place. This show includes almost every possible bad thing you can imagine happening to the MC, but what makes it watchable is that very little of it is particularly unrealistic in the sense that ""this never happens to anyone ever"".Overall, the quality of Mahou Shoujo Site is there. The plot has decent flow albeit some logical flaws, the animation is good, and the voice acting is actually some of the best of the season.  However this only holds value as long as you don\'t hate this type of anime.  If you do not care for some edgelording, then do yourself a very big favor and do not watch this show. If you either enjoy this genre or are indifferent to it, then you will likely find that it is quite underrated and overly criticized for being exactly what it was trying to be. The biggest downside to the show has more to do with the length than anything, in that it is a single cour show of an ongoing manga and thus doesn\'t really conclude on a closing note.7.5/10 Mahou Shoujo Site.

You’re basically taking the innocence of that magical girl trying to save the world and reducing it into “Girls with supernatural abilities trying to kill each other”, regardless of their intentions. Torturing someone to death, even though he deserves it, doesn’t really fall into the heroic nature of the “Magical Girls” concept. Because it is still a wrong thing to do. You’re no better than the person you’re actually harming. Because you’ve become him. Point is, you can forget about the whole “magical” genre here. You can replace the title...of the show with anything you’d like, say “Devilish Girls Site” or “Mentally Unstable Girls with Powers Site” and it’s not going to change a thing.This show is not about everlasting conflict and dilemma between good and evil. Because let’s face it, almost all of them are evil, and they try to wash away their sins by pretending nothing happened in the first place.This show is about retarded girls who get rewritten every time the writer demands it so they can supposedly fight each other without any sense of logic and motive.Magical Girls Site is a bad, bad show. And it doesn’t even try to hide it.This review will contain minor spoilers.The story revolves around Aya, a social awkward student who just transferred to a new school. Little did she know that some of her classmates are the reincarnation of the Devil himself. From the very first episode, we witness endless bullying, extreme and exaggerated physical torture such as drowning Aya’s head straight into a toilet and hiring a rapist to have his way with her. Man, school sure sucks. Can’t wait for her to go back home so she can take a nap from all this nightmare. But it doesn’t stop there! At home, her brother tortures her by treating her as his “personal punching bag” just because he wants to release his stress. Because what better way to let it all out? Gym, boxing, music, gaming? Forget it. Punching his very own sister is much more enjoyable because he blames her for enjoying a carefree life. What an ignorant. Enough of that, let’s give Aya a cat, the only companion who truly understands her suffering and acknowledges her existence as a human being. Let’s also kill this pet by the very same bullies at school. What a day! Aya has had enough. In fact, we had enough. What’s with the exaggerated bullying and torturing of this poor and innocent girl? We get that the brilliant writer wants to victimize the protagonist, but why go so far? So far for a girl who apparently suffers from social anxiety and struggles to fit in her school. But that’s not the main reason for the bullying. Aya was bullied because she didn’t thank her classmate. I wish I was joking!So all this brutal torturing and harassment must be for a reason: becoming a Magical Girl. Oh boy! Can’t wait for Aya to teach the bullies a lesson! And she does, well, accidentally and feels sorry for them. Yes, she feels sorry for the man who tried to rape her, and the girl who brought him here. Basically, she feels sorry for defending herself.I get it. The writer wants to portray Aya as an innocent and caring little girl who doesn’t harm a soul. But how can she stay the same after all this physical and mental torture? This is where the psychological aspect of the show fails miserably. And it doesn’t begin with Aya. You’ve got Rina, a serial killer on the loose known as the “Magical Hunter” who murdered hundreds of magical girls but later on befriends Aya and her friend Tsuyuno like nothing ever happened. One would think that Rina is heartless and cold-blooded killer, because that what she was at the beginning, but then she starts crying at Nijimi’s funeral, a girl she barely interacted with, a girl whose friend was brutally murdered by no other than Rina herself.After Rina “magically” becomes one the good guys, she transfers to school, having NO MONEY and PARENTS to rely on because she took the identity of another Magical Girl. And she admits it when she decides to spend the night at Aya’s house, a girl she tried to kill a few episodes ago. At this point, the story doesn’t present any sense of logic. Characters do whatever they want to, change their personalities however they like, and get rewritten from scratch just so that they can fit the plot and its context.I wish it gets better. Tsuyuno, Aya’s BFF, keeps the guy who killed her parents locked in her house in a BDSM fashion. Did I mention that the girls we’re talking about are only 14? Yet Tsuyuno sadistically tortures the killer day after day. Let’s not forget about Nijimi, a friend of Aya and Tsyunuyo and enemy of Rina. We have a whole episode where all the characters cry at her funeral when in reality they barely even knew her. It was unsympathetic and irrelevant because nothing was really giving to the viewer so he can CARE for her character, just like nothing was giving to the characters themselves so they can care for her. They just HAVE to pretend they do, and we just have to blindly imitate their emotions. This is why Magical Girls Site can never be considered a drama, simply because it fails portraying its characters and doesn’t develop their relationships and interactions between each other. It just paints them as if they exist already, and we just have to accept that. Just like we have to accept that 14-year-old girls can be worse than real life criminals.On the other hand, Aya’s brother becomes a forced antagonist who wants to kill his own sister along with her friends. Wait, wasn’t he supposed to be focusing on his studies all day? Because that’s how he was presented in the beginning: an angel who studies in the day and a devil who tortures his sister at night. Again, he gets rewritten, just like everybody else.Remember the leader of the bullies, Sarina? She wants to get back at Aya for killing her “friends” but suddenly becomes friends with her after she gets saved for no apparent reason. Let me get this straight: Aya saved a girl who mentally broke her, physically tortured her, and attempted raping her with her bigger “friend”. Sounds about right.Even the voice acting was not well-handled. They hired a fairly new voice actress for Aya. When voicing, Yuku Ono was not acting. She really had trouble reading her lines. The other voice actors/actresses were acceptable. We have an ED that blatantly shows sperms flying around and girls dancing on the roof. Huh. In episode 4, there’s a live action ED based on Nijimi’s character. This was far better than the previous nonsense.The animation was also mediocre. Besides the rather funny faces such as Njimi’s killer face or the brother’s rape-y face, nothing was really memorable. In fact, they tried their best to hide the facial traits of the characters especially during the more serious scenes for several minutes at a time. It didn’t help settle the mood, it just made it worse.I wanted to like Magical Girls Site. I really did. But it turns out to be a show that ironically goes too far with its “edgy-ness” without actually going anywhere. It’s not a disappointing show that gradually becomes worse in time. It’s a show that starts bad and ends bad, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless he’s as mentally insane as the writer. of the show with anything you’d like, say “Devilish Girls Site” or “Mentally Unstable Girls with Powers Site” and it’s not going to change a thing.This show is not about everlasting conflict and dilemma between good and evil.

Wait, wasn’t he supposed to be focusing on his studies all day? Because that’s how he was presented in the beginning: an angel who studies in the day and a devil who tortures his sister at night. Again, he gets rewritten, just like everybody else.Remember the leader of the bullies, Sarina? She wants to get back at Aya for killing her “friends” but suddenly becomes friends with her after she gets saved for no apparent reason. Let me get this straight: Aya saved a girl who mentally broke her, physically tortured her, and attempted raping her with her bigger “friend”. Sounds about right.Even the voice acting was not well-handled. They hired a fairly new voice actress for Aya. When voicing, Yuku Ono was not acting. She really had trouble reading her lines. The other voice actors/actresses were acceptable. We have an ED that blatantly shows sperms flying around and girls dancing on the roof. Huh. In episode 4, there’s a live action ED based on Nijimi’s character. This was far better than the previous nonsense.The animation was also mediocre. Besides the rather funny faces such as Njimi’s killer face or the brother’s rape-y face, nothing was really memorable. In fact, they tried their best to hide the facial traits of the characters especially during the more serious scenes for several minutes at a time. It didn’t help settle the mood, it just made it worse.I wanted to like Magical Girls Site. I really did. But it turns out to be a show that ironically goes too far with its “edgy-ness” without actually going anywhere. It’s not a disappointing show that gradually becomes worse in time. It’s a show that starts bad and ends bad, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless he’s as mentally insane as the writer.', 'was a really good anime i rate it 10 was so sad and i felt so bad for her going through all this especially the cat that was so sad, i love watching this show i hope there is way more to this anime soon more episodes and more seasons i really love this anime and i also want her fucking brother to die already from her i been waiting for that moment for him to just die from her i havent seen a anime like this for awhile now but very good animedefinitely needs more episodes sooni really love how her personality becomes...more confident in herself later onim hoping to see more soon im waiting for episode 7 right now more confident in herself later onim hoping to see more soon im waiting for episode 7 right now', ""Will contain very minor spoilers.I started this show with high hopes and watched it every week although I rarely watch an airing show (hate cliffhangers) and was one of the guys that liked episode 1. Thought that it was necessary to move the show forward.On all levels this has been a disappointment.Characters act in ways that are not believable, they try to kill each other one moment, the next they're best friends because of plot, plot which get forgotten in the end. Not anything psychological here.The art and hence the fights are boring. I have the feeling the art quality drops...from episode 6, in episode 8 or 9 the facial features are not there, the characters look like cardboard cutouts. The fights are boring and some not even animated or not there to be considered a fight. Apart from one in the early episodes (where the dialogue consists mainly of Japanese profanity courtesy of Haruka Yamazaki). The backgrounds are generic with no special art to them.The plot is confusing, they set a goal, the goal is never expanded upon nor does it have a conclusion. The apocalypse theme doesn't have either, seems to be forgotten by the end of the show. Characters behave erratically sometimes violent, sometimes non violent, mostly to shock the viewer rather than drive the plot forward.Sound is boring, nothing special during the boring fights either. Voice actresses are mostly newbies, also a good indication of the low budget for this one. As a side note, one of the administrators in episode 10 I think is voiced by Aoi Yuuki, a great performance and an interesting voice change from her part - I guess it's a promotional role to showcase the voice.And if the show is disturbing for you, if the animal violence in episode one is disturbing for you then the implied male rape scene in the end credits is the cherry on the rotten cake MGS is.Was really disappointing, was not really expecting Madoka here, or Yuuki Yuna, but at least I was expecting this to be on par with Ikusei Keikaku. Not the case here unfortunately.Symphogear S1 had bad art, bad plot, but characters were okish in their beliefs and the way they acted. MGS I think is overrated at 6.6 on Mal, 5 something would be fitting. I choose a 4, there was nothing memorable for me here but I will forever remember the sperm ending credits scene.

Why?"", 'This review is spoiler-free.A lot of anime adaptations fail to meet the bar set by the manga, and Mahou Shoujo Site is one of them.The fault of this anime is it wasn\'t able to incorporate the shape of horror of its manga. For this reason, it ended up being shallow. This has something to do with the usage of sound and visual effects. Perhaps this is also the reason why other critics find the anime pretentious for even using stern issues (i.e mental health) as a narrative.The only good thing about this anime is its character development. Every episode, it manages to grip its audience...to know the characters even more. Clearly, knowing a detrimental character is as interesting as it could get.Dissecting this anime into parts won\'t do anything better as it is meant for a targeted audience who watch anime casually without entirely gleaning on the themes of the anime. Consequently, if you enjoy gore anime with a sub-par plot, this anime is recommendable.This anime is the type anime that you\'d categorize as ""it\'s so bad, it\'s good"". to know the characters even more.

One example of that is Mahou Shoujo Site. Great deal of people come and watch it expecting another magical girl shounen, and immidiately leave because they cant take anything that isnt wholesome and happy feel good vibe.This show isn't perfect, but so is life. And so this show tries to be reallistic, tries to show us how REAL despair and STRUGGLE can look like. Things in this show get messy, and disturbing, and, while I hate to use that word, it describes it well, edgy. All those things are merely a reflection of reality.This helps us feel more...connected to the characters in the show, and deepens our feelings for them. All of that makes everything more engaging and dramatic.

The music track for the show was truly great.The artstyle in this show is crafted with great care and attention to details.

Sometimes an anime series doesn\'t take itself seriously in order to be more enjoyable. By making itself self aware to be over the top and absurd can lead to some very enjoyable scenes and moments that keep you entertained. But what about those shows that unintentionally make you take it less seriously. Does it make it good or does it simply cover its flaws? This anime series optimises this idea by taking a dark spin on a genre that is generally light and fluffy but making itself enjoyable in the way it didn\'t want you...to.So Sit back, relax you poor, unfortunate souls as I present to the anime review for Mahou Shojou Site, or by its English translation, Magical Girl Site. lets begin.Story 4.5/10The story follows Aya Asagiri. A girl who has pretty much had life kick the s**t out her. Constantly bullied at school and abused by her Brother at home, this poor girl is struggling to have the will to live and constantly thinks of suicide but lacks the courage to do so. After an abuse session by his Brother, a mysterious website appears in front of Aya called ""Magical Girl Site"" where the administrator, Nana, gives Aya a magical device called a ""stick"" to become a magical girl. She then meets another Magical girl by the name of Tsuyuno Yatsumura, who introduces her to the idea of being a magical girl and tells of her of a mysterious event that is going to take place known as ""Tempest."" From there the two girls try to find out what is Tempest and the truth behind the Magical Girl Site.Right off the bat, this show tackles some very heavy subject matter such as domestic abuse, bullying, suicidal thoughts and even rape (""lovely""). Subject matter that this show brings up and never is talked about again; which leaves the question. Why? Well to bring one obvious point that this show is trying to be ""dark"" and ""edgy,"" even with the razor blades and pins in the shoes. And you know what, that what makes this show enjoyable. You can just sit back and relax as you watch this anime be absurd and over the top to the point where you can just enjoy the whole absurdity of this anime.Does this mean it can cover its flaws? Good god no. This show has plot holes and continuity errors that leave you scratching your head as to why this has happened. When you are progressing the plot, you can\'t just leave things unanswered and resolve things quickly. That\'s bad storytelling. A girl who is mentally unstable and wants to kill someone should not just play it down when you don\'t have the means to kill that person (even though you could improvise). This is just for the sake of reminding you that this is a dark show and not for kids even though you should still tell a good story.And that\'s the thing, it struggles to differentiate itself from the obvious anime its taking influence from, Madoka Magika. In fact, I\'m going to say that this show is Madoka Magika with a mixture of Higurashi in there and a lot more edge. It struggles to carve itself its own identity as it only thinks that making the show even darker would help make it unique even though it just makes itself more absurd.And don\'t get me started on the ending of this show. Heading into the last few episodes, I was wondering how this anime was going to end. Well guess what? It doesn\'t. Leaving us on a cliffhanger which I honestly don\'t think is going to get resolved, leaving me bitter in the mouth.Characters 7.5/10Aya is portrayed as being a sympathetic character so much that you just want to walk over and give her a hug. Bad things always happens to her which brings her down on her luck to the point of trying to commit suicide. She is presented as a character being incredibly weak and shy but over time, she gains more confidence in herself as she has someone to talk to in the form of Tsuyuno. Now I like Aya as a character since she is someone that we can care for because she has just been a very unfortunate girl. But she is merely a victim in the anime\'s attempt to be dark and edgy since most of its darker scenes include her.Her relationship with Tsuyuno is what I consider to be the highlight of the show as it is clear that these two girls need each other. This is because they are getting something that they have desperately needed, a friend. To have someone to talk to and share your problems. Aya gains confidence and is more sociable thanks to Tsuyuno. Tsuyuno is less cold and understands peoples\' emotions better thanks to Aya. From the beginning, we are introduced to Tsuyuno as a cold and serious person who doesn\'t take nonsense for an answer. But by talking to Aya more, she is more understanding and feels less pressured to to everything by herself because she has someone by her side. It even has a tiny bit of Yuri in their relationship just to make it that much emotional.Now the rest of the cast is where the Higurashi element comes in as some of them struggle to keep their violent tendencies in check. Nijimi is the best example of this because she can flip between a cute pop idol to a revenge filled monster at the flip of a hat. Of course she isn\'t the only character that has personality changes but she is the best example. But in terms of depth, they are lacking. Even though you can\'t do everyone, some of the more important characters don\'t get any depth in their character. This is mainly due to poor storytelling that causes these characters to be more simplistic and have their actions to be explained with little reason.Animation 6.5/10The animation for Mahou Shojou site is fine. Not bad but certainly doesn\'t stand out. It definitely does its job and it doesn\'t put me off but again, it\'s just fine. However, I do like the exaggerated facial expressions (aka the ""Higurashi Face"") that are shown on these characters, even though some of them are over the top a bit.In terms of character designs, they are all pretty standard affair with the exception of two characters, Aya and Nana. Aya really does look like a character who would be and has been abused. Small stature, looks weak like she doesn\'t eat and has baggage around her eyes, telling the viewer of her lack of sleep because she is never comfortable because of all the abuse she is getting. And then we have Nana with her old look from old black and white TVs and an unmoving expression that really does get creepy the longer you stare about it.Sound 5.5/10The soundtrack is also fine but it doesn\'t exactly stand out. It more or less to stays in the background and does its own thing which is kind of disappointing because for a horror series, the ambient soundtracks helps to add to the atmosphere of the show. Shows like Higurashi and Shiki do this well to add to the tension and atmosphere but unfortunately, this show\'s OST doesn\'t do that.As for the show\'s opening I actually do like it even though there isn\'t a lot of stand out animation in the opening. It is more or less foreshadowing of things to come in the show. However, it does do things right. For one, I do like the cracks on the corners of the screen since many characters are mentally broken so it is good symbolism. Another thing that stands out is the scenes change in the opening depending on where we are in the story, making me wish more anime did this.The ending for the show is..... weird. Like, really weird. Not only does it have a live action dance number, there was a heavy emphasis on sperm. Yep sperm. It is just wierd to watch this. Although the song ""Zenzen Tomodachi"" by Haruka Yamazaki is good, it definitely overshadowed by the weird visuals on display.ConclusionThis is a show that is difficult to decide whether or not you should at least check out this show. On one hand the absurdity and the over the top antics of this show makes this entertaining and the relationship between Aya and Tsuyuno is something I genuinely cared about. On the other hand, its poor story writing and emphasis that this is a dark and edgy show hampers this show quite a bit. Honestly, I wouldn\'t blame you if you dismiss this show or if you already had dismissed this show because this show doesn\'t exactly scream high quality anime. I also honestly think it should have broken the 12 episode mould and have at least 14 episodes to wrap things up and not leave us on a cliffhanger which suggests a sequal that might not possibly happen.I\'m going to use an analogy right here. Mahou Shoujou Site is like the Shadow the Hedgehog video game. Does it fail at telling a cohesive and good story? Yes. Does it go over the top with the emphasis that is is dark and edgy? Yes. Does it still has entertainment value from its stupidity and absurdness? Yes. If you are looking for an anime to turn your brain off and be entertained, then check this anime out. If not, then you can just skip this one.My Personal Enjoyment: 7/10Overall Score: 6.2/10           Recommendation: Consider it to.So Sit back, relax you poor, unfortunate souls as I present to the anime review for Mahou Shojou Site, or by its English translation, Magical Girl Site. lets begin.Story 4.5/10The story follows Aya Asagiri.

She attempts to commit suicide multiple times, but fails to succeed. One day she is called upon to earn a magical weapon that would help end her bully. She hesitate to use the magical weapon, but when used it she accidentally kills two students; her bully and the bully\'s friend that was going to rape her. And the story goes from there, this is just the surface.Story: There is a lot of violence and a lot of blood, but that is...not we are here for. The story is complex and confusing. Every character introduced in the anime gets a brief background, even the antagonist (well, not all of them). It all revolves around the ""Tempest"" but it never talks anything past that, maybe there will be more information later. Every magical girl wants to survive the Tempest, but no one ever try. They just want information, information, and capture the site admin. IDK, seems confusing that if someone was going to die, they might as well kill as much they can.Character: Like said before, character are developed in a brief manner. You feel numb for the Aya Asagiri trying to commit suicide because the character is only briefly explained and makes it hard to be conveyed by her feeling. There are twisted girl, but along with Aya, everyone feels numb also. Everyone is in the shadow.Enjoyment: I enjoy the sperms flying everywhere in ED as there is idol dancing XD, it always makes me laugh. Anyway, this show is exceptional for enjoyment if you don\'t mind the blood and violence along with twisted characters. The plot is ""ight,"" not too shabby or too great.Conclusion: Compared to some other season anime *cough *cough ""Ousama Game,"" it phase the story in a good and exceptional way. Not too many dumb characters, but not too many too smart characters. Those who know more information at least tries to help those who don\'t. Characters has their own knowledge, personalities, and god forbid, a background at least. It\'s like angel and devil put together here. Light and dark. not we are here for.

I started to see it totally at random and I only knew that the protagonist was a bullied girl, when I saw the name of the anime with ""shoujo"" I really demoralized because I don\'t like the genere at all and I saw the first random episode. I realized that this isn\'t the usual story of magical girls doing nice things and fighting bad guys with the power of love. No. This anime is beautiful, of course it has its flaws, but I think I was never bored to see it and I was very taken. I didn\'t find...it boring or stupid at all. The only flaw I think it\'s for the final that I think they left a little random .. maybe for a second season?In my opinion this anime must be given at least one chance.PS: Excuse me if I made mistakes, I used the translator because I\'m not English.

And Mahou Shoujo Site is one of these shows (at least from my perspective).

The show is also more or less original than completely following the events of the manga (e.g. many events and the whole finale of the anime are either changed or completely original to the anime).  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the show!  I don't expect a season 2 since the show went original, but it would be cool to see something like an ONA or maybe perhaps a reboot...in the future (despite it being highly unlikely). in the future (despite it being highly unlikely)."", ""This anime was swild from start to finish, and writing a positive review wont suffice to its awesomeness. Don't let the low rating and negative reviews stop you from watching this. Enjoyed every minute of it!Although I felt that it was a bit rushed since there are so many parts that could still be elaborated and there's been a cliffhanger at the end (which is something I'm not a fan of), the story, the development (although it's super fast especially with the relationship of the characters), were superb.This is some combination of Akame Ga Kill + Mirai Nikki + No Game No Life freak. It's...good! good!"", '""DID HE SERIOUSLY GIVE MAHOU SHOUJO SITE A 9"" YEAH I DID BUCKLE UP AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING THIS INCREDIBLE DUMPSTER FIRELet me get something out of the way really quick: the beginning of this show is awful! it\'s incredible. The art is stiff, the music is generic, the character interactions suck, and overall the whole thing is written like a hamfisted attempt to set the stage for a story the author started writing from the middle. Weirdly enough it smooths out by episode five and by episode six you\'ll find yourself suddenly...aboard the hype train with an EXPRESS TICKET TO HYPEVILLE.But to get to this point you have to take a step back and really try to understand the thing you\'re looking at. If you try to absorb this as-is, take the characters and their interactions at face value and expecting the show to create value to you by itself you\'re going to be disappointed. This isn\'t Gurren Lagann or BNH. The characters and the circumstances and the special powers and stuff are all metaphors.You can laugh at me for digging meaning out of somewhere there is none but I\'d like you to consider this: I\'m still fully acknowledging that this show is bad. The way I went in to this experience started shaping the way I contextualized everything and ultimately how much I enjoyed the experience. One of the biggest criticisms I notice about this show have to do with unrealistic character interactions, particularly with the brother, and the bullying in the beginning. I was skeptic (and even angry) while I was watching it. This isn\'t how abuse works! Bullying doesn\'t happen like this! on and on. But you can look at it from another direction too: the hyper-absurdist depictions of these kinds of things ends up lending itself to how the story is told. Building the interactions and fleshing out the characters is great and all, but it would have ended up confusing the whole situation. PLUS! The series isn\'t about them! They\'re used as plot devices. They\'re not built up as characters because in the context of the story they aren\'t characters, they\'re monsters.I\'m not going to do a breakdown because those are dumb. Here\'s what I\'ll leave you with, though:Mahou Shoujo Site, on the surface, is a mind-numbing, torturously generic ""muh suffering"" madoka magica wannabe that isn\'t worth watching. Peel it back though, and watch it in the context of the message it\'s trying to send instead of just staring slack-jawed, drooling with your left hand in your pants at the pixels dancing around on your screen, and you find something that\'s really weird but suddenly really exciting. If you put Madoka Magicka, Higurashi no naku koro ni, and (bear with me here) Hataraku Saibou in a blender, something pretty close to Mahou Shoujo Site would come out.If you don\'t see where I\'m coming from when I say that, you missed the point I\'m trying to make entirely and should probably reread my entire review from start to finish. aboard the hype train with an EXPRESS TICKET TO HYPEVILLE.But to get to this point you have to take a step back and really try to understand the thing you\'re looking at.

YOU WILL NOT HAVE A GOOD TIME.', 'I will start by saying that I started watching Mahou Shoujo Site (Magical Girl Site) completely unbiased. Neither am I accustomed to the Magical Girl genre nor had I read any information regarding the show\'s popularity before. For that reason, and having just finished watching it, I will only comment on it the way I experimented it.Mahou Shoujo Site\'s plot is nothing particularly new or breathtaking. Protagonist is given a magical object that gives them a power strong enough to protect themselves or others, but is soon proven to make them bear a responsibility so huge it counterbalances the good it brings them - been...there, seen that. Watching this plot once again may bore some watchers out of their minds, but if you tend to enjoy that type in particular, Mahou Shoujo Site\'s take on it could pique your interest.As someone who easily gets emotional watching animated series or movies, I\'ll have to be honest and say the first few episodes barely made me feel any empathy towards the protagonist, Asagiri. That, however, didn\'t bother me in the least, as I felt that the beginning of the show, the first episode especially, was clearly meant to clarify the story\'s bases, and the actual action would show up later - I turned out to be right, and my sensible, much too empathetic heart, ended up completely attached to the characters\' emotions by the end of the story.The first episode may be interpreted as ""torture p*rn"" and I absolutely understand how, however, I have seen worse, and was relieved to see this element of the story was soon thrown in the background where it belonged, by mainly focusing on the ongoing plot and presenting different characters with diverse points of view and backstories.Mahou Shoujo Site consists of 12 episodes only, and manages to get its points accross in that short amount of time without leaving much confusion behind. I didn\'t notice any plot points dragging for too long or being glossed over too quickly, and for that reason I feel Mahou Shoujo Site should be an enjoyable watch to most.There isn\'t much to be said about the artstyle of the show. It didn\'t strike me as particularly beautiful, nor did I find it ugly in the least. Some artistic choices are pretty interesting in my opinion, such as the appearance of the world when a certain character uses her power, the different artstyle used for the main antagonists, or something as simple as the way eyes are drawn, and I enjoyed looking at these details. If I had one thing to complain about, it\'s that a certain character isn\'t wearing a t-shirt, it\'s bodypaint.Drawing folds on her bodypaint won\'t trick me, anime artist, this is not how fabric interacts with breasts!Its music was something I consistently enjoyed about Mahou Shoujo Site. It never felt out of place and some themes were really pleasant to listen to. I wouldn\'t know how to comment on the show\'s whole sound-design, but keep in mind that I noticed and enjoyed a lot of its music and was impressed by the main antagonists\' voice acting.The characters in Mahou Shoujo Site have their ups and downs.Asagiri is really nothing special, and she didn\'t seem to me either likeable or unlikeable.Some characters did probably suffer from the show being very short; Izumigamine, am I supposed to like her? Does Takiguchi even have a personality? Ringa looks purely amazing, why doesn\'t she have her own show? It is a little bit disappointing not to know some of these characters\' backstories, especially since I really expected to see some clues towards them, however, this did not impact the story negatively for me. Again, Mahou Shoujo Site is only 12 episodes long. It could have arguably been very different had it been longer, but I think it did a good enough job for its designated lifespan.Simply don\'t expect to learn about a lot of these characters in-depth - if like me you are into psychology it may be a little bit disappointing not to, but I have to say I didn\'t even think about it until the show was over and I managed to empathize with them still.That being said, Mahou Shoujo Site also has really good characters. It is of course up to each individual who\'s their favourite, but I think I could easily guess which characters are the most popular among the show\'s watchers. I really fell for Yatsumura, whose evolution with Asigiri was lovely and satisfying to watch, but she\'s not the only one to have a striking personality, backstory and development. Mahou Shoujo Site does a great job portraying some of its characters, which is why one could have expected this treatment for all them.It is interesting to note that the show has much more than a single antagonist, and the ways they come and go, develop and end up changing or disappearing, do a great job of keeping the hype of the story up and are in some cases captivating.So, did I enjoy the show? Yes, and I was surprised to read such negatives reviews of it when I was done watching. As someone who often criticizes what I already described as ""tortune p*rn"", I didn\'t find Mahou Shoujo Site annoying in that sense. Now that I\'ve thought about it, I understand that this type of show can\'t be enjoyable for all audiences. It may give some déjà-vu (although I\'ll argue the antagonists and the way some are portrayed gave it something special), and it may annoy watchers who enjoy action more than they do drama.Mahou Shoujo Site revolves around misery. If Cosette drives you nuts, so will probably Asagiri. But if the portrayal of someone miserable and how they handle relationships and danger is what you\'re after, you will probably love to learn about her, Yatsumura and the others.I\'m awful at giving shows a score, and I was particularly hesitant regarding this one. I kept giving a 7, then coming back to give it a 6, then a 7 again, etc., etc., but I finally settled on a 7. ""Good"". Not the best, nothing special, but an enjoyable watch. It may not stay forever engraved in my mind the way my favourite shows are, but there are parts I loved and will probably want to revisit through fanart - that\'s how I know a character or scene struck me.If you are searching for a quick, easy watch, Mahou Shoujo Site should do the job. I do not regret watching it and was interested in the plot from beginning to end.As a last comment, for those who are interested by that: there is what could be interpreted as LGBT representation in this show.One character (and I don\'t think that is a spoiler, as this is one of the first things we learn about them) is namely a ""crossdresser"" and may very well actually be trans. It\'s a character whose backstory isn\'t explored, though, so I wouldn\'t call that good representation. That being said, compared to other crossdressing or transgender characters in anime... It\'s really not bad either.One character is pretty clearly a lesbian, and I think it works very well. It\'s the kind of character you\'ll probably read being interpreted as straight but ~really attached to her female friends~ online but I think there\'s no mistake in saying she\'s really attracted to women. The show hints at it multiple times and later confirms it by a simple, straightforward sentence. I was worried she would only be used as queerbaiting but I think she\'s better than that.And finally... I won\'t spoil it, but one of the final scenes shows a gay male character. It\'s unfortunate, and I\'ll make the choice not to hold it against the show seeing how other LGBT characters were handled, but he\'s clearly representative of a common degrading trope, loved by some fetishits. It may be a ""coincidence"" in a way, as the scene is not portrayed as positive in the least.And don\'t worry if you fear propaganda - those LGBT characters seem realistic enough and shouldn\'t feel rubbed in your face unless you\'re particularly hateful. there, seen that.

A lot of people judge things on the merits of another anime or anime they have seen. Rarely do you find someone who deconstructs an anime and judge's it bases on the anime as a whole.  Without bias and without letting their taste get in the waySo that is what I am going to attempt to do with this short and sweet review.Let's talk story first. The story was interesting to say the least. While at times I felt uncomfortable or anger at the things I was viewing, the story kept me interested. Kept me...focus. Wanting to know how things would unfold. It kept me on edge. Here and there, there are dark bits of humor but the overall story is balances. We see the life of our main character unfold and we watch her day to day interactions and we see how she deals. This gives us a glimpse into who this person is. And for that reason we are drawn to her. Because we feel for her. Many who watch anime have been victim of bullying themselves and can relate to the feeling of being bullied. So there's always that to connect with. I personally was bullied at a younger age so I can relate.Watching these girls lives and learning how they got there kept me interested in this story. I wanted to see if they could pull it off. I suggest if you watch this anime to focus on the interactions that happen between characters and look beyond what is shown at face valueThe art style was wonderful and pleasing to the eye. Simplistic emotions and even complex ones were portrayed very well. The puffiness on a characters eyes who had been crying and the detail to show anguish and suffering or happiness and laughter were stylized well. It was pleasing to watch over all.The music was not something I focused on a lot. I'm one of those guys who skips intros and outros once in a while,  but I caught myself watching them here. Plus there is a good score within the anime during scenes as well. I'm trying in the voice acting here as well. I watched subbed anime and the range of emotion delivered did not disappoint. I give high praise to the staff that worked on this anime with their voice acting. I'm sure they worked very hard to produce the results they did. Overall sound was of a very good standard. It's not the best but it's not the worst either.The characters. Now we get to a crucial point. Story is one thing but it's another if you fail to have characters that cannot bring your story to life. And this one did. I pray that the things that happen here in this anime aren't too common because there were a good list of characters who, in more than one instance, I rooted for their death and suffering. There were characters I felt for that when they died their disappearance was felt. Characters who matured in ways I didn't see coming. I will say one thing though. Each and every teacher in this anime should be fired.I highly enjoyed this anime. I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a dark yet enjoyable anime. It has dark times and light times. It isn't a total gore feast. It's psychological at best,  I wouldn't even call it horror. Not one time was i scared or completely unsettled to the point of tears or rage. It was an anime with a story I wished to see progress. And in all honesty I wouldn't mind a season 2. Or picking up the manga.Overall, I give this anime an 8. It's a very good anime. Worth watching and enjoying. Pace yourself while you watch it, take time to understand characters and try to look at the anime with an open mind and I'm sure you can enjoy it as well. focus.

Plus there is a good score within the anime during scenes as well. I'm trying in the voice acting here as well. I watched subbed anime and the range of emotion delivered did not disappoint. I give high praise to the staff that worked on this anime with their voice acting. I'm sure they worked very hard to produce the results they did. Overall sound was of a very good standard. It's not the best but it's not the worst either.The characters. Now we get to a crucial point. Story is one thing but it's another if you fail to have characters that cannot bring your story to life. And this one did. I pray that the things that happen here in this anime aren't too common because there were a good list of characters who, in more than one instance, I rooted for their death and suffering. There were characters I felt for that when they died their disappearance was felt. Characters who matured in ways I didn't see coming. I will say one thing though. Each and every teacher in this anime should be fired.I highly enjoyed this anime. I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a dark yet enjoyable anime. It has dark times and light times. It isn't a total gore feast. It's psychological at best,  I wouldn't even call it horror. Not one time was i scared or completely unsettled to the point of tears or rage. It was an anime with a story I wished to see progress. And in all honesty I wouldn't mind a season 2. Or picking up the manga.Overall, I give this anime an 8. It's a very good anime. Worth watching and enjoying. Pace yourself while you watch it, take time to understand characters and try to look at the anime with an open mind and I'm sure you can enjoy it as well."", ""Mahou Shojo Site is not a good magical girl show under any serious context. For any of those going into this show expecting to see Madoka Magica, take this review as your warning. Mahou Shojo Site not only fails as a dark magical girl show, but as a magical girl show in general. Whereas magical girl shows typically try to establish the main character and basic magical systems in the first episode, this show prefers to make up the magical nonsense as it goes along and only establishes that the main character has an overly tragic backstory that gives her no personality to get attached...to. She just seems like this object getting constantly abused by the plot. Her best friend isn't that much better. She indeed has a personality, but that personality only consists of dumping exposition at convenient times and being overall reserved and depressed constantly with no motivation to better herself. Anyone else who's seen generally making the main character's life miserable are psychopaths with seemingly no motivation at all other than causing this girl in particular as much pain as humanly possible. I don't even care enough about Rina to talk about her. Nijimin is this shows one saving grace in terms of characters. She has an adorable idol that completely offsets all of the melancholy teenagers around her. She's upbeat and a nice breath of fresh air in a series that tries to beat moral dilemmas into you every five seconds, despite these dilemmas not being engaging in the slightest. How can they be if the characters experiencing them are thin as paper?  Art is overall very good in this series. I enjoy the different character designs and the show's over all atheistic. I question the directoral choice to have flying CG sperm in the end credits, but I at least have something to laugh at after 24 minutes of suffering. I recruited my boyfriend to sit through episode two with me post ranting to him about episode one, and he suffered just as much as I did whilst yelling at the television, so I think it's safe to say that this is a show you should skip unless you enjoy making fun of bad shows, which luckily, I do. to.

Now don\'t get me wrong, I ain\'t got no issues with those two dude that\'ve mention, for me, just seeing this was a clear indication that of ones conflicting issues upon watching this anime. Ok so Aya\'s sadistic onichan...got what he deserves and we can conclude that he got man raped by that guy cop named Detective Masumi, which to us audience has given Aya some justice after getting a lotta beating from her sadist onichan, we also get so see Yatsumura getting some justice when Sarina missed her target which happens to be her and ends up killing the killer who killed Yatsumura\'s family 10 years ago who, Yatsumura is slowing killer him by means of a method used by them Chinese, which ""Killing by a Thousand Cuts"" OUCH! But seeing Sarina become a mahou shoujo hunter was an injustice , cu\'s she is suppose to be ""DEATH"" WHEN YATSUMURA SLIT HER THROAT!!!!!!!!!!!!Also being the girls ally was another slap to us audience cu\'z were expecting that she get\'s her ass kicked either by Yatsumura or Aya so that way we can say that ""PAYBACK IS A BITCH!"" Cu\'s she is a bitch, also some of those mahou shoujo from the other site don\'t seen to deserve welding a stick like Mikari Izumigamine the girl with a flying broom, whom I think should have been the antagonist or should be death just like what happened Nijimi Aizawa, and Saiyuki Ringa the girl with a cut anything katana, now according to info she got her magical stick before she got kidnapped, and she didn\'t developed any unfortunate feelings after she used her magic stick, so basically that conflicts the policy of them site admins to give her a magical stick since according to their laws the girls who should have a magic stick must have some unfortunate feelings first. Also, let\'s not forget that transgender homo Kiyoharu Suirenji, according to that gay cop Misumi it should be only girls who should posses magical stick, so wtf was original creator Satou Kentarou thinking of adding a fag like Kiyoharu when it would have been better of if that Original Creator just made it an all girls group. On the sound part, I really hated the voiced of them site admins like Nana who sounded like some gay old man, but the end theme was good, also since them administrators were girls according to info, then they should have sounded like girls and not like a bunch of cross dress fags or old matrons, Now how enjoyable was this?????IMAO it was enjoyable especially the post credits were we see Aya\'s sadist oniichan get raped it kinda gives us that feeling of ""How\'ya like being on the receiving end you bastard"" Kinda of thing, so yes it was good t some point but overall all I hate the yuri thing that exist around here. so here are my ratings:Story- Very Good 8: Cu\'z it starts with us empathizing with Aya\'s predicament and seeing his sadistic oniichan getting what he deserves.Art- Decent 6: As in decent enough to only limit the panty service to Nijimi and there were some of those usual swimsuit service with the girls in the beach scene.Sound- Good 7: For the closing theme, but them site admins sounded like a bunch of old homos and matrons.Character- Very Good 8- Cu\'z we empathize with them girls misfortunes, especially with Aya.Enjoyment- Good 7: Though ""Good"" the original creator relies a lot with the character having to suffer such poor predicament that has haunted them.Overall- Good 7: Though ""Good"" the let down was that we\'re given an open ending where it was unknown as to what will happen next to Aya\'s sadistic onichan in the hands of that detective....... got what he deserves and we can conclude that he got man raped by that guy cop named Detective Masumi, which to us audience has given Aya some justice after getting a lotta beating from her sadist onichan, we also get so see Yatsumura getting some justice when Sarina missed her target which happens to be her and ends up killing the killer who killed Yatsumura\'s family 10 years ago who, Yatsumura is slowing killer him by means of a method used by them Chinese, which ""Killing by a Thousand Cuts"" OUCH!

The anime, imo, did the manga little to no justice, and if you're at all interested in this series, I highly recommend reading the manga.The anime changed the series the events occurred in and never fleshed the characters the way it is in the manga. This could be due to the anime trying to adapt an unfinished manga, which deserves more than 12 episodes to be adapted properly, but even then,...I feel that this could have been adapted better.The worst part of this, imo, is the ending. It was just thrown together because the fate of the two characters in question have not been revealed. The anime tried to create a concluding end, and that makes me believe that we will not be getting a season two. Honestly though, I don't even want a season two, because if we did get a season two, it would be an entirely new series since stuff that happened in the anime completely alters the plot and some characters in the manga. If anything, a completely new adaptation is needed.An anime I can liken to this is Akame ga Kiru. The manga was adapted before it was even completed, and because of this, the fate of a handful of characters was completely different. It takes away from the experience after dedicating time to reading the manga, and it was just a huge disappointment.I can only hope that when the manga concludes, we will get a proper adaptation. The characters develop a lot more, and the plot is deeper (in some aspects), and this was all thrown away in this adaptation.I guess I can say that the anime was entertaining enough. The art and animation was good enough for me to not be driven away by it, so I enjoyed that. Something manga readers look forward to is the series you are reading get animated on screen, and that was the elation I felt when seeing the characters come to life with voices and colors.

It must contain awful and terrible events happening to our characters, a dark and troubled past, causing anguish, a bleak setting, and very obvious good and bad characters.This show has it all, and more.The show aims for shock value with no clear narrative to justify its inclusion.  It also deliberately has exaggerated facial expressions with “dark” dialogue to reinforce the dark and edginess. After a certain point, I stopped caring about the setting and characters, I didn’t care whether they lived or died, or...whether they will get their “happy ending” or not. In fact, the show doesn’t have a happy ending, it’s a bleak and inconclusive ending with many questions let unresolved.  In short, Mahou Shoujo Site is an awful, aimless, and agonizing show to watch.STORY:Story Summary: a bunch of poor, unfortunate girls are recruited by a creepy figure, running a sketchy website, to become magical girls, only for them to discover that the website holds a more sinister message + cue lots of anguish, misery, and anger + lots of distorted facial expressions and over-the-top violence = this fucking showMahou Shoujo Site is a dark and edgy show from beginning to end. As soon as you finish Episode 1 and move on to the remaining episodes, you’ll realize the darkness and edginess never fades. As the series progress, does it get more dark and edgy?  That’s debatable.  However, for me, in terms of dark and edgy, I’m finding it really difficult to top anything beyond Episode 1.  In fact, let me breakdown what occurs in Episode 1, so you’ll understand why I believe it’s more dark and edgy than any episode beyond it.Episode 1: Aya Asagiri, our main character, is constantly bullied at school at the hands of Sarina Shizukume and her friends. They write verbally abuse language on her desk, they destroy her books, they beat her in the bathroom, et cetera. What does Aya do, she does nothing, but soak up all the abuse. At home, Aya experiences domestic violence at the hands of Kaname Asagiri, her older brother, whereby he continuously ties her up and beats her.  What does Aya do, she does nothing, but soak up all the abuse. Then, one day Aya’s pet cat is brutally murdered by who else, her school bullies. And, on that same day, the bullies decide to get one of their guy friends and ask him to rape her. Luckily for Aya, she doesn’t get raped. And, again, luckily for her, she had received a magical weapon from the sketchy website, and used it on the random dude and one of Sarina’s friends. In the next scene, they are shown completely decapitated by an oncoming train. Later, Aya becomes friends with Yatsumura, a violent sociopath, who casually slits the throat of Sarina. End of Episode 1.Yep, that all happens in Episode 1, and the remaining episodes will continue to have dark and edgy content, such as the kidnapping and torture of a burglar, the cruel and horrible character backgrounds, every action Kaname Asagiri does, the gory deaths of many characters, and the depressing undertones.  A show that is dark and edgy is fine if there is a meaning and purpose.  However, for Mahou Shoujo Site, there is no real meaning or purpose. In fact, the show seems to bask in all the violence, cruelty, gore, and “mature” themes without restraint, and shoves it in the our faces and expects us to enjoy the content. More importantly, many of the “mature” themes are never addressed in a serious manner and are used as a tool to artificially create sympathetic characters, which to mean is a sign of bad writing.Besides its awful setting, unnecessary “mature” themes, and bad writing, the show is missing tons of content. For example, the early battles with the administrators and the later battle with Nana, the introduction of important characters like Alice Misumi or Hinomoto Makoto, Sarina Shizukume’s realization of the truth, her supposed “death” was suppose to happen soon, and her reasons for revenge, additional background details of many characters, the kiss with Yatsumura, etc.In addition, there are numerous unanswered questions, such as who is that girl that the administrators are talking too, why was Aya’s brother kidnapped and locked away when he could have killed all the magical girls in the resort and finished it, why is the detective working for the administrators and what does he gain from all this, and why is the King the most unfortunate girl in the world?Some additional problems include: the death of Nijimi Anazawa lacked impact even with her backstory told within the episode, the detective appearing out of nowhere to stop Kaname Asagiri was a huge deus ex machina, also Aya having a new power to save Tsuyuno was a really ass-pull, the reshuffling of the fight scenes, and finally the Anime’s ending deviating from the manga.ANIMATIONS:The art is adequate and, sometimes, downright hideous, especially the background art and character designs. The character designs are simple and not very detailed. The characters sometimes look janky and off-model, but it usually occurs to background characters. The background art features many dark colors, such as shades of gray, brown, black, and red, and it maintains these colors throughout the series, constantly reminding the viewers that Aya’s world is filled with terrible people who do terrible things, and that anything she does will only hurt her and her friends. The background objects, such as buildings, furniture, trees, and other landscapes, are plain-looking and unremarkable. There are occasionally some bright screen tones like ‘love bubbies’, ‘love flowers’, or ‘speed stripes’ to emphasize certain emotions and actions that are being performed, but they are short and often fleeting.The animations are decent, especially the excellent live-action ending credits, and, at time, outright hilarious. For example, in episode 2 and 9, Kaname Asagiri displays some of the most distorted and exaggerated facial expressions I’ve ever seen. It was created to be serious, but it was too funny to not laugh. Other characters will also have distorted and exaggerated facial expressions, such as Nijimi Anazawa when she wants to kill someone really badly, or Rina Shioi with her crazy eyes and loud laughing, or everyone else with their heart or blood shot eyes.SOUND:The voice acting is very good with noticeable performances from Nobuhiko Okamoto, who voices Kaname Asagiri, Yuuko Oono, who voices Aya Asagiri, and Himika Akaneya, who voices Tsuyuno Yatsumura. The background music is very hit-or-miss, it sometimes creates the mood and atmosphere of a typical horror show, other times it fails and turns it into a comedy. This mainly happens when the girl beginning to chant “fa la la” attempts to create horror vibes, but turns it into a trivial and ludicrous scene. Basically, that particular background music is cheesy and occasionally distracting.The opening song, “Changing point”,  is sung by Japanese band i☆Ris, and its intro displays many magical girls, including our two main protagonist, set in a gray and dreary world with most of them bleeding from various areas on the body. The ending song, “Zenzen Tomodachi”, is sung by Haruka Yamazaki, and its outro displays live action clips of idols running and dancing, various scenes of our two main protagonist, and hundreds of CG sperm flying through the sky. The opening song is your standard J-Pop, which to me is uninteresting and dull; the intro is also typical for many anime shows, thus making it uninteresting and dull. The ending song is also your standard J-Pop, however its outro was so bizarre and strange that I couldn’t help but be enthralled by it. I mean, watching live action clips of dancing idols with CG sperm flying through the sky? Interesting. Very interesting.CHARACTERS:I’ll be honest, I hated almost every single character in this show from their pathetic excuses/reasons to perform stupid or inhumane actions to their shallow and tragic backstories and finally to their almost nonexistent character developments. Everything about these characters just screams unrealistic, superficial, mentally unstable, and soulless. Still, I want to talk about four characters, specifically our two main characters and the two antagonist characters. Every other character was either lacking depth, irrelevant to the story, or not interesting.Main Characters in this Show:Aya Asagiri is a middle-school student with fair skin, long straight black hair with bangs, and pink eyes. Her stick is a gun that allows the teleportation of people to her last visited location. Upon using her stick's ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood streams from her eyes, her inner eyes become heart-shaped, and her hair turns red. She is very timid, frail, easily frightened, and isolated from her peers; she suffers from depression and has suicidal ideations. She has a warmhearted personality and doesn’t hesitate to protect people even at the risk of her own life, as seen in Episode 5 where she protects Yatsumura and Shizukume from the collapsing building.Now, here’s the problem, the anime was throwing everything it could to turn Aya into the most sympathetic character possible. Shown in Episode 1, Aya was viciously bullied at school, suffered from domestic violence, had her pet cat killed, and almost became a rape victim. The viewers are forced from the very beginning to feel sorry for her and to be angry at the bullies and the older brother for the horrible things they were doing. This is such a cheap tactic to gain sympathy for a character that I can’t believe the creators would put something like this in Episode 1. In fact, I’m sure most people weren’t feeling sympathy for Aya, but rather disturbed and disgusted by the “torture porn” filled first episode that they didn’t even make past the half-way mark. And I don’t blame them. And if you do decide to continue watching, you can expect Aya to cry, whine, and bitch all the way until the final two episodes, where she suddenly grows a backbone. But, for me, it was way too late, and I had already grown tired of her.Tsuyuno Yatsumura is a middle-school student with fair skin and short blonde hair. Her stick is a smartphone that has the power to stop time for herself and for anybody else written on the smartphone. Upon using her stick’s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood drips from her mouth, her inner eyes becomes a crescent moon, and her hair turns orange. Before meeting Aya, she had a stoic personality and a tendency to be sadistic, but now with Aya being her friend she was slowly changing and opening up to people.Tsuyuno has a typical tragic backstory, where she lived an ordinary and fortunate lifestyle, until a burglar murdered her family. She was spared, however the burglar vowed to return and find her when she grew up. And since then, she spend several years living in fear that he'll return. That is, until she discovered the magical site, received her powers, and exacted revenge.Now, I would like to say that Tsuyuno is a fairly interesting and dynamic character with a justified backstory. However, her earlier actions, slitting the throat of Sarina Shizukume, portrays her as a violent sociopath. And her kidnapping and torture of the burglar, only reinforces this notion. Still, her repeated interactions with Aya made her charming, sweet, and caring, and thus one of the better characters in this show.Main Antagonist in this Show:The real antagonists are, of course, the administrators, however the lack of appearances and the numerous questions concerning their existences makes it difficult for me to either like or hate them. Some questions include: who was the first administrator, what are their ‘true’ intentions, what is their method and purpose to using magical girls as administrators, do the administrator remember their former lives, etc. Because of these unanswered questions, I’ve decided to focus on Sarina Shizukume and Kaname Asagiri as I despise both these characters.Sarina Shizukume is a middle-school student with fair skin, red hair with pigtails, visible neck stitches, and red eyes. Her stick is a yo-yo that can cut anything. Upon using her stick’s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood leaks out of her ears, her inner eyes becomes the Greek letter phi, and her hair turns yellow. She has a fierce and violent personality, who exhibits traits like resentfulness, envy, and insincerity.Sarina’s path to becoming a magical girl is marked by deep vengeance and personal hatred against Aya and Tsuyuno. Originally, one of Aya’s bullies, she replaced Shioi Rina as the new Magical Girl Hunter, shortly after getting sliced by Tsuyuno. However, in Episode 10, she suddenly has a change of heart and assists Aya and her friends in defeating the administrators.Now, I’ll state that I dislike Sarina and her bullshit reason to commit vicious bullying, as shown and explained in Episode 4. Her reasons for this bullying are extremely petty and beyond stupid; she bullies Aya because she seen as timid, weak, frail, “unthankful”, and a hinder to the class. I guess she must have thought, “Hmm. If Aya is making class hard for everyone, I’m just going to make her life even harder by bullying the shit out of her. Yeah! And hopefully, she will stop being a hinder to everyone in class.” Wow, solid reasoning! And the strange part is that after becoming a Magical Girl Hunter, she decides to join Aya’s side because she was “pissed” and the administrators were treating humans like animals. (Which is ironic because she treated Aya almost like an animal as well.) Anyway, in the anime, her reasons to join Aya’s side are weak and extremely sudden, unlike in the manga where she had a more justified reason to join Aya’s side.Kaname Asagiri is a tall and handsome high-school student with blue-black hair and glasses. He has used two sticks: Nijimi Anazawa’s panties to mind control people and Sayuki Ringa’s katana to cut and kill Nijimi. Upon using her stick’s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: his inner eyes becomes spades and his hair turns white. He is manipulative, abusive, egocentric, and has ‘god complex’, i.e., feeling a being superior to everyone. He is extremely abusive and violent towards his sister to the extent of physical and psychological torture. He performs these cruel actions in order to expel his hatred of his father, i.e., the father abuses him and has high expectations of him getting into Tokyo University. It’s because of this stress and pressure that he regularly ties up Aya and punches her, and even stating that her only role in life is to be his stress relief.Kaname is one of the worst characters in anime I’ve ever seen. He’s an inhuman bastard that doesn’t care about anybody, but himself. He has killed two people, Keisuke Naoto, Nijimi Anazawa, without remorse and believes they are human scum. He likes being in control, as shown in Episode 8 and 9, and enjoys the suffering of other people. In short, he’s a terrible character with no redeemable qualities what so ever.ENJOYMENT:Mahou Shoujo Site is one of the worse shows I’ve ever watched. We have “dark and edgy” villains who get high off of bullying, torturing, and killing people, and we have a weak and pathetic main character who cries and talks rather than fight. We have an incomplete story with many lingering questions and numerous omitted details and content, revealed only in the manga. It also has many pointless mature themes, such as domestic violence, torture, suicidal ideation, and sexual assault, just for the sake of making it “dark and edgy”.We have cheap and bland background and character designs with decent animations, especially the distorted and exaggerated facial expressions. And finally, we have hilarious background music of a girl chanting “fa la la” trying to create horror vibes, and an interesting live action ending song complete with dancing idols and sperm flying through the sky. There are many additional problems with this show, however the ones that I mentioned are what’s making this show absolutely goddamn awful. My recommendation: avoid this show like the plague and watch something else. Something with more substance and entertainment than this piece of shit. whether they will get their “happy ending” or not. In fact, the show doesn’t have a happy ending, it’s a bleak and inconclusive ending with many questions let unresolved.  In short, Mahou Shoujo Site is an awful, aimless, and agonizing show to watch.STORY:Story Summary: a bunch of poor, unfortunate girls are recruited by a creepy figure, running a sketchy website, to become magical girls, only for them to discover that the website holds a more sinister message + cue lots of anguish, misery, and anger + lots of distorted facial expressions and over-the-top violence = this fucking showMahou Shoujo Site is a dark and edgy show from beginning to end.

For example, the early battles with the administrators and the later battle with Nana, the introduction of important characters like Alice Misumi or Hinomoto Makoto, Sarina Shizukume’s realization of the truth, her supposed “death” was suppose to happen soon, and her reasons for revenge, additional background details of many characters, the kiss with Yatsumura, etc.In addition, there are numerous unanswered questions, such as who is that girl that the administrators are talking too, why was Aya’s brother kidnapped and locked away when he could have killed all the magical girls in the resort and finished it, why is the detective working for the administrators and what does he gain from all this, and why is the King the most unfortunate girl in the world?Some additional problems include: the death of Nijimi Anazawa lacked impact even with her backstory told within the episode, the detective appearing out of nowhere to stop Kaname Asagiri was a huge deus ex machina, also Aya having a new power to save Tsuyuno was a really ass-pull, the reshuffling of the fight scenes, and finally the Anime’s ending deviating from the manga.ANIMATIONS:The art is adequate and, sometimes, downright hideous, especially the background art and character designs. The character designs are simple and not very detailed. The characters sometimes look janky and off-model, but it usually occurs to background characters. The background art features many dark colors, such as shades of gray, brown, black, and red, and it maintains these colors throughout the series, constantly reminding the viewers that Aya’s world is filled with terrible people who do terrible things, and that anything she does will only hurt her and her friends. The background objects, such as buildings, furniture, trees, and other landscapes, are plain-looking and unremarkable. There are occasionally some bright screen tones like ‘love bubbies’, ‘love flowers’, or ‘speed stripes’ to emphasize certain emotions and actions that are being performed, but they are short and often fleeting.The animations are decent, especially the excellent live-action ending credits, and, at time, outright hilarious. For example, in episode 2 and 9, Kaname Asagiri displays some of the most distorted and exaggerated facial expressions I’ve ever seen. It was created to be serious, but it was too funny to not laugh. Other characters will also have distorted and exaggerated facial expressions, such as Nijimi Anazawa when she wants to kill someone really badly, or Rina Shioi with her crazy eyes and loud laughing, or everyone else with their heart or blood shot eyes.SOUND:The voice acting is very good with noticeable performances from Nobuhiko Okamoto, who voices Kaname Asagiri, Yuuko Oono, who voices Aya Asagiri, and Himika Akaneya, who voices Tsuyuno Yatsumura. The background music is very hit-or-miss, it sometimes creates the mood and atmosphere of a typical horror show, other times it fails and turns it into a comedy. This mainly happens when the girl beginning to chant “fa la la” attempts to create horror vibes, but turns it into a trivial and ludicrous scene. Basically, that particular background music is cheesy and occasionally distracting.The opening song, “Changing point”,  is sung by Japanese band i☆Ris, and its intro displays many magical girls, including our two main protagonist, set in a gray and dreary world with most of them bleeding from various areas on the body. The ending song, “Zenzen Tomodachi”, is sung by Haruka Yamazaki, and its outro displays live action clips of idols running and dancing, various scenes of our two main protagonist, and hundreds of CG sperm flying through the sky. The opening song is your standard J-Pop, which to me is uninteresting and dull; the intro is also typical for many anime shows, thus making it uninteresting and dull. The ending song is also your standard J-Pop, however its outro was so bizarre and strange that I couldn’t help but be enthralled by it. I mean, watching live action clips of dancing idols with CG sperm flying through the sky? Interesting. Very interesting.CHARACTERS:I’ll be honest, I hated almost every single character in this show from their pathetic excuses/reasons to perform stupid or inhumane actions to their shallow and tragic backstories and finally to their almost nonexistent character developments. Everything about these characters just screams unrealistic, superficial, mentally unstable, and soulless. Still, I want to talk about four characters, specifically our two main characters and the two antagonist characters. Every other character was either lacking depth, irrelevant to the story, or not interesting.Main Characters in this Show:Aya Asagiri is a middle-school student with fair skin, long straight black hair with bangs, and pink eyes. Her stick is a gun that allows the teleportation of people to her last visited location. Upon using her stick's ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood streams from her eyes, her inner eyes become heart-shaped, and her hair turns red. She is very timid, frail, easily frightened, and isolated from her peers; she suffers from depression and has suicidal ideations. She has a warmhearted personality and doesn’t hesitate to protect people even at the risk of her own life, as seen in Episode 5 where she protects Yatsumura and Shizukume from the collapsing building.Now, here’s the problem, the anime was throwing everything it could to turn Aya into the most sympathetic character possible. Shown in Episode 1, Aya was viciously bullied at school, suffered from domestic violence, had her pet cat killed, and almost became a rape victim. The viewers are forced from the very beginning to feel sorry for her and to be angry at the bullies and the older brother for the horrible things they were doing. This is such a cheap tactic to gain sympathy for a character that I can’t believe the creators would put something like this in Episode 1. In fact, I’m sure most people weren’t feeling sympathy for Aya, but rather disturbed and disgusted by the “torture porn” filled first episode that they didn’t even make past the half-way mark. And I don’t blame them. And if you do decide to continue watching, you can expect Aya to cry, whine, and bitch all the way until the final two episodes, where she suddenly grows a backbone. But, for me, it was way too late, and I had already grown tired of her.Tsuyuno Yatsumura is a middle-school student with fair skin and short blonde hair. Her stick is a smartphone that has the power to stop time for herself and for anybody else written on the smartphone. Upon using her stick’s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood drips from her mouth, her inner eyes becomes a crescent moon, and her hair turns orange. Before meeting Aya, she had a stoic personality and a tendency to be sadistic, but now with Aya being her friend she was slowly changing and opening up to people.Tsuyuno has a typical tragic backstory, where she lived an ordinary and fortunate lifestyle, until a burglar murdered her family. She was spared, however the burglar vowed to return and find her when she grew up. And since then, she spend several years living in fear that he'll return. That is, until she discovered the magical site, received her powers, and exacted revenge.Now, I would like to say that Tsuyuno is a fairly interesting and dynamic character with a justified backstory. However, her earlier actions, slitting the throat of Sarina Shizukume, portrays her as a violent sociopath. And her kidnapping and torture of the burglar, only reinforces this notion. Still, her repeated interactions with Aya made her charming, sweet, and caring, and thus one of the better characters in this show.Main Antagonist in this Show:The real antagonists are, of course, the administrators, however the lack of appearances and the numerous questions concerning their existences makes it difficult for me to either like or hate them. Some questions include: who was the first administrator, what are their ‘true’ intentions, what is their method and purpose to using magical girls as administrators, do the administrator remember their former lives, etc. Because of these unanswered questions, I’ve decided to focus on Sarina Shizukume and Kaname Asagiri as I despise both these characters.Sarina Shizukume is a middle-school student with fair skin, red hair with pigtails, visible neck stitches, and red eyes. Her stick is a yo-yo that can cut anything. Upon using her stick’s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: blood leaks out of her ears, her inner eyes becomes the Greek letter phi, and her hair turns yellow. She has a fierce and violent personality, who exhibits traits like resentfulness, envy, and insincerity.Sarina’s path to becoming a magical girl is marked by deep vengeance and personal hatred against Aya and Tsuyuno. Originally, one of Aya’s bullies, she replaced Shioi Rina as the new Magical Girl Hunter, shortly after getting sliced by Tsuyuno. However, in Episode 10, she suddenly has a change of heart and assists Aya and her friends in defeating the administrators.Now, I’ll state that I dislike Sarina and her bullshit reason to commit vicious bullying, as shown and explained in Episode 4. Her reasons for this bullying are extremely petty and beyond stupid; she bullies Aya because she seen as timid, weak, frail, “unthankful”, and a hinder to the class. I guess she must have thought, “Hmm. If Aya is making class hard for everyone, I’m just going to make her life even harder by bullying the shit out of her. Yeah! And hopefully, she will stop being a hinder to everyone in class.” Wow, solid reasoning! And the strange part is that after becoming a Magical Girl Hunter, she decides to join Aya’s side because she was “pissed” and the administrators were treating humans like animals. (Which is ironic because she treated Aya almost like an animal as well.) Anyway, in the anime, her reasons to join Aya’s side are weak and extremely sudden, unlike in the manga where she had a more justified reason to join Aya’s side.Kaname Asagiri is a tall and handsome high-school student with blue-black hair and glasses. He has used two sticks: Nijimi Anazawa’s panties to mind control people and Sayuki Ringa’s katana to cut and kill Nijimi. Upon using her stick’s ability, many physical changes begin to occur: his inner eyes becomes spades and his hair turns white. He is manipulative, abusive, egocentric, and has ‘god complex’, i.e., feeling a being superior to everyone. He is extremely abusive and violent towards his sister to the extent of physical and psychological torture. He performs these cruel actions in order to expel his hatred of his father, i.e., the father abuses him and has high expectations of him getting into Tokyo University. It’s because of this stress and pressure that he regularly ties up Aya and punches her, and even stating that her only role in life is to be his stress relief.Kaname is one of the worst characters in anime I’ve ever seen. He’s an inhuman bastard that doesn’t care about anybody, but himself. He has killed two people, Keisuke Naoto, Nijimi Anazawa, without remorse and believes they are human scum. He likes being in control, as shown in Episode 8 and 9, and enjoys the suffering of other people. In short, he’s a terrible character with no redeemable qualities what so ever.ENJOYMENT:Mahou Shoujo Site is one of the worse shows I’ve ever watched. We have “dark and edgy” villains who get high off of bullying, torturing, and killing people, and we have a weak and pathetic main character who cries and talks rather than fight. We have an incomplete story with many lingering questions and numerous omitted details and content, revealed only in the manga. It also has many pointless mature themes, such as domestic violence, torture, suicidal ideation, and sexual assault, just for the sake of making it “dark and edgy”.We have cheap and bland background and character designs with decent animations, especially the distorted and exaggerated facial expressions. And finally, we have hilarious background music of a girl chanting “fa la la” trying to create horror vibes, and an interesting live action ending song complete with dancing idols and sperm flying through the sky. There are many additional problems with this show, however the ones that I mentioned are what’s making this show absolutely goddamn awful. My recommendation: avoid this show like the plague and watch something else. Something with more substance and entertainment than this piece of shit."", ""So, firstly, I'll admit this show is far from perfect. I can totally see why some people have given this show as low as a 2 rating overall. MSS is a dark, unfeeling anime that is truly not for everyone.The abuse, torture, etc. of the MC, Aya, is essentially a plot device to drive our sympathy for her. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I do think it could've been made a bit... less dense. In the first ten minutes of EP1, sadness is just fired nonstop, and while I guess you could say that's to represent how, from Aya's perspective, it *is*...nonstop, it still feels like too much at once.The bully characters are written a tad too heartless for my tastes, as they seem to enjoy literally nothing but making her sad. I'm not going to spoil, but the reason why the bully her is just... so dumb. I mean it's so fucking stupid, the first time I saw it I was literally in open-mouthed awe at the unrealistic stupidity of it. The conflicting emotions the show tries to make you feel (making you sympathize with one of the bullies) is completely undermined, at least for me, personally, by the fact that she is so clearly unredeemable.Okay, so, why an 8 out of 10? Simple. I genuinely enjoyed this show. Despite everything, no matter how bad or good this anime may be, I actually liked it. I was curious to see where it went, I think the plot was engaging and well-paced, twists were reasonably built up to, etc. I can't necessarily say I recommend MSS, but if you think you're in the mood, you should give it a shot. Just... make sure you're in a good mental place, first. nonstop, it still feels like too much at once.The bully characters are written a tad too heartless for my tastes, as they seem to enjoy literally nothing but making her sad.

Ever since Mahoiku aired in late 2016, I\'ve been wanting more bad Magical Girl anime, and this anime definitely delivered.Story - 1The story revolves around Aya Asagiri, Despite the fact that she has done nothing wrong, everyone she meets absolutely despises her. She\'s relentlessly bullied by her peers at school, and physically assaulted by her older brother every night. Then out of nowhere, a creepy website grants her a magic stick. Except, like all pseudo-horror magical girl anime, there\'s a catch. A being called the Tempest is preparing...to end the world, and only one magical girl can survive.It\'s extremely cliche, definitely been done better before. There isn\'t much to be said other than it\'s an absolute train-wreck of a plot.Art - 6There\'s nothing wrong with the art. Character designs are okay at best, nothing appalling but nothing breathtaking. The only nitpick I have is with the idol group, Dog Play. All of the members except Nijimi look like boring background characters. They all have brown hair, no effort at all was put into their designs. It\'d be passable if they all just had colourful hair like Nijimi does, but it seems they didn\'t care enough about them to do that.Sound - 5None of the music is memorable at all. I come back every week having forgotten what the background music even sounded like. The sound effects are adequate.Character - 1The characters are terrible. Seriously, I could rant about them for hours. I\'ll provide a brief summary of my feelings for each major character that has been introduced so far.Aya Asagiri - Boring damsel in distress type character who everyone treats like trash for no reason other than to give her a sad backstory.Tsuyuno Yatsumura - The stereotypical ""mentor"" character. Most magical girl anime has one of these characters. Her backstory is just about some guy who murdered her family for no reason at all.Kaname Asagiri - That one guy every female character is falling over for. His parents have unrealistic expectations of him, so he beats up his sister to let off his stress. Disproportionate? You bet. He seems to only exist to create conflict.Rina Shioi - Also probably only exists to create conflict. She goes around murdering other magical girls to steal their sticks, just to almost get herself killed because of it.Sarina Shizukume - One of the most unlikable characters in the series, and that says a lot seeing as they\'re all unlikable as hell. She doesn\'t have an ounce of empathy within her, and the majority of her dialogue is just her not listening to the other person and forcing the blame of all her problems over to Aya. I mean, yeah, her friend was killed. Absolutely tragic. This must justify how unlikable she is, am I right?!Nijimi Anazawa - Actually off the rails at this point. She will stop at nothing to kill the person who killed her friend, she\'ll even go after her own friends without a second thought. Her complete 180 would have been surprising if it weren\'t for the fact that literally every character does it too.Kosame Amagai - An emo girl with the edgiest power ever. She\'s the reason why I lost all faith I previously had in this show\'s ability to tell a compelling story. She\'s literally just a plot device created to make things convenient, she\'s also an annoying edgelord.Enjoyment - 7The only reason why I\'m enjoying this show is because I love laughing at terrible magical girl anime. If I didn\'t, I\'d have dropped this show after the first episode.Overall - 2If you want to spend your night laughing at a terrible show with terrible characters, then this is for you. However, if you\'re going in looking for a compelling story, you\'ve got another thing coming.

This anime should only be watched when there\'s absolutely nothing else you can watch.', ""This show touches on many controversial themes such as rape, domestic violence, suicide and extreme bullying (in the first episode). The first episode is where you see a cluster bomb of edgy concepts, which the main character Aya Asagiri is suffering from. I thought that the series was going to make a unique twist to the already famed Madoka Magica that was a magical girl series that had a great psychological and realistic perspective to the genre that made it unique to begin with. But it seems that Magical Girl Site copies those ideas made by Madoka and makes it worse. I dont know if...it's the edginess or the bad written main character that made it go under for me. Though, I am still watching this, because it's so bad that it makes me laugh (not to offend fans).So, if you are interested in this series, I would suggest the manga instead of this show, as the manga has a better pacing than the show. The core concepts are still in the manga, but the composition of the story is better.This show did not cut it for me after 6 episodes, but it had great potential with its concepts that could have explored more of the magical girl genre. But with many shows, it was executed poorly because of the bad pacing and writing.Overall: 3/10 it's the edginess or the bad written main character that made it go under for me.

What is edgy? Everybody might describe it differently, but to sum up it is an anime that showcases easy ""jumpshocks"" or shocking situations in order to make it look deep, but not really succeding at all.Do I consider this anime edgy? Well, not really and I\'m going to explain why:The story itself doesn\'t go any further than other ""dark"" mahou shoujos such as madoka magica: magic girls finding out that being a magic girl...is not really that nice and sweet. It\'s not really something inovating by this point so the story is nothing new for the ones- like me, who have certain interest in this kind of animes. Being this said, what I consider that stands out the most is the humanity of the characters.Aya Asagiri seems like an abused, moe girl with depression who doesn\'t seem to have any reason to live yet she doesn\'t commit suicide for some reason or another. Some people critized this saying it seems ""fake"" or ""unlikely"" since our main character looks like it\'s made to suffer. As a person who suffers depression myself, I consider that this is actually really relatable; I haven\'t been abused nor got through the horrible things that Asagiri has been through, but I know her suffering and how depression can consume your life yet you\'re not able to kill yourself. Why? You can not even explain why, I guess we just try to go along and get used to or hang on to any little hope there is left. You think about suicide but you just CAN\'T commit it. Been there, so I find this feelings or behaviour actually really realistic to what some of us may have experienced.Another thing that caught my attention was the reaction Asagiri had when she realized she killed 2 of her abusers. Eventhough they were going to rape her, just the thought of having killed somebody and the guilt that might come to her if somebody finds out drives her crazy.If there is something that I have always found weird, is the way that magic girls tend to react to death in this kind of animes. When they kill the villain or the villains, although they may have some moment of hesitation, they seem to randomly accept it and take it as natural, as if killing was something that can have an excuse. I can\'t pretend reality on a very fantasy kind of anime, but those reactions seemed very odd to me.In Mahou Shoujo Site I have found that the reaction to death seems very rational and human-like. Let\'s be real, if you killed somebody, eventhough that person did something really wrong, wouldn\'t you feel guilty af? Would you even consider that what you did has an excuse and that nobody is going to judge you not even yourself? I don\'t think so. The reaction Aya has is the same that any of us would have if this happens in real life, we would feel guilty because we killed somebody and more if we didn\'t mean it. This behaviour around Aya\'s powers goes along the anime, with Asagiri finding it difficult to assume that it wasn\'t her fault and that she\'s not a killer until she evolves into a more deep and fierceful person. I consider this attitude more reasonable than just taking death as it was nothing.So yeah, Mahou Shoujo Site might not be the most inovating and original anime of the season and has a lot of triggers in it that seem to have no reason at all, but I think they did a pretty good job with the character development. They humanized the characters, making them seem more human and relatable. I don\'t see edgyness at all. is not really that nice and sweet.

Yes there are some points in the story that aren't that good i'll admit that but while some points...aren't good others are, i love anime like that. aren't good others are, i love anime like that."", ""The first couple of episodes are a great depiction of the human psyche... and the greatness ends thereThe one interesting element this series had quickly gets drowned out by an over the top plot, eccessive amount of new characters with zero time to develope them, changes of heart which make absolutely no sense with little to no credibility, nonsensical powerups, and even more characetrs which pop out of nowhere in random episodes seemingly with some importance to the plot only to then be completely forgotten, all neatly wrapped up in one of the most lackluster endings of all timeI'd only ever recommend this series if...you want to watch it for a laugh, 'cause it does have one of the most hilarious magical items in the universeOther than that it's just wasted potential you want to watch it for a laugh, 'cause it does have one of the most hilarious magical items in the universeOther than that it's just wasted potential"", 'I’m so pissed off. Not just because I felt like I wasted my time with this show, but also because this had all the right ingredients to be a great experience. Mahou Shoujo Site might seem like yet another Madoka clone, but this one combines elements of shows like Mirai Nikki to try and have a more unique spin on the genre. Although it started off extremely compelling and interesting, the show eventually got boring and frustrating to watch, although the ending was not as bad as it could have been.Not everything was bad, though, even near the end of the show. The visuals, while...initially appearing strange and even dated, are not all that bad. The music, while unmemorable and sometimes shamelessly taking cues from Madoka Magica, also suited the scenes well. The animation was pretty good and the character designs were a little unique. The base premise of pitting magical girls against each other in a Mirai Nikki-like competition based on the rules from some mysterious website is also not the worst, and introducing ideas such as the end of the world, while unoriginal, do make the stakes higher.What makes me angriest are the numerous places this show fucked up and lost all of the potential it had to be a great show from the first episode. One of these areas is character development, which is unfortunately very botched. Right from the first episode, we are immediately attached to the main character Aya Asagiri and want to see her at least get one over the people that are bullying her, if not just get revenge on them. However, this show manages to take a character that was initially likeable, pitiable, and (for some unfortunate people) relatable and turn her into a non-compelling dumbass who pisses you off every time she’s on screen. Why? Why does this show insist on making her an unrealistically nice dumbass rather than someone who grows with her experiences? Aya experiences hell every day, yet still has sympathy for the people that cause that hell? At least instead of killing them once she gains her powers, she should be less hesitant about defying them. But when any sort of character development—mainly regarding her strength as a magical girl and attitude—finally comes for her, it is too little too late.Unfortunately, the “just make her a complete dumbass or way too weak” problem with this show doesn’t stop with Aya. Nearly every one of the good guys falls victim to this issue, especially during a certain scene. Even magical girls that are supposed to be more intelligent such as Tsuyuno Yatsumura, Kosame Amagai, Kiyoharu Suirenji, and others are purposely dumbed down whenever it is convenient for the story, which usually seems to be to make a villain feel more smart or threatening than they really are. Imagine one person going up against multiple, but instead of any actual fighting, the one person manages to incapacitate all of them and just have fun being an asshole until some deus ex machina saves the day. There was nothing smart about how he got the upper hand; everyone else was just unrealistically dumb. It felt like I was watching a male power fantasy. Why was all of this caused? Because Aya STILL does not want to have the people that have abused her harmed or killed even later in the series! It is frustrating for all of the wrong reasons.Aside from characterization gripes, there are also rules of the universe that seem to be wildly inconsistent, although this is a little more of a minor gripe. Case in point, the [MINOR SPOILER START] rule that magical girls can only use their powers so much in a limited time and that in general every time they use their powers their lifespans decrease. [MINOR SPOILER END] For some reason, this rule only seems to apply for the heroes and never for the villains. Why can a villain use their ability numerous times in the span of a few seconds with virtually no consequences while Aya or Tsuyuno cough up blood or collapse after using their powers no more than ten times? It just makes it feel like the villains are not actually outplaying our heroes, but rather just cheating because of bad writing.However, by the ending, it felt like the writer was listening to my thoughts as my criticisms regarding how unrealistically dumbed down the characters were basically vanished into what I thought was an excellent fight sequence. The rules for how often magical girls can use their powers were still inconsistent, but this time in worked in favor of the heroes, so I guess it balances out? Not really, but whatever. At the very least the show didn’t end on a sour note.All in all, Mahou Shoujo Site has a pretty good premise but is unfortunately weighed down by being wildly inconsistent in a lot of things and being unable to make some villains threatening without making the protagonists incompetent. Despite what may have seemed like nothing but criticism and contempt for this show, I did actually enjoy it. Even though it was incredibly edgy at the start, I actually wished that they would embrace that more. The story line was also interesting enough to keep me watching at the very least. As much as I would like to recommend this, those middle episodes destroyed my faith in this show so thoroughly that I don’t think you’d be able to come out of those without feeling immensely disappointed. You might be better off with the manga for this one. initially appearing strange and even dated, are not all that bad. The music, while unmemorable and sometimes shamelessly taking cues from Madoka Magica, also suited the scenes well. The animation was pretty good and the character designs were a little unique. The base premise of pitting magical girls against each other in a Mirai Nikki-like competition based on the rules from some mysterious website is also not the worst, and introducing ideas such as the end of the world, while unoriginal, do make the stakes higher.What makes me angriest are the numerous places this show fucked up and lost all of the potential it had to be a great show from the first episode. One of these areas is character development, which is unfortunately very botched. Right from the first episode, we are immediately attached to the main character Aya Asagiri and want to see her at least get one over the people that are bullying her, if not just get revenge on them. However, this show manages to take a character that was initially likeable, pitiable, and (for some unfortunate people) relatable and turn her into a non-compelling dumbass who pisses you off every time she’s on screen. Why? Why does this show insist on making her an unrealistically nice dumbass rather than someone who grows with her experiences? Aya experiences hell every day, yet still has sympathy for the people that cause that hell? At least instead of killing them once she gains her powers, she should be less hesitant about defying them. But when any sort of character development—mainly regarding her strength as a magical girl and attitude—finally comes for her, it is too little too late.Unfortunately, the “just make her a complete dumbass or way too weak” problem with this show doesn’t stop with Aya. Nearly every one of the good guys falls victim to this issue, especially during a certain scene.

Or not, I\'m not sure.The story instantly hooked me on in ep 1, the uhm... edgy feel (?) gave me chills that made me wana watch more of it. But the more the story progressed just had me dying, it was very, very, typical.Art? I\'m not sure if I\'m happy about it either. I\'m not the type of guy who likes going into the juiciest bit of very uncommon data, but I\'m guessing this wasn\'t made with the best of the best staff either. It was...typical, I guess. maybe?Sound? I very much like both intro and outro, it\'s not *catchy* but its the type of opening that sounds good and you just cant skip it, just because the song is good.Character... I am honestly disappointed, not because of personalities but how much of a big hypocrite everyone is, I do enjoy the Yatsumura x Asagiri ship, but everything is literal trash. I am scratching my head why no one hasn\'t killed anyone when they so much hate the other. They got over everything so quick like: ""Hey girl, im sorry i tried to break ur neck and nearly kill u, i still dont like u tho haha but wana hang out on the beach?"" ""Oh okay sure girl, i hate you as well but why not as well have some f u n at the beach""I like beach episodes, but when its very forced into a show that doesnt fit its theme? Not sure about it, tho there were shows that werent the happy tag and managed to pull off a beach episode like Another, which i totally enjoyed, it really is weird when just the other episode they were trying to kill each other.Enjoyment? mm... sure... i enjoyed, i guess. maybe.Overall 7/10, i dont know. im not a huge fan of the show and i most probably will not ever in my lifetime touch the manga. I guess its worth the watch if you really have nothing else to watch, or just want to clear ur damn watchlist.

do you feel bad yet? do you feel bad for her? she\'s so pitiful and sad! look, she\'s crying! she\'s hurt! do you feel bad yet? do you feel  for her?"" which is the first and one of the most glaring, lazy ways that this anime tries to go about getting you to care for its characters. i\'ll avoid spoilers by detailing other ways this anime tries to go about its characters, but if you enjoy a show treating its audience as though they have a brain, you won\'t enjoy anything about this anime.there are some people will say that none of this matters, because the anime isn\'t trying to be serious. i disagree. this anime spews a lot about misfortune, suffering, friendship, and even love - with this alongside the touching character moments, i believe this anime is completely taking almost everything seriously (aside from its obviously comedic moments). if you can get through this believing that it\'s just some silly show, then, like... power to you, though.if you like madoka magica for its deconstruction of the magical girl genre, its characters, and the way it portrays despair and hope, then don\'t watch this anime. if you\'re on the other side of the spectrum and enjoy watching bad anime, then... also don\'t bother with this one, or if you\'re really curious, watch it with friends, because when i wasn\'t busy laughing with friends about the appalling writing choices, site was dead boring.you\'ll probably only like this show if you don\'t care for plot, don\'t care for characters, and if you\'re someone that likes to call themselves an edgelord that enjoys the relentless onscreen abuse of young female characters, in which case... power to you, i guess?tldr; if anyone recommends this anime to you believing it to be a masterpiece because girls die and get hurt just like in madoka, they were lying. go watch something else. misunderstand what made madoka good in the first place. to each their own, and i\'m sure there\'s a lot of edgelords in this world that will think site is a good piece of media for its lazy and pointless abuse of its underdeveloped, unsatisfying characters, and that\'s fine, i guess. but if you\'re someone that enjoys madoka, or even just something with a good plot and characters then, like. don\'t even bother with this one. seriously.the art style is fine, i think. the music is also fine. but any entertainment i got out of site is solely from the fact that i watched this with friends knowing that it was a horrible excuse for a deconstruction of the magical girl genre (and i think that calling it even that is too high of a praise).because welcome to magical girl site, where if the girls aren\'t being tortured or abused, they\'re torturing someone else, probably. for what it\'s worth, there\'s breaths of fresh air away from the \'edge\', but they\'re always filled with extremely boring melodrama or moments that might have been touching if i didn\'t find the characters sharing these moments to be dull as well. even though magical girl raising project also shares site\'s problems of having shock value and death mean nothing to the characters or story\'s development, at the very least, it was entertaining. site is just. boring.from the very beginning, our protagonist is hit back-to-back with horrible things in a horrible world, and instead of developing her, it just felt as though the show was squawking at me; ""do you feel bad?

To respect the top review of this show here on MAL and its honorable reviewer, I will try to avoid the word ""edgy"" in my descriptions and comments here. This anime is comically over-the-top almost all the time, and don\'t expect any decent pay-offs in the plot or character development. Telling from the mangaka\'s works (Magical Girl of the End in 2012 and this one), he probably got his brain fried permanently after watching Madoka Magicka, and developed...a condition that drove him to compulsively trying to outdo Madoka in all the wrong departments. Many scenes in MG Site gave the impression that the mangaka was writing this story in the height of a psychosis episode when he needed proper treatment he just said ""fudge it"" and instead took a bunch of LSD.Baseline quality: 4.5/10. Look, I won\'t pretend that it\'s the worst anime ever made. There are some merits and qualities to the show. However, I also cannot pretend it\'s worth something more than 5/10.Recommended to: ""sick effs who just want to get off messed-up stuff"" according to the top review here. People who get ironically entertained on a meta level by The Room. People who want to watch some real bad anime in order to lower their MAL mean score.Pros and Cons: (Minor Spoilers)+ Pretty solid art and interesting character design (save for a few broken frames). Almost every character is distinguishable (which is a quality many better shows cannot claim to possess). I feel bad for the animators as they deserve a much better story for their efforts.+ Dramatic OST and songs work more often than not.+ A few decent battle sequences and a mildly interesting climax.+ Unintentionally comedic in some instances. (one pivotal scene with the MC\'s evil brother, for example).- I went in with expectation of about 6/10 (in the spirit of finding a few grams of gold nuggets in a mountain of manure) but still got more cringes than I asked for. An example is a girl\'s funeral which took half an episode with the main characters crying nonstop...despite the fact that they never knew that girl that well.- Too morbid for any believability. The population in the world of MG Site is made up with about 90% psychopaths, sadists, yanderes or other over-the-top degenerates. Everyone has skeletons in their closet, but in this world almost everyone is just batshit crazy. This story may as well be set in the Arkham Asylum, seriously.- Took the worst from Madoka, Mirai Nikki among other ""dark anime"" and multiplied them by 10. You want some type of malicious cosmic force like Kyuubey? Well how about 100 of them, all sounding, looking and acting dramatically demonic all the time? You want some cruel battle royale with super powers? Well, how about 10 Yuno Gasai but in different hair colors? You want a tragic main character? Well how about having literally everyone in her life be a sadistic degenerate, adding all the tragic traits from all sad stories on a calculator? You get the idea.- Predictable. As a mystery thriller set in an expanding fantasy world, the main arc follows the Madoka formula pretty closely. When you expect the show to somehow hit you with a ""theater of the absurd"" curveball in pivotal moments, it more often than not hit you with the same old pitchfork. Take the ""friendship""/Yuri love between Aya and Tsuyuno for example, when you think the show was genuinely making their bond somewhat more believable and relatable than Madoka and Homura, the show just threw this relationship into a microwave and turned the power to maximum.- The 12-episode anime is an adaptation of the first 50 or so chapters from the manga, as if they were really expecting it to be the next phenomenal hit that lasts years with multiple seasons. Well too bad there won\'t ever be a 2nd season, as it seems.Extra thoughts: (More spoilers)Writing reviews is more revealing about ourselves than it is for the objects we review, sometimes. In that regard, I am actually thankful for MG Site the anime, for it helped me articulating something I disliked about Madoka Magicka in the first place. You see, when a writer designs a story around a fundamentally hopeless cosmology, all the narratives of hope and love the writer tries to bring out also becomes extra artificial and manipulative in nature. That is why as poignant as the girls\' rebellion was in the show, or as commendable as Aya\'s declaration of hope is at the end of the show, the thematic integrity of MG Site simply does not work. As gleefully morbid as the mangaka\'s writing usually feels, I think there are still serious themes he tried to convey. This core problem as I mentioned is not as apparent in Madoka, but just think about it. a condition that drove him to compulsively trying to outdo Madoka in all the wrong departments.

Same animation in Kakegurui.  Its not boring and I am really excited what will happen in Episode 6 until the end. I find this anime interesting (Omoshiroi).Well that's my opinion, I do respect other's opinion and review for this animebut as for me I love anime and this adds to my collection of the Greatest Anime That I Haved Watched.Peace Yo!!"", 'While I understand criticism of this show, I feel like a lot of this sentiment is coming from either bandwagoning or a misunderstanding.While I haven\'t seen Madoka Magica, I do understand that Mahou Shoujo Site does not live up to Madoka.

It is about miserable girls that are turned into magical girls by being given magical 'sticks' gotten from a website called Mahou Shoujo Site.The show starts by showing our main protagonist being bullied and abused 24/7. I feel like all of these scenes are supposed to make you feel bad and sympathize with our protagonist, Aya Asagiri. But what it really did is making it painful to watch. Fortunately, it is only like this in the beginning.All those misfortune made her...get a magical stick after stumbling to Mahou Shoujo Site. After first using her magical stick, she encountered another magical girl, Tsuyuno Yatsumura. Together, they form some kind of bond, while fighting off the problems that is hidden in the Mahou Shoujo Site. Along the way, they will meet some other magical girls, some become the focus of future episodes.The theme in this anime is usually some kind of dark psychological atmosphere. Occasionally, there is some moments they tried to make it heart-warming when the characters remind themselves of their bonds. But if course, it fails to make you feel those dark atmosphere or sympathize with the characters because of how utterly ridiculous the scene is. Some scenes are absolutely ridiculous that you will be unable to watch this seriously and just start laughing.The characters are made super unrealistic and are in no way relatable. Our main character just tolerates all the abuse that she gets. Her brother (the one that abused Aya) is someone who looks down on litterally everyone but himself.\xa0 There is also Nijimi Asazawa, who is an idol at surface but actually just wants to kill someone horribly underneath. Some characters also went through drastic changes with only little time (sudden development), they are hostile towards the protagonist at first, but easily changes sides to helping her. All these characters are made very messed up, it might not necessarily be bad if you like watching extremely messed up characters.Art and music are not impressive either. The anime's ending is also one of the weirdest one i have seen. It is live action dancing with flying sperms in the sky. I think it is supposed to have some kind of connection to the story, but i can't help thinking how weird it is.Taking everything into account, while the premise is quite unique or weird, this anime is just a horrible mess of gimmicks including, but not limited to, magical girls, psychological problems (abuse, murdered relatives, etc), and psycho genius brother. It fails to make us care about the characters, even when we are given half-episode-long backstory. But can it be entertaining? Yes.

Hopefully they will mention those in the manga.All in all, I really do enjoy the story, it has its moments and there are times I...chuckled in some of the cringe scenes, especially that last episode.

Many of the characters have crazy personalities that are played for gags: one of the characters has anger issues (It seems more like a mix of manic depression and PTSD, but the show calls it anger issues...so I’ll call it anger issues) which are played off as a major plot point.  Also, let me just add that, arguably, the most psychotic character in the show is voiced by the voice actress for Love Live Sunshine’s Mari Ohara: if you, like me, have not only watched Love Live Sunshine but play School Idol Festival, you will swear you hear “it’s joke” when her voice appears in the show.  Enough with side tracking, Mahou Shoujo Site condenses a fair chunk of manga into twelve episodes, so the show ends up feeling a bit rushed, and the characters suffer for it: to make sure they end up at a certain point in the manga, the show steamrolls past character and plot development leaving characters as empty husks and the last few episodes making no sense contextually.  I had a big problem with the ending; that doesn’t necessarily mean everyone will.  I say, if the concept of this anime interests you and manga isn’t your thing, go ahead and give this anime a go.

I want to write this review as a way to say to the people defending this show that intentional edge does not eliminate shoddy pacing, unbearable characters, and a poorly written and plot-hole infested story.The characters are your typical anime girls bumped up to the edge level of 10. The main girl is a passive, frail, and hopeless protagonist who can't find her backbone even when push comes to shove. As desperate and depressing as...her situation is at school and home, I don't care for her because she feels like a character written to be in this situation but not an actual person who would react realistically to these situations.I don't want to make this review long, but I will conclude with this. This show is probably one of the worst shows I have ever watched. I have never had to physically force myself to continue watching a show I thought was terrible. I just wanted to finish it and say that I finished it so I could give it the score it truly deserved. I couldn't do it. I made it to episode 6, and that was it; I tapped out. It was insufferable. I felt like I was in a car without working breaks, and the only way I could stop it was by opening the side doors and putting my bare feet against the asphalt to slow it down.Some people are arguing that it's intentionally meant to suck for the sake of sucking.

It\'s hella WEIRD, I can tell you that! My feelings about the show changed from love to hate and back CONSTANTLY, so I can\'t even give you a consensus with this one. The first episode I found objectively bad, bordering on torture porn. It\'s a rough sit as you watch literally every terrible thing happen to this poor girl, from being viciously bullied at school, to being used as a punching bag by...her brother, to having her cat murdered, you get the picture. All this to establish that girls who are beset by misfortune are the ones qualified to access the website and become magical girls? You could\'ve just shown *one* of those scenes and it would\'ve had the same effect!

One of my favorite moments is when heroine Aya uses her teleportation gun to ""catch"" the villain\'s razor yo-yo, create a portal behind her, and fire it right back at her. At a certain point the magical girls all team up to fight the website admins, and that\'s when the show REALLY goes off the rails! The admins are so bizarre looking, unlike anything I\'ve ever seen, and their fight scenes are DBZ-levels of epicness. The show is too ""edgy"" for its own good, like when we introduce the magical girl whose power is activated by cutting her wrists with her ""magical knife"" (OK, come on, really?), or the various girls who bleed from the eyes when they use their power. It also copies Madoka Magica in several ways. I just don\'t know with this one. Approach at your own risk!The numbers I picked for story, art, enjoyment, etc. are all arbitrary, as I constantly changed my mind on whether I liked or hated it. I\'m sorry to be so vague but this is one of those shows you just have to see for yourself.

The very first episode was amazing at getting the audience invested into the main character\'s plight, albeit in a cruel and hard to watch way. Intense bullying, suicide, self harm, domestic abuse and rape all make their way into just one episode. I respected how serious her circumstances were and how unapologetic the show was about displaying them. It set a nice tone for the rest of the series based off mere minutes which made me genuinely excited to see how far they could push these dark themes. Unfortunately it all falls apart from episode...2 and onwards. Besides the main 2 characters Asagiri and Yatsumura, the show introduces a whole host of both unlikeable or completely useless characters. They add very little to the world building or narrative at hand and take away a huge amount interest whenever they appear in a scene. As time went on, I felt more obligated than curious to see the series through to the end which is never a good sign. Subplots and character motivations were just all over the place making it difficult to follow what exactly was more important and interesting. Thankfully this anime is only 12 episodes making it a somewhat quick watch. Some redeeming qualities would be some of the character designs and ""transformations"" when the magical girls use their powers. They have a nice subtle change in hair and eye color giving them a somewhat menacing look. It works with the mood the show is trying to portray and honestly just looks plain cool. I found the opening pleasing to watch and listen to as well, nothing too fancy or innovative but enjoyable nonetheless. All in all, an anime with a promising start but shortcoming in subsequent episodes. I wouldn\'t recommend this anime unless you\'re extremely bored or love to watch anime that try to explore darker subject matter. 2 and onwards.

However, I really love this series. Is it super edgy? Of course. But is it a bit of a refreshing break from the same ""kawaii""/""moe"", sparkly, and girly magical girl shows that we usually get? Yes. It\'s not a masterpiece, and it definitely will never top the genius that is Madoka Magica, but it is still very much worth watching for those who like shows that defy the stereotypes expected to be followed in this genre.I have work soon, so I\'ll make my...review as brief as possible and without ANY spoilers. :)~ STORY ~ 8/10Pretty straightforward, with very sudden and unexpected plot twists throughout. Some people complain that Aya\'s ""misfortune"" is ""unrealistic"" alongside the ""misfortunes"" of others, but I see it to be possible, just not common. I really enjoy all of their motives and how they work against or team up with one another.~ ART ~ 8/10Not awful, but not gorgeous. We can\'t expect an anime series to have the same quality as, say, a movie (even Demon Slayer\'s animation in Mugen Train is far superior to the anime in the anime). I still love the art style though. Aya\'s design, alongside Kosame\'s, are two of the character designs that I love the most. I also love how the characters look when they\'ve transformed into their ""magical girl"" forms.~ SOUND ~ 7/10The music is pretty, but it repeats a LOT. I\'d say the soundtrack is roughly 10-15 songs. Not as much as Madoka Magica, but around the amount as Dragon Maid. The songs are placed nicely though. One of the beginning scenes with the cat nearly brought me to tears. The composer definitely knew what he/she was doing.~ CHARACTER ~ 9/10I just love all of the characters in this series. Do I love some more than the others (*cough* *cough* Mikari *cough*)? Yes, of course I do. I still value the presence of all of them though. They all contribute something to the story which is very valuable.~ ENJOYMENT ~ 9/10Not much to say that hasn\'t been said before. I love the darkness of this series. I\'m always on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen in the next minute. The show never fails to bore me. Every scene has a reason to exist, even the ones that don\'t involve Aya. They all bring something to the table, from motives to plotlines that will be addressed later on.~ OVERALL ~ 9/10While I\'m not done with the show yet, I still love how it\'s going so far. I hope the show doesn\'t pull a \'Darling in the FranXX\' and completely ruin everything the last couple of episodes. Sorry to all of my FranXX fans out there.I\'ll be sure to update this once I\'m done with the series... If it\'s not updated, then my stance of the series remains the same. I appreciate the existence of the series, and I pray that we can get a second season one day despite the show\'s overwhelmingly negative reputation. It\'s not every day we get a magical girl show quite as brutal as this one.Time to get ready for work. Sadly. I\'ll watch more of the show when I get home if I don\'t pass out.

I\'m always on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen in the next minute. The show never fails to bore me. Every scene has a reason to exist, even the ones that don\'t involve Aya. They all bring something to the table, from motives to plotlines that will be addressed later on.~ OVERALL ~ 9/10While I\'m not done with the show yet, I still love how it\'s going so far. I hope the show doesn\'t pull a \'Darling in the FranXX\' and completely ruin everything the last couple of episodes. Sorry to all of my FranXX fans out there.I\'ll be sure to update this once I\'m done with the series... If it\'s not updated, then my stance of the series remains the same. I appreciate the existence of the series, and I pray that we can get a second season one day despite the show\'s overwhelmingly negative reputation. It\'s not every day we get a magical girl show quite as brutal as this one.Time to get ready for work. Sadly. I\'ll watch more of the show when I get home if I don\'t pass out. (lol)Cheers!', ""Oh my gosh hold on there or you might hurt yourself with all the edge.This Dark magical girl anime is honestly just a bunch of filler still trying to be like Madoka without any of the smart symbolism or set up. Everybody (besides the main girl who is so pure she wouldn't hurt a fly) is horrible! Everything that happens is just a big mess of whatever horrible thing you could think ofAlso the writer or whatever missed the whole part of what makes a magical girl story is getting us to care about the character before everything turns south. Honestly there is nothing smart...or inventive about the anime and it does it in the plainest way possible.I don't think I would be that upset if it didn't feel like the show was to dileratly trying to manipulate the view by throwing whatever graphic imagery they could through (good writes and shows can do this without is being to obvious or pandering)Also the lighting in the of the scenes are so dark I could barely tell what was happening. or inventive about the anime and it does it in the plainest way possible.I don't think I would be that upset if it didn't feel like the show was to dileratly trying to manipulate the view by throwing whatever graphic imagery they could through (good writes and shows can do this without is being to obvious or pandering)Also the lighting in the of the scenes are so dark I could barely tell what was happening."", 'Fukou-dan ni.....FUKOU DAN NIMahou Shoujo Site showed itself quite early (as in the first episode) as one of the edgiest animes for the Spring 2018 and tried to mix up the formula of the ""dark magical girl"" genre.......with interesting yet ""despairing"" results.Mahou Shoujo Site revolves around Aya Asagiri voiced by Yuuko Oono an unfortunate middle school girl who has her life in absolute despair, from the constant EXTREME amount of bullying in class to the constant physical abuse by her brother at home, her life is absolute despair until she finds a website for her to turn into a magical girl.Mahou Shoujo Site takes the...""extreme"" edginess to another level, as most of the abuse Aya goes through not to mention Mahou Shoujo Site\'s uncensored and unbashed nature of showing violence, rape, physical and mental abuse and fan dis/service is what Mahou Shoujo Site is KNOWN for thus easily gained ""the edgiest anime of Spring 2018"" and yes, LA felt the same way for the first couple of episodes just seeing aya going through all this and pretty much showing Mahou Shoujo Site\'s world as nothing but an asshole.Oddly enough it got morbidly interesting when the true intent of the ""site"" and the ""admins"" of the site itself came into light which goes into the typical ""end of the world"" scenario, newer and older characters coming into the mix to stop the ""Tempest"" the site admins are trying to enact along with some in-fighting between the magical girls, mainly Nijimi vs. Rina, Sarina vs. Aya & Tsuyuno somewhat made the despairingly atmosphere ""interesting"" to say it lightly at the very least.Yes, most of the characters outside of Aya and Tsuyuno are just awful people but some of them become allies, some are villains after Aya and Tsuyuno and even Tsuyuno herself isn\'t the pure of characters either. Really what LA is saying is because of the nature of Mahou Shoujo Site, most of the characters are awful, terrible people, blood hungry with no dignity whatsoever or straight up mentally homicidal, this statement can easily be said about Nijimi of all people as they ""try"" to be sentimental but it failed for LA went it tried and she kinda deserved her own stupidity by the end of it. Nonetheless the only light to the darkness of Mahou Shoujo Site and the anime is mostly focused on Aya\'s despair and how she got out of it with the help from Tsuyuno. LA\'s favourite character weirdly enough wasn\'t Aya however as LA liked Rina Shioi voiced by Aina Suzuki, the ""Mahou Shoujo Hunter"" and ""it\'s NO JOKE"" that she livened things up and was the start to the craziness of Mahou Shoujo Site, on the other side of things, LA quite easily deems Kaname Asagiri (Aya\'s older brother) voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto as the WORST character of Spring 2018 because of what he did before and after the end of the series and his fate at the end of the series was an ironic fate that LA didn\'t mind reveling in.Mahou Shoujo Site also had a tonal problem when it brings in murder, bullying and unbashed violence then somehow makes a chibi experssion joke about a character or situation. LA gets that Mahou Shoujo Site wants to relieve the tension at times but there is a time and place but Mahou Shoujo Site doesn\'t time these well and considering the nature of Mahou Shoujo Site that causes LA\'s entire tonal problem in the first place.In terms of animation by production doA, the animation from character designs and battles were quite decent though because of the animation is uncensored (in most cases for TV syndication anyways) it makes most of the unpleasant scenarios all the more nerve wracking to go through at times. LA didn\'t mind the battles as they were fluid and the uncensorship was good to have and again the overall animation done by production doA was decent.Voice acting wise, the majority of the cast was decent, though LA is bias against ""shy-willed characters"" which Yuuko Oono was cast as Aya and she kept her ""shrill voice"" throughout but still Yuuko had some sense of range nonetheless. so what happens when the majority of the voice cast hams it up to no end, well we get some hammy performances...like Rina Shioi voiced by Aina Suzuki, Yuu Serizawa as Nijimi Anazawa, Kaname Asagiri voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto, Sarina Shizukume voiced by Haruka Yamazaki and Site Admin 7 voiced by Freeza himself...no seriously. Mahou Shoujo Site\'s voice cast was hammy as hell and LA loved it.Also for those in the know, Ai Kizuna along with another virtual youtuber was cast in this anime, with some few lines (they were Site Admins)...LA kept forgetting about that little tidbit...did it help?...well they were characters with little screentime all things considered...soooo...take that like you will...Mahou Shoujo Site\'s finale did give Aya a full character development and resolution to tear out the despair from not only herself but the rest of the magical girls which is easily taking cues from Madoka Magica but the finale if anything was an anticlimax to what it was trying to do, we do at least know about how the Site Admins work but the anticlimax comes from the entire ""Tempest"" situation and if Aya and Tsuyuno even completed it, but LA thinks Mahou Shoujo Site tried to leave it ambiguous for ""effect"". LA just felt the finale was just left there however...Yes, Mahou Shoujo Site can easily be pointed as the ""edgiest"" anime of Spring 2018, but if you got the guts and love despair (like a certain pink twintailed despair girl) and can handle all the abuse our main protagonist goes through...or just love a batshit crazy plot that is another of the ""dark magical girl"" genre it\'s trying to put out in, then Mahou Shoujo Site probably has something for you...for LA...it\'s an ""ok"" anime but all the abuse and violence definitely took a bit to handle and for LA definitely got better away from the despairing beginning but kinda faltered in it\'s finale.Fukou-dan ni.....FUKOU DAN NI indeed...

Don\'t get me wrong, those complaints are found, but by no means should it be considered an abomination as there are other series that take the seriousness and attempts at edginess to another level while still having lighter subject material and being aimed at younger demographics. I just see there being so many obvious points that could be considered a cringe-worthy cliche or trope. The general mood and often sadism of the characters,...particularly the magical girls is something that I feel an edgy Western teenage girl would enjoy on top of the occasional ""lalalala"" whimsical horror theme. But the thing is is that I doubt that sort of crowd would be behind this show, much less able to get past all the subject material without instantly getting upset. Either way, it\'s a fun watch after the first three or so episodes, and the character designs become progressively more enjoyable. particularly the magical girls is something that I feel an edgy Western teenage girl would enjoy on top of the occasional ""lalalala"" whimsical horror theme.

It\'s a little uncomfortable to watch, but as episodes progress things begin to get better. My biggest complaint is the story line. In the beginning it was very clear cut, but it became nonsense at the end. I think a problem that occurs in a lot of 12 episode anime is that the story gets rushed.

I just stare at these characters making bad decisions and get in these bad situations then solve it by being edgy. These nothing special about the technical aspect of the show. Art and animation is fine. The OP and ED are wild though. You gotta see it yourself. Being an edgy magical girl show, you gotta compare it to the widely successful Madoka Magica.

I get the impression that the writer either wanted to write something like Madoka Magica or Sailor Nothing but got impatient and threw pacing out the window.As a result, the plot becomes very predictable, very fast. I'll start with the cons and work up from there.The first issue is, the main character is so severely, unrealistically, unfortunate. She hit the absolute lottery on generic depression inducing misfortunes to happen to a character. It gets laid on super thick from the start.I'm a sucker for contract, tontine, 'Alice Game' plotted animes, but this one's...plot is far too predictable and character motivations are paper thin. What's more, too many plot devices are too similar to that of Madoka Magica, seeming to be jumping on the growing trend of the 'dark magical girl' genre. The problem is, unlike others that carry out a balancing act of cute oldschool tropes juxtaposed against looming darkness on the horizon, Site just staight up vomits psych horror onto you to a hilarious degree.On the subject of characters, many of them are completely and unrealistically psychotic right off the bat. Over half the cast begins with some severe crippling behavioral issue that wouldn't run unchecked for that long in a normal functioning society, and that's BEFORE anyone gets life altering powers. What's more, the motivations behind the insanity are tremendously weak.  So far only a select one or two characters have become remotely relatable, since most are just beyond crazy.So what's good about it? Artistically it looks nice, sound's decent, animation's decent, cute character designs, and cool ideas and gimmicks for the usage of magical powers. Not necessarily revolutionary in that regard, but a definite strongpoint. If you can get past the 'edge' it becomes pretty to look at. Still an enjoyable show at face value, and I'd recommend it for those that like some senseless violence, mayhem, and psychotic characters. I personally plan to finish this one. plot is far too predictable and character motivations are paper thin.

The closest comparison I can give to this is the anime adaption of ""Deadman Wonderland"". Characters were cut, the story was condensed but still managed to leave some of the overarching plotlines and intrigue, and more importantly they went ahead and did something that Deadman Wonderland didn\'t even do... they completely changed when and how the story ends.  They basically cut maybe... 1/2 or more of the story and altered what remained so it ended when the anime did in...a concise fashion.I went to read the Manga out of curiosity and... immediately had no idea what was going on. This seems to scream that they didn\'t see much potential in the series itself and probably just wanted filler anime that would attract attention with the amount of Edge™ it contained in the first episode alone. Adaptions typically don\'t retcon half or more of the story so that it ends when the anime ends, is what I\'m getting at. They weren\'t trying to sell the Manga or build a fanbase, they just wanted a timeslot filler.It\'s a decent anime, but a downright terrible adaption. The sheer amount of cut content and story alteration is mindblowing, but if you feel like you aren\'t going to read the manga anytime soon (or at all) than it\'s a fine anime to watch on its own merits. a concise fashion.I went to read the Manga out of curiosity and... immediately had no idea what was going on.

I came in with extremely low expectations but ended up finishing the show and enjoying the watch a...lot. It's a show that doesn't expect to be taken seriously and is super duper cheesy, but god damn is it a RIDE.But first, the bad: the characters don't understand the gravity of the situations they're put into.

Fair warning, this review will include spoilers.The first few episodes of the anime are fairly decent. It begins by explaining the main character\'s, Aya\'s, misfortune. This leads to her being chosen by the Magical Girl Site to obtain a ""magical girl stick"". She\'s also introduced to Tsuyuno, someone she allies with throughout the rest of the series. Each character\'s story is just sympathy baiting, the worst torturous things happening to a single character all at...once.After about episode 4, everything really drops off. Random characters begin to be introduced without an explanation. The antagonists, the Magical Girl Site, motives aren\'t explained either. Everything ends up feeling incredibly rushed. It becomes confusing and muffled. Episode 6 is one the worst, in my opinion, it randomly becomes a yaoi fetish-y beach episode. All character development is thrown out the window. The plot holes are absolutely endless.When things really, really went to shit are the final two episodes. All these characters we don\'t know anything about decide it\'s time to take on the Magical Girl Site. The finale is the absolute worst, giving us our first and last look into the antagonist\'s world. These girls who were given powers by this same site can suddenly now defeat it. Aya can also somehow override the ""admin system,"" which once again comes up out of nowhere and is never explained. Not even going to try and explain the blue hair detective who kidnaps Aya\'s brother and has him in a torture dungeon... We see this one girl at the very end as if there\'s supposed to be a season 2. There are so many loose ends that I don\'t know they meant to tie up without a second season or OVA???In conclusion, Magical Girl Site is just pointless gore, yaoi fetish, Madoka Magica wanna-be, mindless nonsense. It\'s only worth the watch if you go into it randomly, not knowing what the hell is going on. The only support I can give it was: at least it wasn\'t boring. once.After about episode 4, everything really drops off. Random characters begin to be introduced without an explanation.

To put it a few words without beating around the bush, ITS BAD, but this a great hate watch and I LOVE it to bits! This is spoiler free, so feel free to go, I wont ruin this experience to you.I highly recommend it if you want a text book example of how to overdo dark thematic elements and the things that you can do to avoid that in retrospective.Mahou Shoujo Site is a genuinely passionate attempt to make the darkest possible version of the Dark-Mahou-Shoujo-Faustian-Bargain genera and fails in an spectacular way at doing so. It tried so hard...to be the next best thing to Madoka that it felt flat on its face in an almost comedic way. While looking at the reviews for this show I haven\'t seen so many variations on the word ""edgy"" since Kayn became a thing in League of Legends.Its just mesmerizing to watch, I haven\'t read the manga yet, but I cant wait to do so.So this is coming from someone without the full picture.To recap things quickly, this series has some serious problems, and a LOT of missed potential, It could have being actually really good; there are some interesting ideas and concepts here, but the execution lets so much to be desired that the entire show collapses under its own weight.So! Bulletpoints!Story: Its actually very good in some aspects. Sadly, since the manga is 16 volumes, you already know that you cant expect the full story. So... be ready for that. It would have been a complete disaster if they tried to pack that up in just 12 episodes. For what it does cover, is quite competent in its own way, but I haven\'t read the manga yet. Expect mishandling/overdoing of dark themes, it goes way over the top.Art: The production value is very descent. The animation its fine, the characters are on model, the backgrounds are fine. The big character moments are handled well enough (for what they are), the compositions are fine. Its just fine, nothing to complain here really.Sound: Its serviceable at best. Its nothing special, but it gets the job done, there are no mayor hits, but no misses either. Its... unremarkable, just fine.Character: Oh boy, here we go! This is the meat of this ordeal. I cant say anything without spoiling things, so I\'ll try to keep this short. There are SO many problems. Some of them are irredeemable, some of them have little to no development, some of them are forced in a likable position way past a point of no return, some of their interactions make no sense... They have very interesting setups and character quirks, but the audience have little to no time to get into them. Its really a shame, since there are some some really cool and interesting things and themes to explore on them, but the story and passing didn\'t deliver. Arguably, the main villain of the arc they cover is the most interesting character. Missed potential is what Im saying here.Enjoyment: As I said before, this is a bad show, but its blast to watch as a learning experience. I had a great time, I cant wait to read the manga, Im gonna go do it right after I finish this text.So! AWARDS TIME!-EDGE:The valance in between darkness and edginess is a delicate thing. This show is an example how to overdo things.-LOVE-HATE:I love and hate this show at the same time, Its terrible, but it haves a personality that won me over. As I said, its a great hate watch. Someone had a vision and now we have to pay for it.-MISSED POTENTIAL:I like to think of a world in witch this could a been a masterpiece. It throws a lot of stuff that if explored with depth and respect it deserves could make a great show.So... that\'s it! :DEsta fue mi reviu de majoh yoyo sait para Sega Genesis y espero que les haya gustado.Chau! to be the next best thing to Madoka that it felt flat on its face in an almost comedic way.

In the beginning it\'s front loaded with immense amounts of dark and depressing subjects but I\'d rather watch a train wreck than paint dry which is what the latter half of the season suffers from. When I think back on this show I immediately think to the more absurd things at the start, whereas the second half feels like they ran out of edgy things and realized they needed an actual plot. However! The magic system is very cool and I really enjoy it! I...just wish such a good magic system was attached to a show I could earnestly recommend for something other than an ironic watch. If you\'re looking for a way to kill time or have a ""bad anime night,"" with friends, this is for you. just wish such a good magic system was attached to a show I could earnestly recommend for something other than an ironic watch.

And that\'s the exact reason why I like it, tbh tho I wouldn\'t have finished this anime if my friend didnt bugged me about finishing this.The story is great and all, but the characters are just undeniably frustrating. For example the mc, asagiri. It was as if, that she was a sorry excuse for an main character. No matter how you look at it everyone has an breaking point, so I was expecting for asagiri to fight back, but in the end i was just disappointed.Now the art, it was good and was the only thing...that kept me from not watching a different series. I remember finishing 3 eps. and my reaction  was ""That was 3 eps? I thought I almost finished the whole series"", due to the lack of enjoyment.Next, the OP\'s and ED\'s. I never skipped an anime OP, so I basically listened to the op for 12 times, and I must say i wasn\'t hooked with it. Although I started listening and liking it when my yt recommendations showed the OP for this anime. And now the ED, as a person who watches anime since she(me) hates reality shows. I LITERALLY SKIPPED THE ED THE MOMENT I SAW ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS, since i was watching due to my love for animations. I listened to ed again in YT where I can only see anime characters, and I was glad I always skipped the ED, since the music is just plan old classic unoriginal song.I don\'t even want to talk about the character and enjoyment, since everything is just so messed up. that kept me from not watching a different series.

To the point that I can't stop myself from rooting for the sadistic characters that are supposed to be the villains.Overall this anime is simply one that you re better off not watching and doing something productive of your life for once. I mean it when I say it but...absolutely nothing is enjoyable when it comes to this anime absolutely nothing is enjoyable when it comes to this anime"", 'Mahou Shoujo Site is one of those animes that comes after Puella Magi: Madoka Magica, the first dark Mahou Shoujo that gets sucessfull and popular, but its edgier, with poor character development and with a bad plot.The fact of being dark is the only thing that Mahou Shoujo Site has to offer. The sluggish main character suffers from buyiling and familiar abuse, and does nothing to change that, even when she gets her power. The plot consists in a battle royale of magical girls trying to kill each other, with a upcoming treat that will put an end to the world.The motivations of the characters...are pathetic, the red haired girl bully the main one just because she doesn\'t said ""thank you""(?).The protagonist is just unlucky, she has a bad family and suffers from all type of buyiling. I mean, its much more easier to identify with Sayaka, from Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, because she is like us, someone subject to make mistakes and be bamboozled.

So I\'m going to write a review about it even though I\'m 2 years latePlot: 8/10This is one of those series I\'ve watch where it introduces a whole and a lot of conflicts but fails to resolve everything by the end.Every single episode has its own purpose. It manages to maintain its idea of being a dark magical girl series, but always left with an another conflict even though the main character hasn\'t solved the previous one yet.I got absorbed and more interested from every single episode that passes as I watch the protagonist suffer even...more. For I find it satisfying when every conflict is finally solved by the end. But the end left me disappointed as the final episode doesn\'t feel like it resolved anything. It left the idea of fighting for love that I find irrational and even pointless at times.Another thing that made it worst is the way that the conflict is handled. Like how can a single person suffer that much?Watching it for the first time, I find this series amazing as it\'s one of the only series I\'ve watched where it has an actual conflict.But watching it for the second time I finally realized how \'only\' good it was.I\'m giving it an 8 because I really love its plot premise, episodes from 1 to 10 felt like a bliss but episode 11 and 12 felt like there wasn\'t even a goal or a purpose anymore.Animation: 10/10The animation however is fantastic.The environment feels so bland. Making the viewers pay more attention on the characters movements and actions rather than on its surroundings is kind of good. It fills the series\' aesthetic and idea of being a horror anime.The body proportions may look weird and doesn\'t seem appetizing, but the way that everyone is drawn where their appearance makes them look having their own and unique personalities is what I think saves this series from being a complete ""below the average"" series.Sound: 9/10I never skipped this series\' Opening Song nor its Ending Song. I really love both. I find myself listening to it from time to time even up until to this day.The main and only issue with the sound is how important scenes fail to give attention to (or to introduce) the background song/music. Making fight scenes boring and on most times uninteresting to watch.Characters: 5/10The characters were not so great. They are the most unrealistic characters I could have ever encountered.Like you got the main character that is like an angel. She doesn\'t know how to be angry nor to be irritated even in situations where she\'s being abused. She does not have the ability to commit any kind of revenge or vengeance. She just forgives and feel sorry for everything and I find myself irritated at most time instead of having to sympathize for her.Then there\'s everyone who\'s always mad at something or someone that they\'ve decided to put all the suffering towards the main character.Enjoyment: 10/10Watching the entire series on the other hand never made me bored. As the irritation I felt for the main character combined with the complete and utter interest towards the progression of the plot gave me a complete mixed emotion to never skip any scene and to complete the entire series continuously in just one day. It seems like it was rushed, but watching it always makes me fully absorbed into the series.Overall: 8/10If only the main character wasn\'t the most pathetic character ever, this series would\'ve been great. more.

So i was searching for a Magical Girl show that was actually good...or had at least something that would be interesting for me. I too watched  Anime like Higurashi or Corpse Party so when i googled dark Mahou Shoujo Anime i found Mahou Shoujo Site.I am currently reading the Manga so i will compare the original work with the Anime adaption.I would say... let\'s start!Story / 6:The Story of Mahou Shoujo Site has many mixed Elements in it that i found really, enjoyable for the most part ( Im not a Psycho i just found it interesting to start a Manga in that kind of brutal way ).The Plot is kinda insane and much of a Chaos, but overall i think its a chaotic thing that has something that makes it pretty interesting. Though i kinda forgot that this is supposed to be a Mahou Shoujo Anime...But compared to the Manga... the Anime\'s Storyline is just shit.The Anime Producers could have adopted the ""whole Storyline"" but then the Anime would at least have 20 Episodes. The last Episode ( Episode 12 ) is i  think the 16th Volume when Episode 11 goes from the beginning to the end of Volume 7.And because of that you are left with so many answers or things that were shown but never fully explained until the end. I have to say i only rated it six because they at least tried ( not really ) to adopt the Storyline. But oh, right! We shouldn\'t spend money on making an Anime... well we could... but... let\'s cut the half of the Storyline out and go for a Tokyo Ghoul Root B!Art / 7: So i don\'t know about you but i actually liked the Art of it. That dark Atmosphere with the colorful Characters around and stuff was actually pretty fitting. Even if other Anime were too pretty good at that... Maybe like...  Madoka Magica?Sound / 6: So i think the Cast  of Mahou Shoujo Site made a pretty good job bringing most of the Characters to life and fitting them... but there is ONE thing that is so fucking dumb. The Ending theme...I know many people complained about it but... its so weird... i mean are those things around the Tempest really Sperm? Was the Producer looking at that Ending theme and thinking... Oh, yeah that\'s good! That fits the show!The Music of the Ending Theme is pretty okay... but the presentation of the imagery is worse than anything i ever saw. The Opening though is pretty good, but the OST itself is really forgetable...Characters / 3: Oh, boi! Now we get to the worst part of this Anime... THE CHARACTERS!Aya: She\'s fine... but i wish that she wouldn\'t be that weak. I mean she IS the Main Character so what the heck was she learning from this?Yatsumura: She has at least a better backstory than Aya and does more things for the plot but i think there\'s nothing more to say about her.Nijimi: I don\'t even know why she\'s there i mean she wasn\'t really important.Other Characters: So the other Characters like the Police Officer get one or two scenes when he was later on the Manga pretty important. Shioi is the half of the Anime not even there anymore and the other Magical Girls get NOTHING at all! No backstorys, no look at the character... nothing! In the Manga they were not really important but later on they were pretty interesting and after they\'re backstorys and some Character conversations you cared about them. But in the Anime you just don\'t give a shit about they being even there!Oh and btw... because the Story was cut half off in the Anime most of the Characters weren\'t even in the Anime what is pretty sad cause i liked Hyouka, Anjo, Alice, Sakaki or Komura more than the Main Characters... and that is because they have more personality, charme and more interesting events in the Story.Enjoyment / 3: The Anime is a complete chaos ( more than the manga ) with so many plot points, characters and many events missing. When i watched Tokyo Ghoul Root A i though you can\'t make an Adaption worse. But here we are with not even the all the important characters in there.Overall / 4: For people who are only Anime viewers might enjoy this ""Adaptation""...But for people like me who had no enjoyment but at least interest in the Manga so far is this Anime just a another Tokyo Ghoul Season 2 but sadly even worse than that...  I don\'t care if you agree on all those points but that\'s after all just my opinion. or had at least something that would be interesting for me.

I don\'t care if you agree on all those points but that\'s after all just my opinion.', ""Mahou shoujo site is a poorly done adaptation which lead the anime to be full of plot hole and incoherence and it also tries to munch to be dark which leads it to be ridiculous more than anything. But in a certain way, that’s also what made it enjoyable for me.The overall animation and visual of the anime are good. Nothing stunning but nothing bad. I really liked how the anime manage to be colorful and still maintain an overall dark atmosphere, I really liked the using of light, shadow and colors during the whole anime and the chara-designe of the site-admin are also very...creative and interesting. I would just say that in therms of staging and imagery, the anime is kinda poor.The sounds in the anime are also good, there’s nothing to say about it. But the musics are kinda bland. There’s nothing very original and there’s no particular theme that manage to stand out. The only theme that manage to stand out for me, and not in a good way, was “Innocent Murderous Intent”. The song is basically your very cliché horror song with kids singing and it makes every scene it’s used in more kitsch either than making them more scary or disturbing.The opening is very good. I think that it really manage to retransmit well the dark atmosphere the anime is trying to create. The ending on the other hand… I can really take seriously actress in school girl uniforms dancing on the top of a building with giant 3D sperm flying around them. And as far as I’m aware there’s no particular symbol or something like that that justifies it.The characters are very bland. Most of them are bad person ( which doesn't mean they are badly written character ) and because of their way of thinking and acting they will confront the consequences of those, but they will never be questioned or learn something through those events which lead those character to never grow or change. The only development characters in this anime have is their background ( which is sometimes thrown just before the death of the character just to hope you will miraculously become attached to them ) which is basically always the same: “some bad shit happened to me ( bullying or murder ) so now I’m an asshole that do not hesitate to kill”. Some character could bring some interesting theme but they are never developed fully. It always just feels like those element are here for the anime to look more dark but after that nothing interesting is done with those elements with potential. There’s literally a character in the intrigue that stay in the background and seems to become more and more dangerous because of how unstable he become but then he just get killed by another antagonist before having any impact on the story. One thing I liked however was at the end of each episode where we view thing from the big brother perspective, I found those moment really funny and it also build the megalomania of the character.The story is very interesting with some good plot point but it suffer from a terrible execution. Has I said, the story try to munch to be “dark” with it’s character, it’s just “let’s make them suffer but let’s not try to do anything or say anything through it”. But the story is also full of plot hole ( and I’m usually very forgetful about plot hole ) and by reading the manga I discoverer that most of the incoherence and plot hole are because of some explanation or scene that allow to understand what’s happening are missing in the anime adaptation. And I think that the story get even worse when it throw a beach episode out of nowhere. It’s not just that it almost served nothing for the plot, it’s also that, in my opinion the anime destroy it’s own credibility by making some weird fan service episode when it constantly tries to be dark. Overall, there's a ton of more or less smaller element that just make the story not work for me.But overall, I did enjoy quite a bit this anime. In my opinion, it’s part of those bad fiction that are enjoyable because of bad they are. There were still some moment that where legitimately boring, but overall it was still fun to watch. But on a more serious note, it’s also very hard to not compare Mahou shoujo site to madoka magica. It’s not the same story and also not a copy of MSMM, but it does takes multiple plot element from it, and the thing that, in my opinion, makes them bad or not as good, is that Mahou shoujo site doesn’t try to give depth or meaning behind those elements and use them just because “it’s dark”, and by forcing it to munch, the “dark” element of the anime become more laughable than anything else. But it’s still an interesting watch that I would recommend if you think it’s your type of anime. creative and interesting. I would just say that in therms of staging and imagery, the anime is kinda poor.The sounds in the anime are also good, there’s nothing to say about it. But the musics are kinda bland. There’s nothing very original and there’s no particular theme that manage to stand out. The only theme that manage to stand out for me, and not in a good way, was “Innocent Murderous Intent”. The song is basically your very cliché horror song with kids singing and it makes every scene it’s used in more kitsch either than making them more scary or disturbing.The opening is very good. I think that it really manage to retransmit well the dark atmosphere the anime is trying to create. The ending on the other hand… I can really take seriously actress in school girl uniforms dancing on the top of a building with giant 3D sperm flying around them. And as far as I’m aware there’s no particular symbol or something like that that justifies it.The characters are very bland. Most of them are bad person ( which doesn't mean they are badly written character ) and because of their way of thinking and acting they will confront the consequences of those, but they will never be questioned or learn something through those events which lead those character to never grow or change. The only development characters in this anime have is their background ( which is sometimes thrown just before the death of the character just to hope you will miraculously become attached to them ) which is basically always the same: “some bad shit happened to me ( bullying or murder ) so now I’m an asshole that do not hesitate to kill”. Some character could bring some interesting theme but they are never developed fully. It always just feels like those element are here for the anime to look more dark but after that nothing interesting is done with those elements with potential. There’s literally a character in the intrigue that stay in the background and seems to become more and more dangerous because of how unstable he become but then he just get killed by another antagonist before having any impact on the story. One thing I liked however was at the end of each episode where we view thing from the big brother perspective, I found those moment really funny and it also build the megalomania of the character.The story is very interesting with some good plot point but it suffer from a terrible execution. Has I said, the story try to munch to be “dark” with it’s character, it’s just “let’s make them suffer but let’s not try to do anything or say anything through it”. But the story is also full of plot hole ( and I’m usually very forgetful about plot hole ) and by reading the manga I discoverer that most of the incoherence and plot hole are because of some explanation or scene that allow to understand what’s happening are missing in the anime adaptation.

Well - They tried.', 'Personally, the only people I\'ve seen complain about this anime are people with overall basic taste who definetely missed alot of core points, and you can tell by reading their reviews. People who rated this badly probably don\'t have much experience with the topics this anime tackles. Obviously it\'s not free of criticism but it\'s being hated on for all the wrong reasons. Personally I happen to have gone through quite a big of turmoil in my life. To most people this anime may seem edgy and its portrayal unrealistic, but I digress, it\'s not trying to give realistic portrayal. But rather what the anime...does is exaggerate the story elements, not for shock value, but actually it\'s a very common method used in literature. It\'s fair none of the people criticizing it noticed, definetely don\'t seem like the types to know anything about literature. The negative reviews here just seem shallow and superficial, clearly not educated enough to be speaking about this. That said, the technique this show seems to use is from realist novels; Enstrangement,whereby the reader\'s perception of reality is altered and distorted by means of various techniques to make him discover new sides of reality, dismantling and deconstructing the more usual and more conventional perception of the world around us. Which is exactly what this show does,  the world is show as completely bad. It might seem edgy to some for Aya to be abused this much, but it\'s really not that different from reality, if you saw no meaning to this show perhaps you\'re simply not bright enough to get behind it. The whole point is for the characters to be incredibly unlucky, whether the one watching feels for the characters based off of that doesn\'t quite matter. The anime could have represented it better but in the manga it\'s completely different, every character has much more depth in them from the start.This anime is not ""oooh so edgy"", it\'s a reality people are not used to seeing and therefore see it as exaggerated or even ""otherwordly"", the character is so unlucky because if she wasn\'t she wouldn\'t get a stick, as for the humour i think it\'s fine. It\'s nothing unusual in anime, and I think a normal sense of humour in this show would have felt more out of place than anything. Personally I think the outrageous sense of humour gives it another layer of being unsettling, which reminds me of kakegurui in a way.Someone in the reviews said the anime ""doesn\'t take itself seriously"" and no, it definetely does lol, every character in this show is supposed to be evil, even the side characters, the office men pissed off by Aya\'s suicide attempt, the way degenerate media like Nijimin\'s idol group is accepted and idolized, and the overall lack of morality in the whole show. That\'s not a sign the show doesn\'t take itself seriously lol, it\'s a very common writing technique, as i already said.I haven\'t seen many people addressing it but most characters designs are very good, whether it\'s from personality to appearance. I seriously think before judging the series based on the anime, people should be reading the manga too. The characters aren\'t one diemnsional in the slightest, it\'s been portrayed multiple times but perhaps most ppl have their heads so far up their ass they fail to notice. There was no time to expand on the later characters because there planned to be a season 2, which unfortunately we\'re not getting. I wish I could reply to reviews i have so much to say....

I thought the story was good until about episode 9 they\'d established a common goal and created great bonds with eachother but then after that it felt kind of like the anime lost its goal was it to show that love can overcome all obstacles and misfortune? They completely lost the eerie/sinister vibe that episodes 1-8 portrayed and instead went for a ""power of love"" story on top of...that I thought ""plot twists"" near the end were obvious from the start(more of a personal thing). But the thing that really annoyed me was the ending, they killed three administrators but instead of living in fear they just go back to bed??? Also I thought it was dumb how people thought the r*pe scene of kaname was deserved, first of all kaname was abused by his father (this doesn\'t justify his actions but definitely plays a role in them), and was forced into extreme conditions of stress still he shouldn\'t of abused his sister or killed that random guy or nijima but dies this justify him getting r*ped, the show at the end feels as though it boils down to ""women good, men bad"" girls that would have contributed to the r*pe of the main character and a girl that killed several other girls are so easily forgiven yet the dude gets r*ped if this is the case then the others deserve the same fate(which I think they don\'t). that I thought ""plot twists"" near the end were obvious from the start(more of a personal thing).

gets r*ped if this is the case then the others deserve the same fate(which I think they don\'t).', '(Contains spoilers)So,where do I start with this?I don\'t normally use words such as ""Trainwreck"" or ""Dumpster Fire"" but yeah,I think this anime deserves those two adjectives.The anime\'s plot,to put it simply(Not that it\'s much more complicated),and short,is that a supernatural world-ending event is destined to hit the earth and to prevent(?),that a secret supernatural organization of masked people give away magic wands(Objects that grants a specific supernatural ability to someone),to ""Unfortunate"" girls(Which they will be referred as ""Magical Girls""),so they can collect dark energy because that would somehow helps against the said supernatural world-ending event(Which is referred as the ""Tempest"" in the anime).Things aren\'t exactly...as I laid out,but things appear like this for most of the anime until the very end when it\'s revealed more about the nature of the ""Tempest"" and what\'s the ""Real"" purpose of the magical girls(Which isn\'t anything nice if it wasn\'t clear already).While this premise isn\'t exactly super intriguing it\'s not even that horrible,it\'s the whole story that\'s built on these fundamentals that it is horrible.It wouldn\'t be too exaggerated to say that the whole anime it\'s just pain / violence porn,with the term ""Porn"" it\'s used to describe something that\'s ""Shoved in"" without a real presentation,or to put it differently ""Have things happen because they need to happen"",just like in porn where nobody expects a story,people shouldn\'t really expect a compelling story out of this show,because it\'s clearly built around showing as much pain as possible,well,almost,let\'s not forget the beach episode which probably wins the non-existing prize of the most out of place episode of every anime ever.The story starts exactly how most stories I don\'t like start:By throwing as much shock value at the viewer as possible to hook it for the rest of the show;This is already a very bad sign as it shows poor confidence in the production to hook an audience for the entire duration of the show.This is clearly show even in the comments section of MyAnimeList site where the first episode by the time I\'m writing this has 387 comments,second one has 139 comments,third one has 151 comments,then 111,113,128,last three episodes have 10,12 and 40 comments,that\'s quite the bad sign,it\'s almost as if most of the audience left the boat,I wonder why?Anyway,back to the ""Story"";The story starts by showing one of the most miserable lives of a girl living in Japan at this time and age can have,the girl(Called Aya,which is the main character),not only gets relentlessly bullied in school,but at also at home by her psychopathic brother that punches her in the stomach and strangle her for fun...later in the episode the bullies at school even girl Aya\'s cat by throwing it under a train because why not,and then having an upperclassman assault her because why not #2.Things don\'t go as expected as by the time why not #1 and why not #2 Aya gets delivered a magic wand,which has the form of an heart-shaped pistol that has the power to teletransport whatever it hits to whatever location the user is thinking of,this tool gets used in extremis by Aya to transport both the upperclassman and one of the nearby bullies in front of a moving train and blessing the rest of the world of the removal of their presence;Note that Aya wasn\'t even aware of the powers of that weirdly shaped pistol when she used it,it will be another girl,Yatsumura,that explains things to her after saving her from yet another bullying attempt by stopping time with her time-stopping magic wand and injuring the bully\'s neck in the process(The bully will be later become a more relevant character,her name is Sarina).This is pretty much the first episode and as I said earlier it pulls all the stops to try to shock the viewer with as much tragedy as possible,oh yeah I also forgot at the start of the episode Aya is thinking of throwing herself in front of a moving train,yep,she is suicidal and will later say that she thinks of dying every day.Aya it\'s also extremely shy and passive,so she is the ideal punching bag for a story that wants to throw tragedy and pain at the viewer for easy shock value.Things get however a lot milder for most of the anime compared to the first episode,another girl gets introduced,called Rina,this one is the first to have discovered that the ""Tempest"" is coming and so she goes around collecting other girls magic wands because...yes,apparently you can simply steal someone else\'s magic wand and use it no problem...I said ""Steal"" and if you were a normal person you\'d think ""Robbery"" but that\'s not tragic enough you see,Rina instead decides to murder several other magical girls to get their wands,the ""Murder"" part was completely unnecessary as a magical girl without her magic wand has no powers whatsoever,but again,evil things must happen because why not.Rina is a psychopath,much like most of the cast of this show,and the worst part is that after Aya and Yatsumura capture her,she will later become one of the...err...""Good guys"" I guess,despite what she has done;Would you sympathize with a psychopath that needlessly kills other people? I would not,and that\'s the reason why she is the first of a long list of characters that I wouldn\'t care if they live or die,which is quite a BIG problem when your whole show relies on the fact that the viewer has to care for its characters,doesn\'t it?Due to a ""Side effect"" of using their magic wands and the fact that Rina went overboard by using many of them,she ends up in a coma at the hospital.Apparently all Magical Girls have a non-replenishment amount of mana points,the more they use a magic wand(Any magic wand,not just theirs),the more their lifespan gets shortened,which could be used as a justification plot-wise to not just abuse their powers left and right but as it will turns out later,all characters are too dumb to use their powers intelligently so it wasn\'t even necessary anyway.Anyway,thanks to Rina\'s notebook,Aya and Yatsumura manages to locate another Magical Girl(It\'s not clear HOW Rina figured out who were the other magical girls),and since they\'re now aware of the ""Tempest"",they\'re trying to gather allies,so they go after her.This other magical girl is called Nijimi,which is an idol whose magic wand\'s power is to mind control people with voice commands,in other words,every command she issue with her voice will be enacted by whoever hears it,it\'s like the Geass power in Code Geass but without restrictions saved the limited mana points like the rest of the girls.Nijimi\'s magic wand is probably the most peculiar as it\'s literally a pair of panties,eh,whatever.Turns out that this Nijimi is...yet another psychopath,not Rina\'s level psychopath,but somewhat in her range.She had her best friend killed by Rina because she wanted to get her magic wand,so she is looking to get her revenge by killing her...and she is obsessed about it.Since Aya and Yatsumura wants to get more information from Rina,which is still in coma,they decide not to tell Nijimi about the girl\'s whereabouts.Oh yeah I said that Nijimi is a psychopath but haven\'t explained why;Aside from her anger issues that are literally called as it is in the anime,she has several of her fans enslaved in her home using her wand\'s power.You known.The girl which is nationwide-famous which probably has enough money to hire at least a couple of butlers,instead use her wand to enslave people to work for free,yeah,very sane,and yet another character which I don\'t care if she lives or dies;I may be a broken clock by repeating this but one of the fundamentals for a good anime is caring,if the viewer doesn\'t care about the characters,how can he like the rest of the show?Anyway,it will be irrelevant but it\'s worth mentioning because ""Irrelevant"" doesn\'t mean ""Not annoying"" and thus worth reporting,there\'s a background character,a fan of Nijimi,rather,a mind-crazed fan of Nijimi,that stalks her and that be later killed in a future episode,his whole existence in the anime made next to no difference wasn\'t for Aya casually witnessing its murder(Will talk about this later),but besides that,such an useless character that only waste the viewer\'s time.Later in the episode(3),Sarina returns into the scene and now she is been offered a magic wand by a site admin(I forgot to mention,the girls first gets in contact with this supernatural organization by a ""Magical Girl Site"",that\'s controlled by various site admins),for the reason you may expect:Revenge,of course,because Sarina suspects that Aya was responsible for the death of the other 2 bullies even tho she hadn\'t witness it.Episode 4 is pretty uneventful,Nijimi gets into the same school of Aya and Yatsumura,meanwhile it\'s revealed how Aya\'s bullying started,with Aya basically failing to say ""Thank you"" to Sarina since she was a little bit kind to her at the beginning,yeah,sure,whatever,she would have been eventually a target sooner or later anyway,that was just an excuse to trigger the bullying.Anyway,Nijimi becomes sort of friends with Aya and Yatsumura,which they still kept the fact they know of Nijimi\'s friend\'s assassin a secret(It\'s Rina,the one still in coma at the hospital),meanwhile Sarina eavesdrop a conversation between Aya and Yatsumura about Rina and of course,goes straight to inform Nijimi,while preparing an ambush at Yatsumura\'s home,because she is mad at her for injuring her neck,so the natural and sane reaction is that she needs to die too.Episode 5 is mostly Sarina fighting with Aya as Yatsumura got an early KO due to a surprise attack;Sarina\'s magic wand it\'s basically a yo-yo that can cut stuff,uhm,not exactly the most overpowered thing she could have get but whatever.Aya is still as a crybaby as in the first episode and refuses to fight back Sarina,even after she threatened not only her life,but her friend\'s too.Oh yeah,while we\'re at this,let\'s reveal Yatsumura\'s secret:She kept prisoner the murder of her parents in her home so she could torture him;Of all the psychopaths in this show Yatsumura is the most relatable one,becuase yeah,the guy deserves it.Unfortunately for Yatsumura,she doesn\'t get her revenge to the guy since Sarina decides to kill him because why not,it\'s not like Sarina had a grudge towards the guy nor she knew what he had done,but remember this is an evil anime so evil things have to happen so the guy dies,whatever.The entire apartment complex get demolished by Sarina\'s attacks,but just moments before the whole thing collapse on the girl\'s head,Aya saves Sarina by teleporting her away,while she protects herself and Yatsumura with one of the wands Rina collected,one that is capable to generate a force field of sort,that protects both girls.It will be later mentioned that several other people died in the building collapse,so add that to the list of killed people by Sarina,in case somehow you found her relatable.Anyway,now basically everyone but Sarina is at the hospital,and yet another magical girl shows up...In episode 6,Nijimi shows at Aya\'s house and immediately falls in love with Aya\'s piece of trash brother,which has been suspecting about Aya and her friend and even finds traces in the internet history of her sister about the Magical Girl Site thing...so word after word,he finds out what\'s going on.Meanwhile at the hospital,the new girl is called Kosame,a girl that for some reason is the second in terms of user favorities after Aya in the MyAnimeList site,no idea why,maybe because she is not a psychopath like the rest?,anyway,her wand is a paper cutter,and it\'s power is healing,but unlike the other wands,on top of the usual mana consumption,this wand also requires the user blood to be swallowed by the target to take effect(It doesn\'t replenish the mana by the way),which is very convenient considering Kosame used to cut herself anyway.So,Kosame heals up everyone and tells the other girls what she knows about the whole story.Apparently,there\'s another group of Magical Girls that has found out about the ""Tempest"",the Magical Girl Site,and the Site Admins that apparently go out and kill the girls who try to investigate the matter.In this episode there\'s also the biggest ""Mask off"" moment of the anime.Apparently,the tempest\'s arrival is inevitable,but there\'s one way to survive:To feed the King\'s hunger(Whoever is the King);The King feeds on humanity\'s negative energy,and offering that to him will allow the girl to avoid death during the Tempest.The negative energy is stored in the magic sticks and it\'s collect by,you guessed,doing evil stuff.So basically the anime admits that it has build its whole premise around doing evil stuff for evil\'s sake,because doing evil stuff is necessary to gather negative energy which is necessary to survive the Tempest,and it\'s necessary because...of course,because the anime says so.And that\'s why I called it at the start just violence porn,things have to happen because it decided that have to happen,the plot it\'s just an excuse.Anyway,Kosame offers the girls to ally with the rest of the group to fight the real villains - the site admins,which as already said,go around killing the magical girls for investigating too much.Now one question someone logical would ask is:If these site admins can just go around killing stuff on their own,why not collect the negative energy themselves?,and what\'s the point of killing the magical girls anyway? What happens after they investigate?,they refuse to continue the collecting thing?,is that even a problem considering they have apparently no issues replacing them?,maybe they have some headquarters that can be tracked down?,who knows,but it feels way too insecure and over cautions for beings that appear to be so all-mighty.There\'s also a few very short scenes of other magical girls getting killed because why tell when you can show evil am I right?Episode 7,now there\'s a bunch of other girls I don\'t even wanna bother talking too much about those,there\'s one with super physical abilities,the one that read minds,the one that flies on a broom,the one with a sword and...did I forget anyone?,oh yeah,there\'s also a crossdresser,why not,I guess being female isn\'t a requisite.Anyway,Rina ALSO joins the school with Aya and Yastsumura,while Nijimi is in class and guess what?,she immediately snaps and almost orders her to kill herself but Aya and Yatsumura manages to tackle her and Aya even removes her magic wand...whatever.Later that day,after the manage to calm down Nijimi,they convince her to cooperate with the rest of the group,their current goal is to kidnap a site admin to extract information from it...sounds a bit crazy but whatever;Oh,also Yatsumura instead of using Nijimi\'s magic wand,she just hide it somewhere,ugh,she could have used it to ensure Nijimi would behave or something,I\'m not saying making her slave but at least hold her grudge against Rina,which is,by the way,a very justified grudge since as far as I know Nijimi\'s friend did nothing wrong to deserve being killed by that psychopath.Anyway,all the magical girls have a talk and decide to ally together bla bla there\'s no real plan yet,but it\'s a start I guess.Meanwhile Sarina manages to recover all the wands who were lost during that building collapse,I forgot to mention that none of girls have their magic wands(Expect for the newcomers);You would think that,if you were Yatsumura and had lost her magic wand,she would use Nijimi\'s,just in case,but nope,instead she and Aya go around completely unarmed while hiding the second strongest magic wand in the anime after Yatsumura\'s time-stopping one,okay,very stupid.Episode 8 beach time wtf?,sure the logic is to have the girls share a happy memory since they all realized that they won\'t ever get into adulthood,but still just like most of the anime,it feels somewhat forced.Anyway,half of an episode later Yatsumura finds out that Nijimi\'s magic wand disappeared from her locker,good job! and you will never guess who stole it - Aya\'s psychopath brother,who had been in contact with Nijimi who told her that they stole her magic wand and he offered to find it back - obviously Nijimi is too enraptured by...what was his name again I need to check...right,Kaname,Aya\'s piece of trash brother...anyway,Kaname,which is dumb but still a lot smarter than Yasumura,puts on Nijimi\'s wand which I remember is a girl\'s panties,if the idea is already repulsive don\'t worry,the anime will make sure to show Kaname wearing them.Now once you\'re done puking let\'s get back to what is happening in this dumb episode,remember that background character,that Nijimi\'s fan that stalked her?,he saw Kaname talking to her so he is now stalking him and wants to kill him because of course,psychopathic fan think Nijimi shouldn\'t be in a relationship with anyone so Kaname has to die - or so he wish,because Kaname,using the magic wand,easily disposes of him by simply telling him to kill himself...that\'s the extent of the presence of that character,what a waste of time.Anyway,turns out SOMEHOW Aya has seen the entire scene,this despite the beach and the street being separated by an huge wall;There\'s a shot in the scene where you see Aya crouching next to the wall which clearly appears taller than her even considering she is crouching...yet for some reason Aya was on top of the wall,watching it happened,yeah,get your facts straight anime.Episode 9 and here things start to get not only dumb,but also completely nonsensical.Remember when I said there was a magical girl capable of reading minds?,yeah,she reads Aya\'s mind discovering who stole Nijimi\'s magic wand(Aya didn\'t want to tell the others of course,she must protect that nice and good brother of her right),so this magical girl called Suirenji,the crossdresser which is biologically speaking a boy but whatever let\'s call it a she anyway since it doesn\'t really matter.So Suirenji whose name I need to copy-paste because it\'s too complicated to type goes after Aya\'s brother with two other girls:The one that can fly with a broom and the one with enhanced physical capabilities and...at first it seems like the girl(Named Asahi),manages to knock down Kaname(Which remember,still is wearing the magic mind-control panties),but instead of finishing him off or taking away its magic wand SUPER IMMEDIATELY like any non braindead person would do against someone who only needs a couple of seconds to tell you to kill yourself she waste time and gets ambushed by Nijimi who has been previously mind controlled by Kaname to protect him and guess what - the second most absurd scene in the anime happens,the girl with supposed enhanced strenght gets immobilized by Nijimi,which is even smaller than her,that strangles her,yep,makes as much sense as it sound(That\'s it,it doesn\'t).Anyway Kaname orders Asahi to go kill whoever is controlling her(Because this whole time Asahi was mind controlled by Suirenji TOO MANY NAMES TO REMEMBER DAMN IT),and she immediately runs out to stab Suirenji with her arm(This time not wasting time like a total moron like she did earlier),and immediately snaps back to sanity after that...the girl that can fly on a broom(Named Mikari,good thing this one is easy to type),brings the injured girl back to the main group where the one that can heal(Kosame),is.Remember Kaname\'s order?,to kill whoever was controlling Asahi?,yeah turns out the magic wand\'s power is not that precise since Suirenji is still alive but somehow Asahi didn\'t finish her...another plot hole?,the writer being dumb?,both?,who knows.Anyway,still episode 9 here,the other girls are all located at a mansion where the girl with the sword lives(Named Sayuki),this one has an entire security service made of dozen armed men which is laughable against frigging magic...and guess what?,just as expected the men gets slaughtered easily by Kaname,just like that,who could have imagined?,I mean,beside anyone with half a brain...not to mention that the so-called ""Genius"" brother(He says so himself),could have used his power to turns those armed men into his personal army or just tell them to go away but remember me calling this anime violence porn?,yeah,bad things have to happen no matter what,who cares about logic?Kaname gets into the room where all the girls(Including the one injured by Asahi),are located and immediately immobilize everyone by simply saying ""Sit"",and just like that a room full of magical girls it\'s child\'s play apparently.Good thing Kaname for some reason brought with him Nijimi,still mind controlled,because dozen of big armed men are useless to mind control but a little frail girl definitely worth bringing her over,yeah,sure;Anyway,turns out Suirenji who has been partially healed by Kosame barely manages to override Kaname\'s mind control and free Nijimi(Yeah she can apparently both read the mind AND control it),which in a fit of rage lunges as Kaname which reacts fast enough by slicing her with Sayuki\'s sword.Nijimi falls to the ground but somehow manages to pull enough strenght to get up,break a glass bottle and stab Kaname in the throat,the same guy who 10 seconds ago reacted fast enough against a much healthier Nijimi who lunged at him yet somehow was caught of guard by a 90% dead girl the second time,okay,sure.Kaname tries to heal himself with Kosame\'s magic wand but a mysterious invisible entity stops him.When the other girls return to their senses Kaname disappeared and Nijimi is dead.Episode 10,not much going on in this episode besides Sarina reappearing and joining with Aya against the site admins,seems like after discovering how they treated the magical girls that she had a change of heart and now she is one of the good guys,never mind what she has done to Aya or the people she has killed in the building collapse nahh forget about that it\'s all good now.There\'s Nijimi\'s funeral going on and all the magical girls attend to it,however the site admin has decided to get rid of all of them by making the whole place explode,which ultimately doesn\'t accomplish anything because Sarina had informed Aya of what was going to happen and also brought back the lost magic wands,including Aya\'s that allows her to teleport everyone away just before the explosion.Oh,forgot to mention that Rina also tells Nijimi(At her funeral),that she is sorry for having killed her friend,yeah,a bit too late now to apologize with Nijimi being dead and stuff,not to mention the real victim is Nijimi\'s friend,Erika,but whatever,dead people don\'t complain anymore so,moving on.Sarina have a talk with the rest of the magical girls and after Aya\'s proposal of basically taking on all site admins by herself with Sarina being denied because it was something so dumb even the characters of this anime could tell,they ultimately decide to do the smart thing and ally together.Episode 11 more dumb stuff,this time the girls try to ambush one of the site admins but for some reason they let only Rina fight for most of the time with her original magic wand which is just...an hammer,yeah,an hammer,who doesn\'t really appear to be anything special other than maybe being lightweight and still striking like a ""Normal"" heavy hammer...nothing magic about it in other words,yet for SOME reason they decide that she is the one to fight against a site admin,with Aya and Yatsumura watching her just a few dozen meters away,you know,by now Yatsumura has her wand back,she could easily stop the time and kill anyone,but nope,because conveniently she has almost no mana left,Aya tries her best to not let her do anything...forget about the fact that anyone can use anyone else\'s wand,let\'s just leave the strongest wand in the anime to the girl that won\'t use it because she is out of mana,yeah,right,how more dumb this anime can get?,ohh,just you wait,it gets even dumber very soon.Meanwhile,another group of magical girls that for some reason weren\'t with the others to ambush the site admin,rush to the place where the others are but gets stopped by another site admin,and a fight ensues.Meanwhile,the main group,which also has Sarina I forgot to mention,finally starts to join the fight instead of watching Rina almost getting killed for no reason,and they quickly take down the site admin,which appears not to be an human as it doesn\'t bleed nor it feels pain,yet when it dies its outer shell breaks and it appears as if it\'s a young girl...okay,whatever,another site admin shows up and quickly injures Sarina,putting her out of the fight,and now...Yatsumura does the most stupid thing the universe of anime ever witness,she take her wand,you known,the strongest one in the anime,the one that can stop time,and she just points it at the site admin,instead of,you know,use it?,nahh!,let\'s just point it at the site admin which promptly hit the wand with a long distance attack(The same that had incapacitated Sarina moments before and that Yatsumura saw),and destroys it.There are not words to describe just how baffled I am,the sheer,utter,gigantic stupidity of this anime is mind blowing,I\'d ask ""What were you thinking you hyper moron??"" but I don\'t think Yatsumura had a reason to do it,she just did because the writer couldn\'t come up with anything intelligent to counter a time-stopping machine so he simply had it destroyed...great.Yatsumura,which had hold herself back from using wands due to her low mana left,uses the other wand that creates a force field to protect Aya,Sarina and Rina,while she dies after running out of mana,why she didn\'t cast the force field so she was inside too? no idea!,not like it was important anyway,she would die anyway immediately after...whatever!Anyway last episode...won\'t bother actually telling much of this one since it\'s a bunch of nonsense,the other group manages to kill the site admin;Yatsumura gets revived after the head of the site admins decides to make her a site admin,and she tries to kill Aya after her original time-stopping wand gets restored,somehow.Oh,her magic-stopping wand now doesn\'t stop time anymore,it just shoots energy projectiles which are incredible ineffective since they can\'t seem to severely damage an undefended Aya,makes sense!Yatsumura ""Somehow"" snaps out of her trance and regains her personality,immediately facing against the site admin...Aya manages to kill the site admin by teleporting her in front of a moving train...right,how did she knows there was a train in that place in that exact same moment?,who knows! coincidence I guess? Anyway,as I said I don\'t want to talk much about this episode because it\'s...bah,there\'s tons of things hinting at a second season but I\'m really not interested in watching anymore of this stuff...To finish this review:This anime tries too hard at making the viewer care for incredibly psychopathic characters in incredibly twisted and messed up circumstances but tries so hard to it disconnects so much from reality and relatability that it\'s really hard to feel anything for the characters,making this excuse of a plot totally ineffective to convey a meaningful experience.If you like seeing girls suffering and lots of senseless death while keeping your brain off, go have a look at this anime,otherwise stay away from this.3 out 10 as I laid out,but things appear like this for most of the anime until the very end when it\'s revealed more about the nature of the ""Tempest"" and what\'s the ""Real"" purpose of the magical girls(Which isn\'t anything nice if it wasn\'t clear already).While this premise isn\'t exactly super intriguing it\'s not even that horrible,it\'s the whole story that\'s built on these fundamentals that it is horrible.It wouldn\'t be too exaggerated to say that the whole anime it\'s just pain / violence porn,with the term ""Porn"" it\'s used to describe something that\'s ""Shoved in"" without a real presentation,or to put it differently ""Have things happen because they need to happen"",just like in porn where nobody expects a story,people shouldn\'t really expect a compelling story out of this show,because it\'s clearly built around showing as much pain as possible,well,almost,let\'s not forget the beach episode which probably wins the non-existing prize of the most out of place episode of every anime ever.The story starts exactly how most stories I don\'t like start:By throwing as much shock value at the viewer as possible to hook it for the rest of the show;This is already a very bad sign as it shows poor confidence in the production to hook an audience for the entire duration of the show.This is clearly show even in the comments section of MyAnimeList site where the first episode by the time I\'m writing this has 387 comments,second one has 139 comments,third one has 151 comments,then 111,113,128,last three episodes have 10,12 and 40 comments,that\'s quite the bad sign,it\'s almost as if most of the audience left the boat,I wonder why?Anyway,back to the ""Story"";The story starts by showing one of the most miserable lives of a girl living in Japan at this time and age can have,the girl(Called Aya,which is the main character),not only gets relentlessly bullied in school,but at also at home by her psychopathic brother that punches her in the stomach and strangle her for fun...later in the episode the bullies at school even girl Aya\'s cat by throwing it under a train because why not,and then having an upperclassman assault her because why not #2.Things don\'t go as expected as by the time why not #1 and why not #2 Aya gets delivered a magic wand,which has the form of an heart-shaped pistol that has the power to teletransport whatever it hits to whatever location the user is thinking of,this tool gets used in extremis by Aya to transport both the upperclassman and one of the nearby bullies in front of a moving train and blessing the rest of the world of the removal of their presence;Note that Aya wasn\'t even aware of the powers of that weirdly shaped pistol when she used it,it will be another girl,Yatsumura,that explains things to her after saving her from yet another bullying attempt by stopping time with her time-stopping magic wand and injuring the bully\'s neck in the process(The bully will be later become a more relevant character,her name is Sarina).This is pretty much the first episode and as I said earlier it pulls all the stops to try to shock the viewer with as much tragedy as possible,oh yeah I also forgot at the start of the episode Aya is thinking of throwing herself in front of a moving train,yep,she is suicidal and will later say that she thinks of dying every day.Aya it\'s also extremely shy and passive,so she is the ideal punching bag for a story that wants to throw tragedy and pain at the viewer for easy shock value.Things get however a lot milder for most of the anime compared to the first episode,another girl gets introduced,called Rina,this one is the first to have discovered that the ""Tempest"" is coming and so she goes around collecting other girls magic wands because...yes,apparently you can simply steal someone else\'s magic wand and use it no problem...I said ""Steal"" and if you were a normal person you\'d think ""Robbery"" but that\'s not tragic enough you see,Rina instead decides to murder several other magical girls to get their wands,the ""Murder"" part was completely unnecessary as a magical girl without her magic wand has no powers whatsoever,but again,evil things must happen because why not.Rina is a psychopath,much like most of the cast of this show,and the worst part is that after Aya and Yatsumura capture her,she will later become one of the...err...""Good guys"" I guess,despite what she has done;Would you sympathize with a psychopath that needlessly kills other people? I would not,and that\'s the reason why she is the first of a long list of characters that I wouldn\'t care if they live or die,which is quite a BIG problem when your whole show relies on the fact that the viewer has to care for its characters,doesn\'t it?Due to a ""Side effect"" of using their magic wands and the fact that Rina went overboard by using many of them,she ends up in a coma at the hospital.Apparently all Magical Girls have a non-replenishment amount of mana points,the more they use a magic wand(Any magic wand,not just theirs),the more their lifespan gets shortened,which could be used as a justification plot-wise to not just abuse their powers left and right but as it will turns out later,all characters are too dumb to use their powers intelligently so it wasn\'t even necessary anyway.Anyway,thanks to Rina\'s notebook,Aya and Yatsumura manages to locate another Magical Girl(It\'s not clear HOW Rina figured out who were the other magical girls),and since they\'re now aware of the ""Tempest"",they\'re trying to gather allies,so they go after her.This other magical girl is called Nijimi,which is an idol whose magic wand\'s power is to mind control people with voice commands,in other words,every command she issue with her voice will be enacted by whoever hears it,it\'s like the Geass power in Code Geass but without restrictions saved the limited mana points like the rest of the girls.Nijimi\'s magic wand is probably the most peculiar as it\'s literally a pair of panties,eh,whatever.Turns out that this Nijimi is...yet another psychopath,not Rina\'s level psychopath,but somewhat in her range.She had her best friend killed by Rina because she wanted to get her magic wand,so she is looking to get her revenge by killing her...and she is obsessed about it.Since Aya and Yatsumura wants to get more information from Rina,which is still in coma,they decide not to tell Nijimi about the girl\'s whereabouts.Oh yeah I said that Nijimi is a psychopath but haven\'t explained why;Aside from her anger issues that are literally called as it is in the anime,she has several of her fans enslaved in her home using her wand\'s power.You known.The girl which is nationwide-famous which probably has enough money to hire at least a couple of butlers,instead use her wand to enslave people to work for free,yeah,very sane,and yet another character which I don\'t care if she lives or dies;I may be a broken clock by repeating this but one of the fundamentals for a good anime is caring,if the viewer doesn\'t care about the characters,how can he like the rest of the show?Anyway,it will be irrelevant but it\'s worth mentioning because ""Irrelevant"" doesn\'t mean ""Not annoying"" and thus worth reporting,there\'s a background character,a fan of Nijimi,rather,a mind-crazed fan of Nijimi,that stalks her and that be later killed in a future episode,his whole existence in the anime made next to no difference wasn\'t for Aya casually witnessing its murder(Will talk about this later),but besides that,such an useless character that only waste the viewer\'s time.Later in the episode(3),Sarina returns into the scene and now she is been offered a magic wand by a site admin(I forgot to mention,the girls first gets in contact with this supernatural organization by a ""Magical Girl Site"",that\'s controlled by various site admins),for the reason you may expect:Revenge,of course,because Sarina suspects that Aya was responsible for the death of the other 2 bullies even tho she hadn\'t witness it.Episode 4 is pretty uneventful,Nijimi gets into the same school of Aya and Yatsumura,meanwhile it\'s revealed how Aya\'s bullying started,with Aya basically failing to say ""Thank you"" to Sarina since she was a little bit kind to her at the beginning,yeah,sure,whatever,she would have been eventually a target sooner or later anyway,that was just an excuse to trigger the bullying.Anyway,Nijimi becomes sort of friends with Aya and Yatsumura,which they still kept the fact they know of Nijimi\'s friend\'s assassin a secret(It\'s Rina,the one still in coma at the hospital),meanwhile Sarina eavesdrop a conversation between Aya and Yatsumura about Rina and of course,goes straight to inform Nijimi,while preparing an ambush at Yatsumura\'s home,because she is mad at her for injuring her neck,so the natural and sane reaction is that she needs to die too.Episode 5 is mostly Sarina fighting with Aya as Yatsumura got an early KO due to a surprise attack;Sarina\'s magic wand it\'s basically a yo-yo that can cut stuff,uhm,not exactly the most overpowered thing she could have get but whatever.Aya is still as a crybaby as in the first episode and refuses to fight back Sarina,even after she threatened not only her life,but her friend\'s too.Oh yeah,while we\'re at this,let\'s reveal Yatsumura\'s secret:She kept prisoner the murder of her parents in her home so she could torture him;Of all the psychopaths in this show Yatsumura is the most relatable one,becuase yeah,the guy deserves it.Unfortunately for Yatsumura,she doesn\'t get her revenge to the guy since Sarina decides to kill him because why not,it\'s not like Sarina had a grudge towards the guy nor she knew what he had done,but remember this is an evil anime so evil things have to happen so the guy dies,whatever.The entire apartment complex get demolished by Sarina\'s attacks,but just moments before the whole thing collapse on the girl\'s head,Aya saves Sarina by teleporting her away,while she protects herself and Yatsumura with one of the wands Rina collected,one that is capable to generate a force field of sort,that protects both girls.It will be later mentioned that several other people died in the building collapse,so add that to the list of killed people by Sarina,in case somehow you found her relatable.Anyway,now basically everyone but Sarina is at the hospital,and yet another magical girl shows up...In episode 6,Nijimi shows at Aya\'s house and immediately falls in love with Aya\'s piece of trash brother,which has been suspecting about Aya and her friend and even finds traces in the internet history of her sister about the Magical Girl Site thing...so word after word,he finds out what\'s going on.Meanwhile at the hospital,the new girl is called Kosame,a girl that for some reason is the second in terms of user favorities after Aya in the MyAnimeList site,no idea why,maybe because she is not a psychopath like the rest?,anyway,her wand is a paper cutter,and it\'s power is healing,but unlike the other wands,on top of the usual mana consumption,this wand also requires the user blood to be swallowed by the target to take effect(It doesn\'t replenish the mana by the way),which is very convenient considering Kosame used to cut herself anyway.So,Kosame heals up everyone and tells the other girls what she knows about the whole story.Apparently,there\'s another group of Magical Girls that has found out about the ""Tempest"",the Magical Girl Site,and the Site Admins that apparently go out and kill the girls who try to investigate the matter.In this episode there\'s also the biggest ""Mask off"" moment of the anime.Apparently,the tempest\'s arrival is inevitable,but there\'s one way to survive:To feed the King\'s hunger(Whoever is the King);The King feeds on humanity\'s negative energy,and offering that to him will allow the girl to avoid death during the Tempest.The negative energy is stored in the magic sticks and it\'s collect by,you guessed,doing evil stuff.So basically the anime admits that it has build its whole premise around doing evil stuff for evil\'s sake,because doing evil stuff is necessary to gather negative energy which is necessary to survive the Tempest,and it\'s necessary because...of course,because the anime says so.And that\'s why I called it at the start just violence porn,things have to happen because it decided that have to happen,the plot it\'s just an excuse.Anyway,Kosame offers the girls to ally with the rest of the group to fight the real villains - the site admins,which as already said,go around killing the magical girls for investigating too much.Now one question someone logical would ask is:If these site admins can just go around killing stuff on their own,why not collect the negative energy themselves?,and what\'s the point of killing the magical girls anyway? What happens after they investigate?,they refuse to continue the collecting thing?,is that even a problem considering they have apparently no issues replacing them?,maybe they have some headquarters that can be tracked down?,who knows,but it feels way too insecure and over cautions for beings that appear to be so all-mighty.There\'s also a few very short scenes of other magical girls getting killed because why tell when you can show evil am I right?Episode 7,now there\'s a bunch of other girls I don\'t even wanna bother talking too much about those,there\'s one with super physical abilities,the one that read minds,the one that flies on a broom,the one with a sword and...did I forget anyone?,oh yeah,there\'s also a crossdresser,why not,I guess being female isn\'t a requisite.Anyway,Rina ALSO joins the school with Aya and Yastsumura,while Nijimi is in class and guess what?,she immediately snaps and almost orders her to kill herself but Aya and Yatsumura manages to tackle her and Aya even removes her magic wand...whatever.Later that day,after the manage to calm down Nijimi,they convince her to cooperate with the rest of the group,their current goal is to kidnap a site admin to extract information from it...sounds a bit crazy but whatever;Oh,also Yatsumura instead of using Nijimi\'s magic wand,she just hide it somewhere,ugh,she could have used it to ensure Nijimi would behave or something,I\'m not saying making her slave but at least hold her grudge against Rina,which is,by the way,a very justified grudge since as far as I know Nijimi\'s friend did nothing wrong to deserve being killed by that psychopath.Anyway,all the magical girls have a talk and decide to ally together bla bla there\'s no real plan yet,but it\'s a start I guess.Meanwhile Sarina manages to recover all the wands who were lost during that building collapse,I forgot to mention that none of girls have their magic wands(Expect for the newcomers);You would think that,if you were Yatsumura and had lost her magic wand,she would use Nijimi\'s,just in case,but nope,instead she and Aya go around completely unarmed while hiding the second strongest magic wand in the anime after Yatsumura\'s time-stopping one,okay,very stupid.Episode 8 beach time wtf?,sure the logic is to have the girls share a happy memory since they all realized that they won\'t ever get into adulthood,but still just like most of the anime,it feels somewhat forced.Anyway,half of an episode later Yatsumura finds out that Nijimi\'s magic wand disappeared from her locker,good job! and you will never guess who stole it - Aya\'s psychopath brother,who had been in contact with Nijimi who told her that they stole her magic wand and he offered to find it back - obviously Nijimi is too enraptured by...what was his name again I need to check...right,Kaname,Aya\'s piece of trash brother...anyway,Kaname,which is dumb but still a lot smarter than Yasumura,puts on Nijimi\'s wand which I remember is a girl\'s panties,if the idea is already repulsive don\'t worry,the anime will make sure to show Kaname wearing them.Now once you\'re done puking let\'s get back to what is happening in this dumb episode,remember that background character,that Nijimi\'s fan that stalked her?,he saw Kaname talking to her so he is now stalking him and wants to kill him because of course,psychopathic fan think Nijimi shouldn\'t be in a relationship with anyone so Kaname has to die - or so he wish,because Kaname,using the magic wand,easily disposes of him by simply telling him to kill himself...that\'s the extent of the presence of that character,what a waste of time.Anyway,turns out SOMEHOW Aya has seen the entire scene,this despite the beach and the street being separated by an huge wall;There\'s a shot in the scene where you see Aya crouching next to the wall which clearly appears taller than her even considering she is crouching...yet for some reason Aya was on top of the wall,watching it happened,yeah,get your facts straight anime.Episode 9 and here things start to get not only dumb,but also completely nonsensical.Remember when I said there was a magical girl capable of reading minds?,yeah,she reads Aya\'s mind discovering who stole Nijimi\'s magic wand(Aya didn\'t want to tell the others of course,she must protect that nice and good brother of her right),so this magical girl called Suirenji,the crossdresser which is biologically speaking a boy but whatever let\'s call it a she anyway since it doesn\'t really matter.So Suirenji whose name I need to copy-paste because it\'s too complicated to type goes after Aya\'s brother with two other girls:The one that can fly with a broom and the one with enhanced physical capabilities and...at first it seems like the girl(Named Asahi),manages to knock down Kaname(Which remember,still is wearing the magic mind-control panties),but instead of finishing him off or taking away its magic wand SUPER IMMEDIATELY like any non braindead person would do against someone who only needs a couple of seconds to tell you to kill yourself she waste time and gets ambushed by Nijimi who has been previously mind controlled by Kaname to protect him and guess what - the second most absurd scene in the anime happens,the girl with supposed enhanced strenght gets immobilized by Nijimi,which is even smaller than her,that strangles her,yep,makes as much sense as it sound(That\'s it,it doesn\'t).Anyway Kaname orders Asahi to go kill whoever is controlling her(Because this whole time Asahi was mind controlled by Suirenji TOO MANY NAMES TO REMEMBER DAMN IT),and she immediately runs out to stab Suirenji with her arm(This time not wasting time like a total moron like she did earlier),and immediately snaps back to sanity after that...the girl that can fly on a broom(Named Mikari,good thing this one is easy to type),brings the injured girl back to the main group where the one that can heal(Kosame),is.Remember Kaname\'s order?,to kill whoever was controlling Asahi?,yeah turns out the magic wand\'s power is not that precise since Suirenji is still alive but somehow Asahi didn\'t finish her...another plot hole?,the writer being dumb?,both?,who knows.Anyway,still episode 9 here,the other girls are all located at a mansion where the girl with the sword lives(Named Sayuki),this one has an entire security service made of dozen armed men which is laughable against frigging magic...and guess what?,just as expected the men gets slaughtered easily by Kaname,just like that,who could have imagined?,I mean,beside anyone with half a brain...not to mention that the so-called ""Genius"" brother(He says so himself),could have used his power to turns those armed men into his personal army or just tell them to go away but remember me calling this anime violence porn?,yeah,bad things have to happen no matter what,who cares about logic?Kaname gets into the room where all the girls(Including the one injured by Asahi),are located and immediately immobilize everyone by simply saying ""Sit"",and just like that a room full of magical girls it\'s child\'s play apparently.Good thing Kaname for some reason brought with him Nijimi,still mind controlled,because dozen of big armed men are useless to mind control but a little frail girl definitely worth bringing her over,yeah,sure;Anyway,turns out Suirenji who has been partially healed by Kosame barely manages to override Kaname\'s mind control and free Nijimi(Yeah she can apparently both read the mind AND control it),which in a fit of rage lunges as Kaname which reacts fast enough by slicing her with Sayuki\'s sword.Nijimi falls to the ground but somehow manages to pull enough strenght to get up,break a glass bottle and stab Kaname in the throat,the same guy who 10 seconds ago reacted fast enough against a much healthier Nijimi who lunged at him yet somehow was caught of guard by a 90% dead girl the second time,okay,sure.Kaname tries to heal himself with Kosame\'s magic wand but a mysterious invisible entity stops him.When the other girls return to their senses Kaname disappeared and Nijimi is dead.Episode 10,not much going on in this episode besides Sarina reappearing and joining with Aya against the site admins,seems like after discovering how they treated the magical girls that she had a change of heart and now she is one of the good guys,never mind what she has done to Aya or the people she has killed in the building collapse nahh forget about that it\'s all good now.There\'s Nijimi\'s funeral going on and all the magical girls attend to it,however the site admin has decided to get rid of all of them by making the whole place explode,which ultimately doesn\'t accomplish anything because Sarina had informed Aya of what was going to happen and also brought back the lost magic wands,including Aya\'s that allows her to teleport everyone away just before the explosion.Oh,forgot to mention that Rina also tells Nijimi(At her funeral),that she is sorry for having killed her friend,yeah,a bit too late now to apologize with Nijimi being dead and stuff,not to mention the real victim is Nijimi\'s friend,Erika,but whatever,dead people don\'t complain anymore so,moving on.Sarina have a talk with the rest of the magical girls and after Aya\'s proposal of basically taking on all site admins by herself with Sarina being denied because it was something so dumb even the characters of this anime could tell,they ultimately decide to do the smart thing and ally together.Episode 11 more dumb stuff,this time the girls try to ambush one of the site admins but for some reason they let only Rina fight for most of the time with her original magic wand which is just...an hammer,yeah,an hammer,who doesn\'t really appear to be anything special other than maybe being lightweight and still striking like a ""Normal"" heavy hammer...nothing magic about it in other words,yet for SOME reason they decide that she is the one to fight against a site admin,with Aya and Yatsumura watching her just a few dozen meters away,you know,by now Yatsumura has her wand back,she could easily stop the time and kill anyone,but nope,because conveniently she has almost no mana left,Aya tries her best to not let her do anything...forget about the fact that anyone can use anyone else\'s wand,let\'s just leave the strongest wand in the anime to the girl that won\'t use it because she is out of mana,yeah,right,how more dumb this anime can get?,ohh,just you wait,it gets even dumber very soon.Meanwhile,another group of magical girls that for some reason weren\'t with the others to ambush the site admin,rush to the place where the others are but gets stopped by another site admin,and a fight ensues.Meanwhile,the main group,which also has Sarina I forgot to mention,finally starts to join the fight instead of watching Rina almost getting killed for no reason,and they quickly take down the site admin,which appears not to be an human as it doesn\'t bleed nor it feels pain,yet when it dies its outer shell breaks and it appears as if it\'s a young girl...okay,whatever,another site admin shows up and quickly injures Sarina,putting her out of the fight,and now...Yatsumura does the most stupid thing the universe of anime ever witness,she take her wand,you known,the strongest one in the anime,the one that can stop time,and she just points it at the site admin,instead of,you know,use it?,nahh!,let\'s just point it at the site admin which promptly hit the wand with a long distance attack(The same that had incapacitated Sarina moments before and that Yatsumura saw),and destroys it.There are not words to describe just how baffled I am,the sheer,utter,gigantic stupidity of this anime is mind blowing,I\'d ask ""What were you thinking you hyper moron??"" but I don\'t think Yatsumura had a reason to do it,she just did because the writer couldn\'t come up with anything intelligent to counter a time-stopping machine so he simply had it destroyed...great.Yatsumura,which had hold herself back from using wands due to her low mana left,uses the other wand that creates a force field to protect Aya,Sarina and Rina,while she dies after running out of mana,why she didn\'t cast the force field so she was inside too? no idea!,not like it was important anyway,she would die anyway immediately after...whatever!Anyway last episode...won\'t bother actually telling much of this one since it\'s a bunch of nonsense,the other group manages to kill the site admin;Yatsumura gets revived after the head of the site admins decides to make her a site admin,and she tries to kill Aya after her original time-stopping wand gets restored,somehow.Oh,her magic-stopping wand now doesn\'t stop time anymore,it just shoots energy projectiles which are incredible ineffective since they can\'t seem to severely damage an undefended Aya,makes sense!Yatsumura ""Somehow"" snaps out of her trance and regains her personality,immediately facing against the site admin...Aya manages to kill the site admin by teleporting her in front of a moving train...right,how did she knows there was a train in that place in that exact same moment?,who knows! coincidence I guess? Anyway,as I said I don\'t want to talk much about this episode because it\'s...bah,there\'s tons of things hinting at a second season but I\'m really not interested in watching anymore of this stuff...To finish this review:This anime tries too hard at making the viewer care for incredibly psychopathic characters in incredibly twisted and messed up circumstances but tries so hard to it disconnects so much from reality and relatability that it\'s really hard to feel anything for the characters,making this excuse of a plot totally ineffective to convey a meaningful experience.If you like seeing girls suffering and lots of senseless death while keeping your brain off, go have a look at this anime,otherwise stay away from this.3 out 10', 'it\'s certainly not for everyone, but i quite liked it. it was definitely only dark just to be dark, but it\'s not nearly as depressing as i thought it would be going in. my friends recommended it to me and said that it was extremely gruesome, but it was a little underwhelming. not saying i didn\'t like it, i\'m happy it wasn\'t as bad as my friends remembered it. i\'m just saying that if you think it\'s going to be absolutely horrid, then you\'ll be pleasantly surprised.i don\'t think this show deserves all the ""not recommended"". it WAS just trying to be edgy, but i...think it still worked. think it still worked.', ""I genuinely couldn't stop watching. It was 2am, I was exhausted from a long day, but I couldn't wait to figure out what happens in the next episode. Maybe it was my love for other similar magical girl tragedies, such as Magical Girl Raising Project, but there were so many intense plot twists throughout every episode, and a relatively happy ending. Despite what the the ratings say despising the anime, the visuals are highly appealing, the characters have quite a lot of depth considering the short span of the episodes, and you end up feeling a mixed bag of emotions towards the MC throughout this...season.As the synopsis concurs, the plot of the anime is about unfortunate girls placed in a fortunate position, which they soon find out is soon going to kill them over use of their 'stick'. I really wish they could have used another word for their weapons lol, but it works. The tragic hero of the story we soon come to learn is mainly the MC's original bully, which is where I lay my few critiques. I was confused how the bully of the story who was out for blood suddenly turned around one episode and decided to help the MC after fighting tooth in nail to murder her for the loss of her friends and her scar. It made no sense and was simply covered up by 'Oh, I was tired of the admin bossing me around'? I disliked that there wasn't shots from all angles, but it made time for the characters later in the series to have more screen time to build an emotional connection to the audience so they would be more affected when, and if, any of them died, like Tsuyu did.I was mildly confused as to how she died, became an admin, and then just suddenly became fine again. And, considering the fact it seems none of the other admins have a limit on their abilities and whether or not it would kill them, why in the last scene of the episode show her wrist displaying her sigil was low on life? It didn't make sense to me, assuming now she was without restraint on her abilities. Could there be some hidden unmentioned 'recharge' time for abilities? Or did some just cost more 'life' than others?Another thing to outline, is how the cross-gendering side character is able to connect with other magical girls and hear them dying during the (super overused, but stay with me here) beach scene. If his abilities are always being used and will connect him to other girls, and he uses his stick more frequently than the other magical girls, how did he not meet the same fate as many of the others who used their abilities and died?A few of these inconsistencies could be cleared up easily with a second season which the viewers have been teased about nonstop for around a year or two now, and yet no cigar. Overall, this anime was a really pleasant watch and a lovely way for me to spend my night delving into the plot and characters. I hope to hear if this series will be getting a revival anytime soon. season.As the synopsis concurs, the plot of the anime is about unfortunate girls placed in a fortunate position, which they soon find out is soon going to kill them over use of their 'stick'.

She soon finds friends, who are also magical girls like herself, that provide her strength. Aya and her friends also face enemies.the whole anime itself its pretty edgy however This series has an excellent premise and aesthetics. Each magical girl gets their own stick from the Mahou Shoujo Site, which have different abilities, and their lifespan is converted to magical energy for the stick. So, the more they use the sticks, the lesser...time they have to live. These girls are monitored by ‘Site Admins’ and I can’t say more because that’s spoilers. The Site counts down to an event called ‘Tempest’ represented by sperms fertilizing a… something.Characters:Aya’s brother is a piece of shit. The end.Just kidding, these people have got to be the most tragic group of magical girls I’ve seen (that including those from Ikusei Keikaku) There are so many badass and likeable characters, and they’ve got their motive and backstories and stuff. Even those that seem like were there just to expand the cast ended up being good characters. Down side is that I felt the characters weren’t treated fairly by many of the writing decisions in the story.Story:To say the least, it was so depressing. MHS is about Aya, who’s abused by her brother and bullied at school in horrible ways, but in the end, Aya is still a nice, selfless girl.MHS started out solid. Solid characters, solid conflict, solid mystery. I was dying to know what the hell Tempest was. It was the signature suspense that this author is good at. However, it dropped somewhere in the middle, where the story felt like it’s starting to drag itself out. Same issue as this author’s other series.The late chapters of MHS just had me constantly going WTF because of… a lot of things. There are many inconsistencies (ex. with the issue of Kiyoharu’s gender, the plot only counts her as a girl only when it wants her to be). There’s time travel and alternate realities and all those fun stuff that aren’t actually so fun. I understand that this series is a spinoff of Mahou Shoujo of the End, but you just can’t jump right into the parent story and have the characters appear as cameos out of literally nowhere… I had to sit down and explain the whole plot of Mahou Shoujo OTE to my friend, who’s a MHS fan, who was genuinely disappointed by the ending.I felt like many aspects of the plot are just there for ‘shock’ and weren’t necessary aside from that. Shock! Out of nowhere! Okay, let’s move on to more horrible things.Overall rating:I don’t know how to feel about this series. I loved it when I started out, and my love died out somewhere in between when the plot started getting too long and messy.The manga itself is quite good for a large portion of its run, but due to horrible writing decisions, crashed badly in the latter portions.

I\'ve seen a good number of magical girl anime and while they all have some merit, Magical Girl Site, while also having one or two small points in its favor, has got to *easily* be the worst I\'ve seen.  The ""camp"" factor does not save it.  Where shall I begin?  I\'ll jump around:The first episode.  Overly violent to the point of being completely unnecessary.  On top of this, the violence factor is totally lopsided, mostly being piled in this one episode, so even viewers come came for the ""messed...up"" kind of content (I saw this recommended alongside the excellent Madoka Magica, LOL) will be disappointed that it drops off like a rock.  I\'m not a fan of animal abuse as a motivator when it\'s used in such a crass way either.  -1 for ripping off Elfen Lied in an utterly tasteless manner.The characters.  Holy ****ing moly.  The MC is as useless as the one from Blood C and the rest are all literal psychopaths that fit right in the mold of Gasai Yuno from Mirai Nikki.  Somehow the creators of this anime actually managed to make psycho girls boring because they\'re all fighting for the spotlight here and none of them shine.  Think a girl is normal?  No, she\'s got a penchant for murder.  It\'s literally nearly the whole cast taking up the same pigeon hole.  Yawn.The plot.  It\'s all over the place alongside with the characters\' motivations and personalities.  A girl that wants to murder them all in one episode is completely complacent in the next with no explanation.  We go on one plot thread only to drop it the next episode.  The only through-line is the Tempest.  The rest is like a game of telephone, as if the writers forgot what they were doing in the previous episode and decided to meander in a new direction in the next.  The barest minimum sense of continuity.  New characters get randomly introduced half way through the show for some reason and we\'re supposed to care.The utter unoriginality of it all.  I can\'t think of really, anything that Magical Girl Site does that another anime before it didn\'t do better.The one thing I will say in this anime\'s favor is that the big brother character is absolutely hilarious, as are his outro monologues.  He is also the one aspect that might be original?  But this single amusing factor does not a good anime make.Avoid unless you want something to laugh at with your friends with how unbelievably stupid it is. up"" kind of content (I saw this recommended alongside the excellent Madoka Magica, LOL) will be disappointed that it drops off like a rock.

But this single amusing factor does not a good anime make.Avoid unless you want something to laugh at with your friends with how unbelievably stupid it is.', 'After Madoka Magica grew to be more mainstream, almost every other series wanted to be the next edgy magical girl anime. From what I know the author of the original manga had made Site as a spinoff to Mahou Shoujo of The End/Magical Girl Apocalypse, which barely counts as a magical girl manga since it was just strange creatures that were only called magical girls. Site, however, actually tries to incorporate the magical girl style.First off, if you\'re just going to ignore my review, I want to give you a trigger warning. For what specifically? Everything. I\'m not kidding. Everything in the series was edgy...just for edginess sake. An entire character based on self-harm, a middle schooler who\'s ""magical stick"" is a pair of underwear that is emphasized very frequently throughout the show, a character designed to mock trans people, and a main character who had no real point of living on after being endlessly abused is only the tip of the iceberg.The main character being a constant victim of extreme bullying was a plot in itself, but it just kept adding another form of abuse and it kept going on and on. Anything you could put under the umbrella of fucked up is probably in here. Mind you, these are 14-year-olds. Middle schoolers.Since I made the comparison to Madoka, I should elaborate more. Madoka works because it isn\'t constantly outdoing itself and knows when to take a break and when to stab you in the gut, meanwhile it\'s consistently sad but never goes into an absurd or unnatural level in which it doesn\'t fit in just to make you feel bad for a character like Site does. Making your main character, the face of your series, their only personality being them being constantly tortured, is proof that you can\'t write a good character.Then, there\'s just characters who have no real purpose of existing and are only there to add a tiny bit of plot. Kosame only existed to heal Rina\'s illness and her whole character is based on self-harm for no real reason. Kiyoharu, while being blatantly transphobic with the writers saying ""Kiyoharu actually thinks he is a girl"" only existed to show Kaname that people with male organs can use magical sticks and that motivated Kaname to steal Nijimi\'s ""stick.""The anime is rushed and tried to mash up a long story into 12 episodes and missed some of the biggest plot points. Like oh for example, the main character\'s love interest being HER SISTER. I could go on about how bad the manga is but this is just the anime we\'re talking about.Overall, it\'s just bad. If you want a magical girl horror anime, Madoka is your best bet. It\'s around the same length as the anime adaptation of Site but it\'s worth your time and actually puts depth into side characters. just for edginess sake.

So I\'m putting this at the end, sorry :))) ', ""Magical Girl Site is an exercise in disappointment.What could have been a not-perfect-but-at-least-good series was ruined by a mangaka who had no idea what planning ahead meant. It feels less than cohesive.It's a shame. The designs are solid, the story could have worked if it was actually planned (and a certain set of pantsu was removed from the plot). And every time a character fundamentally completely changes with no explanation, and every time a plot thread gets abandoned, I think of this and am disappointed.The good parts of this anime are the romance between the two lead characters and the character designs. The bad...parts are, well, most of the rest of it.Also, content warning for everything that could possibly be in an edgy anime. parts are, well, most of the rest of it.Also, content warning for everything that could possibly be in an edgy anime."", 'I don\'t like mahou shoujo site. Infact, together with seikon no qwaser it is at the very bottom of my likes. I have watched the anime and read the manga several times to see whether I could still pull out some things I like, and I did.I like dark magical girl quite a lot (or rather, Madoka Magica is my all time favourite anime), but this executed the concept of it in a... queer way. In this case, queer is to be taken negatively.Mahou shoujo site starts off with a very poorly treated girl who tried to commit suicide in the first 29...seconds after the opening. She is abused by her big brother, later revealed to be negelected by her father, and her mother barely spoke a single word in the entire series (a protagonist with both aprents alive!!). Additionaly she is bullied at school by three girls. Cause of bullying: because she did not say ""Thank you"". Yes. Apparently, that is a reason to fill someones shoes with razor blades, shoving their head down the toilet and calling a senior to r*pe her in the first 13 minutes of the entire anime. One day she finds a website called the ""Magical girl site."" A rather eerie looking creature with human like shape (I remember that creatures face especially well because I watched the entire anime in one run in the middle of the night) offers her magic against payment. Short: she gets a magical object, referred to as magic stick/stick and the use of the magic exchanges lifespan. Her lifespan is tatooed onto her wrist, showing how much she has left. With that they are trying to do.... something, I suppose. The anime explained it very poorly, the manga didnt do a better job. But they tried to stop the end of the world.Now after I said all this one would expect me to feel sorry for the girl. Well, big plottwist, I dont. Why? Because it is so ridiculously over the top. It is as of the author would have asked random people on the street about how to make a sorrowfull and pityable character then wrote together the ideas of like 1000 people. Not only is it so damn stupidly over the top, it has also no base. If she would be treated like that because... idk, she killed someone, or she supports incest (yes, that was extremly poor foreshadowing), then that would be halfway understandable. But why is she treated like that? Because her brother attends an university and she was too shy to say thank you. Yes. Thats all. Litteraly. It is a poor reason. with that, its very hard to actually feel anything for her, because there is nothing to feel about. She is suffering. For absolutley no reason. The best moment in her life was when she slept with her sister. Twice. The second time when she KNEW she was her sister. You know that meme where a guy pours  ingredients for a cake into a bowl and they are labled differently for laughters sake? Well, in this case the lables would be ""edgy"", ""disturbing"", ""incest"" and ""violence"". It\'s brutality can match Elfenlied (good manga, horrible anime) and bloodliters kill la kill.The villians are a bunch of odd creatures called ""site managers"" who try to reach salvation by letting a girl made of sperm cells take over the world and making everyone into a sperm cell. No, it is even derpier than it sounds. Basically they try to stop them and suffer... and suffer.... and suffer some more... the brother gets also r*ped by a detective... they die several times and get revived again.... not to mention the general, just plain up lack of morality which can easily outmatch the lack in Euphoria, Boku no pico and Devilman Crybaby, the fact that the father wore girl panties which he stole from his son to physically control the son made it all even worse.... its messy. Messy, messy, messy. 2/10, Disturbing for the sake of being disturbing.The sound were fair enough.. decent I suppose.... not memorable or interesting but okay (my standart of judgement is No Game No Life and Madoka Magica).The characters were just as deep as an average ""gacha life depressed uwu alpha male gay femboy"" (you\'ll see what I mean if you have the guts to search for them). Edgy, insecure, agressive. To put their character depth into persepctive: If their character depth would be as deep as a glass of water, then the character depth of panty from panties and stockings would be the challenger depth. Absolutley pathetic. As someone who writes stories on their own, spends several hours everyday to take care of their characters and rounds every edge of them for the past 11 years this spits into my face. Characters are meant to be a representative of yourself. A mirror. A teacher, a friend and a child at the same time. They are your heart, each and everyone serving as a different purpose and a different part of your soul. And even if their purpose is: ""entertaining others"" you can still make them deep, because they have a purpose. Usually the character and backstory is wrapped carefully around the characters purpose and representative fraction of your mind/heart/soul, like gold leaf sheets containing experience, time and emotions, especially love, wrapped over a tiny diamond until they become a ball of pure gold and magnificence. Mahou Shoujo Site rather seems like the author squeezed a bunch of aluminium foil over the plain concept of ""edgy"" then added a grain of ""mahou shoujo"" as topping. Bad. Just. Bad. It\'s not just simply not enough effort and time. It\'s a lack of the very CORE of the characters, their purpose. -1/10. It\'s just that bad.The enjoyment was probably predicatble. It\'s like watching a horror movie but minus the tension. Just disturbing, leaving you with nothing more but slightly more resistance against gore and heavily damaged sense of moral.1/10.Overall it is an average of 2.4 because the art was fairly detailed and waay better than Madoka Magica (even though No Game No Life is still unmatched) so it\'s just about a 2.That is my opinion, and if you like this anime, it\'s absolutley fine! I am glad to hear people praising something I don\'t like, so I get a better view on it, depending on what they say. seconds after the opening.

Well, in this case the lables would be ""edgy"", ""disturbing"", ""incest"" and ""violence"". It\'s brutality can match Elfenlied (good manga, horrible anime) and bloodliters kill la kill.The villians are a bunch of odd creatures called ""site managers"" who try to reach salvation by letting a girl made of sperm cells take over the world and making everyone into a sperm cell. No, it is even derpier than it sounds. Basically they try to stop them and suffer... and suffer.... and suffer some more... the brother gets also r*ped by a detective... they die several times and get revived again.... not to mention the general, just plain up lack of morality which can easily outmatch the lack in Euphoria, Boku no pico and Devilman Crybaby, the fact that the father wore girl panties which he stole from his son to physically control the son made it all even worse.... its messy. Messy, messy, messy. 2/10, Disturbing for the sake of being disturbing.The sound were fair enough.. decent I suppose.... not memorable or interesting but okay (my standart of judgement is No Game No Life and Madoka Magica).The characters were just as deep as an average ""gacha life depressed uwu alpha male gay femboy"" (you\'ll see what I mean if you have the guts to search for them). Edgy, insecure, agressive. To put their character depth into persepctive: If their character depth would be as deep as a glass of water, then the character depth of panty from panties and stockings would be the challenger depth. Absolutley pathetic. As someone who writes stories on their own, spends several hours everyday to take care of their characters and rounds every edge of them for the past 11 years this spits into my face. Characters are meant to be a representative of yourself. A mirror. A teacher, a friend and a child at the same time. They are your heart, each and everyone serving as a different purpose and a different part of your soul. And even if their purpose is: ""entertaining others"" you can still make them deep, because they have a purpose. Usually the character and backstory is wrapped carefully around the characters purpose and representative fraction of your mind/heart/soul, like gold leaf sheets containing experience, time and emotions, especially love, wrapped over a tiny diamond until they become a ball of pure gold and magnificence. Mahou Shoujo Site rather seems like the author squeezed a bunch of aluminium foil over the plain concept of ""edgy"" then added a grain of ""mahou shoujo"" as topping. Bad. Just. Bad. It\'s not just simply not enough effort and time. It\'s a lack of the very CORE of the characters, their purpose. -1/10. It\'s just that bad.The enjoyment was probably predicatble. It\'s like watching a horror movie but minus the tension. Just disturbing, leaving you with nothing more but slightly more resistance against gore and heavily damaged sense of moral.1/10.Overall it is an average of 2.4 because the art was fairly detailed and waay better than Madoka Magica (even though No Game No Life is still unmatched) so it\'s just about a 2.That is my opinion, and if you like this anime, it\'s absolutley fine! I am glad to hear people praising something I don\'t like, so I get a better view on it, depending on what they say.', ""Magical girl site:personal reviewCharacter:this anime has some bad character production they're making the main mc (aya asagiri) as a weak person who judt acepted her fate being abuse and hated even with her own brother who think her as a sandbag so he could Release his anger by abusing aya to make him feel better of himself cus of his mental problem and i think they make bad figure character  by making them greedy and unemotional puppet (sorry idk how to express it) that doesn't even care about their condition or something happen to other personStoryline:i would say the storyline is more bad and...confusing then the character because it all start from a girl that got bully on her school getting abuse from her own brother and turn the story into a depressed magicak girl that had to risk their life if they're using their own magic wand to slay another magical girl with endless purpose to serve the administration to fulfill their true ambiton and that is to build one big event called the tempestAnd i think the writter of this anime has lack of idea and just making some stuff into some edgy gore stuff without thingking that will ruin the show after allAnimation:i wouldn't complain about the animation or the graphic at all even tho its quite geeky a bit for the character design but i guess everything else is just ok nothing elseMy final rate:c+ im not gonna recommended this anime if u dont like edgy gore anime with confusing story and quite bad storyline for me its a total dissapointment since i expect this anime to be a good mahou yeet with some good gore but after i see this anime i think this anime was a bit of failure for dark magical girl animeThe positive thing that i get from this anime:-if the world hating on u dont give up because u are deserve to be loved and supported from other people-never ever trust any website that offers free stuff Without think it twice.-sometimes the people who hurt u will be ur friend or even the one who will save u from ur own mistakes(This series could have good potential to be good if the writter is srs about doing the job and making better character role or for simple giving a lil bit of happy moment on the anime) confusing then the character because it all start from a girl that got bully on her school getting abuse from her own brother and turn the story into a depressed magicak girl that had to risk their life if they're using their own magic wand to slay another magical girl with endless purpose to serve the administration to fulfill their true ambiton and that is to build one big event called the tempestAnd i think the writter of this anime has lack of idea and just making some stuff into some edgy gore stuff without thingking that will ruin the show after allAnimation:i wouldn't complain about the animation or the graphic at all even tho its quite geeky a bit for the character design but i guess everything else is just ok nothing elseMy final rate:c+ im not gonna recommended this anime if u dont like edgy gore anime with confusing story and quite bad storyline for me its a total dissapointment since i expect this anime to be a good mahou yeet with some good gore but after i see this anime i think this anime was a bit of failure for dark magical girl animeThe positive thing that i get from this anime:-if the world hating on u dont give up because u are deserve to be loved and supported from other people-never ever trust any website that offers free stuff Without think it twice.-sometimes the people who hurt u will be ur friend or even the one who will save u from ur own mistakes(This series could have good potential to be good if the writter is srs about doing the job and making better character role or for simple giving a lil bit of happy moment on the anime)"", ""This is my first time writing a review so this might not be good fueee~anyways let's startSTORY: I like the story, though it isn't anything new, I do like the premise of using your lifespan as the cost for powers, unlike most mahou shoujo shows at least from what I've seen, people call this show 'edgy' and things along those lines from what I've heard and I can see why they do so, but, I enjoy these edgy shows for who knows why, though, too much edge is just not my thing *ahem* Kirito.ART: The art is very cutesy, I can't describe it with any...other word than that.

Sorry if it sucks."", 'Seeing this anime get dissed on so much is kinda funny. Just comes to show how many people think of sunshine and rainbows when they think of magical girl anime.Let me say this now: this anime isn’t sunshine and rainbows. It’s a much darker version of the magical girl genre and has its own unique twist that I couldn’t help but be fascinated by! As someone who has watched shows like Sailor Moon and absolutely obsessed over it, this anime is like that but even darker.Be warned now that this show has discussion of suicide, self harm, rape, cancer, death, abuse, bullying, etc. Imagine it...as a magical girl anime but where everything is opposite: girls get powers because of misfortune and despair. The main character isn’t a bubbly clutz with a male love interest, instead she’s a broken girl recovering from the past while still having so much to handle in the present. She’s even a lesbian! That’s something I haven’t seen in a protagonist before and, as part of the LGBT community, I loved that.Speaking of this, the first canonly transgender magical girl is in this anime! She isn’t a crossdresser, nor is she simply the butt of everyone’s jokes. Instead, she gets treated equally and is supported by the main characters! When I first heard this was canon, I remember frantically messaging my friend because I was so excited over it! Finally, the transgender community is treated fairly in an anime!My main criticism, however, is that so much of this anime seemed rushed. During a character’s death, the show makes it out to be some depressing, plot-changing thing, but we had little to no time to actually enjoy said character. It’s hard to empathize with characters we know little to nothing about.Along with this, many characters almost seemed... 2 dimensional? It’s like having an OC with general knowledge on what they should be like and just going off of that: it doesn’t lead to any interesting character development. Part of me wonders if this is intentional, though! This entire anime seems to be a parody of other animes in the same genre such as Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew!This anime may be edgy, but at the same time it’s nothing more than a unique idea that hasn’t been presented before.

What he did still haunts my nightmares to this day (hint it is in the beach episode), it was disgusting. The story was decent, it had potential but it wasn't executed well.

Wouldn\'t watch if you\'re sensitive to dark themes or suicidal stuff but yeah. Edgy? Yeah but I think it did it well compared to other anime of this type. Though, as I said before, that relationship Aya and Tsuyuno had was god tier, made this show a whole lot more enjoyable. There were some moments that made me go ""bruh what"" but if you turn part of your brain off its more enjoyable. Just go watch it, better to experience it than not. The romance kinda side is good, the characters are fun...for the most part, some of the visuals were amazing and the horror really hit at some parts, especially when the artists decided to change the art style for the spooky vibes.

One of those times where I know its not good but I still like it anyways. "", 'I\'d say the main quality of Magical Girl Site is its ""edginess"", but at this point, that word is thrown around so much it\'s better if I explain it a little more clearly.So, to clarify, Magical Girl Site takes a concept as cutesy as magical girls and gives it a dark and violent twist. It relies a lot on shock value, features a lot of blood and death, its characters are excessively miserable and, to top it off, most of them are just middle school girls.As in a lot of ""edgy"" anime, everything is exeggerated to the point of being silly, but in this one...there\'s a kind of ironic quality to it, giving off a feeling that the author doesn\'t take it all completely seriously, either. There are genuine moments, for sure, but there\'s still the feeling that the author knows exactly what he\'s doing with some of the more extreme moments.For example, one of the characters\' sticks, which are basically tools that give them a power, is a pair of panties, and when they use it, it\'s implied that it makes them bleed out their ass. There\'s a lot of ridiculous stuff like that in this anime (and moreso in the manga) and that\'s one of the reasons it\'s so entertaining.I can\'t completely explain why, but something about this series just draws me in. It\'s not extremely deep or profound, but I couldn\'t help getting intrigued and somehow caring for the characters. The Magical Girl Site itself makes for a pretty interesting mystery and all the unexpected reveals and plot twists are a lot of fun to watch. It\'s all pretty well-paced, too, and there\'s always something happening.The characters are nothing new, but everyone is different and their interactions are fun. None of them, except the two main ones, get much character development, but that\'s not such a big deal in this case. The moments where those two interact are surprisingly heartwarming for a series like this and the moments when the main character, Aya, stands up for herself are very satisfying.Visually, it\'s just adequate, but it matches the art of the manga very well.Its only real negative is that they didn\'t do the villains\' designs justice. In the manga, the site admins look incredibly creepy and uncanny (especially the most prominently appearing one, Nana), but in the anime they didn\'t quite match that.The animation is fairly good, with some key moments being animated better than others.The OP is surprisingly good, to the point that I never skipped it, while the ED is unique and even kind of experimental.I\'m watching this a while after reading the whole manga and it\'s a very good adaptation of the first 50-ish chapters. It did omit some parts and change the ending, but it\'s still mostly a faithful representation of the manga. Because they changed it, unfortunately they can\'t continue it anymore, but if they adapted the whole thing like this, I would definitely watch it.All in all, if shock value, amusing characters and crazy twists are enough for you, you might enjoy Magical Girl Site.

Please.', 'So, I\'m going to start a review of Mahou Shoujo Site by talking about jokes and comedy, but bear with me.Jokes have a certain anatomy, a standard structure which is essentially setup and punchline. In something like a knock knock joke these elements are easily distinguished; in something like the subtly brilliant British sitcom Peep Show, they\'re harder to pick out, but they\'re still there. This basic structure is the bare bones of all comedy.Both parts of the structure are important. The setup can be skillfully and efficiently executed for rapid fire comedy or it can be deliberately long-winded and circuitous so as to...leave the viewer not expecting the punchline when it finally arrives. But that\'s the key - the punchline is almost always a non sequitur. If it\'s predictable, you\'re unlikely to get laughs or those you do get will be diminished. It\'s that twist, the unveiling of the unexpected, that makes the punchline work. In other words, if you can see the punchline coming a mile off, its unlikely to land.Now if you look at Ancient Athenian theatre masks you have the two classics that have basically become symbols for drama or the theatre - the laughing mask of Comedy and the drooping, weepy mask of Tragedy. The two are, in their simplest, least embellished forms, perfect inversions of each other. And this is the key to understanding tragedy - it is in many ways a mirror to comedy and at its core shares the same basic structure: setup and punchline. The only real difference is that the best punchlines of tragedy will bring forth breathless sobs and not breathless laughter.I consider myself to be a bit of a connoisseur of tragedy. For whatever twisted reason I love to put myself through it; the stronger the soul-crushing pathos of its pay-off (or its punchline, to use our earlier term), the better. The only three series I\'ve ever given 10s to (as of writing) on this site all share an element of tragedy and none of their most tragic moments would work without the setup. If you skipped straight to a certain elevator ride in Made in Abyss, straight to the moment a certain character mutters ""I was stupid, so stupid"" in Madoka Magica, or straight to the words ""You\'re gonna carry that weight"" in Cowboy Bebop, it wouldn\'t work. It\'s the setup - which for those who haven\'t seen one or more of those (what have you been doing?), I\'ll leave out - that makes the tragedy hit home.Mahou Shoujo Site is filled with tragedy. But like a lame or cheesy comedy none of its punchlines hit home. In part it\'s because it doesn\'t bother with setup, at least some of the time. The rest of the time it\'s because its setup is so clumsy, its tone so thoroughly established, that nothing comes as a surprise.So let\'s talk about those no setup punchlines. Discounting a little flash-forward prologue, the first lines we hear from our protagonist, Aya Asagiri are, ""Everyday all I think about is dying."" So you can consciously acknowledge that what was just said there is sad, but there\'s no setup for it, we haven\'t been primed to care. We don\'t get any gut punch of tragedy when the punchline is delivered. Now that could be an effective start, an intriguing one even, if we were then whisked away to what seemed to be a reasonably happy point in the past and were left wondering how it all came to that. That isn\'t what happens.Instead the first episode is a pretty much uninterrupted parade of horrors from start to finish. The only times any setup is attempted, what we\'ve seen already has so primed us to expect a tragic denouement to any given situation that it comes as no surprise whatsoever when that\'s exactly what happens. At risk of spoiling the first episode, by the time the credits roll Miss Asagiri has been bullied in such a relentless and sadistic way that even her bullies are made to embody the audience\'s sentiments and get bored. A stray cat she took solace in has been... asploded on a railway. Two of her class mates are dead. Another is seriously injured. She narrowly escapes an attempted rape. Her parents are oblivious and uncaring and her brother is a sadistic nutjob who pitilessly and violently assaults her every single night. It\'s so mind-bogglingly over the top that it becomes difficult to care. It completely desensitises the audience to Aya\'s suffering. There\'s no point of comparison, no happy times to harken back to. Above I mentioned the role of the non sequitur in joke structure, well there\'s absolutely none of that here. Everything follows on precisely as expected. Frankly there\'s so much torture going on here I actually WOULD expect the Spanish Inquisition.After initially dropping this show after episode six, I recently pushed myself through its remaining episodes whilst suffering writer\'s block, vaguely curious as to whether there were any real surprises in the latter part of the show. There really aren\'t.In fairness, I suppose, there is some rising action in the plot as things progress. There are some episode to episode questions the viewer is left with. But we can always be confident that whatever happens next, it will be fucking awful. There is no contrast in this show - no light to make the shadows seem deeper. It\'s just darkness and in uninterrupted darkness our eyes adjust.I mentioned in the review of WataMote that I did immediately prior to this that Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku had called that show the most mean-spirited he had ever watched. Writing in August 2013, just one month after Magical Girl Site began its manga run, he wasn\'t to know about this travesty of a show, but let me say here and now - this show is truly, deeply mean-spirited, and yes, maybe the most so I\'ve seen. There are gorier and more violent shows, but this one seems so sadistic in its treatment of its lead and her suffering. So indifferent to it, yet so gleeful in its infliction.Of course we also need to address the big hairy mammoth in the room. And yes, in my now informed opinion this is indeed a knock-off of Madoka Magica. But worse than that, it\'s a knock-off of Madoka Magica that fails completely to understand what makes Madoka Magica good. It\'s a sadistic edgelord\'s interpretation of Madoka Magica.Now just in case you were wondering - Mahou Shoujo Site began publication in July 2013, as stated above. It was a spin-off, I am told, of Mahou Shoujo Apocalypse which began publication one year earlier in July 2012. I think that timing, in the immediate wake of Madoka Magica\'s massive success is not exactly a coincidence. Without having myself read either manga, it appears Apocalypse is far more loosely tied to Madoka Magica and only really shares the ""let\'s make magical girls dark"" theme. Site, however, uncannily closely resembles its obvious, superior progenitor. I mean, it replaces Incubators with Administrators and blurs the lines a bit with another Madoka Magica concept, but overall it\'s hard not to see the plentiful, too close to be coincidental similarities in many of the concepts on display here. Conceivably you could call it an homage, but that entails a degree of respect for the object of that homage that is not at all on display here.At the end of the day, I put myself through it for reasons that still aren\'t entirely apparent to me. I thoroughly advise that you do not. leave the viewer not expecting the punchline when it finally arrives. But that\'s the key - the punchline is almost always a non sequitur. If it\'s predictable, you\'re unlikely to get laughs or those you do get will be diminished. It\'s that twist, the unveiling of the unexpected, that makes the punchline work.

So you can consciously acknowledge that what was just said there is sad, but there\'s no setup for it, we haven\'t been primed to care. We don\'t get any gut punch of tragedy when the punchline is delivered. Now that could be an effective start, an intriguing one even, if we were then whisked away to what seemed to be a reasonably happy point in the past and were left wondering how it all came to that. That isn\'t what happens.Instead the first episode is a pretty much uninterrupted parade of horrors from start to finish. The only times any setup is attempted, what we\'ve seen already has so primed us to expect a tragic denouement to any given situation that it comes as no surprise whatsoever when that\'s exactly what happens. At risk of spoiling the first episode, by the time the credits roll Miss Asagiri has been bullied in such a relentless and sadistic way that even her bullies are made to embody the audience\'s sentiments and get bored. A stray cat she took solace in has been... asploded on a railway. Two of her class mates are dead. Another is seriously injured. She narrowly escapes an attempted rape. Her parents are oblivious and uncaring and her brother is a sadistic nutjob who pitilessly and violently assaults her every single night. It\'s so mind-bogglingly over the top that it becomes difficult to care. It completely desensitises the audience to Aya\'s suffering. There\'s no point of comparison, no happy times to harken back to. Above I mentioned the role of the non sequitur in joke structure, well there\'s absolutely none of that here. Everything follows on precisely as expected. Frankly there\'s so much torture going on here I actually WOULD expect the Spanish Inquisition.After initially dropping this show after episode six, I recently pushed myself through its remaining episodes whilst suffering writer\'s block, vaguely curious as to whether there were any real surprises in the latter part of the show. There really aren\'t.In fairness, I suppose, there is some rising action in the plot as things progress. There are some episode to episode questions the viewer is left with. But we can always be confident that whatever happens next, it will be fucking awful. There is no contrast in this show - no light to make the shadows seem deeper. It\'s just darkness and in uninterrupted darkness our eyes adjust.I mentioned in the review of WataMote that I did immediately prior to this that Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku had called that show the most mean-spirited he had ever watched. Writing in August 2013, just one month after Magical Girl Site began its manga run, he wasn\'t to know about this travesty of a show, but let me say here and now - this show is truly, deeply mean-spirited, and yes, maybe the most so I\'ve seen. There are gorier and more violent shows, but this one seems so sadistic in its treatment of its lead and her suffering. So indifferent to it, yet so gleeful in its infliction.Of course we also need to address the big hairy mammoth in the room. And yes, in my now informed opinion this is indeed a knock-off of Madoka Magica. But worse than that, it\'s a knock-off of Madoka Magica that fails completely to understand what makes Madoka Magica good. It\'s a sadistic edgelord\'s interpretation of Madoka Magica.Now just in case you were wondering - Mahou Shoujo Site began publication in July 2013, as stated above. It was a spin-off, I am told, of Mahou Shoujo Apocalypse which began publication one year earlier in July 2012. I think that timing, in the immediate wake of Madoka Magica\'s massive success is not exactly a coincidence. Without having myself read either manga, it appears Apocalypse is far more loosely tied to Madoka Magica and only really shares the ""let\'s make magical girls dark"" theme. Site, however, uncannily closely resembles its obvious, superior progenitor. I mean, it replaces Incubators with Administrators and blurs the lines a bit with another Madoka Magica concept, but overall it\'s hard not to see the plentiful, too close to be coincidental similarities in many of the concepts on display here. Conceivably you could call it an homage, but that entails a degree of respect for the object of that homage that is not at all on display here.At the end of the day, I put myself through it for reasons that still aren\'t entirely apparent to me. I thoroughly advise that you do not.', ""The plot was interesting at first. But honestly, if that was the kind of plot the writer was going for, it'd have to be very complicated and deep. I guess it wasn't planned thoroughly, had a lot of plot holes. Shitty reasons that are supposed to be answers, like the reason why heroine got bullied so much.  There was also no proper in-depth indication of how the brother turned out that way. It was really irking to watch, especially if you like to think deeply about stories. But other than that I enjoyed some of it. A show what youd call guilty pleasure I...guess. The songs were a bop too, so Im giving a 3 out of mercy. guess.

I wanted so hard to enjoy this dark magical girl anime but it just never got as good as I was hoping in any sense of the word. Art is average/unimaginative and animation is consistently clunky, the story is weak and leaves multiple open points unresolved, the cast expands but the girls are just there to provide power ups with jack all personification past it. One of the few positive points was the interesting Sticks (their individual weapons) they get, but they’re rarely...used and definitely not enough to bring it back to Worth It. I feel like I wasted nearly five hours of my life. I know every anime can’t be Madoka Magica but this was an incoherent awful attempt to be gristly that held no further weight behind it.[[spoilers from here on, as in like the very end, but why the fuck did it need to end with the brother getting Punishment Raped in the last two minutes?

"", 'To my memory, I\'m pretty sure this is my third ""Magical Girl"" anime of the year 2020. Flip Flappers, Madoka Magica and now Magical Girl Site... I read some of the review, and I was kind of surprised by them! Hopefully mine won\'t be to surprising. Let\'s get into the anime basics.Story; You begin the story with a tired looking girl named Aya Asagiri. You might just think she isn\'t getting enough sleep because of studying or playing video games; that is not the case at all. Every day she is stressed out from getting bullied at school for being to quiet, her parents neglect...her because of their fantastic son, her brother beats her like a punching bag every night to relieve stress and she has zero friends because of how shy she is. She wants to kill herself; but then a magically site pops out on her screen offering her magical powers. You then follow Aya with guilt, learning to become stronger, learning to make friends and find out if other magical girls are as unfortunate as Aya Asagirl is... Maybe it\'s my lack of Magical Girl anime\'s, but I thought the story was interesting and not rare per se but still unique enough to stand out. There\'s only so much you can do with the ""Magical Girl"" genre before it becomes Pretty Cure or Aitkatsu somehow. Art; I liked the style of the animation. The administrators stood out, looked cool/creepy and I like the cute yet somehow grungy style of the anime. Sound; The OST fit the anime really well, and I love how the worked the ending song into the last episode. I liked how they used animation, cgi and real people in the ending video as well. Characters; They had a perfect cast of characters for everyone to enjoy. Even if you didn\'t like the main cast (quiet/adorable, cold/warm-hearted and psycho/sad chicks) then side characters come along soon for the picking (the have emo, yakuza, idol, crossdressing, etc.)Overall, I really enjoy the theme of this anime. I liked how all the girls worked together, how there was happy ending although the world was going to be destroyed and it somehow didn\'t because... you guessed it, love and friendship.If you pick up this anime expecting it to be completely out of the ordinary, ignored the title and don\'t read the synopsis and still somehow end up complaining ""It\'s like every other Magical Girl anime""... why did you do that to yourself? If you don\'t enjoy Magical Girl anime\'s that are basically all the same with a slight different twist then why attempt to watch it in the first place?I suggest this anime to anyone who is a Magical Girl lover and wants to check this one off their books!

Should be the motto of this anime.It just keeps getting dumber and edgier every episode. It tries to deal with some heavy themes, e.g. torture, rape, abuse, bullying, murder, etc., but does it in such a comically overdone awful way, it actually becomes hilarious. I think such themes should be treated with some dignity, or at least some basic human decency. In the way it is portrayed, I find it hard not to laugh when yet another terrible thing meets our shy cardboard cut-out main character. It is very difficult to sympathize with any character, because they are...all awful. Not even awful people (which most of them all, anyway. Or rather, stereotypes of awfulness), just awfully written. And speaking of characters...Characters are not even 2D, they are 1D cookie-cutter stereotypes without any real reason to do anything. The story doesn\'t make much sense either, at least I couldn\'t see any. The ""characters"" constantly have information they shouldn\'t have and their actions are quite nonsensical as well.What I quite like is the art and sound.

The first episode is essentially just a series of unfortunate events happening to our protagonist (the most pathetic person alive) and it\'s hard to take it seriously because it\'s so over the top. That\'s basically how the rest of the show goes, things happen but you can\'t take them seriously because they\'re too ridiculous or they just don\'t make sense.Madoka had the whole thing with the soul gems and...the wishes and the aliens that made it feel like more than five minutes of thought were put into the premise. In Magical Girl Site, the jannies of some deep web site give magical powers to depressed girls, and they\'re supposed to use those powers to hurt people, and somehow that makes the jannies more powerful? It comes off as a lot more vague and generic. Maybe the manga does a better job of establishing how the whole system works, but most of the time it\'s hard not to think about how similar this stuff is to Madoka and how much of a better job Madoka did with the ""edgy magical girl"" shit. The way the magical powers work is kind of weird, too. They\'re physical objects and it seems like anybody can use the objects. For example, our protagonist has a gun that teleports things. If she handed the gun to someone else, that other person should be able to teleport things, too. Of course, since this is just like Madoka, using the magical powers shortens your lifespan, so you shouldn\'t use them too often. Okay, cool.The problem I have with this is that there\'s a character introduced in the first episode who has time stop powers, which is clearly the most overpowered power you can get. Introducing something like that so early kind of fucks you over, because now you have to figure out a way to not make ""just stop time lol"" be the best way out of every bad situation. Supposedly the character with the power doesn\'t have enough magical energy left to use it without dying, except that isn\'t actually a copout because she should be able to just hand the device that gives you time stop powers to somebody else. But she never does that. I feel like I have to have missed something, some reason why she never just hands the thing over to the protagonist. It\'s totally baffling. There are plenty of other things that happen in the show that are like this, where you aren\'t sure if you missed a detail or if it\'s just bad writing, but this was the one that kept sticking out to me because, again, they introduce it so early and then barely use it even though it would have helped out in so many situations.With that said, I think it\'s safe to say that I highly recommend this. I hate to invoke memes but it\'s a ""we have Madoka at home"" situation where it seems like they wanted to make something like Madoka but didn\'t understand what made Madoka actually good (when you ignore the godawful final episode), so what you get is a Madoka clone with all the edgy shit turned up to eleven.

It\'s really offputting to me and perhaps I\'m getting to opinionated and not as objective as I like to be but it doesn\'t make this show any better, that\'s for sure. In fact, I think it really brings down a lot of it.Actually, I think it brings it down a lot but that\'s just because the show itself was pretty mediocre and pairing that with the irritating and uninspired animation made things all the more worse. Damn, like seriously, I hate moe artwork. It\'s one reason why I avoid a lot of modern shows.Granted, I don\'t think early 2000\'s  animation would have improved this steaming heap.Sound:Forgettable music and forgettable VA work. Not bad, not good. 5/10Character:The male lead is a hebephiliac and the so is the adult female lead. Not to mention the youngest character is so stupid I wanted to stop watching almost immediately. I just finished it out for the extra \'Completed\' tag on my watch-list.Enjoyment:And it wasn\'t worth it. I almost would have preferred having this NOT be on my list. I can\'t say it was boring because it was somewhat enjoyable, but I can\'t say it\'s good because Ecchi and Moe stuff are 2 of the dumbest things on the planet. So, here I am giving it a 4/10.Oh well. At least my Vodka bottle is near empty. Gives me an excuse to finish it.((If you liked this review, feel free to check out my others! I review most manga and anime I finish!))', ""Two minutes seems far too little for an anime series, but I guess it's a good choice if you're short on time... The adults seem far too interested in Chie, it's kinda weird, in my opinion. I won't lie, she IS cute, but they just take it too far. It also feels like they talk faster than normal in order to fit into the two minute slot, like the speech is sped up. It gave me a chipmunk vibe, if I'm honest. The story itself wasn't really all that entertaining for me, but it wasn't unbearable, either. I say watch this if you have nothing...better to do. better to do.""]"
Pingu in the City,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36259/Pingu_in_the_City,"[""In 1986, the “Pingu” animated children’s program began in its home country of Switzerland. The cartoon quickly became a worldwide hit because of its unique, universal method of storytelling and simple humor that entertained all ages. There were two countries in particular where “Pingu” became a massive hit: the United Kingdom and Japan. The United Kingdom-based company HIT Entertainment purchased the rights to “Pingu” for a whopping £15.9 million after production on the Swiss version was stopped in 2000. They used their investment to produce more episodes of the series from the years of 2003 to 2006.Both the Swiss and British versions of “Pingu” were...massive hits in Japan; if one searches “Pingu” on eBay, all sorts of exclusive merchandise, books, toys, and even Game Boy and DS games that were only released in Japan pop up. As the series has continued to thrive in Japan even without new episodes being made, it would make sense that a Japanese company would want to invest in producing new episodes for the franchise.Enter Polygon Pictures. Instead of continuing the original series, they decided to completely change up the formula and reboot “Pingu” for a new generation with “Pingu in the City”. Not only is the series now computer-animated, but Pingu’s family has been moved from their classic setting of the South Pole into “the city”, where new adventures await for the always curious Pingu. But does such a drastic change work with “Pingu”?Let me explain a bit about my history with “Pingu”. I remember watching the original show when I was younger and enjoying it, primarily because it was weird that channels aimed at running educational drivel would often put it on their schedule. Let’s face it: you can’t learn much from “Pingu”, but you’ll have a good time. The reason every country hopped on board with airing the show at one point is because of the unique storytelling method I mentioned earlier: the characters, instead of having real spoken dialogue or a narrator explaining the story, communicate through a made-up language known as “Penguinese”. In this sense, “Pingu” is educational, as it teaches children not only how to interpret a story through visuals, but how to read body language and vocal emotion to tell how others are feeling.The first night I started taking antidepressants after getting out of the hospital and feeling shitty about life in general, I randomly stumbled across the original “Pingu” on YouTube again, and it honestly made me the happiest I’d been in a long time.The feeling was only temporary, and something I’ve been chasing ever since. As such, I was understandably very excited by the news of this new “Pingu in the City” reboot. At the same time, I was a bit worried about the ways a different production team and changing the classic formula could go wrong. Another show from my childhood, “Max and Ruby”, was revived under a different production team who altered several aspects of the original. Max, who originally spoke in humorous one-word exclamations, now spoke full sentences, while Max and Ruby’s parents made random appearances seemingly in an effort to be “politically correct”. It just didn’t feel right.Thankfully, the production team of “Pingu in the City” is clearly very familiar with the original source material, as this reboot has all the charm and humor of the original. Pingu is the same accident-prone yet lovable penguin child he’s always been; the new setting of the big city gives plenty of new opportunities for the story that it’s never had before. The “Penguinese” language, including the classic battle cry of “Noot noot!”, has been left fully intact. Unlike other shows (*cough* Berserk 2017 *cough*), the shift to a new animation style is barely noticeable and actually seems to work to the show’s advantage.Some might argue that “Pingu in the City” has a unique aspect over the original that really works in its favor; the setting is almost a utopia, where Pingu, a young child, doesn’t appear to go to school, and instead learns about the world around him through working at jobs with adults who are more than happy to help him learn. Kids in modern society don’t have the time to explore the world around them and learn what they like to do due to the amount of time they have to spend in school, which is a real shame. “Pingu in the City”’s utopia brings me a sense of joy, and a hope for a future with a reformed education system.For all these reasons (and probably more that I'll wish I added later), “Pingu in the City” is more than a meme to me. From the first second of every episode, the show is full of a unique energy that immediately puts a smile on my face, even when nothing else seems to be going my way. I highly recommend the show for viewers of all ages, and hope that with the international licensing deals in progress (Sony has the rights to the show in North America, while Mattel has the rights in China) that every viewer possible will get to enjoy it. Ed Sheeran and Harry Styles both have Pingu tattoos due to their viewings of the original show as children. I hope ten to fifteen years from now another celebrity who’s popular with the kids will have a Pingu tattoo thanks to their viewing of “Pingu in the City” as a child. massive hits in Japan; if one searches “Pingu” on eBay, all sorts of exclusive merchandise, books, toys, and even Game Boy and DS games that were only released in Japan pop up.

The characters are charming and the humor is top notch. The mimicking of the claymation stayed true to the original concept and the lack of dialogue makes this a universally appealing anime with no language barrier. Pingu in the City is very episodic and realistically you could watch any episode in any order back to back as there isn't any real overarching story. This is a simple kids show and a great one at that. Very little shows can capture the charming, carefree nature of children as well as this did. I personally...felt this was masterfully done, the simplicity only adds to the overall genius of this show. This show has a variety of simple, easy to understand themes sprinkled throughout each episode and you could come out learning something even if it's a simple lesson it's important. This show isn't for everyone, being a kids show doesn't mean it won't appeal to adults (I mean I certainly enjoyed it) but there is a clear audience in mind and taking that into consideration this clearly not only nails it in that ballpark, it perfectly encapsulates everything a kids show should and ought to be. I highly recommend this show if you enjoy carefree wholesome kid shows that is fairly simple to grasp and understand. Kids will surely enjoy this show, some adults can come to like and appreciate this show as well. Truly a modern-day masterpiece that won't be forgotten. 10/10. felt this was masterfully done, the simplicity only adds to the overall genius of this show.

We\'ve got everything from obnoxious, unfunny kids giving it either extremely high or low scores and its occasional inclusion in the overall top 10 through spam-filled, rule-breaking \'reviews\' to toxic discussions over its status as an ""anime"" given the lack of loud, spiky-haired boys and annoying copy/pasted teenaged girls with extremely large eyes among its characters.Pingu in the City can be better described as a spin-off of sorts to the award-winning European animated series ""Pingu"". The Western version of this show features the titular Pingu\'s various stunts and misadventures in a South...Pole village inhabited by anthropomorphic penguins. With its stopmotion-based clay animation, it quickly became a worldwide hit for its sometimes bizarre slapstick humor and the now-iconic ""Penguinese"" fictional language, which was as expressive and easy to understand as could possibly be. There was never any need for dubbing or subbing: Pingu\'s appeal was mostly visual and completely universal, allowing it to take over the world and reach the largest audience possible destroying any existing language barrier. Originally airing in most of the countries in the world over the course of two decades, it\'s safe to say that most readers must have watched at least one or two original Pingu shorts at some point in their lives. Pingu proved to be incredibly popular in Japan, where its original version is still running - a couple of JP-exclusive games were even released over there, too. Being aware of that is important to understand why popular 3D animation studio Polygon Pictures would start producing this new take on a series over 10 years since its final episode and clears most of the shadow of mystery that\'s apparently hanging over all of the ""anime is only my hand-drawn Cambodian cartoons"" manchildren\'s eyes.Unfortunately, as is usual for sequels that dare enough to change a classic formula, some of what may have made the original Pingu series so charming may have been lost or dimmed in its transition to CGI animation. The computer graphics look nice, of course. Directed with a ""claymation emulation"" technique, the effort and care of the 3D artists really shows, meaning that animation is way more up-to-date and that impractical or otherwise impossible to animate ideas can potentially be explored in the next episodes of the show (we had flying vegetables and a tennis match until now). Who knows what they can come up with, right? Still, the simple, goofy stop motion animation was probably what sold the original Pingu to much of the audience.The new urban setting may also have taken out some of the bizarreness factor which made Pingu so unique - vast ice deserts and dreamlike clay scenarios now give place to a colorful, bustling city (Tokyo reference? looks pretty European though). But sound design might have taken the sharpest blow of all of the aspects, sadly. Penguinese comes back, as expected, but with different voice actors. It\'s still neat and funny to listen, but then some very small details bother me - the show\'s signature catchphrase (""noot noot!"") sounds too different and characters now vocalize almost uninterruptedly, contrasting with the sparsely and cleverly used grunts and mumbling let out by the hilariously moody penguins from the original show. Maybe the excessively talkative penguins are there to represent how life in the big city is all about communication or something like that?With simple plotlines and characters, the show has got just what it needs to hook its primary audience in, but expect some very light surrealism and situations deserving of a sincere laugh (no matter your age!) if the original series writing formula is to be followed.In conclusion, while Pingu in the City may not turn out to be as grand as the classic series, it will still certainly make for a harmless, quick and fun weekly watch for the next 20-something weeks or so.

With that being said, the 6 episodes of this season that have aired are far from bad. The stories are predictable and follow traditional themes of children’s storytelling, but there is a uniting theme...of “work” at the core of every episode. This can be broken up into sub-themes such as (but not limited to): helping, responsibility, and making the most of an unsavory situation. One positive aspect of the Pingu series that lends itself towards effective storytelling is its gibberish dialogue, which cuts out almost all exposition. At only seven minutes per episode, there is little to complain about here. For a children’s show, “Pingu in the City” is fantastic, but when compared with something intended for an older audience, the story of this show will obviously come-of as nubile and generic.Art 8/10:Despite the switch from the claymation of previous seasons to the computer-animation of this one, the art style of the Pingu series has always been good. The simplistic character designs of the previous seasons are still around, only now, their forms are a tad more consistent. The splendid texture work on the characters, objects, and buildings makes for a very convincing replication of original show’s soft clay aesthetic. While not exactly inventive, the shot composition is very nice, and the lighting looks quite realistic. Despite the constant technological advancements that are made regarding the visual fidelity of CG, the lighting and textures in this show cannot match the real shadows and actual clay of the claymated original. One benefit of the switch to CG is the spike in animation fluidity and consistency, making “action” scenes more convincing. If “Pingu in the City” was claymated like the original, while also using the artistic technique on display in these past six episodes, I’d give it a 10/10 in this category. Even though this is not the case, I feel that an 8/10 is a valid score for how well they were able to replicate the charming claymation of the original using a digital medium.Sound 7/10:One of the Pingu series’ main appeals is its gibberish dialogue, and in “Pingu in the City” this is still the case. The voice actors flesh out the characters quite well, even though the words they’re speaking have no specific meaning. The OP and ED are short, cheery, and pleasing to the ear. The sound effects serve their intended purposes very well; I personally found the slapping sounds that accompany the movement of feet and flippers to be very cute. The background instrumentals are relaxing, and the overall soundtrack seems to be filled with a wide expanse of different songs that fit the tone of every scene in which they are used.Characters 5/10:The characters presented so far are serviceable, but the only one with a discernable name is the main character, Pingu. After minimal research, I found out that there are only 12 other named characters in the series, including “Papa,” “Mama,” and his sister, Pinga. One might take this as a bad sign, but for the sake of this show’s interests, names aren’t really needed. Traditional family stereotypes tell us who Pingu’s mother is and who Pingu’s father is; there is no need to for exposition. So far, the only one of these characters with ample screen time has been Pingu. As a mostly episodic anime, there doesn’t seem to be any significant character growth or deterioration from episode to episode. At the end of episode 3 however, Pingu seems to have grown into a more responsible person, so there is the possibility that his character will change with time.Enjoyment 8/10:I’ve enjoyed this anime far more than I had originally expected, which is why I’ve written such a dead serious review; I want to give an honest opinion for those who are drowning in this sea of memes. Pingu in the City makes for a satisfying weekly reprieve from the more violent and depressing anime that I usually consume. With 26 episodes at only 7 minutes an episode, this anime is easily consumable and doesn’t demand the commitment that a normal anime might demand in order to get anything out of it. The hypersexual, overly violent, and needlessly cutesy aspects of modern anime which usually drive people away from this medium are not present here. I can say with certainty that this show is for everyone.Overall Rating: 7/10Despite the lengths to which I have gone for the sake of this show, I am not an avid fan Pengu. I’ve only seen a few episodes of the original seasons, and that was only for the sake of comparison in this review. I’m just a guy who saw a charming, fun show being overtaken by a meme, and felt the need to do right by said show.In deeming this a preview, this review will most likely be removed upon this series’ completion, and I’m ok with that; I can write a full review when that day arrives. of “work” at the core of every episode.

Though this short series provides simple fun, it’s a definitive step down from the older claymation seasons.  That said, if you’re already a fan you’ll probably like Pingu in the City just fine.Review in full:Though this review is solely about Pingu in the City, it would be difficult to truly understand what’s right or wrong about it without looking back to its source.  Originating from Switzerland in 1990, Pingu gained...international acclaim as a children’s claymation series that made fantastic use of its medium to present zany yet touching short stories about the eponymous penguin.  The international aspect was reinforced by how it told itself though expression rather than verbal dialogue, allowing characters to morph themselves to convey thoughts & emotion while having them speak “Penguinese”, a silly gibberish language that fit in perfectly with the typically light-hearted nature of the show.  Japan was one of the many countries Pingu gained a following in, resulting in a CG anime reboot few saw coming but many became excited for.This reboot is, in a word, alright.  Many more descriptive words could be used, but they wouldn’t be completely honest.  It’s unfitting in some ways, and yet it’s definitely still Pingu.  It’s a little unspirited, yet specific aspects of it were certainly made with spirit.  Lacking almost works, but in truth there’s no less going on here than there was before.  It’s a whole product for sure, but you could say it’s missing just a couple screws that would have held the whole thing solid.It starts with the production values.  The use of CG does an average job of replicating the original claymation, though there is an initial effort to avoid the looser effects from the old show (they start making things a bit looser from the halfway point of the first season but it still isn't the same).  At the same time a few odd bits of repeated animation & freeze frames are scattered about, and while giving Pingu transformation sequences was a cute touch it does wear its welcome.  In essence, while it clearly looks like Pingu, it doesn’t hold the same expressiveness the original did, which means the plot can’t take advantage of the art style like it had before.  At least the Penguinese functions the same and usually does its job well, even if it sounds somewhat different (I swear the chef penguin was made to sound the slightest bit French).  There’s little noteworthy music to speak of though.Pingu moving to the city gives the show a new setting but it isn't tapped into all that much.  The environment and set pieces are interacted with in ways befitting an explorative children’s show, but nothing about it has to do with being in a city.  Most of the jobs & activities Pingu partakes in could have taken place at his old village.  Sure, the show can go on without the “city” aspect, but for what is essentially a look into a child’s exploration of his new home it results in many missed opportunities, especially as Pingu isn’t performing a new job every episode (in fact most of his jobs are recycled 2 times or more).  The city itself also feels awfully generic in the end, though part of it is also how static it is from an artistic standpoint.  If you put humans in this setting I’d almost think I was looking at Soviet Murmansk after 5 colors of pastel paint were evenly distributed.The humor is pretty much in the same vein as the older Pingu episodes but it's not quite as quirky as the original due to its much more formulaic nature (Pingu observes job, gets job, does job, has job-related conflict, creatively resolves conflict or the episode ends before then).  The show still has its moments, especially the first few episodes with the chef penguin (probably because Pingu does the silliest things to him, albeit unintentionally).  Some episodes don't follow this formula (such as the racing and babysitting episodes) and they are usually more enjoyable as they actually explore things that fit the characters and the concept of children exploring rather than some random job Pingu gets a sudden interest in (which, again, could have worked fine if he didn’t repeat jobs so often).  It honestly isn’t enough to give the show consistent charm.  It’s almost frustrating to watch this season despite its occasionally down-to-earth episodes when it’s usually just one or two of the characters messing around with a job they were curious about for six minutes before the main joke happens and the credits roll.  For the new viewer, they’ll likely find a couple episodes charming and simply see the rest as a standard kid’s show.Fortunately the old characters that appear are themselves and the new ones fit in quite well.  Pingu himself is a big part of what makes his show enjoyable; his impulsive & childish nature leads him into many crazy situations but he is also hardworking and well-meaning, so even if his approaches to problems are less-than orthodox he generally manages to solve them through genuine effort, even though he rarely takes an optimal path to it and it doesn’t always work out.  His interactions with his little sister Pinga bring out both of Pingu’s sides in a strong way, further reinforcing his immature yet admirable character.  Robby the Seal is like a foil to Pingu, usually fooling around and just looking for a good time, but he has a good chemistry with Pingu and they always find a way to help each other in the end.  It’s a shame his appearances are limited and are mostly just in the later episodes.  Most of the other characters have a few defining traits, which considering the limited screen-time they receive is enough to serve their roles and occasionally bring interesting moments to the table on their own accord.  A little more expressive movement would have gone a long way towards having a consistently memorable cast though, and while there are definitely stand-out characters, the cast as a whole isn’t able to make the city come to life by themselves.Verdict:Pingu is back, but this season just isn’t quite the same.  At times it has a genuine charm to it but when the majority of episodes can be chalked up to “standard fare” despite occasional quirks it’s time to take off the nostalgia goggles and be honest with what it is.  I still found Pingu in the City enjoyable, but it’s not consistently good like Pingu was for me in the past.Side note:The second season addressed most of the points made in this review and is overall a much better showing.  I could recommend the entire Pingu in the City series on account of the second season alone.  The above review of the first season is untouched from before then though, and will remain as such because standalone all of its points still apply to its season.  My review of the second season is also standalone, but in the context of it following this season of Pingu in the City versus this review following the claymation series. international acclaim as a children’s claymation series that made fantastic use of its medium to present zany yet touching short stories about the eponymous penguin.  The international aspect was reinforced by how it told itself though expression rather than verbal dialogue, allowing characters to morph themselves to convey thoughts & emotion while having them speak “Penguinese”, a silly gibberish language that fit in perfectly with the typically light-hearted nature of the show.  Japan was one of the many countries Pingu gained a following in, resulting in a CG anime reboot few saw coming but many became excited for.This reboot is, in a word, alright.  Many more descriptive words could be used, but they wouldn’t be completely honest.  It’s unfitting in some ways, and yet it’s definitely still Pingu.  It’s a little unspirited, yet specific aspects of it were certainly made with spirit.  Lacking almost works, but in truth there’s no less going on here than there was before.  It’s a whole product for sure, but you could say it’s missing just a couple screws that would have held the whole thing solid.It starts with the production values.  The use of CG does an average job of replicating the original claymation, though there is an initial effort to avoid the looser effects from the old show (they start making things a bit looser from the halfway point of the first season but it still isn't the same).  At the same time a few odd bits of repeated animation & freeze frames are scattered about, and while giving Pingu transformation sequences was a cute touch it does wear its welcome.  In essence, while it clearly looks like Pingu, it doesn’t hold the same expressiveness the original did, which means the plot can’t take advantage of the art style like it had before.  At least the Penguinese functions the same and usually does its job well, even if it sounds somewhat different (I swear the chef penguin was made to sound the slightest bit French).  There’s little noteworthy music to speak of though.Pingu moving to the city gives the show a new setting but it isn't tapped into all that much.  The environment and set pieces are interacted with in ways befitting an explorative children’s show, but nothing about it has to do with being in a city.  Most of the jobs & activities Pingu partakes in could have taken place at his old village.  Sure, the show can go on without the “city” aspect, but for what is essentially a look into a child’s exploration of his new home it results in many missed opportunities, especially as Pingu isn’t performing a new job every episode (in fact most of his jobs are recycled 2 times or more).  The city itself also feels awfully generic in the end, though part of it is also how static it is from an artistic standpoint.

It\'s amazing to see that most of what I loved from the past still has been implemented in this show. All the characters I\'ve come to know and love to the classic ""noot-noot""...sound, It\'s still all here.

One more change that i found odd to adapt to first is the longer episodes compared to original pingu episodes but, it only took a few episodes for me to adapt, this nitpick only applies to weird people like me anyways, other than that there's nothing wrong with the show itself that i can point out. not that popular i found it hard to find a streaming platform of which to watch it completely or atleast none with questionable legality.

A good deal of ""90\'s kids"" from the British Isles or other nations in the Commonwealth will remember growing up with Pingu on the television.Pingu features the titular character getting into a number of wacky hijinks, mostly due to his youthful ignorance as he tries to be helpful to others. For the most part this unexpected Japanese reboot has kept the same spirit of the original show, something...that can often be an issue for even the same studio rebooting/revisiting an older series that has not been worked on in a while, let alone an entirely different studio from an entirely different culture.Due to the gibberish style the characters speak in and the lack of any real deeper plot beyond short-lived gags, there is no language-barrier that many children may struggle with watching anime.Pingu in the City is a wonderful children\'s program that children, their parents, those with nostalgia from their childhoods and children at heart should be able to enjoy. that can often be an issue for even the same studio rebooting/revisiting an older series that has not been worked on in a while, let alone an entirely different studio from an entirely different culture.Due to the gibberish style the characters speak in and the lack of any real deeper plot beyond short-lived gags, there is no language-barrier that many children may struggle with watching anime.Pingu in the City is a wonderful children\'s program that children, their parents, those with nostalgia from their childhoods and children at heart should be able to enjoy.', 'This anime is the number one anime that has ever been made. It is somehow a mix of a shonen, comedy, and psychological thriller. If any anime deserves an award of any kind, it is this masterpiece. Nothing can ever compare to it; not Deathnote, not Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure- NOTHING.The plot starts out with the main character, a rather naive and otherwise unknowing penguin by the name of Pingu. He is ridiculously powerful, and would be a boring ""Mary Sue""-esque character if it weren\'t for his overwhelming timidness. His power comes from his mystical spell that only he...can cast: the NOOT. Using it causes those around him to cower in fear of even the most basic of small penguins.CHARACTER/STORY:It is rather unusual for a main character be so NOOT-ingly strong; aside from shows like One-Punch Man, the main character being pseudo-omnipotent is not particularly good for user satisfcation. However, there is a significant cautionary side of Pingu, as he must pick and choose the instances where he uses the vast NOOT, as it only reigns death and destruction. He is and must be careful of where he causes death. Small penguins are not prosecutable in Pingunian law, but he has a conscience that he must obey.The show is well known for its incredible character development, even across single episodes. For the sake of discussing an example, I will refer to the first episode, and as such will not contain any spoilers of the overarching villains in the story. (The first episode acts a pilot, only to set up the scene. The synopsis says much of what happens in it - though it is rich for analysis with visuals included.)In the first episode, Pingu moves to a new and rather plain-looking city. However, the viewers quickly find that the city is overrun by monsters disguised as regular penguins. In the first episode, Pingu has a spell cast upon him that influences his actions, and he quickly is forced to use his insane raw magical ability to brew an otherwise unbrewable spell that would take his mystical powers away from him and give them to the as of yet unrevealed antagonist. Comically, his resistance causes the brew to become tainted, and instead of creating a power stealing bowl of tomato soup, he instead creates an anti-mind control potion. His raw NOOT energy combined with the fumes from the bowl allow him to escape the hands of the dastardly penguin. Though it\'s not stated, it is implied that the ""chef"" (i.e. monster in disguise) of the restaurant is slain for his failure to acquire the omnipotent penguin.As Pingu leaves the restaurant, he becomes a changed penguin. No longer will he be the safe and sound penguin that he used to be in his prior town; now he must be wary of those who may attempt to seize his power. He must guard it so that these despicable souls do not get it. However, he knows that those helping these villains may end up ruthlessly slaughtered, and begins an internal psychological debate with himself about the ethics of remaining in a public area if he risks the world by potentially giving a villain the opportunity to seize his godlike NOOT.ART/SOUND:In a rebellion against traditional anime standards, Pingu in the City uses clay model animations that have been traced over by hand. They share some of the clay features, but retain the anime look we know and love. It is a novel shift from previous anime standards, and creates a visually and aesthetically pleasing frame to watch the journey of Pingu and his NOOT unfold.The characters show incredible depth of expression. Pingu displays a huge number of emotions, and the art is so good at expressing his thoughts at any given moment that words are not even needed. In fact, throughout the entirety of the show, only one word is spoken: NOOT. There is much analysis that can be made of this, but it requires watching the entire several times to truly understand. It also involves spoilers, and I do not wish to spoil the wondrous journey of this forlorn penguin.The sound track is absolutely incredible. I cannot go through my day without listening to the full OST several times. It is *that good.* The opening is quick and to the point, conveying the transition of the penguin. The viewer at first does not understand the implications and depth that the opening contains, but it becomes clearer and clearer as the story progresses. They begin to see the hidden meaning contained in the short time in which the masterpiece of the opening song plays.OVERALL:I simply cannot recommend this anime enough. It is well thought out - the plot, the music, the opening, EVERYTHING. No matter how much anime you have watched or what anime you\'ve watched, this one is the one for you. I am sure that anyone lucky enough to behold the miracle that is Pingu in the City will be blessed for eternity. can cast: the NOOT.

The synopsis says much of what happens in it - though it is rich for analysis with visuals included.)In the first episode, Pingu moves to a new and rather plain-looking city. However, the viewers quickly find that the city is overrun by monsters disguised as regular penguins. In the first episode, Pingu has a spell cast upon him that influences his actions, and he quickly is forced to use his insane raw magical ability to brew an otherwise unbrewable spell that would take his mystical powers away from him and give them to the as of yet unrevealed antagonist. Comically, his resistance causes the brew to become tainted, and instead of creating a power stealing bowl of tomato soup, he instead creates an anti-mind control potion. His raw NOOT energy combined with the fumes from the bowl allow him to escape the hands of the dastardly penguin. Though it\'s not stated, it is implied that the ""chef"" (i.e. monster in disguise) of the restaurant is slain for his failure to acquire the omnipotent penguin.As Pingu leaves the restaurant, he becomes a changed penguin. No longer will he be the safe and sound penguin that he used to be in his prior town; now he must be wary of those who may attempt to seize his power. He must guard it so that these despicable souls do not get it. However, he knows that those helping these villains may end up ruthlessly slaughtered, and begins an internal psychological debate with himself about the ethics of remaining in a public area if he risks the world by potentially giving a villain the opportunity to seize his godlike NOOT.ART/SOUND:In a rebellion against traditional anime standards, Pingu in the City uses clay model animations that have been traced over by hand. They share some of the clay features, but retain the anime look we know and love. It is a novel shift from previous anime standards, and creates a visually and aesthetically pleasing frame to watch the journey of Pingu and his NOOT unfold.The characters show incredible depth of expression. Pingu displays a huge number of emotions, and the art is so good at expressing his thoughts at any given moment that words are not even needed. In fact, throughout the entirety of the show, only one word is spoken: NOOT. There is much analysis that can be made of this, but it requires watching the entire several times to truly understand. It also involves spoilers, and I do not wish to spoil the wondrous journey of this forlorn penguin.The sound track is absolutely incredible. I cannot go through my day without listening to the full OST several times. It is *that good.* The opening is quick and to the point, conveying the transition of the penguin. The viewer at first does not understand the implications and depth that the opening contains, but it becomes clearer and clearer as the story progresses. They begin to see the hidden meaning contained in the short time in which the masterpiece of the opening song plays.OVERALL:I simply cannot recommend this anime enough. It is well thought out - the plot, the music, the opening, EVERYTHING. No matter how much anime you have watched or what anime you\'ve watched, this one is the one for you. I am sure that anyone lucky enough to behold the miracle that is Pingu in the City will be blessed for eternity.', ""Simply perfect, the story is captivating and makes you laugh and cry, the art is too good to be true, you can compare the art of the Beatles' com come togheter clip, the sounds are realistic and give you the feeling of being close to the pingu , the characters are very charismatic and intelligent, the pingu has his famous language that I am trying to decipher to this day, but I know that when he says amanamanam, I cry with emotion, all episodes have their characteristics, but the best is the last for sure , but I don't want to say the reason not...to spoil the experience, I think they should make a pingu game, because this anime is PERFECT! I recommended to my mother, aunt, uncle, grandmother, dog, cat, parrot, blue macaw and rhino, my friends also recommend to spoil the experience, I think they should make a pingu game, because this anime is PERFECT!

Everything inside of this show just reminds me what living in Pingu in the City. Whenever MC says, ""Noot Noot,"" it makes me cry- it\'s sad yet so happy at the same time.Story: 10/10It has one of the most obvious plots from its name; it is just Pingu, the MC, in a city. Watching the MC live inside of that city is just amazing, and that is why I rated it a 10/10 in every category. It is also extremely different from the first few seasons of Pingu, mainly because he used to live in a town...in Antarctica, but it strays from the original because he lives in a city. I didn\'t make this section longer because I want you guys to see the story yourself.Art: 10/10The art inside of \'Pingu in the city\' is a masterpiece in every scene; It\'s plain, and yet it is gorgeous at the same time. The reason I didn\'t rate this series art an 11/10 because the art that characters create in the anime is nothing past satisfactory; It is obvious and apparent in the anime. Although this one flaw is filled in with the wonderful art of the creators of said Pingu in the city. It is also very different from other anime because it has clay animation, which just adds to its uniqueness.Sound:10/10The opening of Pingu in the City is, by some people\'s opinions, the best anime opening. If you do not listen to \'Pingu in the City\'s opening for at least 25 hours a day, you have a psychotic condition. Not only is the opening of Pingu in the city amazing, so is the wonderful ""Noot Noot"" quote that I mentioned earlier in this review. The voice actors also exceeded my expectations by a long shot.Character: 10/10I don\'t think I even need to explain this one. Every single character from Pingu in the City is extremely above average and unique from different anime. Its uniqueness comes from each character being a penguin that doesn\'t speak. Others may think that the characters not speaking is a downside, but I think it\'s what makes it a 10/10. It would be better to go and watch it yourself to rate the characters, but for me, it\'s a 10/10.Enjoyment: 10/10Based on everything that has been stated before this, I believe it is self-explanatory why I rated this a 10/10. Now there\'s only one thing that I would rate better for enjoyment and that is Cory in the House, it is easily the best slice of life anime and I did enjoy it more but nothing can beat this now.Overall: 10/10 in Antarctica, but it strays from the original because he lives in a city.

Pingu in the city is the greatest anime in the history of anime. NOOT NOOT. Its story, art, sound, character, enjoyment make all other shows look awful. FMA Brotherhood doesn’t even compare to this show that was given to us by god himself. NOOT NOOT. I rewatched this show 13 times and it never got old. Hearing the constant NOOT NOOT makes my eyes water every time. The anime is very deceiving however as you may think it’s just a meme. In reality, it’s a heartwarming adventure that will make you cry by episode 2. ', 'I mean...Its Pingu mate.Whats you expect?This thing makes Monster look like fucking kindergarten, you feel me? Every episode grizzled with images of a war that haunt Pingu to the end of his miserable days. And to top it off, Pingu\'s dad is the greatest villain of all time. When he gets angry, Pingu knows he fucked up.My favourite quote from the show is ""BLLUFHGHFHHGFHF!!!!"" from pingu\'s dad. It really shows off his rage and just how far he can push his humanity (as a penguin). When he bangs the table, the screen actually shakes and you can feel your heart beating as well...All memes aside, its actually pretty good All memes aside, its actually pretty good']"

I hope it will be of some help to you :)"", ""This one's quite the mixed bag. Serving as a modern telling of the 1970s super robot series Brave Raideen, this 2007 anime focuses on high school student Junki Saiga coming upon a powerful mecha called Raideen that he must control to protect Earth from a mysterious alien threat. As the alien threat escalates, Junki finds himself contemplating how to handle his role as Raideen's pilot while multiple factions seek to exploit the mecha's power or presence for their personal gain.My reasons for finding Raideen to be a mixed bag come from the mixture of what it does right and wrong with its series elements, and...I'll elaborate on what it does right first. For a refreshing twist to the mecha genre, Junki isn't portrayed as an unstoppable pilot when utilizing the Reideen as he finds himself increasingly challenged throughout the series by the alien threat as they continually change their tactics when trying to lure out and capture the mecha with the alien threats unleashed mostly taking more than one episode to resolve. In addition, Junki finds himself conflicted throughout a good chunk of the series with what role he should have in the conflict surrounding Reideen and eventually comes to terms with what he wishes to gain out of it and hints are dropped with some of the characters having bigger roles in the conflict than one would assume on the surface. Also, the presentation to the series is great for the most part with excellent CG animation work on the mecha and alien weaponry, fluid mecha battle scenes against the alien threat and a good number of tense musical tracks with Reideen's soundtrack that are fitting for the show's serious mood.What greatly hurts the series are a number of significant flaws that it has in regards to its storytelling and depth. The series quite often relies on deus ex machina for Junki to get out of any major crisis with the Reideen whenever it seems like he is about to be finished off and this results in a rather poor ending for the series when this lazy storytelling device gets milked to the umpteenth degree. Also, the series does a poor job of fleshing out and focusing on a number of major story elements and characters critical to its plot. The alien Roxell is introduced as a rival for Junki seeking Reideen for his own ends in the middle of the show's run, yet doesn't show up again until near the end of the series and his motives don't get much fleshing out. The mysterious transfer student Midoriko is hinted to have a connection of some sort to Reideen, yet the series never bothers delving into great depth with it. Also, the aliens attacking Earth to claim Reideen also lack depth in their motives and where they come from.Pretty much, Reideen's mixed bag status stems from what it does right and wrong with its mecha storyline. While it offers a great presentation and some solid twists to your typical mecha storyline, it suffers a number of major storytelling flaws due to dabbling in deus ex machina and not fleshing out a number of its major series elements. Your mileage will certainly vary with how you warm up to this modern retelling of the 1970s mecha anime classic. I'll elaborate on what it does right first.

And talking doesn\'t always solve everything"" the ""fairy"" Maedasaki instructs the protagonist in his dream. ""Reideen"" is full of conflicts. Between aliens and humans, between giant alien ""robots"" and Reideen, between Reideen and the army, between the army and military intelligence, between departments of military intelligence itself... But the main conflict of ""Reideen"" is internal. This anime is in conflict with itself, unable to finally decide what it is and what it is about. As a result, it loses the battle to itself. Those mecha lovers who are attracted to action will find ""Reideen"" boring and overextended. Combats...are rare, Reideen\'s transformation animation cutscenes are frequent and lengthy, and the movements of the giant machines are slow. Fans of trash, entertaining stories and humor will not find either one or the other or the third in ""Reideen"", but they will find it too serious and grave. Fans of melodrama, blood and boobs will also be disappointed with ""Reideen"" - there are no emotional anguish, no dismemberment, no kawaii girls suffering from breast hyperplasia. Fans of romance will find only a very crumpled hint of it, hastily built into the very end of the series. Those who are interested in serious anime will be repulsed by the indestructible stupidity of the protagonist, often manifested in completely illogical (like fleeing from the alien base ship when it was defenseless and could be easily, safely and methodically shot down) and stupid actions, fragmentation of the narrative and gaping plot holes (incompleteness of separate storylines, ""magic"" with dressing up of the MC, which can only be attributed to sclerosis or hack-work of scriptwriters, etc.).The protagonist, Junki Saiga, is also stuck somewhere between narratives - between his strong, bold and determined ""prototype"" from the original 1975-76 series and the ever-doubting, timid, stupid, whiny and weak modern days anime protagonists modeled after Ikari Shinji. He should be taller and more mature than his classmates, an excellent and aggressive kendo swordsman, fighting on equal terms with swords with an experienced alien warrior Roxel, controlling Reideen like an extension of his body and receiving physical damage when his ""robot"" is attacked, but he is actually depicted as a rather frail nerd, who at the beginning does not even try to fight, being one-sidedly beaten up by ordinary punks and is not even able to get angry at a deliberate ""friendly fire"" by the army. At the same time, there is no limit to the stupidity and passivity of the protagonist - most of his problems come from his own slavish obedience and revealing all Reideen\'s secrets to the government. Like the hero of the original series, he yells ""Ruuuydin! Faido-in!"", but it looks completely ridiculous with his character and in a remake that wants to be serious. Just as ridiculous is the futuristic moped in the remake in which the sportbike of the protagonist of the original series was ""turned"" into.""Reideen"" cannot decide what story it is trying to convey to the viewer. There are many “hinted” stories, but they are all fragmentary, loosely connected to each other and not shown properly. Starting with the detective story of the mysterious death of Junki\'s father, the anime soon completely ""forgets"" about it. Political intrigues within the army can not be taken seriously against the backdrop of the epic stupidity of the protagonist, who, like a suicidal, plays giveaway all the time, cannot distinguish enemies from friends, and only in some completely incomprehensible way (often miraculously saved at the last moment by alien enemies, performing the role of deus ex machina for the MC) manages to escape death. The title theme of Junki\'s ""growing up"" is rather vaguely illustrated and mostly only voiced by the other characters in the anime. The romance line, which is barely traceable for most of the episodes, then suddenly develops rapidly, leaving a feeling of crumpledness and understatement. The key theme of the hero\'s acceptance of himself and his responsibility is not sufficiently emphasized and is raised only in a couple of episodes, ending with a short comment by Midorino. In general, Midorino voices almost all the key morales in the ""Reideen"", which, given the small amount of screen time allotted to her (in her human form), blures the message of the anime.And yet, I liked the remake of ""Reideen"". Largely due to the things which are not in it and what many will consider a disadvantage - there is no anguish of passion, blood, fan service, trash, intoxication, hurricane action, kawaii, saucer eyes, cellulite oppai, blue, green and other pink hair, stupid jokes and sentimental nonsense. The Art Nouveau 3D animation of Reideen and its transformations is quite beautiful. In general, the drawing and animation in ""Reideen"" is on top from the very beginning - for example, the animation of movements in the second episode in the hospital, when Junki, while fleeing from the ""zombies"", slips on the turn. The design of the characters is especially good - without the grotesqueness and colorfulness inherent in anime, but with a certain stylization for the Art Nouveau or even mannerism - the figures and faces of people are beautiful and slightly elongated, but not exaggerated. The anime has a pleasant opening with a city-pop song and a green-eyed beauty Midorino posing in various clothes, as well as a blue-eyed, golden Reideen shown in the ending which is made in the Art Nouveau style. Seiyuu are all good - the main and secondary characters are voiced superbly. Some of these secondary characters are also well written - especially Hoshikawa and the obsessive Shiori.Roxel is quite stereotypical, but nonetheless interesting with his imp cat. I liked the repulsive for many viewers “inhibition” of the movements of “robots”, because it conveys the size and mass of gigantic machines. The same applies to the ""prolonged"" transformation - this is exactly how military equipment functions, which always requires time to deploy. The romance line, although rather crumpled, pleases with the lack of melodrama and, especially, how it ended for the annoying stalker Shiori, the obsessive childhood friend of the protagonist. The main character behaves with the girl he is in love with, quite believable for his temperament. At first he is gathering his bravery and looks for an opportunity to get close, some sign that she likes him, and only after that he gains the courage to speak.Although vaguely, here can be traced the main line of the anime which is Junki\'s coming of age - from a kid obedient to someone else\'s will, avoiding responsibility, by the end of the series he transforms into a capable guy who knows what he wants from life and is able to act contrary to the opinions of others (one can only hope that growing up also helped him get rid of stupidity and he was smart enough not to tell the military about who Midorino is). In general, if you omit the fantastical assumptions like giant robots and aliens, ""Reideen"" is a coming of age story. In the story-dream of episode 22, everyone calls the MC only by his last name and he needs to find himself, become a person, by recognizing his name, encrypted in an anagram in the name of his ""magic sword"" - this is the only way he can defeat the monster and save the princess. Throughout the series, Junki gradually ""finds himself"", while literally (through communication) and figuratively (by symbolically fighting with the help of Reideen) interacting with Midorino. By contrast, his childhood friend Shiori doesn\'t ""grow up"" and, unlike Midorino, doesn\'t help Junki grow up (and deal with problems), and therefore, eventually, loses him. The contrast between Midorino and Shiori is emphasized in the episodes with Junki\'s ""supermoped"" falling - where Shiori remained indifferent, Midorino hurries to help Junki to lift the moped. While MC grows up, he learns to overcome his ""limits"", take responsibility, not be afraid of conflicts, but, defending himself, solve and even create them, if circumstances so require, resisting the will of others. The need for a ""symbolic crutch"", which was Reideen, disappears, and Junki gets his princess. Both with the moral message (albeit poorly illustrated) and with the ending, the series is all right, and the animation and art are quite capable of bringing aesthetic pleasure. The characters are written worse, especially ""suffered"" from the screenwriters the main character. But, nevertheless, the characters here are noticeably more interesting and behave more believably than in most other anime, especially in the ""mecha"" genre. So, despite the serious problems with the narrative and a very narrow niche, ""Reideen"" deserves the attention of connoisseurs of aesthetics, allegory and unhurried narration. are rare, Reideen\'s transformation animation cutscenes are frequent and lengthy, and the movements of the giant machines are slow. Fans of trash, entertaining stories and humor will not find either one or the other or the third in ""Reideen"", but they will find it too serious and grave.

The contrast between Midorino and Shiori is emphasized in the episodes with Junki\'s ""supermoped"" falling - where Shiori remained indifferent, Midorino hurries to help Junki to lift the moped. While MC grows up, he learns to overcome his ""limits"", take responsibility, not be afraid of conflicts, but, defending himself, solve and even create them, if circumstances so require, resisting the will of others. The need for a ""symbolic crutch"", which was Reideen, disappears, and Junki gets his princess. Both with the moral message (albeit poorly illustrated) and with the ending, the series is all right, and the animation and art are quite capable of bringing aesthetic pleasure. The characters are written worse, especially ""suffered"" from the screenwriters the main character. But, nevertheless, the characters here are noticeably more interesting and behave more believably than in most other anime, especially in the ""mecha"" genre. So, despite the serious problems with the narrative and a very narrow niche, ""Reideen"" deserves the attention of connoisseurs of aesthetics, allegory and unhurried narration.', 'Reideen is the epitome of a slow starter. Though it does find its footing a bit towards the end of its run, it\'s a show that requires patience in the early going, because the first 10 episodes or so are a real slog to get through.One reason for that is the uninspired setup. If you\'ve seen one ""high school student is chosen by an ancient artifact to pilot a mech and defend Earth from an alien invasion"" show, you\'ve seen em all, and Reideen certainly does nothing to distinguish itself from that crowded field early on. Another factor is that the big mech action setpieces...are absolutely horrendous. They are slow, plodding affairs that look like they take place in slow motion. The mech CGI looks terrible and fights generally take place at night to mask some of the ugliness, but instead that just throws a muddy color palette over the whole thing and makes it look even worse. The backgrounds are reduced to flat, featureless black plains during fight scenes as well, which gives the whole thing a distinct feeling of taking place in some sort of video game arena instead of reality. While the 2D scenes look better and have some occasionally strong animation, they similarly struggle with a dark and drab color palette that drains the energy from the show. Perhaps the most aggravating issue is the frequent re-use of animation in the mech scenes, specifically the scenes of Reideen being summoned or using his special moves. This can account for as much as 3-4 minutes *per episode*, and when you\'ve seen Junki yelling ""God Sword!"" and the same exact minute-long animation of the sword flipping through the air 20+ times, you start to check out on the episode every time it happens, and the fight scenes are nowhere close to exciting enough to bring a viewer back from that.But all of that is not to say that Reideen is a *bad* show. It puts its worst foot forward, and is too cagey about keeping its plot mysterious during the first cours. But once it gets into the meat of the story, there\'s an interesting little plot here about various factions struggling for control of Reideen, and a surprisingly deep exploration of how competing incentives within the military industrial complex can lead to irrational decision making and destructive policy. It takes far too long to get there, but the viewer\'s patience is eventually rewarded with an engaging series full of intrigue. The mech action never improves to the point that you could describe it as anything other than bad, but it does get *better* in the last few episodes as well.One piece I would have liked to see them do more with is Midorino, the mysterious transfer student in Junki\'s class. While we do eventually get an explanation of what her Whole Deal is, far too much of the series is devoted to longing and mysterious looks between the two of them. And even after she\'s incorporated into the overarching plot, she has a handful of lines in the entire series and barely has anything resembling a personality. Considering that she\'s front and center in the series advertising, all over the OP, and so forth, you would expect her to have a big role in the series, but it\'s actually easy to forget she even exists most of the time. She has no real impact on the story and no presence even when she\'s on screen.Overall, I would not call this series bad, but it\'s tough to recommend because it takes so long to get going, and mech fans that may be inclined to give it a chance will likely be turned off by the boring and badly-animated action scenes. Much of the best material comes when there are no mechs or crazy alien devices on screen, and it comes late in the series too. While it does improve to the point of being very watchable by the end of the series, I\'m not sure it\'s worth the time investment to get there when all is said and done. are absolutely horrendous.

Puni Puni☆Poemii,https://myanimelist.net/anime/564/Puni_Puni☆Poemii,"[""Ahhh.... the insanity that can sprout from Watanabe's head. Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy. There is really nothing more to say about it...If you think my review wasn't helpful, please leave a message on my profile and explain why you thought my review wasn't helpful.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel. From the artwork, the jokes that really do not work outside Japan, and the voice acting adds up to a big mess to me.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

Best magical girl series ever. 9/10."", ""Puni Puni Poemi is a spinoff of Excel Saga with even shoddier directing and even more cheap fanservice. The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

Puni Puni Poemi is quite a lot of the usual insanity that you can expect from him, especially if you've seen the last episode of Excel Saga.This OVA binds together a truelly atrocious story, shallow characters with no character development, random fan service and an overdose of humour.And guess what, it balances out. PPP proves that you really don't need a best-selling story with deep characters and all that to bring across some great comedy. In fact, most of that stuff can stands in the way of comedy, and Watanabe carefully steers around all of the...depth that you can put into an anime, clearly avoids any sort of explanation to anything and refuses to put any form of character development into this anime. And you really won't miss any of it.The maniacal comedy, the hyperactive main character, the clearly shallow and senseless supporting characters, all of that works for the comedy factor in this anime and is there for nothing else but the comedy.Alright, let's run through the scores.Story: 3Well, the story is horrible, just to be honest. It's a magical girl story with the objective to make as little sense as possible. The entire set-up of how Poemi becomes a magical girl is about as ridiculous as you can find, and the why's, how's and what's aren't touched in any way.However the comedy that the stupidity of the story creates is a different matter all together. The idiotic situations that Poemi blunders into, one after the other, create some great comedy.Art: 7The art is fairly decent and works really great with the story. The characters are well presented and the sudden shifts in styles are also very good and well placed.Sound: 8Really... nothing to say about the sound here. The use of Poemi wanting to be a voice-actor is well expressed and the general feel of the sound in the anime is good.Character: 3The character design is really bad to say the least. It lacks practically all forms of depth, character development is non-existent and the supporting characters can sometimes be replaced by cardboard cut-outs (and they might even show more depth then the actual characters).However just like with the story, those characters are there to serve the comedy factor, and they work perfectly as they are.They just shouldn't be used for anything other then comedy.Enjoyment: 9The anime just works fantastically. The humour is great, the atrocious story and lack of character design just don't matter when those are the things that make the comedy work here.The only downsides to the anime are that Poemi's hyper activeness can really get on your nerves, the senseless fan service can sometimes work against the story since it's so blatant at times and the fact that it leaves you with a good couple of questions at the end about what happened in the anime doesn't help either. Atleast if it didn't numb down your brain.Overall: 10This anime just proves that good comedy doesn't need to involve a ground breaking story, well written characters or even decent dialogue.It's a comedy from start to finish and everything that is in it just is there to provide the comedy.

Well, really, all you need to know is that it's Excel Saga's spinoff/sequel (in that it has Nabeshin in it, and refers constantly to Excel Saga through inside jokes in the script/art/music), centering around Poemi, who likes to be called Kobayashi (basically Excel in a preteen package, which makes her all the more hyper; I pity her seiyuu, and am amazed at how fast she could speak all those lines), and her randomly and absurdly becoming a magical girl.Basically, they parody the magical girl genre, the voice acting/anime business, and fanservice.  They regurarly break the fourth wall,...which is made of LOVE.  It's a bit more crude than Excel Saga was, but as it's an OAV, they can get away with it (they even joke about it).Like Excel Saga, it has it's moments, but it's not made of brilliance.  Still, good for a laugh if you're bored. which is made of LOVE.

Still, good for a laugh if you're bored."", 'This Anime is so stupid. There is no easier way to say that. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? Let me explain what I mean. It’s really hard to talk about this show because it’s just all over the place. At one point, it just feels like they are stalling for time so they can make it run two episodes long.The show starts out with a bit of an epic concept about someone wanting to take over the world and make it a place of beauty and sweetness. This wouldn’t be so bad except that right after the opening song, we get… stupidity. A...Hyper, overactive girl screaming at the camera for the whole show is not my idea of a good show. This is just made for people to feel uncomfortable, isn’t it? Because the aliens having large balls knocking around from where their genitals would be, little kids showing off their ass, all the sexual images and jokes, and the very hyper girl messes with me. What else can I say about this show? I really have no idea… From the baby that predicted danger by pooping, to the S&M Dominatrix, there is so many jokes that just seem to fly over my head. I blame Japanese jokes that are culturally sensitive and toilet humor being there for no reason.The artwork is all over the place. The opening is part anime, part live action with a young Japanese girl looking like she is running around on a beach. What makes it even more unsettling is that they put so many nudity shots in the beginning over this running girl that I just get thrown off faster then you can say Parody. Then when we get into the show finally, we get noodle legs and arms all over the place. Nothing keeps its proportion and things just seem to have a really high cartoon physics that gets on my nerves at times. Sure it works pretty well in Loony Tunes, but then they are not trying to milk it for all its worth. In shows like Loony Tunes, there is a time and place to use those physics and they don’t distract from the overall story. In this case, it really does. Whenever she moves, I feel like any OCD that I have is going to go overboard because I get distracted by her movements and can’t understand the story… if there really is any story to begin with. Still I do have to give them props for the amazing amount of color in this show. And… That might be all that I can give it. Character designs when they are still are pretty bland, little children sexualized way too much (of course, that happens in many more Anime, not just here), and the backgrounds are generic.The music isn’t all bad. The opening song is kind of fun and playful, much like most songs from Excel Saga (another show I really am not a fan of but has decent music). The English voice acting is really terrible, and that mostly is with Poemi. Her voice is either two high, to energetic, or to out of control that I can barely understand her. Nothing she says seems to be of any importance because they never give you a chance to hear it. The third person speaking that she does also gets on my nerves very fast. I understand, she is trying to get into a rule of a girl named Poemi, I understand that the original voice actor, Yumiko Kobayashi, was trying to portray that she is playing a character playing another character. But does that really mean she has to keep saying her own name? Just saying Poemi did this or Poemi did that would be enough. Flipping through the different names made me miss her real name for a long time, making me think that the magical girl was just named Poemi instead. I give props to Cynthia Martinez who probably never got a chance to breathe trying to read the lines for Poemi though. Its one thing when it’s animated for your original language, it’s completely different when trying to dub a show where the artwork has already been done.This is not the show for me. Looking at it compared to others like this, this is pretty much the bottom of the barrel.

I finally came to watching it. It was good. Once I saw it in FULL CONTEXT, it was better than I could ever imagine. So I will rate this series by 10 points.STORY: The series follows the pattern of a normal magical girl series: Main character has a miserable life, comes across tragedy, finds transformation device, and becomes magical girl, with identity known to not many people. This series improves on the storyline by making more people respect the main character (with the character's best friend getting an overdose...on respect), but sort of declines once you get to the idea that the main character is repeatedly f*cked by the talent agency. Overall, the story is very good.ART: The backgrounds combines city and country into how I would picture Fukuoka. The art is shiny and magnificent, while sometimes, the art just disappears, making the room disappear all of a sudden. Outstanding, no?SOUND: Clear sound. Makes you really get an earful of the full volume treatment. I would call the sound outstanding, but I'll rate it great, since Poemi's fast-paced talking makes the sound seem a little distorted.CHARACTER DESIGN: Varing body shapes, artistic shading, and moe eyes? The character design is awesome all the way! OUTSTANDING!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Simply put, character develops slow to none in this series. But screw development, the descriptions are good enough! But backgrounds are pretty bleak, like how Futaba exactly became prototype lesbian. I know it's supposed to be funny, but I just don't care.MUSIC: A lot of the music comes from Excel Saga. Others are written by Yumiko Kobayashi. One even bacame prototype for a Naruto track. AWESOME!WOMEN: A lot of the female characters are either cute or sexy, and that's really awesome that Ishino made the characters designed like that! But I could live my life without Shii continually groping herself.WATCHABILITY: If you've seen Excel Saga, you'd get a lot of the jokes. But watching enough magical girl/hentai series would get you to understanding the jokes a lot clearer. But seriously. This series is watchable if you try. You might have second thoughts once hearing Poemi's voice, but the jokes will keep you glued to your seat.PROMOTION: This got me to thinking about watching the series once I saw the English trailer. After seeing a lot of scenes cut out, I watched the original trailer. I respected the series more after that.OTHER: Could really work on [as] if they had the right to air it. Or Excel Saga. That way, more of the jokes could be clearer. (BTW, [as] is Adult Swim).but when I first saw images for the series, I thought the series was different, and made my own version with about most of the Aasu sisters replaced. I even went as far as to give Poemi fake parents (with KumiKumi in prison and Nabeshin the first villian, leading to a Star Wars V-esque reveal), make Futaba a magical girl herself, and imagine the series on FOX with none of the ADV VAs. I even thought Nabeshin was working for ACROSS! Good thing I scrapped thatidea before my brain overdosed on my own brew of awesome.OVERALL: Awesome.

The entire OVA felt like Episode 26 of Excel Saga except bad. The art at least is passable and hasn't changed from Excel Saga. The sound and characters are regurgitations from Excel Saga. Poemi is basically a clone of Excel minus Excel's awesome voice actor that basically made the character. Poemi's voice actor (ironically enough) pretty much failed to make Poemi funny or enjoyable.Characters in this series are either slightly entertaining or annoying. Visually and literally, many characters completely unoriginal compared to Excel Saga. Character design in...the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice. The series is inundated with innuendo and sometimes straight out sex scenes (nothing is shown as this is not a hentai). The absurdity of the series delivers funny in a similar way as Excel Saga, which is one of my favorites.All in all, Puni Puni Poemi is many steps down in every way from Excel Saga. The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well. the series was very weak.Despite this, Puni Puni Poemi delivers a moderate dose of fun and a supercritical dose of fanservice.

The premise of Puni Puni Poemi is similar to that of Excel Saga it just isn't executed very well."", ""Puni Puni Poemy is a two episode OVA that is a sequel to the comedy classic Excel Saga, and despite being undeniably shoddily made and disappointingly short, it is still one of the funniest anime I've ever seen.STORY: 1/10Puni Puni Poemy's story is terrible. There's no denying it. In fact, it may be the worst story in all of anime. Don't believe me? It's about Nabeshin (Who is in fact the anime's director) and his adopted daughter Poemy who play the characters Nabeshin and Poemy in an anime called Puni Puni Poemy (You may remember it from Excel Saga) in which a girl...gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works. If you're a fan of Panty and Stocking, check it out. Many of the same jokes were told in Puni Puni Poemy first.Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsMyUrE_0MEpisode 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2w40OrOly0 gains powers through a dead fish and must stop evil Joker-resembling aliens with testicles shaped like maces from stealing all the porn on Earth. I can't make this up.Puni Puni Poemy's story goes absolutely nowhere and the second episode in fact ditches the plot in favor of another even stupider one.ART: 8/10One of the greater aspects of Puni Puni Poemy is the art. The colors are rich and vibrant. The animation is also very smooth and expressive, often going through great flexibility over the two episodes. Character designs are reused from Excel Saga, but that's kinda the point.SOUND: 8/10It has one of the most bizarre opening out there. The soundtrack served well though it isn't groundbreaking. The voice acting is praise worthy, especially the dub (Same performers as Excel Saga, which also had an excellent and hilarious dub). In the Dub, Larissa Wolcott is back as Poemy (Who is very similar to her character Excel Excel from Exel Saga). Once again, her voice work is unbelievable and it's a miracle her throat hasn't been torn in half by now or she hasn't passed out from oxygen loss from how fast and ear piercing she speaks.CHARACTER: 3/10The characters in Puni Puni Poemy are dreadful horrible people who all act so mind numbly idiotic it's very difficult to comprehend them for even just two episodes. Poemy is somehow more hyper than Excel Excel. All of her sisters do jack squat (One of them being an overdone version of Hyatt from Excel Saga but now with D-Cups), and the aliens are zany and unbelievable in their characterization. The highlight is Nabeshin, who is still just as badass as he was in Excel Saga, though he is absent for a lot of Puni Puni Poemy but is the center of the anime two best and funniest scenes.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Puni Puni Poemy is almost repulsively terrible, but damn is it hilarious. This anime is a laugh factory in just two episodes. The humor isn't for everyone however and there's no denying it is without a doubt some of the most low brow humor around. But hey, it's only two episodes so you might as well try it. Plus it's pretty standalone from Excel Saga, though it is much crazier and more sexually explicit (Nabeshin even jokes at how they can get away with more nudity in an OVA than a TV series like Excel Saga). Puni Puni Poemy is a nutty blast from start to finish and its breakneck pace and constant barrage of weird and random is enough to make heads spin.OVERALL: 6/10An utter failure as an OVA but a masterpiece of comedy, Puni Puni Poemy is completely devoid of craft or intelligence. It's vulgar, loud, tasteless, and just plain dumb. However, by giving such a large dosage of all of that in just two episodes is a staggering feat and it just works.

Granted, a lot of people didn’t like the humor in “Excel Saga” but it is a hit or a miss, depending what type of humor the viewer has already. Since I did previously enjoyed “Excel Saga”, I wondered if it’s going on the same vein, but rushed.In the first episode, we’re introduced to POemy Watanabe along with her adoptive parents, Nabeshin (whom she calls “Mr. Director”) and Kumi-Kumi. Right away, we see the magical girl, Poemi, fighting the classic and iconic magical girls (up to...this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality. Granted, newer viewers probably won’t get the references, especially the older magical girls, but it’s still funny. There is an alien who swings … an extension of itself and ends up killing Nabeshin, his wife, and the pet robot dog they had only for Kobayashi and Futaba, the parody and more hardcore version of Tomoyo Daidouji from “Card Captor Sakura” and Kobayashi’s best friend, finding their bodies crucified.From there, Futaba manages to convince her sisters (who do everything together and who are various ages and different points of life) to let Kobayashi stay with them. Apparently, though, it’s revealed that the Aasu Family not only does everything together, but they also protect the Earth as well.Unfortunately, they can only defend and it’s right around here the first episode ends.The second episode is when everything simultaneously falls apart and shows it’s true colors. It’s a lot more explicit and while the first episode did have some nudity and fanservice, they decided to just go all out in the second episode.It got to a point where the reason why the alien wanted to take over the world was because: he’s an erogame enthusiast. He also apparently hates voice actresses and flat chested girls (which is what Koyabashi is, and especially the fact she’s not a very good voice actress either).When you break it down and look at each individual Aasu sister, one could realize that these women weren’t magical girl tropes or archetypes – instead they’re the tropes and archetypes for erogames. There’s only one scene where they imply they’re doing something sexual to them but would I even bother to call it fanservice? They never really bother trying to hide anything unless the person was underaged, or a human man, and there just nothing really funny about it anyway – unless that’s your type of humor.The script could have been easily ripe for a genuine magical girl parody but by the middle to end of the second episode, it seemed more of an ero game parody at best. It would been fine had it been an ero-game parody OVA in the first place.Despite the attempt at writing the parody, the musical score is actually pretty good and it fit the themes rather well. The opening and ending is sung by Koyabashi’s voice actress and it really does do a decent job of parodying magical girl openings. It also sets the mood right for the tone it’s about to ruin with a joke or more referential humor.The animation, for its time especially, is almost on par with “Excel Saga” since it was made around that same time frame. Not only that, it was made it the way that it was to allow the voice actress to do a lot of speed talking and made it seem that she was also moving along with her characters’ actions. Granted, one of Aasu sisters looks almost exactly like Hyatt but with much bigger breasts but eh.I really wouldn’t recommend this to anyone since a lot of the sex jokes really made me feel uncomfortable (especially since it made the underaged characters do really suggestive stuff) but if you don’t mind the sex jokes and if you don’t really mind absolute nonsense, then this magical parody is for you!(Part of Project Magic!!) this point in time) and it seems actually pretty serious.The comedy here is pretty funny, since it focuses on referential humor and dealing with Koyabashi’s wastefully energetic personality.

Anime treats me so badly, but I love anime. Anime beats me, because I wasn\'t in the kitchen making it a sandwich. I think to myself, ""This is it, I\'m finally leaving this relationship!"" Then I watch something like Puni Puni Poemii and instantly fall in love all over again. I feel like a seventeen-year-old girl going to the prom with her high school crush. Billy Ocean\'s ""Suddenly"" starts playing in my head. THIS IS WHY I WATCH ANIME! Are you a fan of the complete and utter chaos of Excel Saga? No? Well,...fuck you it doesn\'t matter.

I love her enthusiastic personality and sense of humor. Everything she says sounds like nonsense, but there\'s a little bit of meaning to it. You know, a funny non-sequitur that makes no sense in context, but when you hear it again it has some depth. Tragedy strikes when Poemi\'s parents are killed (This is not a spoiler, just watch it you\'ll see what I mean.) by this random douchebag with a yo-yo penis, and now lives with her friend\'s family, the Aasu family.Futaba Aasu, the friend of Poemi, who is totally not in love with Poemii and wants to make the scissoring love with her. She has the ability to make dangerous creatures docile and harmless. Mitsuki Aasu, her ability, Earth Acceleration, allows her to run fast and that\'s all. Itsue Aasu, her ability, Earth Barrier Shield, allows her to create a large force field. Mitsumi Aasu, her ability, Earth Breakfall, allows her to fall safely. Shii Aasu, her ability, Earth Healing, allows her to heal stuff. Who would\'ve saw that coming? Nanase Aasu, her ability, Earth Dance of Flowers, allows her to summon a field of flowers.

I think seeing Puni Puni Poemii literally reduced my life span. "", 'Puni Puni Poemii\xa0is an OVA from the early 2000s. It\'s ostensibly a spin-off of Excel Saga\xa0although the two don\'t have that much in common, but I\'ll get to that in detail later. It was brought to us by JC Staff. Like Chocotan, Voogie\'s Angel, Potemayo, Kill Me Baby or a whole bunch of other anime of varying quality I\'ve reviewed. It was written by Kuroda Yousuke, which could also go either way considering he\'s done scripts for absolute trash like Highschool of the Dead but he\'s also done script work for solid anime like Battle Athletes. So, let\'s see how this stacks up.Story:We open with...an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally. But don\'t worry, they appear very briefly and there\'s a bright red filter so it\'s not copyright infringing.After this, we cut to Earth and the whole action sequence is never mentioned again which makes it entirely pointless. We meet Watanabe Poemi who calls herself Kobayashi because ""her actress can\'t get into character."" That\'s the level of humour we have to look forward to. Kobayashi loses her parents to a stand user but gets taken in by the Aasu sisters, thanks to her friend/ red string of fate partner Futaba.Let\'s start with the big problem with the series. Most of the jokes aren\'t funny. The opening sequence is a great example. Poemi goes through a bunch of familiar magical girls in a brutal fashion that just comes across as mean-spirited. Compare that to Excel Saga where there\'s also a clear reference to Sailor Moon\xa0but it\'s actually a joke and a very funny one. And having a battle between the characters could be funny. Just have Poemi win by pushing the Usagi look alike into a desk with a maths test or something to that effect.Then there are the jokes that are based around Kobayashi talking really quickly and loudly. Which you can also compare to Excel Saga since that was also a part of Excel\'s character. The difference is that Excel had funny dialogue to go with it and in this the entire joke seems to be that she\'s ridiculously energetic to the point of being annoying. There are also a lot of fan-service jokes, which just come across as crass and exploitative. Then there are the fourth wall breaking jokes which generally just don\'t work all that well. Fourth wall jokes work best in moderation and used at unexpected, strategic moments. Not so much when they\'re a constant, in your face factor.That being said, there are some funny moments. Having Futaba and Poemi\'s relationship be like a super homo-erotic relationship you would get in a magical girl series while one of them pursues some random guy anyway works since they make it even more blatant and have the girl without any interest in a male love interest, Futaba, actually react to the way her obvious girlfriend is carrying on. There are also some funny action sequences. The scene where Nabeshin fights the one-balled alien is really funny. Unfortunately, those actual moments of comedy are heavily outweighed by the unfunny moments.Characters:There aren\'t much to the characters in this. Kobayashi is just kind of loud and annoying. Futaba\'s main schtick is that she\'s madly in love with Kobayashi. Her sisters are all one-note fetish fuel. Which becomes especially obvious towards the end with an egregiously unfunny scene, but it\'s totally okay because they lampshade it as being fan-service.Art:My big issue with the art is the excessive fan-service. It\'s not the only problem. The backgrounds are frequently lazy. The opening sequence with its red filter to marginally disguise the familiar characters we\'re looking at actually hurts the eyes. It\'s like that climactic battle with the red filter from Figure 17, but much worse. And there\'s just not much to recommend the artwork except for the visual gags in the aforementioned Nabeshin fight.Sound:The acting isn\'t very good. I think that both Kobayashi Yumiko & Imai Yuka are capable actresses. They\'ve been strong in series like Angel Beats or Doki Doki Precure\xa0but one of the by-products of going with the obnoxious, hyperactive style of humour is that your actors don\'t come across very well. And I\'m speaking as someone with ADHD. The music also isn\'t very good. It\'s the worst showing I\'ve ever heard from Masuda Toshio. And we know he can compose because he also did music for Mushishi.Ho-yay:Like I said, the stuff between Futaba & Kobayashi is really obvious. To the point where there\'s a red string of fate joke and they disappear together into a futon while Kobayashi is naked. So, they\'ve had sex.Areas of Improvement:Take better advantage of the magical girl parody aspect. Like I said, when it actually parodies the whole ""blatant les-yay, but here\'s a male love interest so we can pretend it\'s not"" element that\'s common in magical girl series, it\'s actually funny. They could do more with that. Have a character who they think has been brainwashed into turning evil, give the big speech about friendship & ""opening their eyes"" only to have the character just be mad over some minor sleight. Have a magical creature companion but no one can actually understand it when it tries to talk to give advice. There\'s a lot of room for actual genre parody here.Have a modicum of class. Excessive fan-service in and of itself is not funny. So, just show some restraint and do something that\'s actually funny instead of bringing in all the fan-servicey shite.Limit Fourth Wall Breaks. Like I said, these work best in moderation. In two episodes I would say the most you should have if you want them to retain their impact is three or four.Final Thoughts:Puni Puni Poemii wants to have the style of humour that Excel Saga uses to great effect. The problem is, it doesn\'t have a good sense of why Excel Saga works. As a consequence, it takes some superficial aspects like the quick, energetic dialogue and acts like that\'s enough. And while it has the occasional comedic bit that works, most of it is just obnoxious. In the end, I give it a 3/10. an action sequence involving our ""heroine"" fighting her way through a bunch of magical girls including Usagi from Sailor Moon and Sally.

Overall an okay anime, just don't take it serious, then you're doing it wrong."", '‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is cocaine made anime.When this anime came out in 2001, the anime magazine that I bought every month had this OVA as their cover story. The writer praised the show’s dark humor, goofball characters and potshots at the magical girl genre. Given how dark comedies were some of my favorite TV shows (and still are), I promised myself that I would watch it whenever I got the chance. Two decades later, and that moment has finally arrived……And boy do I regret it.I admit it. I have not watched ‘Excel Saga’ yet, but never once did I feel lost. Apparently, two characters...from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember. She is hopelessly obsessed with Poemi and her love-struck antics are creepily amusing. The rest of the cast, like Futaba’s sisters, are barely worth mentioning. Each one has a superficial defining trait and that’s it. There’s a dominatrix, a child psychic, a well-endowed woman, a girl who wants a bigger chest, and that’s all I can recall. And the less said about the scrotum-twirling villains, the better.Everyone is animated as if physics were an outdated science, but it fits the frenetic pace of the anime. Limbs are apparently made out of spaghetti in this universe. Characters are colorful and eye-popping, and Poemi’s magical girl design is straight fire. Backgrounds are as plain as can be, but…no one watches this for the stellar art.Kudos to Poemi’s voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Not only does she have lungs of steel for voicing a character that never shuts up, sings the opening and ending songs, but she herself dances in this OVA! Girl deserves a raise.Recommended only to people who like comedy that is random, perverted, AND dark. All three. Otherwise, don’t bother.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take some Advil for this headache. from the original show got married and had a child – Poemi – but the OVA stands on its own.If there were a main reason to laud the show, it would be that it gives zero fucks about being transgressive. It goes all the way with its shock humor and rips into magical girl shows with deranged glee. After all, the opening scene is Poemi beating up Sailor Moon and Utena. It parodies Star Wars, Evangelion, Dragon Ball, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, etc. Tropes are dissected left and right. Nothing is sacred.Some jokes did land for me and had that dark streak that I was expecting. For instance, one of the defenders of Earth had the super-power of blowing cherry blossom petals at her enemies... She gets easily destroyed by the villain’s laser beam. Another scene has Poemi seeing that the enemy had crucified her loved ones. She tearfully runs towards them…and crashes straight into one of the crucifixes, toppling the whole thing over. Good stuff.I also thought that the show breaking the fourth wall was funny too. There’s an obligatory bath scene with multiple busty women, which Poemi takes this as a cue to smugly turn to the camera and say that the viewer must be enjoying this. She even refers to herself by the name of her voice actress: Kobayashi. The anime’s coy winks at the watcher and its ability to poke fun at itself were quite fun.However, more often than not, ‘Puni Puni Poemy’ is painfully annoying. A thousand visual gags flash on the screen per minute and does not let up. They failed to elicit even the most strained grin from me. The show likes to throw everything at the viewer and see what sticks. No, I did not care for those three smiling humanoid blobs. That couple doing it doggy-style in the background got old fast. And if I see that alien show off its deflated, hairy balls at the screen again, I’m going to hurl.Other times, the anime is offensive just for the sake of being as offensive as possible. There were too many jokes that left a foul taste in my mouth. Earlier in my review, I commended the show for being bold. I stand by my words. In my opinion, if properly executed, there is no topic that is off-limits for comedy. Emphasis on ‘properly executed’. Apparently, comedic punchlines were a mystery to the writers. A news anchor reports the news of an attack on the city, when her boss suddenly grabs and pulls her off-screen to rape her. She screams ‘no’, ‘not now’, ‘not here,’ multiple times. Apparently, this was comedy gold for director Shinichi Watanabe, because this gag was used twice in one episode. It is very tricky to make a rape joke actually work, and this was a horrible attempt. If tasteless jokes about BDSM, sexual assault, child molestation, tentacle porn and the like makes you uncomfortable, run for the hills.Poemi is the standout character here. She is energetic, positive, social, and dumb as a doorbell. Her jaw-dropping stupidity and repeated failures at becoming a voice actress made her the perfect butt of the joke. Too bad she made me want to pour battery acid down my ears. The Flash and Road Runner must have had a love child, because I have never seen a character with that much enthusiasm before. She makes shounen heroes look lifeless by comparison. Poemi’s best friend, Futaba, is the only other character’s name I can remember.

It was confusing as hell there and I dare say it made less sense once I watched it.Other reviewers have said it, But I will say it again this is a parody of Magical Girl shows with in my opinion an undertone of humorous insult and love at those who enjoy watching them for ""Other"" reasons.If you like Chaos, and ruining every trope of a genre or three that you can, and Things that are most definitely not suitable for children, then this is your jam. I am sure I missed so many jokes, one that...I almost entirely missed is the fact that Poemii calls herself Kobayashi, It is just a hit on the fact that the voice actor\'s name is Kobayashi and she is self inserting. Golden.Long story short they accomplished everything they wanted to do, and if you are actually into Magical Girl shows and adult humor this will be even more enjoyable for you than I can suggest.I will probably never willingly watch this again, But damn they nailed this parody good. Good enough that I wanted to give my opinion about it. Quality 10/10, Rated seven because I am a stick in the mud.

It has the same director and overall style of humor.Compare to Excel Saga insanity went all the way to the new heights. At timed it made even me somewhat uncomfortable, may be because protagonist girl is clearly underage.However it is a very fun show, that fans of the original can enjoy. Fans of Gintama and Nichijou as well.As far as I remember you do not need to watch Excel Saga to understand what is going on. However it is probably best if you do watch it first.This show parodies magical girl genre as well as tentacles sex...in hentai. It also touches on BDSM and sexuality generally. Stuff that became more explicit as anime developed.In some ways this show was a pioneer of the future trends. Much like Space Capitan Herlock.Overall I can recommend it to all fans of comedy as well as to people interested in history of anime. in hentai. It also touches on BDSM and sexuality generally.

The music is alright but I gotta say the story is nonexistent. There wasn\'t even a transition to the next song it\'s just instant ""oh new girl new song"" kinda sh*t. Can\'t say much about the art cause I watch this on...some sketchy webpage so it\'s at least a good 180p. And what\'s even better is how the English subtitles are french and sometimes it transitions to English which made me rate this a tad bit high. The only thing I gotta say is telling my good old friend @Zerity to go **** ******* ***** ****** ***** **** ******* ****. And in the future, I will not ask him for any suggestions on what I should watch at 3 am. A good lesson learned. some sketchy webpage so it\'s at least a good 180p.

Precure All Stars Movie: Haru no Carnival♪,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28511/Precure_All_Stars_Movie__Haru_no_Carnival♪,"[""...so the last Precure All Stars review I did (New Stage 2), I complained about some stuff, but overall it was a fairly good movie that kept up the spirit of the crossover movies and was a fun watch. As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point. This movie has No plot or a story to follow. If you can see the Max heart, fresh, or Heartcatch gropus dancing maybe you can see this movie. The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10. Basically they are no character development. They are a lot of precure now and that will be difficult to do. Yes, we have Princess precure, our main characters. Haruka, Cure Flora learns a important (?) lesson but in real life it doesn't have any sense. In other movies characters learn about the importance of friendship, about the dreams and future but, is dancing and singing that important?Yes, I enjoy it. But it in general the movie didn't impact me comparing with other movies that have Precure in the name. The only thing I want is a better movie from this title. Scince Fresh! Precure we can see the main characters having a dance during the ending, and that is popular around little girls in Japan. There is a game about that and now a whole movie about 70 minutes about that. Is Toei laking on writting a good story for a movie of this franchise? is the prove of that.

It makes me feel like a copy-and-paste from previous seasons, a Precure advertisement and a Highschool musical copycat.

Although the scores were composed...by Yasuharu Takanashi (Naruto, Fairy tails, ...) they didn't give me any special impression.Character (5/10)In this movie, they introduced every Precure season again, which is boring.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10. Basically they are no character development. They are a lot of precure now and that will be difficult to do. Yes, we have Princess precure, our main characters.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10. Basically they are no character development. They are a lot of precure now and that will be difficult to do. Yes, we have Princess precure, our main characters.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10. Basically they are no character development. They are a lot of precure now and that will be difficult to do. Yes, we have Princess precure, our main characters. Haruka, Cure Flora learns a important (?) lesson but in real life it doesn't have any sense. In other movies characters learn about the importance of friendship, about the dreams and future but, is dancing and singing that important?Yes, I enjoy it. But it in general the movie didn't impact me comparing with other movies that have Precure in the name. The only thing I want is a better movie from this title. Scince Fresh! Precure we can see the main characters having a dance during the ending, and that is popular around little girls in Japan. There is a game about that and now a whole movie about 70 minutes about that. Is Toei laking on writting a good story for a movie of this franchise? is the prove of that.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

The movie doesn\'t add anything new to any of them either.Enjoyment 3/10I liked the music videos.Overall 3/10I don\'t recommend this movie for anyone. You can find a playlist on youtube of all the pretty cure opening and endings, and it would serve the same purpose.', ""What can we say about this move? Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point. This movie has No plot or a story to follow. If you can see the Max heart, fresh, or Heartcatch gropus dancing maybe you can see this movie. The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point. This movie has No plot or a story to follow. If you can see the Max heart, fresh, or Heartcatch gropus dancing maybe you can see this movie. The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10. Basically they are no character development. They are a lot of precure now and that will be difficult to do. Yes, we have Princess precure, our main characters. Haruka, Cure Flora learns a important (?) lesson but in real life it doesn't have any sense. In other movies characters learn about the importance of friendship, about the dreams and future but, is dancing and singing that important?Yes, I enjoy it. But it in general the movie didn't impact me comparing with other movies that have Precure in the name. The only thing I want is a better movie from this title. Scince Fresh!

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point. This movie has No plot or a story to follow. If you can see the Max heart, fresh, or Heartcatch gropus dancing maybe you can see this movie. The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point. This movie has No plot or a story to follow. If you can see the Max heart, fresh, or Heartcatch gropus dancing maybe you can see this movie. The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10. Basically they are no character development. They are a lot of precure now and that will be difficult to do. Yes, we have Princess precure, our main characters. Haruka, Cure Flora learns a important (?) lesson but in real life it doesn't have any sense. In other movies characters learn about the importance of friendship, about the dreams and future but, is dancing and singing that important?Yes, I enjoy it. But it in general the movie didn't impact me comparing with other movies that have Precure in the name. The only thing I want is a better movie from this title. Scince Fresh! Precure we can see the main characters having a dance during the ending, and that is popular around little girls in Japan.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point. This movie has No plot or a story to follow. If you can see the Max heart, fresh, or Heartcatch gropus dancing maybe you can see this movie. The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10. Basically they are no character development. They are a lot of precure now and that will be difficult to do. Yes, we have Princess precure, our main characters.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point. This movie has No plot or a story to follow. If you can see the Max heart, fresh, or Heartcatch gropus dancing maybe you can see this movie. The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point.

The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains.

Before this movie an all stars movie from precure has a plot and a story to see. A enemy and the group pf girls trying to defeat that enemy. Haru No carnival is weak at this point.

The only part of story is: Someone is stealing the mascots during the main event.The art and animation is quite good. The CGI is really improving in all precure franchise and this movie...is the prove of that. In general, the animation doesn't have anything wrong at my opinion. talking about the 2D animation is good, is the average animation you can see in a lot of animes.The music is other thing...If you are in precure in at least, 3 or more years the sounds will tired you. Hearing again some of the openings or endings will get you angry at some point. That or you will feel nostalgic. Or if you are new on precure you maybe will think a lot of things: too childish maybe or repetitive (they say precure all the songs). About the incidental music, is also repetitive. Most of them is repetitive (again, if you watched previous precure seasons, you can notice that in this movie 90% or more is recicled music.In character, 6/10.

As it is every year, with a new Precure team, there's a new All Stars movie, in this case we have Spring Carnival with the rookie Princess Precure team headlining the show. So how did it do?Story (3/10): So all the Precure teams have been invited to another magical kingdom (this one called Harmonia) for a Spring Carnival, but unbeknownst to them, it's been taken...over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit. This plot actually makes the Miracle Lights look dignified.Seriously, this is honestly the worst that I've seen these movies be. While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker? The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking.

While the first New Stage was shaky, at least it had a plot and took itself seriously. This? This is bad. There's almost no tension in this story, and it feels almost bland. Just...there's nothing really exciting here to talk about. It's just a boring as hell story and while I feel bad about ripping into it, at the same time I feel like with the way the current series is going, that this is a massive step down in comparison.Oh and the kicker?

The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening.

It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains.

It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains.

It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to.

It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking.

I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant.

I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit.

The first half of the movie is a music video for each team. No really, you read that right. Each team gets a chance to perform either their opening or ending theme, with the team doing the CGI dance from the ending or a new dance to the opening. And while it is nice to hear some familiar songs, you have to imagine that Japanese parents were pissed when they realized that they had to sit through at least 40 minutes worth of nothing.(Also, you ever see the Gokaiger 199 Heroes movie? You know, where all the Sentai teams show up at the end? I'm 100% certain that they ripped off the climax for that and stuck it on here.)Art (6/10): One of the positives of the movie is that it shows off all the updated CGI Precure models, and boy do they looks good. Some look better than others, though that is more than likely due to animation style rather than anything else, since more often than not, they look amazing. Otherwise the art was average for the movie, with few and far between scenes looking good.Also the Primavera Keys for the Princess Precure are honestly not that great looking. In fact the design looks like they just stuck puffy stickers to regular Elegant Mode dresses and called it a day. I'm starting to miss the original upgrade forms from the DX movies...Sound (6/10): As stated above, this movie has a lot of tracks from previous shows. There are openings and endings aplenty, so you have the chance to listen to some good music at least. Oh yeah, and there's a terrible fourth wall breaking song sung by the villains. ...it sucks.Character (5/10): I'll give the movie a pass on one thing. It does a great job with showing off each team of Precure and it lets them all have some screen time. Everyone behaves in character and they all react in the way that you're used to. It is, however, really obvious about which voice actors they got to come back for each team, since at least half to 3/4ths of the cast just stand in the background not saying anything.The worst part of this movie, though, goes straight to the villains. Hell, I'm honestly reluctant to call them villains. They're idiots that try to be comic relief and it's just painful. Remember the huge big bads from other movies? You know, where they tower over the Precure and it takes the power of all the teams to kick their ass? Yeah, these guys aren't even worthy of being shit those villains step in. And there's also the royalty of Harmonia and a last minute boss, but they're in the movie for a grand total of 5 minutes, so no, they really don't count as characters.Enjoyment (4/10): This one is bad guys. Really bad. I could barely sit through it. Actually, I fast forwarded through parts because it was either boring, bad, or not all that interesting. Seriously, after the shaky start of the New Stage movies, they ended up with a mostly well done third movie. This though? This is child pandering at its worst. The fights are disappointingly short, there's just no tension, and it's almost insulting that someone thought that this script was a good idea.Precure All Stars: Spring Carnival has set itself to be remembered. Not for anything good, mind you. This is easily the worst of the All Star movies, with an almost stupid story, musical recaps, stupid villains, lazy reasoning, and just all around backward step in how the movies were going.5/10: Precure fans will more likely than not really dislike this movie; only thing going for it is better time spent on past teams and interactions; pretty much sums up as lazy child pandering; I seriously urge that if you aren't a Precure fan, you should stay away; over by a thief and his assistant. When the two realize who's coming, they decide to hold a 'concert' to catch the teams unaware of their wrongdoing and escape with their transformation devices....holy shit.
