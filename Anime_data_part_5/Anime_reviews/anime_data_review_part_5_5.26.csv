UFO Robo Grendizer tai Great Mazinger,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4387/UFO_Robo_Grendizer_tai_Great_Mazinger,"['This is generally a Grendizer-focused movie, as their alien arch-enemies have a new guy from their home planet show up who successfully kidnaps Kouji and has him reveal the location of Great Mazinger which is hanging out in a museum now. New general guy takes Great Mazinger and Grendizer has to fight him.No big surprises in the format here, but it\'s a little more entertaining because there isn\'t too much dull footage of attacks being cried out that do nothing to the latest monster. The humor is more bearable than usual because there\'s no Boss Borot (who also liked to waste a lot of time...in these). Most of this movie has consistent plot development, as simple as it is, and Kouji trying to escape from the alien warship takes up a large chunk. The fight between Grendizer and Great Mazinger is pretty all right, instead of it just being a slugfest of attacks traded back and forth there\'s some actual choreography and movement as the two robots get re-positioned and put in more compromising positions. It\'s still pretty basic, but more thought went into it than usual. It\'s probably worth mentioning that this means this is one of the few ""Vs."" movies that are actually a fight between two of the star robots and not a collaboration against a common enemy, though the two do team up at the end for the final blow. The bummer is that this isn\'t a true Grendizer vs. Great Mazinger fight that might actually be interesting to watch because Great Mazinger is being piloted by a villain, but it\'s no surprise they wouldn\'t want to show heroes fighting each other in a children\'s show from this time. Well that\'s about it. It was a fun watch. in these). Most of this movie has consistent plot development, as simple as it is, and Kouji trying to escape from the alien warship takes up a large chunk.

Tono to Issho,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7591/Tono_to_Issho,"['This is my first review it will have bad grammar. So please try to deal with it.Story: There really is no story its really just a gag anime full of randomness but to best sum it up it Follows the daily lives and details the eccentricities of Date Masamune, Uesugi Kenshin, other famous territorial lords, and their followers during Japan\'s Warring States period. You don\'t really need to learn about Japanese history or any of the historical figures. Honestly if you know alot about Japanese history then you\'ll probably get more enjoyment.Art/Animation: the Anime of the artwork is pretty good While the animation its acceptable...but, the problem is the movement of the animation seems to look a bit choppy and it also looks more like a flash animation as well but that really isn\'t a bad thing in my opinion.Sound: I really can\'t say much about this department but lets just say its overall in the Anime the sound is okay nothing specialCharacters: Oh I just love the characters a lot! Espically Masamune, Date in the old days he is called the one eyed dragon due to losing the eye. In this little gag Anime he is known to lose his eye in a very way and has a crazy eye patch fetish Nobunaga Oda is his evil self and Mitsuhide According to Japanese history he was suppose to betray Nobunaga but instead gets caught trying to betray him. Unfortunately I do not know any of the other historical figures but all of them are so funny they all have such funny personality\'s you can\'t help believe they were important people that established japan!Enjoyment: When you probably see the thumbnail of the anime you\'ll probably think ""wtf? this Anime looks like a crappy OVA"" don\'t think that just give this OVA a try don\'t judge until you see. Even, if you don\'t know any Japanese history you\'ll still get a few laughs out of it. I enjoyed quite a bit that it actually makes me want more of this little gag series. It was originally a 4-koma manga that is still running I think. Its too bad that there is not Manga scanalation team to translate the Manga I enjoy it that much that it makes me want to read the original manga.Overall: I enjoyed it a lot With no knowledge of any of the historical figures it might be hard to get some of the jokes at times but that doesn\'t mean its not watchable. Some people will most likely dislike this OVA but just give it a try you\'ll definitely get a few chuckles then and there. but, the problem is the movement of the animation seems to look a bit choppy and it also looks more like a flash animation as well but that really isn\'t a bad thing in my opinion.Sound: I really can\'t say much about this department but lets just say its overall in the Anime the sound is okay nothing specialCharacters: Oh I just love the characters a lot!

Tobidase! Narase! Pui Pui Molcar,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49146/Tobidase_Narase_Pui_Pui_Molcar,"['This is undoubtedly the single greatest piece of art to ever hit theatres. Absolutely everything about it was top-notch, and I could not recommend it more. The storyline was simply so compelling that it brought me to tears. The artwork and stop motion animation was perfect, capturing every frame in the absolute best way possible. The sounds of the movie were serenading my ears throughout the entire film. It was as if I had died and been reborn with every little squeak, every little effect, every single sound caressing my ear canals. The characters, as well as their development was second to none. Every character...that was introduced brought a new and compelling feature to the movie. Just when you thought they had every character archetype, a new one appears, in greater fashion than you could have ever imagined. The sheer enjoyment knowing that I was one of the lucky souls blessed enough to find this anime is enough to fulfill every life dream and aspiration I have ever had. Pui Pui Molcar completed my life. It completed me. Pui Pui Molcar is the single greatest series to ever exist, and the movie still found a way to make it better. I could not imagine a more perfect ending to an already perfect series. If you have not watched this, I promise you it will change you. If you have a loved one who is suffering, this movie alone will cure them of all their pains. If you are struggling to get out of bed every single morning, Pui Pui Molcar will be the reason why you continue.

Touka Gettan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2105/Touka_Gettan,"[""First of all, don't watch this series backwards.  Just don't do it.  People will tell you to do it, but don't listen to them.  Just like the movie Memento, this anime is meant to be watched in reverse chronological order.The biggest reason you shouldn't watch it backwards is because episode 25 does not follow the reverse chronology time order so it will ruin the rest of the series for you.  The later episodes, 19-26, are generally better than the earlier ones so if you watch it backwards, the series loses steam as it goes on.People are tempted to watch...it backwards because the plot is really hard to grasp in the first few episodes.  Truth be told, the plot is not the main reason to watch this show.  It's a decent plot full of mystery and supernatural suspense, but it has its share of plot holes and slightly jumbled plotlines.  Without the unique format of the show, Touka Gettan would just be another mildly entertaining  and undistinguished fantasy drama.Watching Touka Gettan the way it's meant to be watched gives the viewer an appreciation of the way the story has been molded to fit the format.  You can easily see where this format succeeds in bringing something unique to the story, and also where it fails.  It challenges the viewer to reevaluate his own expectations when watching an anime.  When you see a character as they are introduced into the storyline, you realize that that constitutes the end of their role in the story.  Most everything they will contribute has already been covered.  Instead of waiting for the last episode to see if a certain plotline gets resolved eventually, you're made to be aware of the entire lifecycle of plots being introduced and resolved as the series goes on.Aside from the format, the anime has several things going for it.  The animation is very lush and it sets a great mysterious mood.  There are several episodes near the end presented in very different and unexpected ways which just adds to the quirkiness of the series.  Some of the issues touched on in the show are surprisingly deep and adds a small level of discomfort which is not a bad thing.  Some will be turned off by instances of really risque fanservice, but my own opinion is it just adds to the charming strangeness of it all.Many anime viewers don't really want a challenge when they watch something.  A lot of people will not bother with this show because it takes so much effort and concentration to watch it.  I think if you can get over that, it's a really unique anime and a great watch for people who appreciate the more innovative side of anime. it backwards because the plot is really hard to grasp in the first few episodes.

But it's those things that make this an under-appreciated, under-rated masterpiece.The art and general quality of this series is generally pretty nice. The opening is nice and mysterious with a nice song by Momoka's seiyuu that is very traditional sounding. The end animation isn't anything impressive but the song is nice and soothing, very lullaby-ish.The characters are interesting and are put into unique situations (including staying at a haunted inn, yaoi Dojinshi, social abuse/exclusion and a yuri love triangle). Character's importance and attitude is confusing at first if you watch...it in the airing order backwards but watching it in the original order is best as it allows you to guess and make theories about what is going on throughout the series until the very end. If you get over that and deal with some of the stranger-scenes (that some might not be comfortable with) you could end up enjoying this series greatly.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes romance, mystery and fantasy. I'd also recommend watching it backwards in the airing order with the first episode last and the last episode first. This way, the big twist will have more effect on you. it in the airing order backwards but watching it in the original order is best as it allows you to guess and make theories about what is going on throughout the series until the very end.

If nothing else, Touka Gettan is very pleasant to look at.The bottom line is that this anime is not everyone's cuppa. Touka Gettan is undeniably unique, but it's up to the individual whether that's a good or bad thing. I believe this series will most appeal to someone tired of cookie cutter anime, someone who's looking for something different.In case you are not yet aware, Touka Gettan aired (mostly) in reverse chronological order. Now, while this is not a new concept, it is a...rarely used device. As a disclaimer, I watched Touka Gettan in chronological order (episodes 26, 24-1, 25) because of the way my mind works, but despite this I can absolutely see the genius of the proper order.Touka Gettan was not made and then randomly aired backwards. The order of the episodes plays on the world of Touka Gettan's concepts of time, complementing its lack of linearity. As I was watching, I considered how each scene would have been different and how the impact would have changed if I had been watching the series in reverse order, and I could see how clever it was. The beginning of the series is the end, and the end is the beginning.So, I can't say that watching it one way is better than the other. Both ways have their positives and negatives.Among Touka Gettan's unique characteristics is its atmosphere. I would describe it as the strangest combination of gag humor and and morbid seriousness. I'm still not sure how they got that formula to work so well.It's hilarious in many place, adorable in others, and downright disturbing from time to time. A lot of the elements aren't things I'm normally a fan of, but somehow it all just worked.A handful of episodes are presented in especially unique ways, and I found this an interesting way to break of the monotony of a traditional linear presentation.Touka Gettan is not something you can casually watch; there's so much happening, so much depth. I felt like I should have been taking notes in order to keep up. The cast is moderately large, and just keeping track of who everyone was could be difficult at times.While I was watching, I felt a number of the characters served no purpose, but after I had finished the series I discovered that most of those characters were crossover characters from Carnelian's other series, such as Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito. I think the inclusion of these characters is a questionable choice as it only benefits a viewer if they're familiar with the other series, and they truly stick out in a negative way in this character-driven anime.The relationships between all the characters are very complex, and are more or less left shrouded in mystery (I'm not sure how much of this is because they're explained in the corresponding visual novels).So, in conclusion, many things about Touka Gettan are frustrating, but it's arguable whether those things are good or bad. You also don't get the answers to all your questions by the end, which is one of my personal pet peeves. What I enjoyed most about Touka Gettan is its uniqueness.Overall, I think it's an anime worth watching, but you have to go in being prepared to pay attention.Be warned that this anime contains: ecchi, homosexuality, gag humor rarely used device.

What it is meanders between comedy, fantasy, and romance, often all at once. It is not one aspect or another; some episodes consist almost entirely of one theme, but later combine them with not necessarily equal proportions. What it does seem to have as an underlying element is Buddhism, and this sense that the present is what matters, as in the anime when the past is thought of destructive fantasies come into fruition, and if it's the future doubt is thrown in, as in real life. Other than that, each...episode is narratively distinct, although they all have a bedrock of characters that appear in nearly every one. It is, essentially, an ensemble cast, but some are more visible due to their specific function in the world of Kamitsumihara.It doesn't shy away from much, which makes it fickle as a genre. Some fantasy may be comedic and serious at other times, but not many also attempt to present each story in its own specific frame, whether a theatre (and as such doubt its authenticity, in thinking the viewer is watching the watchers, but then viewers are still doing such an action outside of such a frame). It can have a meta-narrative, as per the implication that a character is also the writer, but still that somehow in-universe personalities are aware of subtitling. The latter is comedic, but the former is used more often in more serious narratives that serve as a commentary to what a 'flow' is, and how a subconsciousness may take over. The anime itself isn't told at all as simply as most other stories, and yet guises itself in typical shounen tropes, which may be distracting as to what causes this and that. Visually it synergizes with the script.While anime like Katekyo may have stereotypical props that tell a fairly straightforward story (that can still narrate it with vigour, although more comedic), Gettan uses items like swords in a similar, but symbolic fashion. Most events are also almost metaphorical, like when the sword first appeared. This is what separates it from most shounen anime, although the comedic episodes have more similarity, despite usually ending with a supernatural twist. This is what makes this story more unique than most other anime with similar themes, along with the variable of sexuality (done in a subtle way), which isn't by itself positive or negative; it was like Inuyasha (with shrines and myths) if that wasn't so single-minded about Naraku. In far fewer episodes Gettan tries to be even more varied, and this is also evident in its music which can range from jazz to (what sounds like) harps.Now, with regards to the average viewer's perception (as indicated by the decimals on various sites)... how exactly does a mind work? So, as long as one assumes Moonlight Lady 1 is seen by the same people as 2 (Gettan)... how? Was the prequel rated solely on how titillated one felt? Narrative and anything non-repetitive be damned? One is hentai, the other is a subtle narrative about meta-universes and existential possibilities... oh, but one can't possibly expect so much from the average viewer, can one? It's a world where Erica Friedman apparently complained it's not yuri enough. I mean, sure, it's unbelievable it even has such a prequel, so perhaps it's attracted the wrong sort of people, unable to appreciate both Yami and this.An impressive analysis of this series was done in the book titled 'Anime and the Visual Novel: Narrative Structure, Design and Play at the Crossroads of Animation and Computer Games' by Dani Cavallaro, page 55 - after the writing about Yami.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryThis Anime is really difficult to review. Objectively thinking its great, but personally I disliked it a lot.Starting with story. I love the Miko\'s and onmyouji type of a setup (shrines, goddesses/gods and their magic), but they have to be presented in a fun way. That was I absolutely adore them. This anime felt more of an one of those story hentai series, that I dislike as they make me feel uneasy. Same was with this anime. Putting aside it\'s reverse chronological air order, which gave a...fair amount of confusion. And I guess I\'m too stupid to comprehend these types of series. As I have horrid memory and forcing me to remember previous episode in order to reconstruct the present episode in my mind. Is basically impossible for me.. I have a very odd brain, just kill me regarding that.Anyhow. Story gave really odd feeling. The endless uneasiness and a lot of weird story aspects and elements I were not fond of. It had that slow and mysterious pacing that I generally like, but this one did rub me in a wrong way. There were fair amount of balance between sexy scenes /fanservice, serious thematics and comedy aspects, which is another great point for a story element.Lot of interesting quirks and non-standard jokes. But in the end, even if story was good/intriguing, it\'s effect of confusion and uneasiness is something I cannot agree/like with.AND IGNORE TOPICS THAT TELL YOU TO WATCH IT REVERSE. That Is actually tip for any Anime, watch it in release order, not in chronological order. If Artist decided that\'s the way he/she wants to convey his/her work, that\'s the way you should digest it. Maiming such purpose, would simply make it pointless. Meaning that, watch how it\'s made, do not perverse it.✦Art & SoundI have nothing to complain about these aspects. Considering it\'s quite an old Anime, it still felt and looked superb. If only thing I have to criticize, which  is purely personal, would be that it felt like watching around same\'ish years Hentai series which had story focus. (as mentioned before, not fond of those, make me uneasy.)Anyhow, Art and Animation was superb. Lots of shading, depth, cuteness, oddity, uniqueness, sexiness and so on...Music and OST was absolutely stunning. A lot of emotional, fun, serious and so on tracks. Maybe I wasn\'t that fond of those comedic tracks, but overall it was superb. Will definitely have to separately check all the OST later and keep those I like.✦CharacterLot of stereotypes with oddity variations, which was a nice touch. Although the relationships (various - between characters, the goddess host and the world, goddesses, goddesses and host etc... some of them were as well quite uneasy, odd in not a good way. Plus all the ""sexual touching/relationships"" between some of the characters also made me feel uneasy. For such an topic serious type Anime, in such presentation method, I was not fond of many things. Including ""fan-service"". Over time you would learn about everyone, especially weirdly since Anime aired backwards.✦Enjoyment & OverallContinuing from previous paragraph, the backwards airing part might be a big cause why lot of things I was not fond of / felt uneasy / disliked etc... but that doesn\'t change the fact aside uneasiness, I found it boring at times, disliked some plot points, character relationships and the presentation method (not the backwards airing aspect, mean as the whole, how the Anime was presented/felt as)Really wanted to drop it with a low score. But as saying, objectively it is almost certainly not a bad Anime, simply personally I disliked it a lot. And maybe my odd cancerous brain simply couldn\'t process it. But that still means I\'m not fond of such serious Anime where I have to re-construct it in my mind. That doesn\'t mean I don\'t love more complex anime (monogatari series, lain etc... - they are complex, but enjoyable, yet make sense for me as they are self-explanatory. I don\'t read into things or in-between-lines, I simply take it as it is.)Anyhow.. most bipolar review so far. I dropped an Anime which I score 7/10 ..  only Anime I have dropped so far with high score is ""kirarin revolution"" but that was simply because I couldn\'t find anywhere to watch nor subtitles thus I gave up on it.But this one Is purely dropped because of personal enjoyment. If I\'ll ever get  a new brain I might check it out again. fair amount of confusion. And I guess I\'m too stupid to comprehend these types of series. As I have horrid memory and forcing me to remember previous episode in order to reconstruct the present episode in my mind. Is basically impossible for me.. I have a very odd brain, just kill me regarding that.Anyhow. Story gave really odd feeling. The endless uneasiness and a lot of weird story aspects and elements I were not fond of. It had that slow and mysterious pacing that I generally like, but this one did rub me in a wrong way. There were fair amount of balance between sexy scenes /fanservice, serious thematics and comedy aspects, which is another great point for a story element.Lot of interesting quirks and non-standard jokes. But in the end, even if story was good/intriguing, it\'s effect of confusion and uneasiness is something I cannot agree/like with.AND IGNORE TOPICS THAT TELL YOU TO WATCH IT REVERSE. That Is actually tip for any Anime, watch it in release order, not in chronological order. If Artist decided that\'s the way he/she wants to convey his/her work, that\'s the way you should digest it. Maiming such purpose, would simply make it pointless. Meaning that, watch how it\'s made, do not perverse it.✦Art & SoundI have nothing to complain about these aspects. Considering it\'s quite an old Anime, it still felt and looked superb. If only thing I have to criticize, which  is purely personal, would be that it felt like watching around same\'ish years Hentai series which had story focus. (as mentioned before, not fond of those, make me uneasy.)Anyhow, Art and Animation was superb. Lots of shading, depth, cuteness, oddity, uniqueness, sexiness and so on...Music and OST was absolutely stunning. A lot of emotional, fun, serious and so on tracks. Maybe I wasn\'t that fond of those comedic tracks, but overall it was superb. Will definitely have to separately check all the OST later and keep those I like.✦CharacterLot of stereotypes with oddity variations, which was a nice touch. Although the relationships (various - between characters, the goddess host and the world, goddesses, goddesses and host etc... some of them were as well quite uneasy, odd in not a good way. Plus all the ""sexual touching/relationships"" between some of the characters also made me feel uneasy.

However, upon discovering he has no affinity for magic at the magic academy entrance exam, he becomes an outcast and decides to spend his life as a gardener. Fortunately, he stays with a man who had fairy seeds which are said to help breakthrough your cultivation once successfully grown. Yuan Ding overtakes the old man's dream of cultivating a fairy seed and finds himself in a lot more conflict than he bargained for as the fairy wants to kill...him. Will this otaku's dreams be realized in the next life?Story & Character: 5/10 (Spoilers)Spirit Seed Manual starts off as the usual fantasy isekai but more uneventful because Yuan Ding doesn't have the run-of-the-mill overpowered magic affinity. Instead, he becomes an underdog character that gains his powers from cultivating fairies. Fairies are said to be immortal, transcendent beings who was former human but live on as a seed because of their cruel past life. The story follows this idea by making the main character fight against himself in these flashbacks with the fairies to increase his compatibility with them; Ironically enough Yuan Ding claims he doesn't want to treat this new world as a game but in the end he literally treats the past life with Lotus Cream as a game when he fails. Furthermore, there are many events in the series that are just unexplainable beyond plot armor like when the Vampire killed him but he was brought back to life with the Vampire's vitality?? or maybe the scene where he is brought back into the Magic Academy and his personality changes when he seduces a girl (The vampire's charm) yet when he fights toward the end it's like his charm powers doesn't even exist. The dragon he meets changes sides like it's no big deal; He fights Yuan Ding in the first encounter and betrays him in the third encounter; Finally back on his side after exiting Lotus Cream's flashback world - I don't understand this plot convenience and the characters fragile personalities. The alternate Yuan Ding and flashbacks does kind of tick me off because it doesn't really add value to the actual plot of MC becoming stronger using fairies (outside of the idea of compatibility with Yuan Ding).Art & Sound: 6/10The animation did feel pretty choppy but the art quality wasn't too bad considering it's a 2D series straight from the mainland. (resource availability & budget) It wouldn't be your typical 2021 series in Japan but it doesn't exactly feel low budget. Character design was good, I like the otaku clothing/style character Yuan Ding maintains throughout the series since it adds to his demeanor. The sound was also above average; Most of the time the music is just a typical fantasy themed happy backing track. When it gets serious it naturally changes to that high BPM suspenseful music. I liked the voice actors since they naturally fit the characters. Overall, sound and art department gets an above average.Overall & Enjoyment: 5/10Reviews will now become more frustrating to make since there is no ENTER for a new line; Literally changes the experience for the worse.

Of all the registered businesses in Japan; only one is categorised as 'supernatural' - something like that! Its been several months at the time of writing this review XDThe super spunky and very irresponsible Ayaka, the detective Karina and her co workers deal with all sorts of trouble such as vampires, laser turrets in a surgery room, haunted exhibits and worst of all; serious financial debt! As heroic...their deeds are, Ayaka's collateral damage or spending sprees always seem to put them back to square zero! The stories may be standard but the sheer energy the characters bring as they progress the plot is anything but! 7/10Art: This is a slightly above average looking 90s ova featuring brilliant colours and (supposedly bland?) very likeable character designs! So good that even with the underdevelopment of half of the characters; you cant help but... love em! The action scenes are also standout with the final rooftop duel being so well choreographed that it almost looks like rotoscoping! (or maybe it is XD). 9/10 not like Patlabor 2 good but the next thing down!Sound: Standard um... 80s style pop synth if I remember? entertaining I suppose but not particularly good? Uses a bit of orchaestra for action themes in keeping with its horror themes too. 7/10 The ending theme is somewhat above average for an 80s anime pop tune.Character: The main character is the fiery and gorgeous action girl type that will drive an anime singlehandedly and make it entertaining; no matter how poor everything else may be (it isn't). The focus on the MC is however rather prominent, meaning that some characters get an underwhelming amount of development (the teen pyropsyker and the big exorcist guy in particular) the character designs give off charm on their own but I wished these two got more screentime (they were only introduced in the 2nd OVA) to fully realise that charm. The real strength of this anime is the perfect use of body language in the animation (a lot of exaggerations too!) as the ultimate expression of characterisation. 9/10 Its so adorable seeing our characters react to the disaster of the day!Enjoyment: lively animation, a beautiful colour palette and super charming characters all set within a monster mix of classic western and oriental horror mythos. Something fun that most people can enjoy; especially fans of retro anime OVAs. 9/10Rating: Tweens and up.

Although it's looks are good, the character design is a bit bland.  None of the designs particularly bad, but there's nothing to write home about either.Story wise it's sufficient.

Starts out slow, then comes upbeat and finished slow. In a way it describes the timeline of the show but doesn't really work. When you listen to it you will find it ends just fine on the last upbeat note. Even has a nice final picture at that point to go with it. While the reaming slow portion of the introduction song and art is entertaining and nicely done just isn't needed.- Introduction to the show makes sense. It is the same general type...you would see on most action tv shows. Such as Csi or Law and order. Where the camera focuses on the event in the surrounding area that will end up building into a long nights work so to phrase. While it may be nice to start with screen showing the main character or characters it is not generally about them but the people they help. Which makes sense when you think about it. Otherwise the movie would come off rather selfish.-While each episode has it's own story some elements still remain the same. Such as characters postions with each other and personal matters the characters have. Such as debt.-Conclusion going back to what i mentioned before ends off slow. While the artist/writer(s) could have a comical ending you can tell from the art alone they want to you not to laugh but get into touch with all your emotions including laughter.Artno issues on anything upsetting appearance or transitions.Sound- no complaintsCharacter- while it appears that some of the characters need a better build on information the story works well without it. Understand, the idea of characters is to lead you along with the story. In a sense they are your tour guide for the adventure. While one can go and on and on on what one character's personal matters are such as college degree or upbringings; Unless it builds on the orignal plot why should i care? Not to be rude but it boring otherwise.Enjoyment: If you want to take a moment of your time and watch an semi old moderate in length short television anime then watch this. While the humor is light it doesn't have off putting bits: gore, heavy plot, light plot, high insight, low insight, bad art.... you get the idea. you would see on most action tv shows. Such as Csi or Law and order. Where the camera focuses on the event in the surrounding area that will end up building into a long nights work so to phrase. While it may be nice to start with screen showing the main character or characters it is not generally about them but the people they help. Which makes sense when you think about it. Otherwise the movie would come off rather selfish.-While each episode has it's own story some elements still remain the same. Such as characters postions with each other and personal matters the characters have. Such as debt.-Conclusion going back to what i mentioned before ends off slow. While the artist/writer(s) could have a comical ending you can tell from the art alone they want to you not to laugh but get into touch with all your emotions including laughter.Artno issues on anything upsetting appearance or transitions.Sound- no complaintsCharacter- while it appears that some of the characters need a better build on information the story works well without it. Understand, the idea of characters is to lead you along with the story. In a sense they are your tour guide for the adventure.

I always enjoy a femal main character who has himbo energy like this. Honestly, all the characters have himbo energy. The animation is fun and bouncy, and the outfits are great. the ridiculousness of whats going on with no explanation suspends the viewers disbelief enough that you'll go  along with whatever. All in all, purely for the entertainment factor when combined with a solid 8...in all other fields, I give this a ten. in all other fields, I give this a ten."", ""This is a wild, funny OVA that manages to pack one hell of a punch in just 4 episodes. Richly animated, cleverly written, and wreathed with a world of magic and monsters in the heart of Tokyo, I'd say that Phantom Quest Corp is one of the quintessential 90s anime, even if it feels more like a high-production 80s anime. Then, to add to all of this, it is surrounded by weird random facts and quirks, like how the woman who sings the intro theme and voices the main character, Rica Matsumoto, would soon go on to be the VA for Ash Ketchum, or how...according to the special extra episode 'File 00', they got the actual real-life 49th Priest of Enkozen Temple, Mudo Oda, to do some kind of voice work on the OVA as well.  Beginning with the story, it's a simple yet effective formula that is highly episodic in its execution. Each episode is its own self-contained story regarding the supernatural, which works really well with the pacing and tone of the show. I enjoy how various tropes are covered from both the Western and Eastern traditions, coupled with unique and imaginative spins on how these encounters with the beyond would look like in the bustling metropolitan life of mid-90s Japan. All in all, the relatively simple story formula is perfect for this title, and embodies its most essential characteristic- fun. The whole anime just feels so fun, like a night out on the town, even with the crazy stakes and the bizarre esoteric encounters. However, in the case of this anime, the story is really just a backdrop to its strongest aspect- the art. The art for this anime is positively magnificent, representing the zenith of 90s anime in its latest and most developed incarnation. It is aligned with itself and its themes in every way, from the vibrant, saturated color palate, to the painstakingly detailed backgrounds, and the brilliant character designs, the art provides Phantom Quest Corp its own unique identity. Even the animation quality, with the seamless composition of fight scenes, and even the way characters interact with the everyday world, never fails to impress. It captures the warm, living essence of the style which defined that era of anime, and even on this merit alone I'm shocked that more people haven't heard of it. It is an aesthetic powerhouse, eye candy from start to finish. Even the architectural design applied to various interiors, like their headquarters, the tea house, and the hospital, all bear a level of detail and aesthetic harmony that most people would simply overlook, and probably do. Yet, this anime has gone the extra mile, and fulfilled its vision down to the last detail. The sound is also good, with strong, characteristic voice work and an OST which oscillates between smooth 90s jazz and frenetic citypop. The characters are similarly strong, with a fun dynamic and chemistry within the cast that further lends the show this general sense of high-spirited wellbeing. Of the cast, my favorite characters have to be Ayaka Kisaragi and Kozu Karina. Ayaka is this unique blend of Buffy and Scully, with this streak of sardonic humor and persistent bad habits, paired with a passion for justice and a badass lipstick lightsaber. Meanwhile, Kozu plays the role of disheveled yet tireless cop perfectly, and contrasts well to the fiery temperament of the protagonist, especially in matters of comedy. Overall, Phantom Quest Corp is a real hidden gem, and one which anybody would enjoy, especially if you're particularly into 90s anime or 90s paranormal media, because this is where that particular venn diagram overlaps. according to the special extra episode 'File 00', they got the actual real-life 49th Priest of Enkozen Temple, Mudo Oda, to do some kind of voice work on the OVA as well.

Yoru no Yatterman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28155/Yoru_no_Yatterman,"['[The bulk of this review was written after the release of episode 9]If you can imagine a situation in which Schindler\'s List knocks up Kill la Kill, and the subsequent child is raised primarily by a nanny called Spongebob Squarepants, then it\'s entirely possible that you\'re imagination is just a little too active for your own good.Sorry, sorry, serious face now. I have to confess that I find it incredibly difficult to gauge exactly what kind of show Yoru no Yatterman is trying to be. On the one hand, it\'s set in a bleak dystopia where a combination of fabricated history and rule by an...iron fist has led to the creation of a society where simply existing is a crime sufficient to earn you a lifetime in a concentration camp that would make even the most rampant Nazi sympathiser blush. On the other hand, it\'s main characters are 3 costumed goofballs who go travel the country being unashamedly silly at people while being beset upon by a bunch of utterly incompetent costumed supervillains who fight using colourful animal-themed mechs. It\'s not above including talking animals, toilet humour, casual ecchi fanservice and downright bizarre battle scenes. It\'s also not above depicting the horrors of genocide and having the main characters indirectly slaughter large numbers of thinking, feeling, squishy humans.Fun fun fun!!!The totally overbearing nature of Yoru no Yatterman\'s rampant inconsistency makes me wonder if the series might actually be making some kind of point. It\'s relatively dim view of the conventional hero archetype and the apparent conflict between its gritty setting and goofy style could very easily be interpreted as a criticism of the hypocritical way that more conventional high fantasy attempts to impress upon its audience the importance of heroism while simultaneously shying away from images of ""true"" villainy. However, to assert this interpretation is to imply a degree of sophistication in a series that also incorporates (among other things) exploding poop bombs, a man with a fish fetish and a chimpanzee who can drive.It\'s not impossible, but something about the thought just doesn\'t sit right.Besides, if Yoru no Yatterman is working to dispel conventional notions of heroic and villainous archetypes, then it\'s doing a bloody weak job of it. I actually quite liked the fact that the central protagonist is established as a young female character with very limited fighting ability, but Galina\'s more straightforward heroic arc and Doronjo\'s growing affection for him as the series goes on (paired with the fact that she hasn\'t really achieved anything in 9 episodes and repeatedly has to get rescued by her male companions to a slightly suspect degree) does undermine any notion that the series is trying for a touch of irony. If it is, it ain\'t taking that self-awareness far enough.OK, quick disclaimer, given that we\'re several paragraphs in and I haven\'t really answered the crucial question of whether Yoru no Yatterman is good. It ain\'t bad. The comedy is a bit hit-and-miss, the action scenes are overblown to the point of being incoherent and the story is largely predictable despite its pretension towards defying convention. There\'s a severe lack of actual character development after the relatively strong first episode and any sense of overarching tension is undermined by the protagonists\' apparent invulnerability and the conspicuous absence of the central antagonist (who has yet to make even a single appearance, to the point that it\'s a little suspicious). [That said and having finished the series, I was write to think that the absence of the main villain was suspicious]. Aesthetic is good, but actual animated movement is shoddy.In short, Yoru no Yatterman is entertaining, but I hesitate to say that I\'d recommend it in the same way that I might enthusiastically push Magi or Kill la Kill in front of you. The above flaws (including that troublesome inconsistency issue) hold it back considerably, but it also has some impressive novelty value and I certainly prefer it\'s more creative style over a number of the more straightforward shounen anime of recent years.OK, so let\'s get back to the problem of determining exactly what Yoru no Yatterman is trying to be, for only then can we hope to determine whether it is successful. If I were a cynical man (I am, by the way), I\'d call it an attempt to capitalise on the recent success of over-the-top shounen stuff while simultaneously reviving awareness of a franchise that perhaps isn\'t as popular as it used to be. Never seen the original series, so this is difficult for me to judge. I\'m more inclined to say that it\'s a show that\'s aimed at a slightly younger demographic than the one I fit into, and that would explain why it gets away with such a dark subtext despite its relative silliness. A younger child is, after all, more likely to overlook such things in the face of goofy comedy and flashing colours.Yeah, I don\'t like kids. Clearly.My conclusion is that Yoru no Yatterman lets itself down as an unfortunate result of its very strong first episode, which paints an image of a compelling character-driven action series that the show itself just isn\'t. It\'s fun but shallow stuff to be half-watched and then forgotten within a few hours as you search for the next big distraction. It\'s got some neat ideas that, in the right hands, could inject some life into a deeper series, but in this case all they achieve is to make the exact intent of the show a little difficult to determine.

[Nevertheless, I do recommend this series purely based on its virtues as a simple and sweet time-killer].', 'Note that while writing this review I haven\'t seen the prequels or the previously associated shows to Yoru no Yatterman so I will focus solely on the mentioned title.Yoru no Yatterman is quite an eccentric anime that appeared this Winter season. So basically it\'s a reboot or rather a side story to an anime not very popular, but familiar among some of the fans it has. When I first encountered this title, the synopsis didn\'t quite match as to what I was seeking about the basics of the premise of the anime, and thus decided to give it a go knowing that it has...connections to a couple of series that I\'m totally unaware of.Yoru no Yatterman begins with a woman in her thirties, soon to give birth to a baby. She lives with her two ""associates"" Voltkatze and Elephantus. It\'s described in the anime that the three are the successors of the late ""Doronbow"" gang which consists of Doronjo the head of the group and their two associates Boyacky and Tonzra. The story mostly kicks on from there as Dorothy gives birth to a baby girl and names her Leopard. Although it\'s expected that not a whole lot of time is spent on a 12-episodes show on the growth of Leopard as a baby to an adolescent girl reaching her teenage. Soon however, Dorothy gets ill and is needed to be treated as soon as possible, thus sending the three in a quest to find medicines from ""Yatter Metroplis"" which is ruled by ""Yatterman."" They are soon denied entrance to the Yatter Metroplis by the Yatter soldiers thus making Leopard question the justice and help that Yatterman had to offer to the people who are suffering. Yatterman is displayed as a warrior supposed to help people in the books and the various stories told by Dorothy to Leopard. This makes the young Leopard go against Yatterman and seeks to punish him with a fore-head flickering. This begins the journey of an unlikely trio of misfits, as they take the personality of their long gone descendants; The Doronbow gang.Yoru no Yatterman revolves around the trio and the two couples; Galina and Alouette, who offer the trio shelter when they get beaten by the Yatter Soldiers. Leopard is our main protagonist of the show and who takes on the name of Doronjo to avenge Yatterman. Voltkatze, who becomes Tonzra and then Elephantus, who takes the name of Boyacky. Leopard is a girl past her tens, and doesn\'t have that much of a talent compared to the other two and mostly just fools around ordering them. Tonzra has the talent in making weird machines out of trash which at times helps them get away from danger. Boyacky is the strength of the gang and is the strongest character in the show. They rely upon him to beat down the Yatter Soldiers with brute force. Oh and they have a Pig they call the ""Honorable Oda"" as a pet, or rather as a friend who travels with them wherever they go. The next two couple are Galina and Alouette. Alouette is a blind woman who has the personality of a kid and is a happy-go-lucky character. Galina is the one who mostly is there to protect Alouette from any danger. Since Alouette\'s father was forcedly taken away by the Yatter Soldiers, Galina is the only one left to look after her. Galina is often pronounced as ""Gatchan"" by both Doronjo and Alouette. While not of much help in the start, once he joins the gang he gradually learns techniques from Boyacky and Tonzra and is one of the main characters in show as there\'s an episode dedicated to him where he saves the trio from being captured and kept in prison forever. Other than these five there are no other characters frequently used other than the General Goro who is out to capture the Doronbow as they continue to defy Yatterman. Hints are given in the show as he\'s the father of Alouette, who has lost all of his memories once he was rebuilt as a robot to work for Yatterman but at times he gets little fazy memories of Alouette as he speaks her name or sees her. The art is done by Tatsunoko Productions, and nothing is really that special but the characters are all well drawn and colors for the background of what seems like an isolated wasteland fits in pretty well. Even for the Yatter Metropolis most of the details are done beautifully thus I have no complaints regarding the art.Yatterman has quite a lot of perverted moments for a kids show for example the breast-feeding scene of Dorothy to Leopard and scenes of Alouette taking a shower as Tonzra and Boyacky try to sneak up on her. The weirdest one was probably the guy from the 7th episode who has a fetish for sea animals like Fish and Tortoise! At times it doesn\'t even make any sense and is mostly annoying. As for the sound aspect of the show I think the opening Shooting Star is a very joyful and a pleasant intro for the show. The ending can be said more of the same and it\'s dedicated to Galina and Alouette in terms of the visual. Other than that the soundtracks weren\'t anything out of order or special. The voice acting of everyone was done pretty well but the only annoying thing was the voices of the Yatter Soldiers who literally know only to scream ""Yatter! Yatter! Yatter!"" and nothing else. I\'d like to mention the voice of Leopard is exceptionally well done as it suits really well for her childish and a talkative personality. Some of her famous taglines from the show are ""Pure, Honest and Beautiful!"" and ""As long as there is Doronbow evil will cease to exist in the world!"". Both are exceptionally well-voiced and is a joy to the ears.As a package filled with goods and bads, it\'s the bad side that gets the better of it. There is little to no characterization in the show with Leopard remaining the same annoying kid who in a moment of time grew as a baby to a teen. Tonzra and Boyacky may have some talents but yet they keep fooling around all the time and don\'t mature a lot. Perhaps the redeeming quality when it comes to characters is Galina. While he is depicted as a shy boy at the start and doesn\'t seem to be much of a help to the gang, he does play a very important role in the show both for Doronbow and for Alouette as well. It\'s also seen that Doronjo aka Leopard showing her feelings towards Gatchan. Overall Yoru no Yatterman is a mediocre show that does promise an exciting turnout but instead fails to deliver in all aspects. Even if you\'re a fan of the older series I don\'t see how this could be any enjoyable addition to that and since won\'t recommend to anyone. connections to a couple of series that I\'m totally unaware of.Yoru no Yatterman begins with a woman in her thirties, soon to give birth to a baby.

Even if you\'re a fan of the older series I don\'t see how this could be any enjoyable addition to that and since won\'t recommend to anyone.', '(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I love my mom. She’s the woman who not only raised me from child to adult but also provided me with the guidance necessary to look at life in a good way. “Something nice always follows something bad,” “what goes around, comes around,” and “karma works in mysterious ways” are some of the phrases she normally uses. Goodness is something that is always around no matter how bad something might be. It’s a simple idea that makes living life that much more enjoyable. Knowing that doing good deeds brings about good, and even if a bump...in the road is encountered, said good is just around the corner. Yoru no Yatterman tries to focus on this motif, but is largely distracted by other venues, generating an anime that isn’t good but instead contains lots of wasted potential.STORYYatterman starts off in a rather strange way. Leopard is the daughter of a woman named Dorothy. When Dorothy gets sick, Leopard and her two guardians, Voltkatze and Elephantus, attempt to contact the Yatterman Kingdom. But their refusal to help causes her mother to sadly pass away. Vowing to follow her ancestors’ footsteps and become the vigilante group known as “Doronbow,” the three attempt to “bring a new dawn” to the kingdom that wronged her.The synopsis there is somewhat lengthier than usual, but that’s because the actual premise has an interesting origin. The show is based on an anime known as “Yatterman,” where the good guys here, “Doronbow,” are actually the bad guys. This inversion of roles immediately connects with the theme already presented, the idea that there is niceness in unexpected places. And as the anime unfurls, we are constantly given this notion. Whether it be a robotic father whose memories were wiped or a monkey who loans his master’s car to the crazy ensemble, the group is always given the chance to witness that goodness takes on forms that are, by and large, unexplainable. But this theme isn’t something that is immediately evident – it only becomes apparent near the anime’s end – and is in fact one of Yatterman’s many problems. The initial focus was on Leopard’s mother and her guardians, therefore giving the show a more familial direction. How families work together, what it means to love and be loved in a relationship, the power of “good parenting;” family was the name of the game, but it quickly devolved into something unwieldy.What the show morphed into was an amalgamation of stories that made it less and less about family and more and more about showcasing “fun.” The anime is completely dreary: people are despondent, conditions are borderline poverty, and nothing is peppy. Despite this, the show contrasts itself on a near constant basis by having comedic moments interlaced throughout its run. In other words, the show (at first) tries to be this mature and insightful anime, but quickly transitions into funny references and mistimed offerings that only serve to distract the audience from the themes it was attempting to work with. Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there, because the show has a very bad habit of ignoring the characters, scenes, or events that it presents. People such as the “Whispering Reporter” are interesting, given the context, but he’s used around two times. The “Twelve Yatter Gods” don’t do much of anything besides stand around having different hair. And worst of all is Leopard’s mother, Dorothy; by the show’s end, it seemed to have completely forgotten her and her importance to the narrative, with lazy remembrance of her given in the form of them visiting her grave for all of three seconds. This last example firmly proves how lost the anime became in the focus it normally had to begin with.Yatterman does do something clever, even with all of the holes and hills it made for itself to climb out of and over. The anime isn’t a story about Doronjo, Boyacky, and Tonzra exacting their revenge, for that wouldn’t align well with the ideas of goodness let alone their newfound sense of justice. Rather, it’s a story about the two people that tag along near the beginning: Gatchan and Alouette. As the anime progresses, and as is without a doubt confirmed by its conclusion, what we are given isn’t just a rethinking of the older work but a reimagining of what it’s done. It’s an origin tale within an origin tale, with the show depicting just how the Yatterman Kingdom rose, fell, and rose again. Sadly, such a plot point does come rather swiftly – the ending is incredibly rushed in order to make its previous scenarios relevant thematically – making it less impactful than it could have been. So while the development is interesting, it’s ultimately lacking the execution necessary to make it worthwhile.ANIMATIONPerhaps Yatterman’s strongest facet is in the art and animation that it provides.As has already been discussed, the show is mired in dread. And to heighten this effect, the anime employs the use of very melancholic colors: lots of greys, browns, and blacks. At the same time, the anime is capable of bringing about rather diverse environments even with the “same” color schemes and general barrenness of the country. A mountain village, a villa by the lake, an industrial city; Yatterman’s coloring and style lends itself well to giving the show the distinct feeling of “something isn’t right” at every turn.The designs for the characters flip-flop between realistic and unrealistic, much like the anime and its tendency to switch between dramatic and comedic. The members of “Doronbow” each have their signature attire that their known for, Gatchan and Alouette wear their hand-me-down clothes, and the Yatter soldiers and generals are always found in their mish-mash of patterns and black garb with capes. They often contrast with the environment in which they find themselves, making them, intentionally or not, stand-out no matter the situation.As for the anime’s actual animation, it’s around above average. The show is filled with more action than at first perceived; the machine fighting, the running, and the overall shenanigans have Doronjo and crew always doing something on-screen. While they do have fireside chats from time to time, even those contain a hefty amount of animation, breathing life into the world that seemingly has none. However, there is a blemish: the final episode is comprised of many continuity issues and reused scenes, so much so to the point that it leaves one questioning what went wrong rather than allowing the audience to enjoy the ending.CHARACTERSYatterman sits at a distinct crossroads when it comes to the characters that it contains.Many cast members don’t see much in the way of development, or at the minimum, meaningful development. The biggest offender of this process is Alouette. She is at first perceived to be Dorothy incarnate – besides just her looks, her unending caring and kindness paint her as a motherly figure. But it quickly becomes apparent how much more of a child she is when compared to Leopard. She’s wholly ditzy, unaware of the gravity of her situation, and overly optimistic in a place designed to quash one’s dreams. In essence, she’s the last remaining bastion of light that hasn’t been snuffed out by the darkness. She acts this way for the entirety of the anime, barring the ending. There, a figurative switch flips within her, moving her from dependent child to leader of the free world without any kind of pretext. They try to make it seem as if her experiences didn’t go unnoticed by her, that she was “turning a blind eye” to everything going on. Her actions, though, were always consistent and never made her out to be someone who was worrying about the calamity surrounding her. Even then, if that is true, then it undermines her very character and the light she represents.Leopard is someone still deciding on the path she should take. On the one hand, her characteristics make her out to be anything but a leader. She’s a child, both in mind and in body, so her being the head of anything, let alone a rogue group destined to fight a bunch of robots, is weird. But it works, because the setting she finds herself in is even weirder. And what’s interesting is that, while she is the leader, she never seems to do anything. Tonzra fights and Boyacky constructs, whereas Doronjo just yells a lot at everybody. She’s the leader, though, not because she was Dorothy’s daughter or because she wears the main outfit, but because her personality is commanding. She’s loud, stalwart in her convictions, and always pushing forward without ever giving up hope. On the other hand, she doesn’t grow as a person despite being a kid. She’s stunted in terms of development in favor of focusing on the other characters antics and the disjointed storytelling, causing her to stagnate quite early on. Unlike Alouette, she actually remains “in character,” yet doesn’t seem to gain anything from the journey she embarked on.The strongest character of the anime is easily Gatchan. He’s the only person to actually develop over the course of the show. When he is first introduced, he’s afraid of the world around him and extremely protective of Alouette. Worse still, he leaves everything up to chance, rolling die in order to make his life decisions for him. But as he says, his time with “Doronbow” gave him the chance to improve. Tonzra toughened him up physically, Boyacky did the same but mentally, and Doronjo motivated and encouraged him every step of the way. The three of them were like family, each providing their own slice of wisdom for him to ingest, to make him into the kind of person capable of not only keeping Alouette from harm but also the Yatter Kingdom, too. No longer does he gamble at life’s crossroads; rather, he forges his own path.SOUNDThe opening theme has some pretty impressive vocal work, matching the more orchestral tone of the piece itself. The track is oddly fast and slow simultaneously, coinciding nicely with the mix of comedy and drama that permeates much of the series. The halfway point seems to pick up the tempo, but it, oddly once more, recedes back to its normal beat. It’s off-putting, reducing the piece from something interesting to simply fun to hear. The ending theme is all speed; it starts off jumpy, and continues this trend until the very end. It mirrors the anime: Yatterman is pretty quick, moving from one scenario to the next, with the ending bringing about the only sense of calm. The quickness can be catchy during certain segments, but the singing can’t “keep up” with the instruments, making the piece largely forgettable.Yatterman does find strength in its soundtrack, despite the OP and ED being lackluster in what they give. “Doronbow ga Irukagiri Yatterman ha Sakaenai” is the perfect theme song, capturing “Doronbow’s” grandiose undertakings and their larger-than-life way of dealing with anything thrown their way. “Dorothy no Yume” is a memorable piece, filled with a soft piano that is both peaceful for the mind yet sad on the heart, which applies to the other tracks that sound similar. “Tabi ha Tsudukuyo Dokomademo” reflects the countryside environment nicely. And they even pay homage to Yatterman’s original opening. It’s a nice soundtrack that finds itself hidden among the other sub-par material of the anime.Voice-acting, like the soundtrack, tends to be above average. A special shout-out is deserved for Eri Kitamura as Leopard, for portraying quite well the young child’s spunky, happy, and girly voice and attitude.ENJOYMENTI think part of the allure of this one is being able to connect, or at least understand, a lot of the references that it throws at you. Having never seen the original or anything else related to this long-running series, I probably missed more jokes than I would like to admit. Regardless, the first episode is what hooked me. The presentation, the themes, the emotions; it was very well done, and seeing it steadily dwindle the further it went on was an unfortunate circumstance. Besides the first few episodes – where they provided some focus on Leopard as a baby or young kid alongside Dorothy and the idea of family – I was never impressed by what it was doing, be it the jokes or the action. It got repetitive early on, and watching it remove itself from such a powerful beginning and set-up into something lesser wasn’t fun to see.Yoru no Yatterman could have been something good. While the nice art, animation, and original soundtrack do what they can to alleviate some of its problems, the narrative, characters, and other minor issues keep this one from being fully cured. It isn’t going to see a new dawn, but instead a slowly falling sunset.SUMMARYStory: Bad, wishy-washy themes, plot point ignoring, sometimes clever, but often falls flatAnimation: Good, nice art style, interesting character designs, and above average actual animation with the exception of the final episodeCharacters: Bad, Gatchan develops, Leopard is interesting, but the rest are either bad or incredibly weakSound: Fine, okay OP, bad ED, nice soundtrack, above average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, besides the first few episodes, it was repetitive and not endearingFinal Score: 4/10 in the road is encountered, said good is just around the corner. Yoru no Yatterman tries to focus on this motif, but is largely distracted by other venues, generating an anime that isn’t good but instead contains lots of wasted potential.STORYYatterman starts off in a rather strange way. Leopard is the daughter of a woman named Dorothy. When Dorothy gets sick, Leopard and her two guardians, Voltkatze and Elephantus, attempt to contact the Yatterman Kingdom. But their refusal to help causes her mother to sadly pass away. Vowing to follow her ancestors’ footsteps and become the vigilante group known as “Doronbow,” the three attempt to “bring a new dawn” to the kingdom that wronged her.The synopsis there is somewhat lengthier than usual, but that’s because the actual premise has an interesting origin. The show is based on an anime known as “Yatterman,” where the good guys here, “Doronbow,” are actually the bad guys. This inversion of roles immediately connects with the theme already presented, the idea that there is niceness in unexpected places. And as the anime unfurls, we are constantly given this notion. Whether it be a robotic father whose memories were wiped or a monkey who loans his master’s car to the crazy ensemble, the group is always given the chance to witness that goodness takes on forms that are, by and large, unexplainable. But this theme isn’t something that is immediately evident – it only becomes apparent near the anime’s end – and is in fact one of Yatterman’s many problems. The initial focus was on Leopard’s mother and her guardians, therefore giving the show a more familial direction. How families work together, what it means to love and be loved in a relationship, the power of “good parenting;” family was the name of the game, but it quickly devolved into something unwieldy.What the show morphed into was an amalgamation of stories that made it less and less about family and more and more about showcasing “fun.” The anime is completely dreary: people are despondent, conditions are borderline poverty, and nothing is peppy. Despite this, the show contrasts itself on a near constant basis by having comedic moments interlaced throughout its run. In other words, the show (at first) tries to be this mature and insightful anime, but quickly transitions into funny references and mistimed offerings that only serve to distract the audience from the themes it was attempting to work with. Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there, because the show has a very bad habit of ignoring the characters, scenes, or events that it presents. People such as the “Whispering Reporter” are interesting, given the context, but he’s used around two times. The “Twelve Yatter Gods” don’t do much of anything besides stand around having different hair. And worst of all is Leopard’s mother, Dorothy; by the show’s end, it seemed to have completely forgotten her and her importance to the narrative, with lazy remembrance of her given in the form of them visiting her grave for all of three seconds.

Slight fixes + Story from 8-7 (just thought 7 was more appropriate) + Revised comment on the first episode tone compared to the rest of the series (2nd paragraph).* Edit Sunday 28th July. Just reviewed my review and lowered some scores. This was mostly brought about by comparing this anime to others on my list and thinking, 'hmm is this really as good as that?'. Though, the personal enjoyment I got from this series is not equal to the sum of its parts. This anime was weird.I've seen so many people showing this series negativity, regarding tone shifts,...ass pulls and so on. Those points may be valid, but here's my defense of why I think this anime has been very underrated.Story : 7The story is simply about a team of people trying to rectify a dystopian future. Every episode shows our team engaging somehow with their Yatterman foes, meeting new people here or there and continuing their journey. The first episode is pretty sad and I think many people would have preferred the whole of the series to stay in that sort of depressing tone, rather than mixing in comedic events, that they believed only detracted form the story. Just a warning that the first episode may, and emphasis on the may, betray expectations for the rest of the series. I suggest to keep to the 3 episode rule of whether or not you stick to the series if you're worried about that.Now here is where the first of many complaints people had kick in. The ending of every episode is very predictable, always involving robots that come out of nowhere to fight the enemy. But you know what? I didn't care one bit. There's something about the setting of this anime and the overall way the message and journey went, that made me not care about the predictability. What mattered was how the characters interacted with each other and how they grew each episode to eventually try and reach their goal.If this bothers you, then you shouldn't watch the series. Remember that this is a reboot of an old kids show. They need the robots otherwise the essence of the show would be forgottenPeople would also point out the tone shift problems. It seems so sad one moment, but then a robot comes out of nowhere. Honestly, I had no problems with that. There was an ironic sweetness to all the crazy moments, as the world they live in is really messed up. The characters take the good with the bad and always try to pursue their end goal. I found that the underlying depression was always there, even during the happy moments, which made the most of the series seem hilariously tragic.There are some filler (sort of) episodes (I'm thinking of you sumo) that I believe could have been replaced with something better. Maybe some more character development where we could get more into the group dynamics.The ending had me very conflicted, (disregarding animation derps, and my own personal confusion regarding a character that I thought shouldn't have been there). The overall message was clear and sweet. There was a good sense of bitter-sweet closure, with a symbolic sense of liberation through the whole thing, but I couldn't help but feel as if the some our main heroes weren't given enough of a spotlight regarding the final villain (which was kind of a good twist of you ask me). I had to think real hard about how the characters had finished up.Art : 7 / 6The art pretty nice and crisp. It suited the world. Nothing amazing, but nothing bad for the whole series..... except the last episode. Overall, the series gets a 7 or 6 for art, but if we were to look a that episode on its own it would get a 2. I think this was due to a lack of budget, but there were flipping reused frames in that episode that made you go WTH is going on. It's not that the art and people's faces looked deformed, or anything. Just that the animation in one particular bit was drastically botched.Sound : 7OP and ending pretty cool. The sound was alright. Some sad tracks during some sad moments that tug at the heart strings. Nothing that particularly stands out, but nothing that I thought was horrible that has to be mentioned either. But I know jackshit about this stuff, so whatever.Character : 6I think the 5 main heroes that we follow were pretty cool. There was something endearing about this group that I could't shake off.Elephantus and Voltkatze ( though these names are hardly used) :The joking father figures. They aren't really the subject of major character development. but the way they're always there for their almost adoptive daughter, I found was really sweet. Thought the flaw here would be that they could and maybe should have been developed more, rather than just being goofy a lot of the time.Leopard: She starts off a little girl with a mission. And she tries really hard to get it. What else can I say, but I think she was well rounded and a good developed hero. Some may say she's annoying, but in my opinion it's important to remember that she's a still a and super young and naive girl trying to fight the world.Alouette: She seems kind of mindless/traumatised for the whole series. The last episode however provides her with a symbolic twist. She's someone that has tried to reject reality for the whole series, but then finally comes to term with it in the finale.Galina: Oddly enough, though not the main, he seems to get the most development. He's a coward at the start, but slowly but surely becomes stronger and stronger as the story goes on.There are many minor encounters but they are just ways to enhance interactions between our main heroes. There's one main villain that pursues our heroes for a long time. But there's something important about him, and the show handles him beautifully, in my opinion.So in the end:Personal Enjoyment : 8Overall though : 7.I enjoyed this anime way more than I expected. Just remember guys and gals, that this is a reboot of a 1970s kids show. It took that and added a dark twist to it. There are very emotional bits that really tug at your heartstrings, and from my perspective, made me realise how much this isn't just an anime that goes 'hurr durr robots'. It's not just kiddy craziness, but a real sense of people growing up to save others. I think I will honestly remember this as a fun and endearing adventure. But it's definitely not for everybody, especially given that this anime was most likely, in my opinion, targeted at old viewers of the show. And I'm certain the many of you reading this review probably will not be said old viewers. ass pulls and so on.

If i failed at something like repeating something well ... sorry. ._.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yoru No Yatterman was a fun ride. Sadly, it went under the radar of a lot of people. It wasn't the best of this winter season but it wasn't bad like a lot of people says. Is it worth your time ? Let's look at it.Story : 6Leopard, Elephantus and Voltkatze are descendant of the Doronbow gang, who were the antagonist of the Yatterman series. They live with Lepoard's mother somewhere outside the Yatterman Kingdom walls because their ancestor got kicked out of the kingdom....So one day, Leopard's mother die and discovers that the Yatterman are actually bad people... and thus begin the comeback or the Dorombow gang to avenge her death and give the Yatterman a good forehead flicking !See? pretty simple !Art : 7The art was very good imo. It wasn't mindblowing but it didn't suck at all. The background and the characters were really nice. However sometimes the quality dropped and sometimes... it wasn't pretty.Sound : 7The opening was one of the best this season and the ending was nice. The OST was compsed by the same guy who did the OST of Mirai Nikki, Free!, Seikon no Qwaser and more. Just this is actually pretty good. However nothing didn't catch my attention. I guess it's better than catching my attention because the music would be bad.So yeah, i guess the OST did it's job right !Character : 6For some people the problem might be the main protagonist, Leopard who's a 9 years old girl that might just be ... pretty annoying. Personally i had no problem with her but i can see why some people have. Boyacky and Tonzra are funny. The problem with them is sometimes their jokes gets old, like Tonzra who says that he can be Leopard's mom for an entire episode.Later we have Gatchan and Alouette. Gatchan at first i didn't liked him. Always scared and uncertain, throwing a dice to know what to do. Luckily he had a really good character developement ! Alouette well ... i liked her. (no not because she has boobs ... jeez.) She was funny and also at the end i liked her even more! I'm not gonna say more about it. c:For the others, you might just don't care about them.Enjoyment : 7If you are the kind of people who needs explication for why this happened or why they didn't do this ... just don't watch it. You're gonna be mad and just put a 1 to this. This show is just full of surprise and ''asspull'' but for this kind of show, i didn't care at all ! The comedy is hit or miss though. Like i said before, sometimes the jokes gets old or it's just ... doesn't work at all.Do we need to watch the Yatterman series before watching it ? Not really. I haven't watched them and it's pretty simple to understand without them. However, some reference or jokes just gonna fly over your head and you might just think ... ''k'' (like me)Overall : 7It was a good adventure that will be forgotten pretty soon.Try it, maybe you'll like it like me !

But even if that’s the intention, that doesn’t negate everything else a new iteration of an old children’s cartoon that no one outside of Japan really cares all that much about can bring. You can get new generations interested in the old property, you can update the material so that it’s not only enjoyed by nostalgia-blinded morons who...still think any cartoon from the 80s holds up, or you can just be your own thing whilst giving some reason regarding why you’re using the franchise name to begin with. I generally support the last one because if I really wanted to watch the original, I’d just watch the original – provided it isn’t over 100 episodes long most old anime that made it big were back then, in which case I’d just need a movie summary that isn’t Escaflowne’s.Now in all honesty, I’ve never seen the original show, the 2008 remake, or any of the Time Bokan OVAs. I saw Miike’s live-action adaptation which pretty much tells me nothing other than the villains are Team Rocket and the heroes are the Ice Climbers. So I was really hoping for the new Yatterman to belong to be its own thing, less it turned out like Sailor Moon Crystal – although to be fair, any anime with their production values would turn out as poorly received as Sailor Moon Crystal. Thankfully, that turned out to be the case. There’s just one little problem though, and that’s the fact that the new Yatterman is total shit. And if you’ve been reading my blog posts, forum posts, and Twitter posts for the entirety of its runtime, you’d know this post to end all posts in regards to the specific subject was coming with a vengeance far greater than a vindictive Korean Go player.Yes unfortunately, Yatterman Night belongs to that bad side of the modern remake populated by those live-action Scooby-Doo films and movie-length Dr. Seuss adaptations in that in trying to aim towards those who have nostalgia for the original product whilst doing something new, they completely misfire by both missing the point of the original source and not even doing a good job with its new direction. And whilst I’m fully aware the original source actually had crude humor, unlike that atrocity we human beings call The Grinch, it’s really badly mishandled here due to the very premise of the show. Did you ever watch Now and Then, Here and There and think to yourself that it would have been better if it had been directed by Seiji Kishi? Hell, I’m surprised this thing wasn’t his baby, because it has pretty much all of his quirks from the terrible tonal shifts to the lame animation to the amount of “suspension of disbelief” I have to buy in general. If these characters are so poor, how can they build mecha and summon ’em out of nowhere? Where do they get the parts for ’em? You can’t seriously expect me to believe that they’re just lying around randomly like rocket launcher ammo in a Turkish knock-off?Granted, I think Turkish Yatterman would be a much better watch than Yatterman Night. At least the former wouldn’t wallow in mediocrity with its lameness and more importantly, it’d be interesting to talk about. Because as much as I dislike this show, there’s not really a lot I can say apart from the fact that nothing works. Similar to Rolling Girls and Nobunaga the Fool, it feels like the creative team decided to put all these ideas into the show with absolutely no idea how to execute them, leading to an altogether empty experience. The plot and characters are so simplistic and treated everything with so little urgency and momentum it’s not even worth elaborating on them besides their basic traits, and I can’t even summon up enough energy to do that. Several episodes are just one-off comedic (being generous here, because they didn’t make me laugh once) interludes that add about as much flavor and substance to the product as Pitbull does in every single song I’ve heard of his. And considering this is Tatsunoko, be prepared for some tolerable animation that later on becomes as pleasing to watch as gorillas humping each other despite the fact that one of them is suffering from erectile dysfunction – particularly in the final episode which the creators flat-out admitted wasn’t finished shortly after airing and that it’d be fixed on the blu-ray. Because aren’t they all these days?Being empty in terms of animation, plot, characters, and pretty much all the basics of entertainment is enough to doom anything in general, but despite that all being true for Yatterman Night’s case, that’s not my main issue with the show. I don’t care about how it threw away its role-reversal promise because I never believed it would follow through with it in the first place. No, the biggest problem I have with the show is something that’s been bothering me since the second episode and which I asked around the time the show was airing and folks could still say they liked it with a straight face: who is this show for? It delves into subject matter too adult for kids (dystopian societies and crucifixion for example) and it doesn’t treat the audience seriously enough to be for adults. So why does it exist? Was it simply made for the fans?If that’s the case, I have two new questions. 1) Why did you air this anime on broadcast TV where a wider audience can easily watch it? 2) What was the point of this new direction in the first place? Why didn’t you just remake the show the same way you did in 2008? I mean I guess they technically did given the amount of childish gags and such littered throughout the show, but why a dystopian society that feels like it came from somebody’s bad fanfiction? And what is your fascination with nine-year old girl butt? Did you forget that the only reason that kind of humor was tolerable with the original Doronjo was because she was an adult? Every time one of my questions gets answered, two or more show up to take its place, and that’s not a good thing in this show’s case because I can’t even get interested enough to want to discover said answers for myself.In fact, at the end of the day, I just can’t summon any energy for this show at all to the point that I probably shouldn’t have watched it in the first place. I mean yes, there’s a lot wrong with Yatterman Night for the reasons I described earlier; but when you get down to it, it’s mainly bad in a way that’s just substance-less and “nothing”, which is worse than being bad in an evil way in my eyes because I can at least work with that. It has no audience at all, there’s no creative spark in regards to anything, and thus it’s not worth giving this thing the same treatment I gave Rolling Girls – a show that at least had passion put into being banal. Let’s just finish this review by saying this show is worthless and move on. A lot of you already have by this point anyways – or at least I hope you have – so I might as well have spent the entire review copy-pasting my numerous shit-tweets on here if this was the best I could muster for the show. still think any cartoon from the 80s holds up, or you can just be your own thing whilst giving some reason regarding why you’re using the franchise name to begin with.

A lot of you already have by this point anyways – or at least I hope you have – so I might as well have spent the entire review copy-pasting my numerous shit-tweets on here if this was the best I could muster for the show.', 'To be honest, this show looks like something made from out a some video game. Although not part of any game universe, the series is inspired by a franchise in the 1970s under a similar banner.  As a way to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Time Bokan series, Yatterman Night (Yatterman of the Night) is this oddball show produced by Tatsunoko Production with a whole lot to give. If science fiction and adventure is part of your vocabulary, then Yatterman should be nothing less than of a treat.Coming into this show fresh, I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t watch the original...franchise although learning more about it is definitely a help to understand this series better. However, this series can be watched as a standalone with no prior experience to the franchise. The premise is actually fairly simple. We have a fantasy world setting where the main characters plays the role of a group known as the “Doronbow Gang”. Lead by a 9-year old girl (yes, she really is nine), the group seeks to overthrow Yatterman because they rule the lands with an iron fist and corruption. This 9 year old girl named Leopard takes on the legendary alias, Doronjo after an incident that resulted in her mother’s death. And as such, she becomes leader of a rebellion with a goal in mind to destroy the current generation of Yattermen.As a series about superheroes, one has to remember that not everything is fair. This is especially true in this show where our main characters are isolated and can only depend on each other. The main core of the group consists of Doronjo, Voltkatze, and Elephantus. The latter two takes on the alias Boyacky and Tonzra. The group has the ingredients to make a difference because Doronjo leads it with a passion. Furthermore, we have her partners that makes up the brain and brawn of the trio. Later on, we have other members joining the cause for a variety of reasons. But taking a step back further, we have to see the type of girl Doronjo is in the present world. We know that she has suffered a tragedy when her mother is taken from her. This is shown through the early flashbacks as she seemed to have a very close relationship with her. Furthermore, the show builds on her passion to lead a rebellion by showing her taking on the role of a crusader. The chemistry she has with her partners are also evident as they seem to be quite respectable and loyal to her; evidenced by them risking their lives. And in return, Doronjo seems to show sincere concern for their well-being. That being said, the show makes great characterization of all three main characters. Later on, we even see some background stories from new members such as Galina and Alouette. In retrospect, the character focus in this show shines not with the way their roles are played but by their motivations. It gives them a purpose to fight for a cause they believe is worth for.On the other hand, we have the Yattermen Army. The show portrays them as comedic villains although their intentions are malicious and corrupt. It’s evident that they seek to create a state of totalitarian dictatorship over its people. This is evidenced by their actions to punish people who committed “wrong deeds” with indiscriminate ways of terror. Their technology also trumps over the majority of the characters in the show it their high tech robots and weaponry. However, the series makes its goal well known for the Doronbow’s Gang to end their reign of terror. Every episode involves their clash in some way or another. And despite the Yattermen being seemingly unstoppable at first, we see how Doronojo and her friends overcome the odds. I’m all for heroic battles and clashes but this show takes it to unorthodox style. Rather than having the big guys shouting out generic attack names or classy heroic lines, we instead get a stylistic way of battle confrontations. Every episode details this in some different way whether it’d involve gadgets, fancy vehicles, or even boxing matches.  To say the least, this show has style and decorates it in a classic way. Unfortunately, this could also be less of an appeal for those who are unfamiliar with the franchise. The story is written in a way that the battles are part of its culture with references and gags. Those who have a better understanding of the original series will probably get a better experience from this show. That being said, the comedy aspect of the series still delivers stellar performance whether it’s the characters, themes, or in general the overlay of the story.Artwork seems simple and classic. As a series based on some classic heroes, we have the character dressed in their fancy gear. Doronjo for instance wears a mask and flamboyant costume complete with a cape. Her partners also has some fancy gear on that makes them look like superheroes. On the other hand, the Yattermen has a strange design. They are decorated with a Sentai-like style ornament complete with their signature poses. Their boss General Goro has a stereotypical look of a villain armed with an electrical cane and generic robots at disposal. Speaking of which, most of the robots in this show seemingly looks “complex” on the surface but operates with simple maneuver. There’s no mechanic really explained with insight but the machines operate on more of a classic style. Finally, the world fiction setting of the series has a very classic adventure tone. The lush landscape, opulent natural surroundings, and the lifeforms all give off a welcoming fantasy feel.When it comes to soundtrack, the most noticeable part is our character voice mannerisms. Or more specifically, Doronjo steals the spotlight almost every episode with her contagious laugh. Similarly, the fiery chants of YATTERMEN will echo throughout the show so be prepared for that nationalistic like atmosphere whenever they make a presence. But to say the least, the characters stay enthusiastic with their roles and gives life to the series. Otherwise, soundtrack for OST is mostly moderate except during some of the more emotional scenes where it highlights moments of solemn. The OP and ED songs for the series aren’t very noticeable except by their classic style.Yattermen is a show that isn’t easy to accept. It’ll take time to be familiarized with the way it’s handled especially with our main characters. But once you get into it, the show can be quite a fun ride. The story itself is cleverly written although it still relies on generic gimmicks. Furthermore, it’s hard to take the story seriously when we have the Yattermen behave like the way they do. For this reason, I’d say that the comedy could probably fit better when it comes to embracing this show’s ideas. It’s more of a sci-fi adventure with a load of references, gags, and even parody along the way. What it is trying to be isn’t always what you may think.

I also might be thinking way to much about the message of this show.Should You watch this show:-Short version: Yes;-Long version: Come back after you watched the show.So I do not make a habit of writing reviews, as it means a lot of work, but I have seen all the negative and mixed responses for this show and I want to defend it as I found it quite good (second favorite show of Winter 2015, after Your lie in April).So what is Yoru no Yatterman?It is a spiritual successor and a tribute...to the 1970 KIDS TV show Yatterman, which in a nutshell is a sort of Japans version of the Power Ranger. You got your two main HEROES, with several sidekicks, your evil mastermind and his henchmen. I did not watch the show, nor do I intend to, but it is simple enough that you can understand it just with a little research, Good guys VS Bad guys and the good guys always win. So why did I waste you time talking about a 40 year old show?...you will see.*Spoilers ahead*So Yoru no Yatterman is set in the future where society has walled itself from the outside world while being defended by the Yatterman,the police, the heroes aka the good guys. But our story starts outside the wall where are characters live a peaceful life, exiled from society.Leopard lives with her mother and 2 other friends ,Voltkatze and Elephantus, (please ignore the retarded names). Leopard is taught form a very young age that in order to go back to the Yatter Kingdom she must be a GOOD girl and then maybe she will be allowed back. She learns that the Yatterman are HEROES and that the infamous Doronbo Gang are the BAD guys.Several years later Leopard mom gets ill and in an attempt to save her mom Leopard sets sail with her 2 friends to seek help from the Yatterman, but they ignore her and they let her mother die.It is here where most viewers get fooled and create expectations for the show. The Yatterman did nothing BAD, they respected their Kingdoms rules and Leopard does not become a HERO she swears Vengeance.So the show continues with the party going to the Yatter Kingdom to ""give them a big doink"" aka to exact vengeance.The show has a very episodic nature where the party meet several characters, see the dark side of this society, fight the Yatterman and LOSE...every time they fight the Heroes they loose.The episode that made me realize how great and dark this show is was episode 4.The characters are fantastic as well.In the first episode Leopard discovers that they are the descendants of the Doronbo Gang thus imaging the original show very well:-Leopard is the leader, but she is just a child... that\'s it, she has nothing except her Vengeance;-Elephantus is the brute with superhuman strength;-Voltkatze is the genius that can create robots out of anything...why is this not okay, but having superhuman strength is? Voltkatze  is probably the most hated character in this show because the viewers are annoyed about how UNREALISTIC it is to build robots our of nothing...really?What you have here is basic, by the book, Evil gang, Team Rocket comparison if you will.There are two other MAJOR characters that I will no touch upon, the leader of the Yatterman that chase leopard the entire show and the Yatterman themselves which are a symbol of ORDER and PEACE in this Kingdom.Episode 11 is where we understand everything and made this show my second favorite as it explains very easily EVERYTHING.Now I will not touch on art and sound as they are a personal taste. The sub was good/great, music did it\'s job but also did not stand out and for the animation.....well that were everyones personal taste comes in. The art and character designs try to image the TV show as best as it can without feeling old. Proof is in episode 2 where are party is naked by the fire and you go ""WTF"". Also the MC is a small child so I\'m guessing a lot of viewers felt guilty for getting a aroused (There\'s a pedophfile in all of us).So why do I think this show is worth a it\'s 8:It\'s start off from a single point and then just expands in this massive world after which it\'s all ties itself perfectly at he end.Why do people hate it?Because they were not expecting this show to develop as it has. They were expecting to see the Heroes the Doronbo Gang to defeat the Evil Yatterman and save the Kingdom.But that does not happen.Form START to FINISH this show respect the original almost to a fucking T. People who watched this show and hated it mostly never watched the original, BUT the producers almost certainly have.The Yatterman are the Heroes that protect the Kingdom form the Vile Doronbo Gang. The Yatterman fight and always vanquish the Evil Doronbo gang, but are never able to capture them.But where this show shines is in the grey line it paints. Yes the Yatterman are Heroes protecting the government, but the government are corrupt. Yes the Doronbo Gang are Evil because they oppose the government, but because of Leopards pure heart they came across as good people, fighting for a good cause in the eyes of the common folk.It is a show that discusses the ambiguous nature of GOOD and EVIL.If you are a fan of the old series you will probably love this as I am certain there were many things that are reference to the original (even I noticed and I didn\'t watch the original).But are people wrong thinking that this is but a bellow average show? YES and NO.The show didn\'t have enough time to explain it\'s message well and because they wanted to respect the source material as much as they could, a lot of people just dismissed it as childish and stupid. BUT the ORIGINAL show was childish and stupid.This show has a beginning, a middle and an end (Which is more than I can say for most shows). the characters are great, the journey is fun and the ENDING is perfect. to the 1970 KIDS TV show Yatterman, which in a nutshell is a sort of Japans version of the Power Ranger. You got your two main HEROES, with several sidekicks, your evil mastermind and his henchmen. I did not watch the show, nor do I intend to, but it is simple enough that you can understand it just with a little research, Good guys VS Bad guys and the good guys always win. So why did I waste you time talking about a 40 year old show?...you will see.*Spoilers ahead*So Yoru no Yatterman is set in the future where society has walled itself from the outside world while being defended by the Yatterman,the police, the heroes aka the good guys. But our story starts outside the wall where are characters live a peaceful life, exiled from society.Leopard lives with her mother and 2 other friends ,Voltkatze and Elephantus, (please ignore the retarded names).

For those of you who don’t know about this series, it’s basically yet another retooling of those old Japanese kids show franchises no one cares about in a similar vein as something like Casshern Sins or Gatchaman Crowds. Yatterman Night is a far-flung sequel to the Yatterman franchise (meant to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the original series) in which the roles of the original heroes and villains have been reversed in a huge way. The legacy of the original heroes,...the crime-fighting duo Yatterman  lives on in the form of a large kingdom known as the Yatter Kingdom. The series stars a young loli named Leopard who, when believing in the Yatter Kingdom as a beacon of hope and kindness, is disillusioned when she is harshly refused entry into the country to obtain medicine for her ailing mother by the very heroes she looked up to. Having been red-pilled on the true nature of Yatterman, Leopard and her two reliable family friends Boyacky and Tonzra set off on a journey to take down the false heroes and the Yatter Kingdom whilst donning the masks of the villainous gang of thieves (the enemies of the original Yatterman) known as”Dorombow”.Whilst I\'ll admit to not being wholly enthused by the 1st episode as much of the people saw it were, but Yatterman Night seemed like it would be on to something, that it would be more than the boring kids show it was based on. It turns out however that the show didn\'t have the grand ambition I was hoping for. Given the set-up practically screams, ""original take"" Yatterman Night opted for anything other than being original. Unfortunately, the 1st episode is the only one that gives off the promise of potential theme exploration. The idea of symbols slowly warped to betray original intentions, or how happiness can be sought from the most unexpected of places are cool ideas to build a show around. Where Yatterman Night fucked up royally 1st and foremost was with its handling of tone. We have this extremely morose, impoverished setting, with people being overworked for the sake of a monolithic governing body from overseas. Basically, no one in Yatterman Night has any reason to feel the slightest bit chipper at all. However based on how the script carries itself, its hard to see how I\'m supposed to take this all in I\'m not really sure of since most of the episodes are interlaced with tons of lame, childish and badly timed humor. The script seems like the unfortunate result of throwing the entire tonal spectrum from Texhnolyze all the way down to The Teletubbies into a blender. Aren\'t the fans of the original too old for the childish gags? Aren\'t the kids too young to appreciate anything that sets it apart from other titles aimed at younger demographic? What Yatterman Night does not seem to get is that the most enduring kid shows should be able to appeal to adults and children at all times. This is the reason why the Animaniacs and the earlier seasons of Spongebob are things I can appreciate as an adult or as a kid. Same goes for less comedic examples like season 3 of Digimon and Princess Tutu (both, of course, being popular examples shows that manage to be ""mature"" without being inaccessible to younger audiences).The real cost of the show’s ridiculous approach to having wide-spread appeal goes beyond the fact that the humor sucks.  It also becomes impossible to take the serious bits, well, seriously. What I mean by this is how no one would bat an eye at how the Dorombow gang conveniently pulls robots out of nowhere when being pursued by Yatterman’s goons if the series had made it clear from the get-go that show was leaning solely towards being a goofy action comedy. But, as we’ve gone over already, it’s not. Yatterman Night wants to be more than just “fun” without making any of the requisite sacrifices. The scriptwriters sort of wanted to have their cake and eat it so to speak. I was never convinced that Leopard’s childish idealism was actually putting her and her friends at risk for nothing since all the conflicts play out as cartoonishly as possible (to the point where explosions have about as much effect on them on them as they do on Team Rocket). Don’t expect anything from the character development department. The closest the series came to having poignant character development is one episode within the 1st half in which the Tonzra and Boyacky begin to question whether or not to keep up with this silly attempt at a rebellion. This welcome dosage of realistic thinking is nowhere to be found in future episodes however since the series continues to let the childish idealism it called into question briefly go unchecked for the rest of the series. There was one attempted character arc between an amnesiac father turned villain and his mentally handicapped daughter, but the way it was executed was laughable with hardly a few tacked on minutes devoted to it.Coming off the boring comedy-centered episodes in the middle of the series, the last arc did nothing to restore enthusiasm for the show so much as it went ahead and backpedalled on its promise even further.  The final conflict itself, on top of being rushed, the lame cartoony tropes finish off eating away at the harsh realism. The mystery behind why the Yatter Kingdom ended up the way it did turned out to be disappointingly simple (not that that was enough to keep the show from explaining it for half an episode). All the goofing around the series did earlier would have made it impossible for the overall net-sum to qualify as good in any case, but the only thing worth remembering from the final stretch was the hilariously unfinished animation for episode 12.Such a shame to see a potential dark horse break both its legs the moment it leaves the gate. I wouldn’t recommend watching the poor thing drag its way to the finish line. the crime-fighting duo Yatterman  lives on in the form of a large kingdom known as the Yatter Kingdom.

I wouldn’t recommend watching the poor thing drag its way to the finish line.', 'I made a video: you can find it at my YouTube channel ""BasementOtaku""Video Script:Yatterman Night (7/10): To learn more about my rating system check the description down below. Not it is time to dive into this spoiler smattered review.I am a big fan of original shows, not being tied to a source material means the show can have a conclusive ending and balance the pacing of episodes easier without tip toeing around a core story. Yatterman Night has some truly stand out episodes, episode four had me aghast that the show was willing to get that dark and the final episode, while it had...its problems, was exhilarating to watch. I had two major issues with the show, first the mother character: she is set up to be a very sweet and caring character but we get very little time with her and she never really displays any flaws or characteristics that make her feel like someone I can relate to or care about. So when the show kills her off I never felt the attempted tug at my heart strings, and when the show keeps bringing her up in flashbacks they are all continued examples of her unwavering perfection so I was never able to relate to that pain. Second was how little the world of Yatterman Night was fleshed out, it would have been easy to include propaganda or design the towns in such a way that they felt more Yatterman themed but for the most part all of the wooden hut villages and bland enemy bases never felt like they had much character. Which is sad because the theme of Yatterman attempting to brainwash the public is really only explored well in episode four and the later three episodes.The show never tried to adhere to reality, which lowers the stakes for the main characters, the show is at its most powerful when working with citizens of the Yatterman kingdom because they feel more grounded in that reality. Which is what makes episode five and eight feel like missed opportunities. Five because the character they related to was also unbelievable and episode eight because it brought in the lochness monster for no apparent reason. As much as I am griping about the show it never fails to have a sense of fun with some really expressive animation. While the final episode does reuse three or four clips the rest of it is animated with such style and energy it is easily forgivable. Also the opening is a blast to watch and does a great job of encompassing the darker undertones with the more bombastic nature of the show. I had a good time with it, and if you are in it for the fun I’m sure you can too. its problems, was exhilarating to watch.

The premise is interesting, the execution spot-on, some themes and ideas are tossed around. . .Then the halfway point happens and it's all downhill from there. We fall into some Saturday-morning-cartoon tropes, cut some corners, repeat some frames in the finale obviously enough to make one cringe, and all in all the show ends up being a bit of a letdown, really. Too many dumb jokes in quick succession, and it's all the more disappointing because the first half was so great. Even the ending seems to be an afterthought and felt to me like something of...an easy way out after everything the show had talked about up to that point.If I was rating the first half of Yatterman, I'd give it an 8. But I'm rating the whole thing, and the whole thing disappoints. There are some good points in the second half, but they're meshed with some really tired and cliche points. During some of the last episodes I felt like I was watching two shows at once.So where am I going with this? Yeah, watch it if you want, I guess. The first half is pretty great. Just warning you the rest is something of a let-down. an easy way out after everything the show had talked about up to that point.If I was rating the first half of Yatterman, I'd give it an 8.

The plot is about innocent girl wanting to find the reason behind her family's exile in this desolate land. Leopard learns of her ancestor's legacy and the Yatterman ultimately triumphing over the villains.This however can't be further from the truth. Leopard accepting the label of villain by this legacy, fights back against the Yatterman to learn why the good guys didn't help her mother. And thus begins the...episodic adventure towards the center of this mad world.Each episode expands upon obviously dystopian society and their forced happiness and loyalty. However that is all they really explore and doesn't expand upon other ideologies of themes deeply.The opening theme with gorgeous character design as well as fluid animation was really well represented earlier on. Colour was solid grim at times but also bright and vibrant at other scenes matching the mood of hope and despair.One gripe I had was animation rehash problems and low frame count towards the end.As a disclaimer I am bias as bush when it comes to superhero contents.Should you recommend Yoru no Yatterman?: Title has no in it, but if they like Yatterman; this is a legitimate reboot episodic adventure towards the center of this mad world.Each episode expands upon obviously dystopian society and their forced happiness and loyalty.

"", ""Have you ever wondered what it'd look like if villains turned into heroes and heroes turned into villains? Well this anime dives into that idea.You may not be familiar with Yatterman because it's mainly a kids' show. But this anime created a concept which was so crazy it just might work. And it did. When our story revolves around the villain, our perspective also changes. We think the MC always wins just 'cause the plot demands it. But in this series, our villains don't always win. Most of their efforts are rewarded with failure. And that just shows that every person is flawed, be it...hero or villain.Another thing that I liked about this show is that it portrayed the unity of heroes and villains to defeat a similar enemy. Doronbow and soon-to-be-heroes travel all over the kingdom just to give the cruel ruler a forehead flick. Seeing both parties working together for the same goal made me think highly of this anime... until the last episode ruined it all... I'll avoid spoiling it, so all I can say is that it's full of Deus ex Machina. Well, it was based on a kids' show, so maybe I expected too much...The characters are memorable in their own ways. Each of them stood out and there's not just one main character. This title is passed down from one person to another, which made us focus on each of the character rather than just one.The animation was fluid, but I wouldn't say that it complimented the whole show.All in all, it's a good sequel, but the ending was quite rushed. I recommend this to those fond of twists in plot and adventure montages like those you see in Pokemon. When night falls, unlikely heroes will step up and fight 'till dawn! That is Yatterman Night! hero or villain.Another thing that I liked about this show is that it portrayed the unity of heroes and villains to defeat a similar enemy.

Because they will not pause to explain actions of phrases they take from the versions of 1977 or 2008.If you like Tatsunoko and Specially Yatterman, this is your kind of anime. There are references to Hutch the Honeybee, Speed Racer, and more in each episode.I really liked what...they did with the franchise here, was a fresh new take on an old classic. they did with the franchise here, was a fresh new take on an old classic."", ""Pointless spinoff where 'actually the bad guys were good the whole time just misunderstood!' like a bad YA novelImage a Dragonball spinoff but Goku was Evil and Pilafs was good and Mai's gran-daughter had to kill Goku or somethingThe series was mostly filler and most of the budget was spent on the final episode.They forgot about the dead mom catalyst until the last 20 seconds standing over her graveWhy was the main cast constantly naked including the 9 year old?What was everything washed out and shaded with a black gradient?Why were we supposed to care about any of this?I don't know ""]"

Personally bummed on how Hanabusa was treated here, but then again, if you watched the main series, you would know just how damn strong she was, so I guess they had to make her not as strong as before.   Aside from the fanservice, there is really nothing much else to point out except for the ending song being good, the animation quality being good as before.   Oh, and as for plot, the plot is basically the girls are fighting over these pin/badges.  Thats it.  Nothing else.

Expect the series to give the most typical fan service most anime special introduce. The setting is in an island setting so expect what kind of fan service the special holds. The plot still stick with the same gimmick as the anime series did. Another unfair battle royal game where poor Haru going to be targeted again and Azuma is going to protect her again. Another 2 vs 11 scenario  same plot mechanics but more fewer stake because the characters are...not going try and kill her but instead take the ribbon wrap around her and boom! The winner get her wish granted it’s the same boring format as before but now the anime is acting what it really is. And that’s all about it. I have nothing to say about the music, art, plot and characters nothing really changes.Subjective Review about the series as a whole: (This may contain Major Spoilers)I already tackle in details why I dislike Akuma No Riddle in my previous review about the series so I will give a short paragraph on what will you see when you watch the anime series first before this special. Akuma No Riddle is a Battle Royale game that is pure train wreck it didn’t explain how the rules work in the game. Another factor is that the assassin girls seem like they are not taking their role seriously and are they really are assassins to begin with? And they are just generic characters from different anime series. We have an air head heroine named Haru and protected by another assassin that was met to kill her Azuma for no sensual reason just protected her just to have a yuri couple excuse for the fan boys fetishes and to extend the story. Azuma is Haru roommate so she has the better chance to kill amongst the other girls. In the end Haru became the victor because of Azuma help and all the girls was “Alive” wow so much for a death tournament it is like the girls just have excuse to throw and hurt each other. Well what you would expect in a “Shoujo-Ai” genre. The life and death situation doesn’t matter anymore once you watch the ending. This anime is just complete time waster. Believe me.If you want to read more feel free to find my previous review about Anime review No.8 for more detail why I dislike the series.I hope my entire review about Akuma no Riddle can help guys.

Thank You for reading :)', ""Akuma no Riddle is an anime I talked about a long time ago. Turns out, they have a one episode special that takes place after the main story. So, let's have a look and see if it adds anything.Story:We open with the girls on a yacht heading for a school trip. When Nio takes the opportunity to crash the boat and start a little game. Each girl has a golden badge, save for Haru who has a red one. It's up to Azuma to protect her girlfriend's badge while the other girls try to take it to have a wish granted. They lose...if they have their golden badges taken and whoever's holding Haru's badge when the sun sets wins. All the girls get into the game, save for Chitaru & Hitsugi who immediately exchange badges to go off and flirt as their wishes came true when they found each other.The big issue with this as a follow up to the series proper is that there are a lot of things that happened at the conclusion of that series that don't really get addressed in terms of how they were resolved. Chitaru & Hitsugi running around all lovey dovey being a big one. Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely adorable and there is something compelling about a tall, strong girl having a relationship with a petite girl but I'm very curious about how they went from where they were as of the main series finale to where they are here.This episode is also a great deal more light-hearted than the main series. The main conflict is just kind of silly and it's very obvious that most of the girls are just playing around. Which I'm a bit mixed on. While it can be helpful to wind down the action with a bit of a more light-hearted moment, it's also a bit weird aesthetically.One major factor this does have going for it is that it's incredibly cute. Especially the Chitaru/ Hitsugi scenes. The special loves to cut to the pair of them just being very flirty.Characters:The characters are very much the same as they are in the series proper except with their darker traits played up more for laughs than used seriously. One thing I appreciate is that Haru is willing to lose the game since she's not actually in danger and she'd rather play in the loser's area but she keeps going for her girlfriend's sake. As Azuma is taking the whole thing far too seriously. The major characters do come across as highly endearing too.Art:The big issue with the art is that it delves too deeply into mindless fan-service. There are multiple scenes of the girls stripping each other. Even putting those scenes aside, they all spend the entire thing in their swimsuits. Which basically makes this the beach episode. If they hadn't kind of had it already with the whole buddy breathing episode. And, in all fairness, the series proper was also fond of fan-service. This just takes it a little further.Sound:The voice acting remains a very strong aspect of the series. And the music is still really good.Ho-yay:There's a lot. This is one of those anime where there just doesn't seem to be any straight characters. Even though Chitaru & Hitsugi get the bulk of the cutesy moments.Final Thoughts:This special is decent enough. It provides you with some extra fluff and some funny moments. With that being said, it's not a brilliant ending to the series. It doesn't add anything of substance. But if you just want some cute yuri moments, you'll be pretty happy with it. I'm giving it a 6/10. if they have their golden badges taken and whoever's holding Haru's badge when the sun sets wins.

I can\'t really get behind that.I DO like the story and the whole concept of ""after the show"".

Chameleon (OVA),https://myanimelist.net/anime/5353/Chameleon_OVA,"[""Chameleon is an anime that gives the viewer moderate expectations that it immediately lives up to, leaving the viewer sad and confused.Story: 7/10The anime immediately throws you into a set of circumstances with no backstory. Eisaku Yazawa is a high schooler that, despite his size and personality, wants to be a feared gang member. There is no true explanation for this. There is little backstory in this anime at all, but with length of this OVA, this prevents character development for characters nobody cares about.Art: 5/10The art in this show is extremely dated, especially for an 1992-1996 release. The animation quality and background drawings are...about on par with something from the mid-to-late 1980's. There aren't any noticeable mistakes or flaws in the animation.Sound: 6/10Sound effects and music are very consistent throughout the whole OVA. Nothing in this anime is considered bad from a musical standpoint, but it doesn't stand out very much.Character: 8/10The characters in this show are what saves it from being completely overlooked. The protagonist is a very funny character that can give of many funny lines and expressions. He fumbles around the world of gang violence, but he is viewed by his peers as a real threat by mistake. This dynamic got a lot of laughs out of me.Enjoyment: 7/10Enjoyment of this show is more subjective than anything. Yazawa can be hated or loved depending on how he is viewed, similarly to Mineta in the newer anime Boku no Hero Academia. He is never portrayed as completely rotten, but he is perverted, as protagonists go. People who are fans of the era might find this entertaining.Final Notes:This show isn't great. But it isn't awful. While dated, it can still keep my interest for an extended period of time. The sex and violence isn't awful, but there are still touchy subjects and stereotypes that haven't aged well (Yu), but it can make for an entertaining time. about on par with something from the mid-to-late 1980's.

The story didn't really go anywhere, and there was hardly any character development, if any at all. I've been a fan of Da Capo as well as Da Capo II and had some decent expectations from Da Capo III. I wouldn't say my expectations were too high, considering I was very much turned off from episode 1.Story: 3/10As I stated before, the story really didn't progress until very late into this series. There really wasn't much development as a Da Capo series, and I personally was disappointed. For those who haven't watched and were hoping...for the drama shown in D.C. and D.C.II, don't.Art: 8/10Fairly enough, the art of this series was actually quite decent. The characters and settings were all drawn very nicely, but unfortunately many episodes had some rather confusing shots.

Keep moving along.Character: 3/10No development whatsoever, and all of the characters are very stale.

The original series had interesting characters and managed to squeeze in character development, then further suck us into this world that also happens to contain the existence of magic.

However, for a certain place known as the Hatsune-jima island, it gives off that feeling of Spring years round. It's a mysterious island and there are many mysteries. One thing is for certain though, the island holds one of greatest secrets involving a Sakura Tree which apparently has the ability to make wishes to come true. With this in mind, the series invites questions to the many mysteries that surrounds the origins of Da Capo III.Da Capo III is the third installation of the...Da Capo franchaise. The series debuted as part of the Winter 2013 lineup which seems to be somewhat ironic given the Spring atmosphere of the settings. Regardless, the series is a direct sequel of Da Capo II and takes place approximately 20 years after. That's over 2 decades and many things have changed.For one thing, the series takes place on a mysterious island. The island itself is shaped like a crescent moon but more important, the setting has many mysteries. Perhaps the biggest mystery of them all is the Sakura Tree. Rumors says that it has the ability to grant wishes and make them come true. Sounds exciting isn't it? Well, that's only the tip of the iceberg...Among all the mysteries also resolves around a competition of the Kazami Academy Newspaper Club. From the first episode, there is a sense of rivalry going around at school. In fact, it brings in together a little drama that were all part of the original Da Capo series.The series has a school life setting and stars the main male protagonist, Kiyotaka Yoshino. He seems to look normal, acts normal, and is typically normal. However, the friends that he hangs around with are a bit..should I say, not too normal. Well, let's just say that Kiyotaka has his work cut out with him because the majority of his friends are of the opposite sex. They are girls and all of them seems to have a thing for Kiyotaka. This should be expected though given the romance aspect of the show. Just like some of the previous Da Capo series, romance becomes revolved around the main character with the interactions he has with the other girls.In terms of the other characters, each of them get their own spotlights with one of them being the main focus. As such, some of the episodes are standalone and makes little to no progression to the plot. To me, this is a major distraction and rather loose way of enforcing the premise of the series. Additionally, I find the main male protagonist Kiyotaka to be far too dense for liking. It is quite obvious that many of the girls he hangs out around with are attracted to him in a different way or form. Whether it's displayed by jealousy, sadness, or curiosity, the girls around him feels a special connection to him; some less than others among the group. Unfortunately, Kiyotaka is too dense to realizes it. Even at one point, there's a minor character who also expressed interest in him. Furthermore, whenever an opportunity is presented for him to do various things to the girls, he passes it by. And of course, he also seems to get into misunderstandings that invokes wrath. Typical.The series' plot revolves around the Sakura Tree and thus, a main female character makes her return to this series. She is named Sakura and holds a sense of innocence behind her character. She adoringly refers Kiyotaka as “oniichan” and often hangs out with a strange cat. Strange as it sounds, there are a lot of mysteries surrounding her character and origins. It spells mystery and as the series progresses, we learn some things about her and her connection to the Da Capo world.As interesting as the potential plot itself sounds, the series suffers numerous problems. The drama involving the first episode with the rivalry is vaguely explored. In fact, there is hardly a sense of rivalry in that aspect at all except for the rivalries between the girls themselves. They all want Kiyotaka's attention but he's too dense to realize it. At various points, I have to wonder if Kiyotaka gives a damn at all.The series also falls under the typical fan-service. In fact, various camera angles often prolong the scenes of the girls' moments with their movements. Certain parts of their bodies are often show in various point of views. It's as if the series wants to market them rather than the actual plot. Examples of this also includes the pool episode with the swimsuits, the many scenes when Charles (Lulu-Nee) literally throws herself at Kiyotaka, and even the opening sequence. Then, there's also the tsundere involving a minor character, the little sister type, the mature school idol, jealousy clingy girl, and among others. Oh, and don't forget about the 'naked apron' part because the show also conveys that part. With all this in mind, it is also no surprising that Kiyotaka becomes the envy of the male students. Sigh.In terms of the major plot revolving the Sakura Tree, it is expressed in a weak way. There's some dream like sequences exploring the aspect of its mysteries but most times are vague. Therefore, it is fairly important for viewers to watch the prequels to understand more aspects behind the Sakura Tree and its origins.Regarding the romance, I find the series to be quite weak in that department as well. Most of the girls seems to lack any sort of personality and Kiyotaka himself isn't faring any better. In fact, he's the guy who has to make decisions and the answers he gives often comes out so ambiguous that one may often if he's just trying to be the typical nice guy. This doesn't come across to be a pleasant response to the girls though. In fact, it's clear that Kiyotaka views one of the main characters as more than just a good friend. Unfortunately, the route? It leads to almost nowhere. Shame.The visuals in this show is expressed well. The majestic feeling of the Sakura tree spreads that atmosphere of the Spring life. It is because of that atmosphere, we can see that the tree itself is obviously special and makes the island seems like a paradise. Unfortunately, the characters' designs are all generic to the max with breast sizes even being compared at various points.For the soundtrack, Da Capo III has a soft melody and often mixes in with a sort of mystical tone. It's not breathtaking though but does gets some of its way across. The OP sequence also has the girls dance in various positions but becomes a distraction, just like the main plot.Well, I'll give this series a '5'. It just didn't work out well for me and stands mediocre at best. The premise is interesting and caught my attention. However, the attention of the series shifted more to fan service and “romance” rather than anything else. While it did maintain its magical theme, it focused more so on the characters, including a minor character that had little to no progression to the overall series. Oh well, it was only 13 episodes but this was a chore to watch. If I did have a wish to make to the Sakura Tree, I wish I probably would of done something better with my time. Da Capo franchaise.

Unfortunately, the characters' designs are all generic to the max with breast sizes even being compared at various points.For the soundtrack, Da Capo III has a soft melody and often mixes in with a sort of mystical tone. It's not breathtaking though but does gets some of its way across. The OP sequence also has the girls dance in various positions but becomes a distraction, just like the main plot.Well, I'll give this series a '5'. It just didn't work out well for me and stands mediocre at best. The premise is interesting and caught my attention. However, the attention of the series shifted more to fan service and “romance” rather than anything else. While it did maintain its magical theme, it focused more so on the characters, including a minor character that had little to no progression to the overall series. Oh well, it was only 13 episodes but this was a chore to watch. If I did have a wish to make to the Sakura Tree, I wish I probably would of done something better with my time."", 'Introduction:Now, Da Capo 3 has fallen very short in popularity from Da Capo 2 and 1, it\'s not like Clannad After Story in which the sequel is better or equal.

Either ways, you probably have one laugh.Overall 8/10: 8 of 10 because instead of a run of the mill harem series, this series delivers a bit higher than that, the series hasn\'t died out and don\'t expect it to be good as the first one because any sequel that lies more than 6 years ahead.

However that aspect is almost completely disregarded after the first episode, and becomes pretty much a one on one of the main guy protagonist and his girl lover candidates.It is literally just an  visual novel being animated or eroge or whatever this is based off.However the  music accompanied to this anime is well done and the art is visually stunning, if not for this i would have definitely dropped this anime. If you want to watch something that is calm with light drama then this is an anime for you. It...is soothing throughout, and to the point.

A lot of cameo came from another D.C series that which one is Sakura. Sakura in D.C III maybe will confuse you, but if you watch D.C II you will understand why is Sakura come to future and playing with Kiyotaka. Great ending song especially ""Aitai yo (会いたいよ)"" by yozuca* (eps 1, 9-13). One of great song for D.C series.

The show seemed to be lacking in plot and played up the harem a lot. I even think ""a lot"" is an understatement. To be honest i haven\'t seen the first two shows in this series and if they have some sort of relation this might make more sense but all in all i feel that this one alone lacked plot and was one of those shows that will slip my mind for the rest of forever. I\'m really into character depth and the was no depth present here so it made...it hard to care about anything the characters were doing. The quality was great and it had some goofy moments that made me laugh but overall it was very forgetful. it hard to care about anything the characters were doing. The quality was great and it had some goofy moments that made me laugh but overall it was very forgetful.', ""... I have no words to make for an introduction for this anime. I'm just solely disappointed with the animators who thought that this was good enough to appease the fans of Da Capo (including myself) who were waiting for this new season of Da Capo to come out for three years! Then what do we get? This sloppy anime with a fist full of disappointment for three years of waiting.Story:This isn't really the worst part of the anime, nor is this the part that really makes the whole anime bad. I think the story could have been good if the writers made their characters...do something in the anime. It's not like the characters don't have anything to do either. They have stuff to write, a mystery, a protagonist who could possibly get a girl, but what did the characters do? Nothing. Nothing, but walk around aimlessly doing nothing. The story as frustrating as it can be did keep one thing straight, keep up the fan service.Art: This is easily the best part of the anime. Hands Down. If something can be admired from the anime is that it takes a page out of Kyoto-Animation's book with its very moe characters and color. The color palate of this anime was very nice and bright, and the animation itself was very fluid throughout. But, this anime is heavy on the fan service so expectations on the the art are pretty high and it pretty much delivers on that expectation. So good job Da Capo III, you didn't completely fail out.Sound/Character:I can clump these two together because they will have the same reaction and same review. They are nothing spectacular and nothing stands out of these two categories. In hindsight, the only thing that sticks out is the computerized twinkles, and the female character's breast that take up about half of the screen. Nothing was good nor was it bad. It was pretty underwhelming.Enjoyment: I didn't enjoy it. I hated it.What do I say about this anime? I hope that you grasped it from the frustration in my opening. If you didn't, here is my response: Don't Watch This Anime. There are better anime around like TWGOK, Sukitte ii Na Yo, Ano Natsu De Matteru, ef - Tale of Memories. This anime isn't worth your time, and might end up like me regretting watching this anime when I could've spent that time other ways. Please don't this anime. do something in the anime.

With the latest Da Capo, however, I\'m not so sure I can continue to do so. I truly thought Da Capo was done with Da Capo 2SS, but true to the title, it\'s back once again. However, this time there is no pretense for drama or character development, the franchise has officially gone for the full harem approach, and the fan-service heavy type at that.I\'ll try not to make this too much of a tirade, but what once was a mastery of character depth and atmospheric...development has suddenly been lowered to Sora no Otoshimono levels of seriousness. Basically, we return to the crescent-shaped island of Hatsunejima where a typical harem protagonist finds himself utterly surrounded by girls attracted to him, and utterly unwilling to choose one of them. This is basically a story of how he abuses everyone\'s feelings towards him with random sprinklings of magic and opaque hints of parallel universes. If you\'re looking for a typical fan-service heavy harem with boilerplate characters, look no further. If you\'re looking for a renewed series worthy of the Da Capo name, this series will be an utter disappointment for you.Animation:No doubt about it, the animation of the Da Capo series continues to improve. The island has never looked better with lush coloring and some really nice scenery. We have a brand new cast of pretty faces with some Da Capo roots including a Yume Asakura look-alike, yet another Suginami, and Sakura- in an even more childish form. There\'s a lot of additional supporting characters that not very memorable as well.There hasn\'t really been much action in Da Capo, and that doesn\'t change here. There are some light hints of magic occasionally, though thank goodness much less of the android-spammage that occurred in earlier Da Capo works. However, rather than replacing this with some actual character development, they filled it instead with a lot of fan service. We\'re talking bouncy at the store, bouncy in bed, and bouncy in the bath tub. There\'s enough nudity and ""sound effects"" to seriously categorize this as soft core H- if you\'re into that kind of stuff.Sound:It sounds weird for a Da Capo series to launch without Yozuca, though she does make an insert song and ED appearance. Instead, the series starts with the cast singing ""Sakura Happy Innovation"". The title sounds like a desperate attempt to sell the series, and the melody is a bit plain as well. There are three EDs for the series, two by Da Capo regulars and one as a character ED. Aitai yo is a nice, if slightly dark Yozuca work while Meguru by CooRie is an upbeat work that I would argue sounds more like a typical DC OP. The character ED has a fair tune and, more noticeably, a lot of random nudity. The BGM is fitting with traditional DC pieces with a heavy emphasis on piano, xylophone, and flute.The VA cast is quite interesting. Either DC ran out of funding or they\'re really going overboard with the ""innovation"" concept. All the lead heroines are pretty much unknowns, and none of them really stand out in particular for me. More annoyingly, all due respect for Hitomi but, Sakura is now pretty much a third grader. Especially that laugh...Story:A lot of DC3\'s story is shrouded in mystery, even after the series ends. So basically there\'s a dude named Kiyotaka who happens to be the only male in the school newspaper club. They decide to do a paper on the mystery of the giant Sakura tree, which stopped blooming, and unintentionally somehow revive it. Afterwards, a mysterious girl who identifies herself as Sakura appears, alongside a non-cat nyaa-ing creature called Utamaru. Who is this familiar looking girl and how does her fate relate to Kiyotaka?DC\'s plot line is pretty much what you\'d expect from a typical, brainless harem. By the time the series takes place, all the girls are already unconditionally in love with Kiyotaka. Irregardless, the story follows the girls in an arc-based approach where each girl spends an episode or two coaxing Kiyotaka with fan-service heavy scenes. Throughout all this, Sakura randomly appears and steals the ever-popular protagonist away so they can play. I\'m not sure why Kiyotaka, a seemingly mentally-sound adolescent male, would choose to play with a high-pitched, annoying third grader over going on dates with hot chicks, though I can only hope he\'s not a pedo.After the story runs out of girls to showcase, it finally gets into plot mode and throws a few dark episodes reminiscent of the mood in the majority of Da Capo 2SS. However, the series, thank goodness, quickly switches out of depression mode and jumps to a rather quick conclusion where some of the many mysteries are answered, though it actually begets even more questions than answers. Will there be a second season? Possibly, as they sure leave enough unexposed plot elements to do so. Whether there will be any fan base left to watch it is another question.Character:This was a painful show to watch. While I\'ve made it quite evident by now that there were many elements that I was displeased with, the character interactions and development, by far, take the cake. While I got over the fact that all the girls were literally cookie-cutter characters with little exposition and static personalities, I just couldn\'t get over the fact that Sakura was relegated to a little girl who forgot who she was. While I never rooted for Sakura in any of the previous Da Capos, her role in his series is just plain humiliating. My other major qualm is character spammage. Not only do they randomly introduce unnecessary side characters, but they re-introduce some clones from previous Da Capo series. However, like the main heroines, they are also empty shells with cookie-cutter personalities. Don\'t expect any meaningful development in this show as apparently no one can sway Kiyotaka to their side.Value:When I typically watch a show, I tend to watch episodes in bundles. For really good shows, this happens right at the start, where as in other shows such as Koi to Chocolate, this happens latter on. For DC3, this never happened. I couldn\'t find anything to really hang on to in order to convince me to keep going. Either the plot was just not interesting or I\'m just not interested in fan-service overload anymore, but I honestly just didn\'t enjoy this show that much. As with music, overuse of Da Capos only end up with bored crowds, this definitely rings true here as well. DC3 is just a plain harem that happens to have the DC badge attached to it. I really don\'t think this met my expectations for the franchise and I\'m not going to even try to defend this one.

The ability to make humor and get the audience laughing is a wonderful thing. However it is often the case that in that pursuit of comedy other aspects of a show is ignored. While there are many shows that are funny, there are less shows that are able to branch out from that humor.Dame X Prince is one of those that can. First off as a fan of outlandish and silly humor the humor of the show was right up my ally. There a ton of good jokes that exist in the show, and there are several running gags that the show...is able to keep working well due to knowing how to switch things up and not focus too hard on one aspect. It does a great job of parody both in the silly things that happen and in how the characters act. Each of the princes is a bombastic parody version of standard tropes cranked up to 11. Their actions are consistently hilarious and fun to watch.But what I find even more impressive than how funny these silly princes are is how likeable these silly princes are. Often times in the name of comedy, comedic characters aren't made to be likeable but rather focus on being funny more than anything. But each of these characters have their own perks.

Surprisingly the first episode had me literally laughing out loud multiple times and I ended up enjoying myself more than I thought I would. The characters are ridiculous and are, although heavily relying on tropes, delightful to watch. It seems like our main character, Ani, is the only sane person on the show, and she's definitely...not as bland as what you'd expect from the dating game protagonist we tend to see in reverse harem's a lot. I think this anime's strong point is definitely the use of dry humor, and for the princes to be exactly what it says in the title: goddamn useless (I say this in an almost endearing way). There are, of course some issues with this show, but as there are only 4 episodes out right now, I can't say much about the plot right now. I think this show is probably more character reliant and not story based, although there definitely seems to be some kind of storyline; it's not very present as of yet. For now I would say, just watch the first episode and see for yourself if this anime is your cup of tea or nah. Just don't take it seriously (because the anime doesn't either) and I think you'll be fine. I sincerely hope that the jokes won't get repetitive after a while though, but for now this is just a fun lil anime I can turn on for some relaxation after a long day. not as bland as what you'd expect from the dating game protagonist we tend to see in reverse harem's a lot.

I sincerely hope that the jokes won't get repetitive after a while though, but for now this is just a fun lil anime I can turn on for some relaxation after a long day."", ""You might be like, why did I give this a ten? Well this anime speaks to me. I've always had a love hate relationship with harems. I hate them, but I always love parodies of harem. But none have done it quite as well as this anime. This was the perfect anime for me, and that's why I'm giving it a ten. This was a hilarious anime that got me laughing out loud, which is rare. Don't come into this anime looking for romance, you won't find any. But you will see a lovable MC and hilarious characters. They always seemed to come up with...new things to keep the reoccurring jokes funny, usually building off of them. The strangeness of the anime is apparent, but its a great ride. new things to keep the reoccurring jokes funny, usually building off of them.

And by any means I'm not a romance fan, actually it's very rare for me to like this genre (reverse harem in particular). But Dame x Prince proves that when you mix hilarious comedy (parody?) with bits of romantical clichés you can make something unique and enjoyable.Story is, well, nothing especial. Main character Ani, which is from small nation Inako, travels to sign peace-treaty with bigger nations Milidonia and Selenfalen. There she mets bunch of very weird princes and troubles begins. Most of the times its episodical but it links...together in the end.Character-wise its more better. Even though each prince has somewhat stereotypical trait (narciss, shota/bishounen, outlaw etc.) its crancked ad absurdum which makes it unbelievably funny. Narek is always concerned about his look to the point that he has trio of knights with mirrors and confetti folowing him everywhere. Luze is so cute and beautiful that people faint just by looking at him and Mea is shut-in weirdo obsessed with his anime idol. Suprisingly Ani is very realistic reverse harem protagonist. She is witnessing all the crazy stuff with personality of normal person, kinda like Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club and that's makes her very likeable.Comedy and parody is huge in this. Ani has perfect deadpan remarks, it constantly makes fun of romance or reverse harem.

The princes are a bunch with super powers i'd say :D But not what you think. One has the power of Narcissism, other - the So-angelic-it-makes-your-spirit-leave-your-body power.... And not to mention the 3 guards with the confetti and the fans, plus the flying cat which almost always messes something up!...Really, the story isn't a big deal.

Love it xD"", 'I\'m absolutely shocked and outraged this anime got only a 6.62 rating on MAL at the time of this review. I can only explain it with two reasons:1. People gave this a try and dropped it the moment they figured out it was a reverse harem.2. The comedy just didn\'t work for them.Both of those reasons are fair in a way, you are free to not like reverse harems, even though I think they always come with an unfair prejudice I don\'t feel harem shows (generally directed to straight men) are subjected to the same treatment even if they can equal in...shittiness at times; and comedy is subjective so obviously it can\'t always land. But if you go into this with an open mind and don\'t expect too much of a plot besides just having a good time, watching DamePri might be the best decision of the day you could possibly make.First of all, I\'m an avid otome game fan and I can\'t deny I\'ve been often displeased with otome games adaptations and a lot of reverse harems. Mostly lately it just feels the joy of making a good reverse harem (no matter the actual result) is dead, so it\'s way easier to push out all the ikemen idol shows and cliche otome game premises with absolutely zero effort. This is where DamePri shines.DamePri is fully self-aware of its genre, of its tropes, of its character stereotypes and definitely doesn\'t shy away from it, it glorifies it and exaggerates it tenfold, also sometimes breaking the 4th wall. Prince Narek is one of the best examples of this. Go figure his introduction is basically ""You there, woman! I see you admiring my gloriousness!"", then, upon the heroine\'s utmost confusion at this weird claim, soon followed by ""OMG! how can she not know the magnificent beast that it is I..??! Oh i know! You\'re so struck that I made you lose your memories!"" leaving everybody including me either shaking their heads in utter shame or laughing their asses off. I definitely reflected both of those states at the same time.  Honestly I don\'t know about you, but that\'s peak comedy for me. Especially when the rest of the characters are equally exaggerated: the flirt, the childhood friend/knight, the pretty-as-a-flower-bishonen, the emo depressive shut-in sprinkled with the mysterious sadist and the rigid duty-is-all-that-matters older man.And it brings me to the heroine. If you are looking for competent heroines, LOOK NO MORE FOR YOUR WISH WAS GRANTED! Ani is everything that I wished for in a reverse harem/shoujo heroine. She can be nice and oblivious but also very smart and competent. She often acts as the straight-woman of the situation everytime she\'s surrounded by the quirky princes/nobles that make up the cast of love interests for this show. She thinks what any normal person would think when surrounded by, albeit very handsome, weirdos, who in any normal situation would be called creeps, if they just weren\'t part of a reverse harem lol. (maybe with the exception of Teo, Teo is an angel).And there is more! Don\'t dismiss DamePri as a just a comedy show that goes nowhere either, the characters have substance and go past their initial stereotypes, they have character arcs, they change and they evolve. By three quarters in you\'ll actually find yourself immersed in a story of betrayals, of loyalty, of friendship and what it means to take things in your own hands instead of remaining a passive bystander, either too preoccupied with one\'s selfish ego or too insecure to take a step by yourself without anybody else\'s control.I admit the pacing isn\'t always that good, some jokes do become old, especially if you binge this show, characters sometimes reach convenient conclusions at the right time, but as far as I\'m regarded it is ultimately all justified and nothing could impede my enjoyment of this anime. In the end, it just doesn\'t have to be taken that seriously when it isn\'t taking itself that seriously either and giving it the benefit of the doubt when it tries to actually move things forward in a more serious manner.It is definitely one of the best reverse harem shows out there and seeing it being dismissed and this underrated hurts my soul.

So much so, it takes a moment to fully accustom oneself to how ridiculous they are. But this is exactly what...makes DamePri so fun and exciting.

Devilman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2252/Devilman,"['Note: both the anime and manga are two completely different stories but as long as you bear this in mind, Devilman TV is an episodic series super hero series that can be very repetitive but manages to provide gruesome horror or other times some intentionally ridiculous entertainment.The story begins rather unsettling as the main character Akira Fudo is killed by Devilman, thus he takes over his corpse and becomes Akira. So, in other words our main characters is actually Devilman (or Amon to be more specific with other Devilman material). Despite this key difference, Devilman falls in love with Miki and has sworn to...protect her from the Demon Tribe. This leads to Devilman being branded a traitor where Demon Lord Xenon will send demons to kill Devilman. As you may have guessed, the series follows a formula where the beginning of the episode features the demon\'s murderous abilities which sets up the horror mood. Afterwards, Devilman has to fight him or her and usually ends the battle with a Devil Beam or a Devil Arrow.A basic flaw of the show as a whole is the repetitive problems that it presents itself. As this Devilman is very much like a Tokusatsu series with Devilman turning into a giant and the demons usually arriving one at a time. While we all know it would make more sense to send everyone at once to get the job done, you have to watch this show knowing that it will play out like this. Of course this does hinder its story and instead relies on a fun factor which often led to some hilarious moments such as the iconic ""Devil Jump!"" . I think appreciating events such as that is what makes Devilman TV enjoyable.What amazes me about this show is despite being aimed at a children audience, this is NOT a kid-friendly show. For its time and possibly even now, the series is too violent for any public broadcast with its constant use of human casualties, especially ones involving car crashes and airplanes. In a very Go Nagai fashion, many civilians aka extras are constantly killed adding to the dark tone of the series. A lot of demons are very over powered but certainly made their presence almost unforgettable due to their fearsome strength as some episodes are genuinely scary.However, like any show there are some things that can\'t be ignored. One of my personal problems with Devilman TV is that the series may have been better is some battles lasted 2 episodes instead of a self-contained story. For example, a lot of the episode\'s time is spent on creating a terrifying atmosphere which leads to a few minutes of actual fighting. I don\'t mind short fights but it does get a bit annoying that a lot of the fights end very abruptly with Devilman struggling in a one sided match only to save his skin by using a Devil Beam (which you will hear a lot of.)Basically, I had a lot of fun watching this version of Devilman but I can certainly see why people wouldn\'t like it, especially if they read the manga for it. The structure of Devilman TV is very similar to the other 70\'s Go Nagai series Cutey Honey & Mazinger Z due to their basic superhero plots. And very much like Cutey Honey, the series does end open-ended with Devilman never fighting Xenon or completely eradicating the Demon Tribe. However, I was really surprised to see Devilman gradually change throughout the series where he began as a despicable, violent person and by the end of the series he\'s an honest to heart good guy. The quality certainly shifts per episode but there\'s definitely something good to be found in this superhero anime. It\'s not a must watch series because its so good nor is it a show so bad its good; Devilman TV is the episodic journey of a devil whose becoming more and more human who vows to protect his love. As simple as it is, this type of series can only be enjoyed by a certain few who love tokatsu or just a monster of the week show in general.

The last episode's later moments does have a small dramatic turn of events but it's way too little and way too late to be respected.The monster of the day episodes, which are probably 100% of the show, are watchable and some has ok ideas but they have no effect on the story and they are all repetitive (monsters arrive, Devilman beats everyone, everything comes back to normal - Miki doesn't find out Akira is Devilman). Also, an average episode contains an unlimited amount of inconsistencies, questions left unanswered and plot holes.Regardless of the story's undevelopped mess the show's strong side is its character balance and chemistry. I liked Akira and Miki's general archetypes. He might have been too aggressive for his own good, unlikely for modern shounen heroes, but Miki had the upper hand and Akira was hers.On the visual department I actually like the art style although it failed to maintain its quality and the animation and movement is laughable, but you should expect that and besides it's the least of the show's problems.P.S.

However, the manga only started publishing about a month before the anime was released. Basically what this means is that Devilman is not so much an adaptation of the manga as it\'s just using the character of Devilman. The anime is actually more of an adaptation of Nagai\'s other manga called Demon Lord Dante. Never the less, Devilman is a classic, so I decided to give the anime a shot.Devilman is about, well, Devilman. A boy named...Akira Fudo goes to the himalayas with his father. There his father is killed and Akira gets possessed by Devilman. And that\'s basically it. After that cue monster of the week type tokustsu show and pair that with ridiculous scenes that you are not sure if they are supposed to be funny or horrific. It was really a strange show and not at all what I was expecting from ""Devilman"".The first thing I noticed about this show was that visually, the show was not very good. The production was just a mess. For example there were multiple times where they didn\'t remove previously used key frames, so they just hung around on screen. After 10 episodes I felt I had seen enough of this show. It did give me a few laugh in the beginning, but as soon as you get used to the ridiculousness of the show it just completely stops being fun. I did not enjoy watching this show and because of that I could not make myself watch more than the 10 episodes I have. Overall I was very disappointed.

The production was just a mess. For example there were multiple times where they didn\'t remove previously used key frames, so they just hung around on screen. After 10 episodes I felt I had seen enough of this show. It did give me a few laugh in the beginning, but as soon as you get used to the ridiculousness of the show it just completely stops being fun. I did not enjoy watching this show and because of that I could not make myself watch more than the 10 episodes I have. Overall I was very disappointed.', 'If you are already an established fan of the Devilman franchise, be warned, this series does not follow the narrative of the original story... at all. You should go into this story expecting more of a monster-of-the-week, ""Kamen Rider""-like story, as opposed to a philosophical look at the dichotomy between good and evil. This show has not aged very well, and perhaps, is far too zany for its own good!⚠️ This review of Devilman (1972) will contain light spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis is the fifth installment of the Devilman series that I consumed in a long list: the first was Devilman: Tanjō Hen (""The Birth""), second was...Yochō Sirene-hen (""The Demon Bird""), third was CB Chara Go Nagai World, and the fourth was reading the original manga. So, by the time that I ordered the Discotek release of this series off of eBay, I was already entrenched in the franchise! I didn\'t really know what to expect from the cover, Devilman looks less like a monster and more like a man wearing a stag-beetle helmet with kabuki make-up... but the answer is: goofy, it is plain absurdity, this show is not a Devilman series at all, but more like what ※""Space Black Knight"" is to ""Mobile Suit Gundam""!※""Space Black Knight"" is a bootleg rip-off of the original Gundam series, where a cheaply rendered version of Char Aznable gets unmasked and is actually Amuro Ray. I would suggest looking into it, if you want a quick laugh.Akira Fudō doesn\'t undergo much of a life-altering change in this iteration, he just demon whips the followers of Ghandi! Yes, this is something that actually happens. If there\'s a positive development to any given character, it would be to Miki Makimura — in other versions of the story, there is small moments of playful banter between her and Akira, but this series showcases her ""comic strip""-like frivolousness and that was refreshing to see. We only see her transform into an Olive (""Popeye"") in the manga, so it\'s refreshing to see her be a part of Akira\'s life in a more meaningful way.  Which reminds me, the most pivotal character in the manga, Ryō Asuka, does NOT exist in this anime!The episodic writing varies from episode to episode, sometimes it can be entertaining (in a trippy way) and other times, it\'s just boring and monotonous, tacking a poorly rendered ""filler"" monster at the end of each segment. The designs that aren\'t lifted from Nagai\'s manga usually look really corny! For example, in Episode 21 — Devilman battles a demon that looks like a red color variant of the Michelin ""Tire Man""! Believe me, there are some really stupid-looking monster designs in this! There also doesn\'t seem to be a consistent continuity with what Devilman\'s utility belt does, Akira will shout ""Devil Beam"" and the command will account for several different attacks! It doesn\'t make any sense, at all!There\'s a new character that becomes a reoccurring (love interest?) third wheel to Akira and Miki\'s budding romance! She\'s a demon named Lala, and while her voice is very cute, she was entirely useless to the story. It felt like she only existed to be a complete idiot and get in the way of their pre-established love affair. It wasn\'t a very well orchestrated plot point, but nothing in the story really has any staying power after a single episode. Even as an obsessed ""Devilman"" fan, it was difficult to immerse myself in any of it, I think I mostly zoned out when things hadn\'t gone completely bananas because (aside from more of a focus on Miki Makimura) none of the characters were the ones that I had grown to love; everything seemed to have been modeled to fit a televised time slot, rather than do anything in the story justice!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Tomoharu Katsumata (director), notable works:* Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime ✅* Captain Future* Cutey Honey ✅* Dai Yamato Zero-gō* Daikū Maryū Gaiking* Daisōgen to Hakuba (""The Princess and the White Horse"")* Entaku no Kishi Monogatari: Moero Arthur* Ginga Nagareboshi Gin* Hashire Melos* Kagayake!

He was a demon who was sent to destroy humanity, but due to his human host's love for a girl, he decided to protect us from a coming genocide.Devilman was a daring show for its time.

Even close friends betrayed each other, leading to a gruesome end for most of the main characters and the apocalypse.

Feng Qi Luoyang: Shen Ji Shaonian,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50657/Feng_Qi_Luoyang__Shen_Ji_Shaonian,"['Luoyang Divine Youth review (contains non-explicit spoilers)OverviewLuoyang Divine Youth, or its mononym Luoyang, is a historically-inspired donghua that combines fantasy elements from the Wu Zhou period. A verdict on the imperial examination has impeded the interests of traditional aristocrats. During this time, Pei Kun came to the city Luoyang and got entangled in the ""fox demon"" case as a wanted man. His persistence in catching the felon led to his involvement in the conspiracy of the Chun Qiu clan. Alongside Li Ying and those of the imperial court, Pei Kun tears apart this massive conspiracy to achieve his original goal.Story & character: 7/10 and 5/10This...donghua goes on a slow pace to build up depth. I was pretty surprised it could fit the main storyline into 16 episodes with fillers for Pei Kun and Li Ying, princess of Tang’s relationship. Everything was set in stone from the first episode until it threw in more hooks and pinch points, which made keeping up with the story a bit perplexing. The most notable episode was episode 8 because it revealed current events but not everything for obscurity.I like how it showed each character\'s reason for actions because of their struggles (such as the Shangguang siblings\' misunderstanding, Li Ying’s “betrayal,” etc.). What I did not enjoy is that most of the introduced characters exist for the sake of others. They are “disposed” or forgotten about later on after events that fit accordingly to their principle (mainly Bai He’s wasted development in the season finale).Art & Sound: 7/10 & 6/10There is nothing special about sound. However, there are some notable things about art. The fight scenes are pleasing to look at; they successfully capture fluidity during most of the character’s stunts. I appreciate this donghua\'s efforts in designing extras and scenery according to its period, which is a bonus for me. Some sets have a drastic change in quality when characters are standing in sunlight or any bright light. It creates a blur effect or an unrealistic glow on their faces, but it is not something that ruins the experience.Overall and enjoyment: 6/10The mystery elements captivated me. The number of vaguely answered questions by foreshadowing hinted at a sequel, but there is no information about a second season (as of writing this). I expected the story to have a play on politics, but the mix of fantasy and vitality themes is not so bad. A 6 is fair, so I consider this a decent donghua to watch. donghua goes on a slow pace to build up depth.

I enjoyed the animation and the story; the character designs are great, the animation and the fights feel fluid (though could be better), and it is enjoyable to watch.The basic plot of this story is: a youth arrives in Luoyang (capital) seeking to find answers regarding his teachers death, and is sucked into a conspiracy/political infighting. While the donghua introduces alot of ideas, cool gadgets and drops alot of hints (mystery element), it ultimately doesn't make use of them all, especially the gadgets. Overall, the plot is nice but relatively simple, the characters are likeable,...resulting in a rather relaxing and enjoyable donghua.This donghua is enjoyable, has some nice quirky and comedic moments. I recommend it if you like historical fantasy type of story. resulting in a rather relaxing and enjoyable donghua.This donghua is enjoyable, has some nice quirky and comedic moments.

This anime adaptation of &quot;Fake&quot; focus on the Act 5 of the Manga, published on the second volum which, by itself, reduces very much the potential of the story. The flashback trick of the manga is explored here, but it was still disappointing not to see more.The manga story holds many detailed complexities, that were basically left out in the anime. However, it's still a great action and mystery tale.The characters were prefectly characterized: many hints...and a lovely flashback are presented for us to know what is going on between them. However, for those that have not read the manga, a mistery remains: who the hell are Bikky and Chal and what are they doing there?Special kudos for the voice actors, a great cast that worked their job perfectly. Only Dee's voice seemed &quot;not quite right&quot;, but after some minutes I got used to it and now I can't imagine him differently.This is very enjoyable, much more for the adventure and mystery than for the BL (which, being near to none and not explicit at all, is well done and realistic). and a lovely flashback are presented for us to know what is going on between them.

The drawing in the anime isn't that good, and I wasn't impressed with the voice-work, either. The plot is the same familiar one as in the manga - though with lesser details, of course. A nice watch, sure, but nothing to be impressed about. (Then again, I think the manga is brilliant, so it is rather hard to beat that :D) "", '""Fake"" is an adaption of the 5th story arc in Sanami Matoh\'s manga of the same name - NYC detectives Dee Laytner and Randy ""Ryo"" McLane are enjoying some down time in the English countryside together and Dee is preparing to take their long time flirtation to the next level...until a guest at their hotel winds up murdered. The story follows the protagonists\' slow burn romance in media res alongside the developing case.a) Story! - Fair""Fake"" doesn\'t adapt the entirety of the original manga; only the 5th chapter in Volume 2 out of the published 7. So, of course, there\'s a lot of missing context...and the narrative feels isolated from the larger work. I was never confused about character dynamics however and always felt sufficiently informed about Dee and Ryo\'s history thanks to various quick flashbacks and context clues! It\'s just important to remember that you aren\'t going to get everything from this one OVA; this is a Free Sample at CostCo that you can taste before buying the whole box of crackers (i.e. reading the manga)This OVA does tell a complete narrative though! It\'s most enjoyable aspects are it\'s character interactions and it\'s development of Dee and Ryo\'s romance. The two of them are in an awkward transitionary period where they know each others feelings, but Ryo especially isn\'t confident in persuing them - he learns to be more open and expressive with Dee via the help of some really well written secondary characters!The mystery aspect is kind of subpar unfortunately. There are some surprising revelations and even a supernatural element that becomes apparent early on! But the overall murders are woefully predictable with no room for the viewer to make deductions on their own.b) Art! - FairI\'m honestly not a huge fan of the art style! It\'s an excellent 90s anime throwback especially character design wise, but the way resting facial features are drawn doesn\'t sit super well with me. The characters seem melty? Or droopy? It doesn\'t quite fit with the overall aesthetic.The classic 90s facial expressions are SICK though!! The visual comedy is really well executed and will definitely do you right if you\'re looking for some of that nostlagia.Background art is relatively unremarkable but well executed! The lighting is rendered very tenderly, especially at sunset and night time.c) Sound! - GoodKind of unremarkable! The music isn\'t exactly memorable?The voice acting is really well suited to the characters! Dee\'s lines hit all the right notes of loud, exuberant, and comedic without becoming obnoxious. Dee\'s VA also balances the comedic and serious heart to heart scenes really well - it\'s incredibly organic and a huge part of why the character performance was so enthralling.d) Character! - GreatThe characters are the highlight of this OVA! Despite being only 55 minutes, you get a really good feel for Dee and Ryo early on that quickly endears them to you. Dee seems initially like the jocky, No-Homo stereotype that could potentially spend the whole OVA in an ""AM I GAY??"" panic scenario - but no! Dee is the character who\'s most confident in his feelings for Ryo and Ryo himself also avoids this annoying trope. His calm, collected presence juxtoposes well with Dee\'s energy and their banter and overall dynamic is a joy.The secondary characters are less developed, but still interact well with the protagonists and are memorable! Berkley Rose specifically is a great addition, since most of the side characters are comedic relief and Berkley functions more so as a serious narrative foil to Dee.e) Enjoyment! - GreatI thoroughly enjoyed watching Fake!! It\'s not a masterpiece by any means, but I mean. I had fun! I watched it with a friend, which maybe heightened the enjoyment factor since we were talking and theorizing and joking - but even if I\'d seen it alone, I think I still would have enjoyed it because the concept and the character dynamics are just exactly up my alley!OVERALL/TLDR:yknow how police procedurals and buddy cop movies are kinda gay and people joke about it?

""Fake"" is a gay police procedural that plays that completely straight. to reference twitter account We Rate Dogs:""it\'s a good ova Brent""', ""I watched this simply because it was mentioned by a youtuber talking about the dynamics of gay relationships in anime. As someone fairly new to yaoi in general, I became interested and decided to watch since I was told that while this is an OVA, it's pretty much a stand-alone in and of itself. I have not read the manga, so that might influence my judgement, though I will try to make this as unbiased as possible.First off, the story: I'm going to be straight up-- other than about five-ten minutes in between, there's really no romance. And the romance that is shown is...mostly just some kissing, and once it nearly escalates before being interrupted. So if you're here for the shipping aspect, this really isn't for you! On the other hand, for people who prefer a different type of story, there is a murder mystery going on in the background. Personally, while I'm a really big crime and horror fan myself, I found this unsatisfactory-- it was very, very painfully predictable, and in many spots it really did make sense. I won't go into detail here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it was disappointing as a mystery overall since I was able to figure out pretty much the entire way the story would play out in the first ten minutes-- it was ridiculously simple.I don't really watch old anime all that often, but I have seen a few (mainly Ai No Kusabi from 1992-1994 and Hunter x Hunter from 1998 and 1999-2001) and both have a cleaner art style that leads me to believe more effort could have been made. The art isn't necessarily BAD, but at times it seems sloppy. However, I was very happy with the more realistic body types-- most of the time in 'gay' anime, the seme tends to have a massive, hulking structure with gargantuan shoulders, while the uke is more of a tiny little feminine dwarf. I'm glad that both of our leads looked like... well, men. Normalish men. That being said, I didn't really like how the eyes were designed on most of the characters, but that can be easily overlooked.The background music and songs of this OVA weren't bad, but completely forgettable. All of it really lacked the fire to make a real impression, so I really didn't care for them. As for the voice actors, I watched a dub, where they did mostly a good job, other than some parts were they sounded rather flat.I think the main thing that saved this OVA from being completely terrible was the characters. While I didn't really like the way some of the characters were structured and the things they were saying (there were too many stereotypes, including the 'I'M NOT GAY! guy who just kissed a guy and admitted to having feelings for a guy' guy, the 'let's rape this person just because they totally gave me consent though they are currently struggling as I try to get close to them' guy, and the 'totally nice old person who really isn't as nice as they look' guy). On top of that, some of the dialogues were unnatural because... well, people don't really talk like that... Regardless of all that, however, I found the chemistry between the characters to be endearing, even if some of the slightly racist and homophobic comments haven't really aged all that well.Overall, this wasn't too bad, but not really what I expected.I would recommend this if you: like murder mysteries, like simpler murder mysteries, like (just hints) of romance in your animeI would NOT recommend this if you: are here for the romance/yaoi, like more complex mysteries, don't like cliche/predictable plots, are really touchy about slightly assaulty behavior (think classic seme forcing themselves on someone clearly saying no but then the entire situation being treated like a joke...)Have a great day everyone! mostly just some kissing, and once it nearly escalates before being interrupted.

If the dynamics of Kimagure Orange Road (or Ranma 1/2) turned gay and given a crime-mystery feel to it, you\'d have FAKE. (And maybe that\'s an oversimplification but the bill should fit somewhat.)With how they rapidly introduce the main cast, it feels like you\'re being dropped in the middle of a series, with only enough detail...to get a superficial grasp as to how they\'re all connected. To their credit, they did give a 5-minute background check on the main couple, Ryo and Dee, and how they became involved with each other. Everyone else, including the love interests of Ryo and Dee respectively? Not a chance. Still, it\'s pardonable given that they try to tell a cohesive, original story in 1 hour, and they do it alright.The mystery was a sloppy Burger King special. After the scene is set, it\'s laughably easy to narrow down the suspects, and therein the motives. No taste, much less flare. But the anime laughs it off anyways; it\'s background music for showcasing the main duo\'s relationship, which seems one-sided but is surprisingly mutual.

Second off, don't get butt hurt just because I don't like it.As a heterosexual male, obviously this isn't something I would be open to watching or enjoying. So, I went into watching this with a pessimistic approach. Overall, I rated it a 4 (Decent), which it wasn't. It was utter garbage, but rating it a 1 is too much imo.Story:2 Cops solving a case, but the case keeps on getting interrupted with sudden ass pumping. To be fair the story had its mystery and not a half...bad plot line, but the 2 cops kind of ruin that. The cops case is a murder case, but without revealing too much, the case is unrealistic and doesn't really make any sense. So, if you don't like an unrealistic story, then this isn't for you.When I look at the plot and genre, I guess I can't help but feel like the anime did in right. Obviously I'm not going to enjoy it because of.. reasons. But, if you like that stuff, go ahead and watch it.Story: 5Art: This OVA was released in the late 90's, so the art and animation wasn't spot on and to be honest I don't like older art styles, probably because I'm used to newer and cleaner animations. For the time, the animation and art was pretty good, not amazing. But good. It suited the presentation of the plot and the relationship of the characters, but again, compared with modern art and animation, it's not great. so..Art: 6Sound: The music in the anime varied from pumped up cop action music, to generic romance music, for obvious reasons. Non of the soundtracks really stood out as being bad or good, so I thought a 5 would be an overall good assessment.Sound:5Character: Well, the obvious problem with the characters is that they don't understand their profession. Their job is to capture criminals which could cause problems to society, but instead they see their relationship with each other to be more important than that. They work perfectly for the genre and romance, I guess, but I can't say I felt any sympathy or connection with the characters. The only one character that I didn't mind was Carol, was actually quite an interesting character, but unfortunately looked like she was drawn by a 5 year old. This kind of goes back to the art, but it's obvious that the art has been directed on the men of the show because the girls just look so.. stupid.Character: 3Enjoyment: I have pointed things out throughout the review and I think it's pretty obvious that I didn't enjoy it, it's just not something I can sit down and watch normally like everything else, instead my watching experience was cringing and hitting my head on the table wondering why these cops can't do their job properly.Enjoyment: 1Overall: 3 bad plot line, but the 2 cops kind of ruin that.

I have not read the web manga but the anime feels like its taken the web manga, strained everything thats good from it and used the left over as the basis for the plot because if the web manga is as bad as the anime then there is no way in hell...that it would have been animated.Story 1/10:As Ive said in the beginning, nothing is explained yet more characters are introduced. There are one or two acceptable fights in the anime but it feels like they put those in so the anime wouldnt be complete trash, they add nothing to character development and the powers used in the fights are never seen again. It seems like the length of the episodes do not play well with the story especially when dialogue drags on and wastes precious time that could be used to make the anime more interesting. Instead time is wasted on explaining what the character did in a fight or flashbacks of characters that play no part later on in the anime. The game inside the anime is also pooly explained and in the second season its even worse. Is the game in virtual reality? What are the value of assets? In the first season its stated that in game money cannot be used in reality but Suigin clearly uses it to pay for his lunch?? Do you lose your assets when you are defeated?

Who knows.Enjoyment 3/10:HA what enjoyment.Overall 3/10:For a short anime to be this bad is embarrasing, the story should be condensed into short and sweet episodes but theyve managed to make short episodes somehow drag on.', 'First of all,this season is a massive improvement to the first season and the first season sucks a lot as nearly the entire season is a filler.Story: 6/10Much better with the story here and it is decent enough to passArt:7/10Pretty good art and animation,some part is not all that good but for most part especially the more intense fight scene,the art is betterSound:6/10Good OP and ED,other then that,the voice acting is alright...character:7/10More character is introduced and they are quite interesting but is a bit blendenjoyment:9/10It is one of those meh anime that is quite fun and interesting to watchRight now,i really want a season 3 since it ended it a pretty decent cliff hanger character:7/10More character is introduced and they are quite interesting but is a bit blendenjoyment:9/10It is one of those meh anime that is quite fun and interesting to watchRight now,i really want a season 3 since it ended it a pretty decent cliff hanger', ""So, this is my first review. And I start from an anime which not many people talking about. And not many people like it.Story: 8/10I think this anime has a good story. Not for only the season 2 but, from the start of the anime, I already like itArt: 7/10It has pretty decent quality of art and animation, it's not the best, but I still enjoying it a lotSound: 8/10It has some good music here, when the fights start or the drama begins, eventhough it's not memorable. The OP is still the same, powerful. The ED is... really beautiful...Character: 7/10Not really much character development, because this season is full with action. I think they don't have room for it. Yeah, Suigin is getting stronger thoughEnjoyment: 9.5/10I really enjoy watching this anime. I don't know why, maybe because i'm not watch this type of anime latelyOverall: 8.5/10Overall, It's a good anime for me. Some people may hate it. But, yeah its only an opinion. Everyone has their own opinionIt's not over yet, so I hope it gets another season Character: 7/10Not really much character development, because this season is full with action.

Getter Robo G,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4486/Getter_Robo_G,"['Getter Robo G picks up right after the end Getter Robo. With slightly better production qualities and a brand new mech designs and the totally-not-Dinosaur-Empire-2 Hyakki Empire, how does it fare? Find out in my long awaited (said no one) review for Getter Robo GThe story, much like the original isn\'t really there too much. It\'s usually just monster of the week most of the time, with once or twice being a multi-episode battle. However, the Hyakki Empire seems to be a lot more hardcore than the Dinosaur Empire as they aren\'t afraid to turn dogs into bombs and sic them on our unsuspecting protagonists,...or use a beam that literally cause people to become brain dead. Since it\'s not exactly an anime with an overarching plot, it\'s only decent. But, like with Getter Robo, I don\'t think it matters too much. I had got a lot of enjoyment out of watching the battles, predictable as they could be.The art and sound is much like the original show, though slightly better. There\'s fewer reused animations (but there\'s still understandably a decent amount) and the art is cleaner. The opening is the same ""Getter Robo!"" as before, but the ED is a new song. It\'s good, but I like the ED from the original more. Speaking of things I like more in the original, I like the original Getter design and not the new one nearly as much. It just doesn\'t do it for me.It\'s practically the same characters as the last one, but with Benkei replacing Musashi, yet fulfilling a similar role. And of course the new antagonists. One of which who is absolutely not inspired by a certain WW2 era German leader. I don\'t really have a preference as far as Benkei vs. Musashi. The Hyakki leaders are not super deep or interesting characters but they do what they need to... though if the two generals weren\'t constantly fighting each other, maybe they\'d have the bright idea to send out all their mechs at once instead of one at a time - which they sort of did by the end but still manged to mess up. I know they probably wouldn\'t want to have an ending where our heroes are defeated and humanity gets replaced by Humans with Horns.Despite its flaws, I still had a great time with the show, when I decided to watch it. What was also nice was that unlike Getter Robo, where only roughly 2/3s of its episodes have competent English subs, all of G\'s episodes have subs that were actually written by someone that\'s fluent in English. If you\'re looking for a good show by today\'s standards, this one probably isn\'t worth your time. However, if you can put up old with cartoons or enjoy something for what it is, maybe consider checking out Getter Robo G. After watching the important episodes of the original if you want, you don\'t really need to watch it to enjoy G. or use a beam that literally cause people to become brain dead.

First of all, the robots now have proper, cooler names: ""Getter-1"" became ""Getter Dragon"", ""Getter-2"" became ""Getter Liger"" (ok this sounds more crap than cool, I admit), and ""Getter-3"" became ""Getter...Poseidon"". The new robots also look better than the original. For example, Getter-1 had two ""horns"" sticking out of its head, and Getter Dragon has about five.More importantly, the robots have a few more moves to play with, so the pilots no longer have to pretend the likes of ""Getter Jump"" and ""Getter Kick"" are special moves. Along with the new moves came some lame new names - all the robot attacks are in English, or rather, Engrish, and when the series was adapted into the English version ""Force Five: Starvengers"", a lot of the more stupid sounding attacks had been renamed. Here, however, you can witness the original names in all their glory. I had a good chuckle at the fact that what I knew to be ""Shoulder Missiles"" in ""Starvengers"" was ""Strong Missiles"" in ""Getter Robo G"" (and ""Getter Robo"" I don\'t think this attack even had a name). Getter Dragon also gained a powerful ultimate attack which was given the unfortunate name of ""Shine Spark"".In addition, ""Getter G"" introduced a new pilot to replace Musashi. His name is Benkei, which literally translates to something like ""strong dude"". Not sure whether it\'s due to nostalgia, but I think I slightly prefer him over Musashi. Benkei\'s personality seems a bit more interesting than Musashi, who was mostly incompetent and only there for comic relief.Last but not least, there are new enemies! The dino empire is replaced by the Hundred Demon Empire. The main representative this empire is a jackboots-wearing general with a small mustache, who goes by the name ""Hidler"". It\'s funny but he kinda looks familiar for some reason...Despite all the upgrades, I still found ""Getter Robo G"" tough going. If anything, the better production made things worse as it means the show is not quite as entertainingly bad. It\'s also a less groundbreaking work, so while it may be less shit than ""Getter Robo"", I can find even less reason to recommend this - despite the higher score - unless you\'re into super robots.Personal rating: -1.0 (""less shit"") Poseidon"".
