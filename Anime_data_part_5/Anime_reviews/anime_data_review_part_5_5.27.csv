Hurricane Polymar,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4808/Hurricane_Polymar,"[""I really don't understand why no one watches Hurricane Polymar. There's an abundance of subs. What does it take for you people to watch this classic?I strongly recommend watching the opening in hopes some of you will actually check out Hurricane Polymar. It can be viewed if you search Hurricane Polymar opening on youtube.For 1974, The animation is extremely sharp and smooth. It's a comedic not so serious anime. A Kid's action superhero fighting show. The fight scenes have good movements, but are not violent. They are in a beat up the bad guy style.I thought the story was fun. I loved how Polymer...was more oriented towards unleashing his techniques rather than stomping the enemy. Polymer as much as a superhero was also a charismatic idol. It had a great happy feel. The synopsis explains everything down to the last point what Polymar is about.If you're that lazy to just go by my review, then Takeshi can transform into the superhero Hurricane Polymar using his Polymer helmet and kick bad guys' butt.Characters except the bad guys are all comedic, good folks. They are humorous not so serious like the anime. It's not a comedy anime, but their antics were cute. Well even the bad guys were funny. They were really funny looking and silly.I've really really really enjoyed this super old school anime.Watch it guys. Please do. I beg you. was more oriented towards unleashing his techniques rather than stomping the enemy. Polymer as much as a superhero was also a charismatic idol. It had a great happy feel.

I beg you."", ""I watched this last year, and I didnt particularly like it, but somehow I can't forget it, so I'll try writing a review.Most episodes follow the same scheme: The gang hangs around in Kuruma's office and gets knowledge of Interpol's plans, thanks to Takeshi's spying efforts. Then, Takeshi beats up a lot of guys in hilarious animal costumes.In a few episodes, Takeshi's backstory is treated, and occasionally, the relation between Takeshi and his father makes some progress. Apart from that, there not much overarching story that I remember. It is mainly animal costume guy of the week hunt.I didn't find art and sound remarkable. Sometimes...I remember the opening song.The bad guys and their underlings had distinctive animal costumes. Apart from that, they were rather flat characters who where evil for no apparent reason and had some megalomaniac plans. I found them all dull.Takeshi's gang was more fun. I especially liked the great detective Kuruma who always looked for excuses to avoid work and not to pay his rent. His dog was the most intelligent character in the series, but unfortunately, he could not speak.After some episodes, it got stale, apart from the action between Takeshi's gang members. The bad guy hunt got boring. And - I found the violence displayed more and more disturbing. Not because it was gory, rather because of the casual way violence was performed. Takeshi beats great numbers of animal costume guys to death and does not really seem to give a second thought about it. Somehow, I found this more and more creepy the more I proceded, and it still haunts me.For comparison: Right now, I watch Hokuto no Ken. In there, violence is celebrated, and Ken can make an enemy's death quite slow and cruel. But: If Ken is cruel against an enemy, he has decided to be so for a reason. I don't know why, but I find this much less disturbing than the casual killing in Hurricane Polimar.Didn't like this series myself, but I would recommend to watch, so you can make your own picture.

HenSemi (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/10187/HenSemi_TV,"['All I can say is Wow. if you thought Hen Zemi was just about fart jokes and perverted comedy, you were wrong. Somewhere within the comedy lies some insight to the human psyche that really blows one away if you sit and think about it.The review is after going through 9 of the episodes plus one of the OVA\'s. Originally, I picked this show up not knowing what I was getting myself into. All I knew is that it featured Hanazawa Kana as one of the main characters and that it was a comedy. When I saw some of the content the show had to...deal with, I had to cover up my 5 year old niece\'s eyes and wait until later to further view this show.The story is, of course, about a girl who takes a strange college course in human psychology. This deals with the less conformist views of the world and dives deep into what many consider taboo. The story is told in a humorous way, but at the same time words what the subject is in a very mature manner. This could vary from the way men are visual animals and how their imagination could shatter a romantic relationship if the reality of their partner\'s physical appearance does not meet their expectations, to the destructive tendencies codependent couples have stemming from fear of being alone. The experiments the students are put through have much to do with the way they view society and likewise how society views them.The artwork is fairly good, considering the character design is thicker than most anime is used to. There will be some viewers who will see the artwork as more toonish than anime, but that\'s subjective. The animation itself flows nicely and the production value seems above average given the 12 minute format.Sound is always a major factor in a good show. This show doesn\'t spend much in the background music department, but it makes up for it with their cast of characters and other small details some people seem to overlook. The cast does a great job in delivering their lines and in some (limited) censored scenes, the sound effects make a world of difference between a mediocre and hilarious audio visual joke.As I mentioned earlier, the cast is one of the reasons I picked up this show. Hearing Hanazawa Kana portraying the somewhat timid Matsutaka Nanako in some embarrassing situations makes my day every week. I seriously never pictured Kana talking about her nipples, but Nanako does. Another great role is done by Kawaragi Shiho, who also played Sekai in one of my personal favorite roles, Sekai in School Days. Seeing her play Makiko is confusing to say the least, as she is almost the polar opposite of Sekai. Very monotone and seldom talks, but her one liners are a real kicker. Each character in the show brings something different to the table and I would write something about each character, but that would make this too long a read.I have to say that if you enjoy dirty jokes (think Seitokai Yakuindomo or Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san) I\'m pretty sure you\'ll enjoy this one. It\'s got some quirky toilet humor and sexual innuendos that are sure to make people ask themselves ""What the fuck am I watching???"" on more than one occasion.Overall, this show is not for everyone, but for those who can take talk about human sexuality, bodily functions and general abnormal behavior, I\'d say this is a good addition to your list. It definitely is not something you want to watch near children... or anyone else for that matter. It goes against any and everything considered normal, but it\'s a nice little guilty pleasure in my opinion.And for those worried about my niece, she really wasn\'t watching this with me. She was watching Shinryaku Ika Musume. deal with, I had to cover up my 5 year old niece\'s eyes and wait until later to further view this show.The story is, of course, about a girl who takes a strange college course in human psychology.

The subtly of this anime in its innuendo makes me smile and its strange approaches to what we normally see in common anime brings me in closer. I feel though this anime is definitely wasted on any younger audience that views it.~Terry ', 'If you have seen Nazo no Kanojo X you have probably seen the debate of whether to taste someone\'s dribble is disgusting or not. Well Hen Zemi takes this not just a step further but A TRANSATLANTIC FLIGHT FURTHER!The story involves Matsutaka Nanako, a nice and somewhat innocent university student, who joins an Abnormal Physiology Seminar, run by a creepy professor, which is cover for anyone interested in sexual deviancy to use their sexual deviancy for educational purposes. Can Nanako stay ""normal"" or become a sexual deviant or is she abnormal because she is the only one not interested in sexual deviancy, or is she?I...will admit this isn\'t for everybody. In fact the writers seem to be enjoying how far they can go with some of the comedy which to be fair is pretty disgusting especially when it comes to bodily fluids. A fact which is shown when an event causes some of the characters to vomit.At first Hen Zemi appears to be nothing more than a gross out comedy but scratch the surface and it is clear it asks psychological questions. For example it investigates what actually causes people to become sexual deviants, what happens if you put people in uncomfortable situations, the affect of childhood experiences on a persons personality, observations on pleasure, are people who enjoy consensual sexual deviancy in private bad people  and should you find the comedy funny and why.With the exception of Nanako the characters are odd and downright creepy. We have the masochist Miwako, Anna who has a split personality disorder, the mummy\'s boy Ichikawa, half British Makiko who has experienced a trauma before she was 17 which means she has subconsciously blocked out any memory before then and doesn\'t seem to have much of a personality, manga artist Taguchi, the disturbingly perverted Mushashi who has a fetish for women\'s bodily fluids and the creepy Professor Kenji. However, it is the characters weirdness that makes the series work and despite their weirdness and somewhat questionable shenanigans they are actually decent people.The art and music are nice yet unspectacular but that this doesn\'t really matter as it is about the psychological questions above and the characters  and what they get up to.Considering each episode is only about 12 minutes long I have written a long review but this is because Hen Zemi actually fits a lot into a short space of time.I short once you get past the gross comedy Hen Zemi is actually an intelligent anime. will admit this isn\'t for everybody.

It\'s awkward and repulsive but you just can\'t turn away. This series literally opens up the pandora box of human sexuality. NTR, masochism, humiliation, voyeurism, watersports... jesus fucking christ. This series is downright creepy.The story and premise are simple. A couple of university students join forces together on their quest for ultimate perversion as they drink piss and shove stuff into each other. That\'s the whole series in a sentence. Yeah, they do also eloquently talk about the philosophy of their perverted quirts but in the...end you can shorten in down to ""I\'d like to jerk off over your sleeping body"".Hen Zemi will definitely change your outlook on perversion. Knowledge is power my friend. This series will help you to spot a watersports enthusiast from a mile away. It will also help you to understand euphemisms better and realise that sometimes a seemingly innocent conversation is actually downright dirty (set up his tent on the other side of the river - jesus, that\'s a good one) .Hen Zemi is for everyone obsessed with sex, perversion... sexual perversion and everything in between. One hell of a fucking ride... now excuse me while I take a few hits and find the nearest bar wench.8/10 points. end you can shorten in down to ""I\'d like to jerk off over your sleeping body"".Hen Zemi will definitely change your outlook on perversion.

These students are tasked with coming up with reports on these subjects and experiencing them firsthand. For the most part raunchy humor, Zemi doesn't provide much else. However, if this is your cup of tea then there is bound to be one or two laughs in these 10 minute episodes.If there is one thing that makes this a weird show it would be the characters. The projects they pick out can only be as messed up as the professor and the students doing them....The point of view is usually told from either Matsutaka's point of view, Ichikawa's, or Anna's. Why? Well these three are the most normal. That only says so much though when your group of friends are in this seminar. The others consist of Mizukoshi the lustful beast just short of a slut, and Komugi the calm collected one who isn't afraid to pull of the most ridiculous projects. There is also a mangaka foreigner couple enrolled too. The characters are very well done for the type of target audience. As the characters make the show in a comedy, these suit the roles very well.The activities range from Body Tables to Yaminabe. Farting in the elevator and telling everyone you did it? Getting into the mindset of a underwear theif? Developed a weird mental complex as a child? Those are the types of things Hen Seminar does.  Now these are mostly the general ones, as there are plenty of times the members test out the responses of their classmates. This is especially true with the female lead Matsutaka, whom has somehow developed a crush on Komugi. As he most likely knows this, he teases her to no end by including her in many of his projects.I'm not particularly one for raunchy humor, but I pride myself for being very open to all genres. Hen Zemi definitely could have been slightly more entertaining, but the shorter episodes prevented me from every getting actually bored. There are quite a few nice tidbits such as Anna's story that are much cleaner, but sometimes there were scenes that were so far on the other end that I gave it a 'surprise factor' entertainment. Overall Hen Zemi was pretty good although you may need time to adjust to the setting of the story. If your looking for raunchy humor I would recommend this for sure.Questions and feedback on my review are welcome! I hope my review was helpful and happy watching!

This really does take an interesting look at fetishes and abnormal sexual psychology, while the humor is great and can be enjoyed on a no brainer level by all, the real treat is the insight into perversions and the subculture surrounding them. Sadly it's all a bit rushed and crammed together being a short series, lightly touching on as many different fetish subjects as it can in the time given. Going to a light covering of a...broad spectrum of them rather than in depth analysis of a few specifics.

The story follows Matsutaka, an ordinary girl who enrolls in an abnormal psychology class, and her adventures with her salacious and deviant classmates. It’s not often you get an anime in a university setting, and it’s refreshing to see adult characters who actually have sex and talk about cultivating their own feces. It’s also interesting to see how the others’ bizarreness rubs off on Matsutaka, and how she changes through the show.As you might have guessed, this show has some pretty weird jokes, and it’s definitely not for the faint...of mind, or those who mostly keep to more generic comedy. If you liked Panty & Stocking (with Garterbelt), it’s a little like that, but more straight faced. Without hesitation, the characters seek out all vile perversions in the world, from indirect kissing to walking around in public in a diaper or with a phone-activated vibrator. The characters are varied, and feel fresh and original. There’s of course a lot of focus on the main character, and as such, more interesting characters sometimes get left behind, but everyone gets their share, one way or another.The art is simplistic, and while it may seem a little bland at first, it fits the show very well, and never feels unsatisfactory. The characters either have over-the-top reactions to most things, or remain calm and collected, which varies things, and gives each character their own identity. The animation is really nothing special, but it doesn’t need to be. It looks and feels very much like the original manga.The soundtrack is pretty unimpressive, but fits the tone of the show, especially a piece of music introduced near the end. The voice acting, on the other hand, is wonderful. The voice actors give it their all, and they each do a smashing job, my favourites perhaps being Norihisa Mori (Ichikawa) and Shiraishi Minoru (Taguchi). The ending, song by Hanazawa Kana, is catchy and light hearted. It’s certainly a notch above average, but not quite up there with the great.I’d recommend this to anyone who wants a comedy out of the ordinary, those who like the abnormal, and deviants in general. It might not be for those new to anime or those a little pretentious, but I had a lot of fun with it, and you should watch it. of mind, or those who mostly keep to more generic comedy.

Rather than an physiology seminar, this seminar is more about educating each other on sexual deviancy.Now normally, a ""pervert"" in anime just means they like sex a lot or think about it a lot, or want it really badly. Not so in this one, these people are real perverts. They eat insects, trick one another into consuming semen, pee in public, break into one another\'s houses and do weird stuff to them while they\'re asleep. If this was the real world, these people would probably be in prison.I was gonna rate this a 6, but the anime does have some...interesting episodes that talk about human psychology and why people end up having these odd sexual desires.Overall a decent anime, but be forewarned, some of these characters\' fetishes are quite revolting. interesting episodes that talk about human psychology and why people end up having these odd sexual desires.Overall a decent anime, but be forewarned, some of these characters\' fetishes are quite revolting.', ""Hen Zemi was an awesome anime. They somehow managed to make a cute college kid anime mixed with the most perverted stuff I have ever seen in a non-hentai anime.The idea is the characters are taking an abnormal psychology seminar, about extreme fetishes, but they get all sorts of perverted assignments. They also talk about and sometimes do all sorts of fetishy things. Most of the people (boys and girls) are there because they have an abnormal sexual side; the exception is the main girl who is very innocent and gets dragged into situations and discussion she is unprepared for...Its very interesting because it...is both disturbing, funny, and sexy all at the same time. I can't think of another anime quite like this one; the closest I can come up with is FLCL, but Hen Zemi is rated 17+.Further on that note, it is definitively not for minors; they talk about sex and all sorts of perverted things.

Honoo no Mirage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1019/Honoo_no_Mirage,"['Want to watch some cool bishounen? Check out this story about Takaya Oogi, a regular high school student trying to lead a normal life. I looked at this series with curiosity of how shounen-ai would be used. But, I found the story more interesting beyond what I imagined.Although everything, in the story, at first seemed peaceful, a major turn in events surprised me. But, once the story unveiled itself after time, the fear of freaky spirits disappeared from my system. I grew interested in finding out what happened with Takaya.First of all, I want to say that I found the artwork incredibly impressive. I think...the animation could have been just slightly better in certain scenes, but the art style was well-designed. Itsuko Takeda\'s character design has always made, especially in Mirage of Blaze, anime, as a whole, much more interesting to watch. From such amazing art, I immediately grew to love each character. Not only was the art style very appealing but also the character development. I found that each protagonist had complex and almost ""realistic"" personalities. Sometimes, there were a few forced and cheesy moments that made the main character act somewhat unnormally. But, for the most part, each character had several intriguing characteristics.Second, the sound added to the effects in a helpful and colorful way. ""Suspense"" and ""horror"" were mostly detectable by the sounds used in the anime. Each background music section blended well with each scene and circumstance. As for the opening theme song, I would say it could have been better in ways, but I found that the shot sequence followed reasonably well with the music. The song itself was quite nice. I thought that the lack of an Ending theme song did not take away from the show.Third, the graphics were not entirely adequate to my tastes, but they were effective and appropriate. The special effects during certain scenes lacked well-timed and flawless animation. But, altogether I found all of the effects unique and useful.Fourth and finally, the story definitely had a rather wacky concept behind it. But, I found the absurdity of the plot quite entertaining to watch for development. This anime ended up being more than a rather ""twisted"" love story. There were many moments of drama and action mixed in with some adventure. Really, I found it hard to stop watching because it was so thrilling and interesting to continue watching till the end. The storyline really brought me to enjoy this series very thoroughly. Although a few things were a bit predictable and funky, I loved to watch the story unfold. The finish of the anime left a rather unsettling impression, though, in my opinion. Even so, I recommend this story to all slash/shounen-ai fans. It\'s a romance story that you cannot miss!(Meh, I might be a bit biased with my review because I love shounen-ai... But, I still think my ratings were rather valid (inspite of the fact that many people do not agree with such high ratings)). the animation could have been just slightly better in certain scenes, but the art style was well-designed. Itsuko Takeda\'s character design has always made, especially in Mirage of Blaze, anime, as a whole, much more interesting to watch. From such amazing art, I immediately grew to love each character. Not only was the art style very appealing but also the character development. I found that each protagonist had complex and almost ""realistic"" personalities. Sometimes, there were a few forced and cheesy moments that made the main character act somewhat unnormally.

(Con advice: make sure at least one person from each travel party has a name on the hotel reservation so you can get a key upon arrival.)Guh. GUH.Admittedly I was interested in this anime upon seeing the previews. The character designs reminded me of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; (the main character is a Seishirou ripoff liek whoa), and there was some nice scenery. I have...a weakness for urban fantasy, and like every girl, I'm crazy for a sharp-dressed man.That isn't enough to hold my attention more than ten seconds, unfortunately. And that is where this show's good aspects end.The story sucks. The dialog sucks. The anime itself DRAGS with filler that fills in the gaps between a story that is boring enough in-of-itself to feel like filler. It's filler within filler. There are some gratuitous shounen-ai-esque touchy-touchy moments. Woo-hoo.It was so boring I don't even really remember what happened, something about a war and the main character being reincarnated and zombies. Sounds like it has the potential to be interesting? It's not.Just watch &quot;X&quot; and save yourself the grief. a weakness for urban fantasy, and like every girl, I'm crazy for a sharp-dressed man.That isn't enough to hold my attention more than ten seconds, unfortunately.

But I suppose it is good enough that I manage to watch all 13 episodes within about 3 days.The animation was weird to me that so many of the characters basically look alike and I kept getting confused as to who was who. I\'ll cut it some slack. This anime is over a decade old but still the fight scenes were a bit weak and disappointing.Characters....i\'d say the characters were mildly interesting. Surprisingly no one really annoyed me or I flat out hated them. They were tolerable enough but this is one of the...few anime where literally no one seems to stand out. From the main character to the minor character, they all seem equally boring and unappealing. I suppose if I had to choose a character, i\'d say Naoe is my favorite only due to his twisted character and persona and the evolution of the character throughout the 13 episodes.Storywise...I really can\'t tell you what the plot was because so many things were happening at one time. The first episode alluded to one thing and I thought it was going to heavily focus on that particular plot but by episode 2 or even 3 it was abandoned and then we get some fillerish moments before another crazy plot happens and this plot confuses the crap out of me and doesn\'t make much sense. It\'s conclusion, though rushed, was satisfying enough but I still was like ""What was the point of...."" or ""why did this..."" quite often.Last but not least the romance...This is quite a twisted anime, especially with Episode 11. The problem with this is....the romance feels forced and tacked on. For most of the 13 episodes there doesn\'t seem to be too much of a build-up and i\'d say around maybe episode 8 or so is when it finally was like ""Yeah let\'s get around to the romance.""I love the idea behind it. It was twisted and not something you see or expect. That being said, the execution sort of made an awesome idea fizzle out royally.In the end, I say watch it but be ready to binge it. I\'d love to see what this anime could be like present day with a much better budget and perhaps even more episodes to fully flesh out characters, plot and romance.Within 13 episodes, it just was barely average and likely a forgettable anime. few anime where literally no one seems to stand out.

The idea was good and there was a lot of content that I could have enjoyed but the presentation was just so sub-par.I watched all 13 episodes in under 4 days and I was very interested in how everything was going to pan out. There are many different factions headed by warlord's spirits and they are all after power, going about it in different ways and making alliances etc. I like that sort of political intrigue. The thing about Mirage though it that we have all these characters that get one or two episodes that I think...play important roles but I have no idea who they are or what they want.  Instead, we follow our main group as they face their current issues and problems with each other and then ... some guy decides the solution to his problems is to set a forest on fire.  Why? Who knows. Then the story is over, leaving our group in pretty much the same position they started with.Aside from poorly designed episodes I really hated the art. Now I watched a less than perfect quality copy of this on gogoanime but I don't think that was my main issue.  Half of the characters looked the same. You were either a guy in charge, a flunky, a child boss, or a woman; and if you were x you looked like all the other x's .

Frankly, the taste of this anime might have been a bit sweeter with nostalgia, but not by much.STORY:  4/10. This anime suffers from Loveless syndrome in that it has a few deep plot points of note but spectacularly manages to complete--and barely even scratch--none of them. For the first six or so episodes, the anime paces its introduction of its characters at a consistent rate, where even if the plot is inundated with historical references, you can still keep up with it. At this...point, the romantic relationship between the two male protagonists takes a backseat, but they dangle a few scenes and hints here and there so you don't forget it's there.Then, after a certain incident, the anime does a complete 180 and introduces a bunch of characters in a short amount of time. Instead of maintaining its steady course towards the various powerplays between warring clans of the Feudal Underworld, it puts the rest of the eggs in a basket of what I can only describe to be a side-quest in an already ongoing mission in any generic JRPG ever. It takes something that was barely relevant to begin with and spins it into this whole mini-arc and at the same time abandons any hope of resolving any of its previous plot points.Then, at the very end of the anime, it remembers that, oh yeah, there was a relationship between the two characters, wasn't there, and gives us this half-baked ending that honestly makes me want to wash my mouth out. So. The premise was really interesting, a nice spin on the whole demon/spirit possessing theme, but its execution couldn't be described as anything but a failure. If you go in expecting any resolution to anything, you'll be sorely disappointed.ART: 6/10. I've seen some complain about the art, but I happen to like its style. Furthermore, it's consistent and doesn't lag or drag. I would say that reasonably so, that certain incident has possibly the best animated scene in the entire 13 episodes. I feel tempted to lower the rating because of its occasionally stale frames, but I'll give it a pass because of its age. Most of the characters (that matter) are pleasing to the eye.MUSIC: 7/10. This is one of those series where the music is all or nothing. If it's a lighthearted moment (rare), you might have a simple tone, but it's usually pretty quiet. This is excellent in terms of mood-setting, although the soundtrack occasionally conflicts with the scenes, and sometimes stands out more. If I had to nitpick about anything, it'd be the OP and ED, but it's really just because they're not my cuppa.CHARACTERS: 5/10. Nothing to write home to grandma about. A few highlights:Takaya - I'd love to say that he developed a whole lot in these 13 episodes. He kinda didn't, but he sorta did. He remains the hot-blooded, recklessly impulsive teenager he was in the beginning, but he starts to become a little more receptive to the situation he was thrust in. He goes through a few changes and introduces a few philosophical conundrums that really makes me feel for him, but in the end, because of the abrupt stance the anime took, I can't tell how much of that is really growth and how much of that is Kagetora's personality blending with his. On a high note, his behavior towards Naoe, which was originally haughtier in nature, softened as their relationship deepened and reached its climax. Watching him made me cringe at times and sigh at others.Chiaki - Because of his initially grey stance, I had really liked him. Unfortunately, this aloofness didn't last long, and it became increasingly clear where he stood. A shame, he would have made for a really nice wildcard.Kousaka – He’s a bit more of what Chiaki wanted to be in that he does what he considers best for his clan rather for any particular situation. Kousaka does as he pleases and has no problem betraying others—sometimes even those he temporarily allied with—to do it. If it weren’t for the staunch tones this anime has, he might have been a more likeable character to watch. Unfortunately, he mainly serves as a mini-deus-ex-machina after the first part, only serving to provide key information.Naoe –  It’s been hinted throughout the anime that several scenes mirror events in the past. And unlike the Naoe of the past, this Naoe’s actions were informed by Takaya, who deeply influenced him. As a male lead, despite having so many scenes surrounding him, his role feels weak. He purposefully distances himself from Takaya, likely due to their past, opting to watch him from afar and see how things roll out. But even when they continue to stay with each other, their interactions feel stilted somehow. Only during that certain incident can the audience finally FEEL the weight of his burden, but of course, the anime takes a 180 after that, drawing a decision that needed to be made into a stalemate. There’s a few scenes of their past which serves to explain Noae’s sins, yet shamefully, the relationship between Naoe and Kagetora is spoken about by the other characters instead of shown to us, the audience.Yuzuru – He’s the Joker, the Trump Card, the unyielding solution that Takaya couldn’t afford to be and Kagetora almost wasn’t. Even though Takaya is the main character, Yuzuru is the one drama spirals around. Yet despite his constantly reputable strength, he’s often a damsel in distress who needs to be saved by the main cast. This pattern holds up to the very end, calling into question how he could even be a trump card at all. Other than that, he’s the soft-spoken Yukito to the stern Touya, offering consolation and occasional insight but not much else. His potential is discussed throughout the series but is never brought into fruition.Kagetora – The dark-horse struggle that Takaya fights with. He’s not really a steady character throughout the series, but he’s the lingering presence in the series that never goes away. His personality is in stark contrast with Takaya’s—where Takaya is abrasive, Kagetora is still. Where Takaya lashes out, Kagetora holds back. He’s serious and determined, carrying himself like the military general he is and manipulating any situation to his advantage. Unfortunately, he only shines in the last three episodes of the anime, and only serves to complicates matters between Takaya, Naoe, and himself. And because of the anime’s execution, we really can’t gleam much about him either.…then there’s the riffraff who only serve to fulfill a role. Like Morino, Haruie, and even more shamefully, Ranmaru. Currently, he’s the anime’s antagonist, but I can’t bring myself to care much about him, especially knowing that he’s only a very evasive steppingstone at best.OVERALL: 5/10. It would be insulting to rate it a 4, but with its incomplete execution, I don't dare give it anything higher than a 5. This is also taking into account the reason why I even remembered/was drawn to MoB in the first place: its music. I figured that if there wasn't even a single upbeat soundtrack out of what, eighteen to twenty tracks, it had to be at least worth one watch. Unfortunately, the music was its only redeeming quality. Perhaps if the series had been longer, it may have received a higher rating. point, the romantic relationship between the two male protagonists takes a backseat, but they dangle a few scenes and hints here and there so you don't forget it's there.Then, after a certain incident, the anime does a complete 180 and introduces a bunch of characters in a short amount of time.

Hero Mask 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40154/Hero_Mask_2nd_Season,"['This review will be biased because I\'m a huge lover of crime anime and with seemingly so few out there it feels great to have one easily accessible on Netflix. However, that doesn\'t excuse the major plot-holes and the extremely disappointing ending.Story: 6/10Yes I\'m being generous but hey, there\'s a lot of good ideas here. The overall premise captures the mystery of the mask and the mask\'s abilities quite well. In this season I enjoyed the addition of Tina\'s story as well as her budding friendship with James. And if they had actually concluded the setup of the Special Service of Crime (SSC) versus the...regular Capitol Police Department branches and a new evil in the ranks of the SSC, the show could\'ve been well respected. But instead Hiroyasu Aoki leaves the viewer with many unanswered questions and too many ""almost"" death scenes.Art: 9/10One of the reasons the show is ending now is that it can\'t keep up with how labor intensive it is to make Hero Mask. Aoki focuses on faced-paced editing which I think works to the show\'s advantage. But, alas, it proved to be too expensive for Pierrot. Overall, very well done and pretty impressive.Sound: 10/10The soundtrack for Hero Mask is pretty much nonexistent. The OP is a dramatic orchestral piece and that\'s really all you get for music. But I\'m giving Hero Mask a 10/10 for sound because of the amazing sound mixing. Everything from the combat noises, punches and kicks to explosions and gunshots were implemented beautifully.Character: 4/10James Blood is your classic American hero and never lets down the audience with his quit wit. Though, in all fairness, the beloved character does not have much of a backstory or that is to say, any.Then one of the most fleshed out characters (and my personal favorite), Harry Creighton, has undeniably the worst character in cinematic history. Okay.. Perhaps an overstatement but the audience doesn\'t even know he\'s dead until another character mentions it in passing.James and Harry\'s relationship is never explained, from the first season it hinted at a lot more than just two men who worked together, a friendship. But who knows ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Also who is the man the new commander was conspiring with ?!?I loved all the characters at their surface level because that\'s all that was available to the audience.Enjoyment: 10/10I have to be honest, I loved every minute of this series. I can easily get sucked into the world Hiroyasu Aoki created. But I was bitterly disappointed by the ending.Overall: 6/10For an anime that wasn\'t based on a manga I would say it\'s a very good attempt at an original anime. Given it had more writers and editors before creation it probably would\'ve been much more successful. Even with it\'s many downfalls I do hope there is a Hero Mask sequel series or movie in the future regular Capitol Police Department branches and a new evil in the ranks of the SSC, the show could\'ve been well respected.

Hero mask is like watching a good sci-fi action movie thriller, besides the anime is really entertaining to watch it has major plot holes and i would like to split the anime in two parts to review it easily.First Season (First 15 episodes)The first season is an immersive thriller that hook you from the first episode. The developing of the story and the mistery is very well paced, the cast introduction and their motivations is well presented, but i have a major problem with one character: Harry Creighton, we only see few flashbacks of...his backstory and his motivations but we never see how Harry and James how their relationship worked or how their ""friendship"" was built and for me that relationship was wasted. The final episode was only an excuse to take out 2 side characters from the main story, also for me 2 wasted characters. Overall the flaws and the plot holes the action scenes, the animation, the sound mixing were great and made it very entertaining to watch (7/10)Second Season (Last 9 episodes)The second season continues with the mask mistery and introduces new characters to the story. The problem with this season is that doesnt answers all the questions presented in the first season, the pace is rushed, some characters were forgotten (*cough Sarah Sinclair *cough) we dont know anything about some characters like the conspiracy man behind all the problems or the new director of the SEC or even the professor (how he escaped from the asylum?). This season has major plot holes, characters were killed just for the cause, characters personality changed just for the cause made a very disappointing second season.  Besides the many downfalls the action scenes and the ""conclussion"" of the masks mystery is worth watching (6/10)In conclussion besides all its flaws and not being based on a manga, Hero Mask is a decent anime with good action sequences, very aesthetic and a good mystery plot. So if you are looking for a decent police sci-fi thriller give Hero Mask a try. I hope they released a movie or an OVA explaining in a better way the ending but after all i give Hero Mask a solid 7/10 his backstory and his motivations but we never see how Harry and James how their relationship worked or how their ""friendship"" was built and for me that relationship was wasted. The final episode was only an excuse to take out 2 side characters from the main story, also for me 2 wasted characters.

I hope they released a movie or an OVA explaining in a better way the ending but after all i give Hero Mask a solid 7/10', ""I had high hopes for season 2, was looking forward to all the unanswered questions presented in season 1, but this was a huge letdown!Since there are no episode discussions for this season, I will use this review to relieve my frustrations.. sorry..SPOILER WARNING!!!First of all, I was really excited for Harry's story and why he turned against SSC. Initially he was helping Connor in order to obtain a mask and save his girlfriend, but they never show what actually happened to her.. how she got sick? and why on earth did Harry leave SSC in the first place and became their enemy? Worst of...all they never showed what happened to Harry in the end? just a sound of gunshot which concludes he commit suicide?!!?Moving on, who is the mystery man voiced by Tsuda-san? They never reveled his name? how he is connected to the head of SSC? Why does he want to obtain the mask? Was he the mastermind behind all of this?Further moving on, the professor is a successful mask user? as it seems he is not affected by the rapid aging side effect? How did he escape the asylum?Is James alive now because of the mask? Did Tina actually die? Where did Sarah Sinclaire go? they totally forgot her in this season?This season was a huge disappointment! the story had a great potential, but is very poorly conducted! too bad it turned out this way.. all they never showed what happened to Harry in the end? just a sound of gunshot which concludes he commit suicide?!!?Moving on, who is the mystery man voiced by Tsuda-san?

Consequently, this is a better, more cohesive season. However, it remains plot-driven, and a lot of the character development is meaningless or non-existent. The watcher is supposed to infer almost everything about the characters based on vague backstories and poor dialogue. *Don’t judge this series based on the reviews that say it’s not “anime” because of its art style.* If you enjoy suspense and action, this is probably...a good choice for you.Story: 7/10The plot is clearer in this season (2) which makes the overall story more understandable. There are still breaks or backstories; however, they aren’t as meaningless. The story helps to end the overarching plot of the show in a cohesive way (albeit while still focusing on plot over characters and excluding some for no reason).Art: 7/10The art style is interesting and works well for the “secret agent” type style and setting. Some episodes have better quality; however, the animation is not as poor as I’ve seen others claim in their reviews. It’s not as traditional in art style as other anime, but that’s fine. *Don’t discount this just because some people claim it has to be a generic art style in order to be anime.* Aside from a few crazy scenes, the quality of the animation and the style are great.Sound: 7/10The music is nice, the voice acting is mediocre, and the sound effects are sufficient.Character: 2/10Nothing ruins a story more than un-relatable, underdeveloped, or pointless characters, and this show is filled with them. Luckily, it doesn’t fall into the “why can’t any characters die?” category; however, the backstories lead up to something that often never comes about (at least in this season), the characters’ intentions aren’t always clear, and the main protagonist is just a risk-taking, impulsive “agent” who doesn’t have a particularly fleshed out backstory or intentions either. This is still the case in Season 2, unfortunately. There’s more pressure put on the main characters, but we still don’t care about them because the story is so plot-driven. Some just die for seemingly no reason, and others aren’t even in the story at all. It’s like they threw darts to select who would be the main characters in this season. Overall, this show has some of the worst character development out of any story out there.Enjoyment: 6/10Season 2 was more understandable than Season 1, so it was slightly more enjoyable. The interesting sci-fi/mystery feel was engaging, but a strictly plot-driven story is never enough to maintain a watcher’s interest, and it prevents the story from really having clear themes and meaning.Overall: 6/10This season has an interesting plot that helps to piece together the unexplained parts of Season 1, although there are still many plot holes.

In the good and the bad. It's the same quality.I only watched season 2 because I watched the first, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this season. I followed all of this without really wanting to, which makes my rating dishonest. Given that it is the same quality as the first season, I give the same rating.At least we are entitled to some answers, but not all, which is a shame.

ID-0,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33797/ID-0,"[""ID-0 is one of those “Netflix anime” that are completely forgettable since it doesn't stand out in any field or particular way, not even in the superfitial level.Production values are decent, the music and sounds are generic but fitting, and Japan is still far away from being Pixar, but at least in terms of CGI animation is not the latest “Berserk”, “Kingdom”, or “Apeggio of the Blue Steel”, the motions don't look as robotic, and proportions are consistent, but once again, it doesn't stand out either.And what can I say about the writing and directing?The plot is the usual stand alone missions in space with...one or two obstacles here and there, if you want well planned and executed missions in space, you have “Planetes”, if you want cool stand alone missions (also with space as a recurring scenario) you have “Cowboy Bebop”, and if you want to see an entertaining as fuck anime with a loli and a robot, you have “Brigadoon”, this anime feels as dry as the first plotless space anime from the 70's, its formula has been executed in better ways throught history yet this anime learned nothing.Pacing is horrible. Fast paced in events and stand alone missions, slow as fuck when it comes to develop the really important aspects of the story, and even to introduce the characters, the first half feels episodic and unimportant, while the second half is completely rushed to the point they don't even explain how exactly the heroes won at the end. The slow pacing helped to make the series feel boring, the rushed events helped to make the series feel unimportant and uninspiring.Characters are one dimensional, all of them. The protagonist is only defined for being timid and smart, although this is only stated and the series never give you a real reason to believe she's smart, while most characters are useless background decorations that contribute nothing, there is one loli besides the protagonist that is there just to cry, and the others have roles like piloting the ship but nothing more than that. The dialogue is plain awful, which helped to make the characterization even worse, plain simple and with no personality, you will constantly hear cliché lines like “My equipment is far superior than yours!”, “It's time to make things well!”. Boring and uninspired.The trope of amnesia is used as a cheap plot device, if one dimentinal characters and terrible pacing wasn't enough to make you feel complete boredom, the amnesia bullshit is the cherry on the top of the cake, it's not a theme about identity or belonging like in “Kaiba”, is just a plot device so the plot cannot be resolved quickly and easily, and so the writers can skip the work to give a real characterization and background to the male protagonist. The series is only 12 episodes yet this plot feels like it drags for too long.The word to describe this work is “uninspired”, I find little to nothing worth saving in this anime.Story: 3 - Generic and unfocusedArt: 6 - Generic and cutsySound: 7 - It's fineCharacters: 2 - Dreadful with moeblob archetypesEnjoyment:  3 - None, but I have seen worse thingsOverall: 3/10 one or two obstacles here and there, if you want well planned and executed missions in space, you have “Planetes”, if you want cool stand alone missions (also with space as a recurring scenario) you have “Cowboy Bebop”, and if you want to see an entertaining as fuck anime with a loli and a robot, you have “Brigadoon”, this anime feels as dry as the first plotless space anime from the 70's, its formula has been executed in better ways throught history yet this anime learned nothing.Pacing is horrible.

It\'s hard to surprise me nowadays, so this was a major plus.The is one of the very rare anime where...I immediately watched the first episode a second time.

This review will be VERY general; so general you'll start the anime and not have any idea what to expect from the story ^^'I honestly think this series is quite a nice surprise. I usually wouldn't check this out just because of how it looks but I just happened to be checking out the beginning of all the shows this season since I have the time. It gave me...the same kinda vibe as Moretsu Pirates but in my opinion, does it better.Maybe anime in general has gotten better at CGI or I've gotten used to it over time but it's really not that bad. (I did also watch Kemono Friends to be fair.) I noticed the slightly robotic motions, yes, but I was never explicitly put off by it either. It was quite appropriate during the mecha (I-machine) sections anyway.There's quite the range with the voice actors. They know what they're doing. Maya is very... anime-y, which is to be expected, voices like her's tend to annoy me at the beginning as I'm getting used to them so nothing new there.At the moment, ID-0 is shaping up to be promising. It's still in the stages of being half-episodic, half-storyline-oriented. But they've alluded to a lot of mysteries to the character backgrounds so hopefully, there'll be more character development. The immediate setting has also been introduced briefly and it seems that that'll get expanded more as the series progresses as well. It's got mystery, action and characters which seem like they will shape up to be likable.I've gone on too long already. I hope people don't get too put off by the CGI and the seemingly simplistic premise.Reading back on this, it's so general I could probably apply most of this to Kemono Friends as well xD the same kinda vibe as Moretsu Pirates but in my opinion, does it better.Maybe anime in general has gotten better at CGI or I've gotten used to it over time but it's really not that bad.

Character development has been fairly solid and the story is intriguing. Multi-layered themes coupled with original ideas and world-building are strong here. Characters (most) are likeable and exhibit heart. While the art is uneven at times, and CG not always coherent, certainly a lot of effort has been put forth.Sci-fi is not easy to do and does not appeal to the majority of viewers. That said...Tropes are typically played, but this is anime after all. Better than anything the West can do. Voice acting is fine and up to par. What...caught me was the variation of protagonists. Yup. Plural. Depth of story. The lines are drawn, in true Japanese fashion,  obscurely between political/military and economic entities, while piracy is relegated to a mysterious other realm.I won't go into Japan's maritime history here. A really huge battleship plays an endearing role subliminally in many space anime, good or bad. Anime fans know that story and love it and all it's iterations.What is right, what is wrong. Moving along, each character plays a complex role whether they want to or not. Allegiance is based upon survival and heart. Bushido.All in all, I really can't understand the low ratings of this anime. I look forward to each episode. There are metaphors regarding mining that are lost on many viewers and possibly piracy in general is not openly accepted thematically. Fine. I guess the Caribbean is open water and space without Depp is wrong. Haha.I could see this opening up toward a stellar realm, or sadly wrapping hurriedly to a finale. If the writers follow the concept of a person evolving recall through concerted interaction, this can be a winner. The shift from mecha to meeting spaces can be jarring and a bit confusing at first, but the idea of virtual space and displaced personalities is kinda cool.Interestingly, this series reminds me of Bodacious Space Pirates. While ignoring the obvious similarities, one can see the camaraderie. Building trust within a confined environment as time passes and challenges build. I like this show.

Initially I did not plan to watch the show due to ts low ratings on this website, but I had already watched all the ""good rated"" shows this season  and couldn\'t find any other, so I thought of giving it a try.Story: There is a lot of story progression already in the first six episodes and none of the episodes dawdle on one concept too long. Also, nothing looks forced as new concepts are introduced to the viewers. In short, the story is fast paced and takes you for the ride.Art: CG or whatnot,...the art is incredibly good. Although you can see the CG effects in Kado too, I have heard of complaints in this anime only. Opposed to Kado, you don\'t notice the CG affects as much due to wonderful work by the CG director and also due to ROBOTS (no spoiler as promised)Sound: Sound is so-so but as mystery elements are introduced (shh...no spoilers! no spoilers I say!), the track variation is introduced and it produces some magical effects in the brain.Character: The story has focused on currently two major characters (or three I should say) and the story also revolves around them. Since these are only six episodes and if you consider the time it took to build up the plot in episode 1, they have done a good job in five episodes. I love the characters and their interaction and how each of them are handling their circumstances. Still characters have predictable actions on how they would react except one. They have been molded into those personifications. If the show breaks through these lines (which is very difficult as story progresses), I would say this can become a great show.Enjoyment: This can\'t be explained! If you view objectively, my ratings haven\'t been that good except the story part but due to this being carrying the most weight in my judgement, if a show gets this right, it can become a fantastic show. Till now, it has been able to hit all the right spots in my enjoyment circuitry and I consider it 9!So, that\'s my review. As before, I don\'t want others to watch only for better ratings. It was my honest review for a good show. Considering that even a show with no plot development can get better ratings than this, it seriously doesn\'t deserve a rating this low!

Their development throughout the series is heartwarming to watch, and ultimately they have to make some hard choices.I will admit that it's been quite a while since I watched this series, but I still remember it fondly even a few years later.  If you're looking for some light mecha to...fill up a weekend netflix binge, you could do a lot worse than ID-0. fill up a weekend netflix binge, you could do a lot worse than ID-0."", ""Warning possible SpoilersConsidering I had just watched Knight's and Magic before going into this, I didn't have a good feeling about ID-0, luckily it wasn't that bad and still had some good points, but it still had some bad points too.Story (6/10)ID-0's story, mainly concentrates on Ido, who is trying to find out who he really is, since he has no memory from before he became an I-machine, luckily he has a rag tag crew to help him out.The story starts off a little slow, it takes time to introduce the characters, but it starts shifting into gear once you reach episode 4 or 5...when Ido finally finds a clue to his past.However, when the story started to get more serious, it just wasn't getting to me, even when a bunch of random planets made out of orichalt came to destroy Earth and humanity, I still wasn't moved.I think it was mostly to do with the pacing, because I felt like the story moved too quickly and it could've been like Cowboy Bebop where it has 20+ episodes instead of the usual 12 episodes, which could've offered us more development for the characters and I think a few needed that development.Also the ending was pretty lackluster too, it felt really rushed as you see the good guys win and then you suddenly see an aftermath montage, followed by the crew heading to another asteroid to mine it, the ending just didn't feel right at all to me.That being said the story wasn't a complete mess, the journey Ido and the others had to take was an interesting one and was probably the main reason why I didn't drop the show, because I kept wondering if Ido would actually find out who he really is and the outcome was pretty surprising....well sorta.Characters (7/10)The characters were definitely the best part of the show, even though a few could've benefited from having some develop time, the others who did get more concentration managed to keep the show rolling for me.Ido is the prime MC of the show, Ido is a mysterious fellow and seeing him trying to figure out who he really is was pretty interesting, despite looking like someone who would be cold and detached from the rest of the group, he is actually very concerned for the other crew members and is willing to sacrifice a part or two for them.Maya Mikuri is the female MC, she is rescued by the other characters after an excavation goes wrong and has to unwillingly join them, even though she was a smart character and a big help for the others, she kinda annoyed me a few times in some of the arguments she had with the others and the fact her constant worrying didn't help either.Alice is another female character that the crew picks up along the way, despite being a main character, she really doesn't serve much purpose other than being a story device to keep things rolling, because all she does is either laugh or cry, which made her character seem more of a nuisance to me really.Clair Honjou is the pilot and the daughter of the ships captain, she is yet again another character who doesn't offer that much to the show, other than her piloting expertise she's pretty much just there, most likely so that Maya didn't feel like the only human character in the crew.Rick Ayer, Grayman, Karla and Fa-loser are the main crew members of the ship and only have their I-machine bodies, Grayman is the captain of the ship, yet his human form looked kinda similar to Dutch from Black Lagoon, just without the glasses, he seemed like a character that wasn't easy to get along with, since most of the time he either got into arguments with Maya or just made ridiculous ideas so their could run away, so there didn't seem much to like his character overall.Karla is another female character who is kinda in the same predicament as Ido, except she's only trying to find her body, which is being held captive, she is alright for a character as she is used for information gathering and sometimes making the odd joke here and there making her character surprising sometimes.Rick was probably my favourite character from the show, his joker personality made him seem like an asshole, but his personality and jokes were definitely one of the best parts of the show, especially considering when he is trying to flirt with one of the characters, which doesn't go very well, often had me smiling or giving a good chuckle from time to time.Fa-Loser is actually an animal that used to be experimented on before becoming an I-machine, however this dude is just there to make stupid noises and biting Rick.Amanza Volchkova is part of the military and after having a run in with the crew, she had to end up joining them because she had no choice, for a character she was actually pretty good, despite being pretty cold hearted, her character grew slowly over time as she got to know the other crew members better, especially Rick who kept hounding her with his affection.Art (6/10)CGI has always been a little difficult for me to handle, although there are some anime's that have managed to pull it off, this one however is sorta mixed for me really, because the I-machines fitted this aspect very well and looked great too, however seeing the human characters in this format just didn't look right and to be honest this may sound wrong, it made me feel like I was watching RWBY at some points the characters felt that off.The design of the ships, planets and scenery was done pretty good too, although the CGI for the asteroids looked pretty damn bad.Sound (5/10)The op, ed and soundtrack I didn't specifically like, it just didn't match what was going on, well sorta, the soundtrack did have a few good moments here and there, but the thing that impressed me the most sometimes is when some parts of the crews ship didn't make a sound when something was activating I thought it was a good attention to detail, since there isn't any sound in space, until you hear a missile go off or something, which just ruins the moment.Enjoyment (6/10)Overall (6/10)Overall this was another mecha series that you either hate or like and for me it was a mixture of both, you can try it out for yourself, just don't expect something amazing to happen while watching it. when Ido finally finds a clue to his

and only now I decided to watch again, this time in English. So, after 4 years, does ID-0 still hold up? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryID-0 combines the mecha genre with excavation and space exploration, which is something I haven\'t seen that much in anime. The fascinating element (no pun intended) for this premise is orichalt, a mysterious mineral that allows for faster-than-light travel, kinda like dilithium from Star Trek. What begins as a simple episodic story about miners and excavators suddenly transforms into a series of mysteries, spatial anomalies and...lost identities and I loved how the show was able to handle these themes.I also loved the balance of comedy and drama in this show. The two tones are in almost perfect synchronization with each other, rarely stepping into each other\'s toes. The show isn\'t lacking in action, either with cool scenes, you would expect from a show about giant robots. (7/10)CharactersI really like Ido, he\'s a very interesting protagonist. While I normally would have dismissed him for falling into the trend of being a ""silent and stoic archetype"", Ido is far more talkative and sarcastic than you would expect him to be. A crucial element of his character development is his quest for identity. Ido doesn\'t know who he is and he is dedicated to his job because it\'s the only thing he has left, but once a clue to his former life presents itself, he quickly takes it.Maya also serves the perfect role of the viewpoint character. This is Ido\'s story, but Maya is the everygirl of the show, the character we\'re supposed to relate to the most or the easiest. She experiences much of the ID-0 universe for the first time and ends up asking the questions we ourselves would ask if we found ourselves in those exact same situations. Like I said before, this is Ido\'s story, but we see it through Maya\'s eyes.The show is also filled to the brim with interesting personalities, like the speed-obsessed Rick, the serious boss Grayman and the intelligence officer Claire. Still, if I had to choose I favorite, outside Ido and Maya, of course, it would be Karla. She acts as the motherly figure of the group, preventing any conflicts between them. She also finds herself in a similar situation to that of Ido, but she gets luckier than him. Just watch the show and you\'ll see what I mean. (8/10)ArtSay what you will about ID-0, but you can\'t deny the visual effects are amazing. Everything, from the mecha designs to fight scenes, is beautifully animated. It\'s very difficult to render humans in CGI with the style of an anime, but I think ID-0 did a pretty good job at that. (8/10)SoundsThe opening song is amazing, I\'ve listened to it quite a few times now, but the closing song is so cheesy and it\'s hard for me to take it seriously. The background music is good, especially the music for the previews.The vocal performances, both in Japanese and English were incredible. Both Kazuyuki Okitsu and Todd Haberkorn did a fine job as Ido, especially Todd, whose voice was modulated in order to deliver the impression that he was really a machine. I\'m not familiar with the career of Minami Tsuda (Maya), and this was my first time watching her in an anime with a major role.The Japanese version is filled to the brim with all-star voice actors like Sayaka Ohara (Karla), Takehito Koyasu (Adams), Rikiya Koyama (Grayman) and the very talented Kikuko Inoue (Jennifer). The English version also features powerhouses like Cherami Leigh (Maya), Keith Silverstein (Grayman) and Christine Marie Cabanos (Claire). Still, if I had to pick a favorite performance, I\'d pick Cristina Valuenzuela (Karla), who is quickly becoming one of my favorite VAs in the business. (9/10).ConclusionID-0 is the true definition of a diamond in the rough. It\'s got mecha action, overarching mysteries, space exploration and cool music. Anyone who actually gives this show a chance instead of automatically dismissing it for being a Netfli show will be in for a fun time.

Here are my thoughts:ID-0 is about a naive astrogeologist girl and a group of space bandits, some of whom are minds trapped inside robot bodies, who engage in illegal space mining. Things go wrong during one of their illicit excavations and the plot spirals from there. All the characters have unique personalities and I enjoyed the chemistry of this motley crew working together.This show is actual genuine science fiction and frequently invokes intriguing sci-fi concepts such as digital consciousness, robotics and cloning. The story is interesting and engaging; it incorporates mystery elements well and does a good job of 'peeling back the...onion' as the plot progresses. As a whole, ID-0 is quite creative and unique; it feels like a hobby project moreso than a commercial anime.ID-0 also seems to have a budget as low as a hobby project. All of the character animation is CGI, but it doesn't look completely awful and I didn't find the faces to be uncanny or unsettling in ways I've experienced with CGI animation in the past. A lot of the celestial landscapes are cool and the show looks best when it is depicting spaceships, planets and things of that nature. Although they are infrequent, the action scenes in this, especially the space battles, are actually quite entertaining; the CGI looks nice and dynamic. There are also lots of awesome spaceships, and the celestial environment is a nice backdrop. I couldn't help but laugh at the space motorbikes with the decorative-flames paintjobs – they fit the mood of the anime well. In some ways, ID-0 is metal as fuck but also doesn't take itself too seriously; it's a really fun ride overall.The soundtrack is somewhat unconventional but fits the atmosphere of the show. The OP/ED songs are endearingly cheesy. I liked the voice acting for Grayman and Rick.My overall rating: 7/10ID-0 is an endearing passion project with a unique intriguing story, fun likeable cast, and lots of cool creative sci-fi stuff mainly relating to space, robotics, consciousness, physics and the like. If you can overlook its janky visuals, ID-0 is a great sci-fi show.If you're a fan of actual science fiction (i.e. not space romcoms) then you would likely appreciate this show.

This prevents me from scoring it the full 10 points but I have to say it still came really close and is worth seeing.The pacing is great, with every episode clearly focused on and adding to the main story, the twists keeping you hooked and wanting for more. Once you start it, you'll probably want to binge it in one sitting. It is the furthest thing from an episodic stand alone missions in space show that...you can get in and out of at leisure, in case you happen to expect that for some reason.Sci-Fi and tech singularity fans will be delighted. Dumb action and giant-ninja-robot fans will find something for themselves too, but may end up disappointed if they fail to get the bigger picture. you can get in and out of at leisure, in case you happen to expect that for some reason.Sci-Fi and tech singularity fans will be delighted.

IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1409/IGPX__Immortal_Grand_Prix,"[""Given that there's only about 23 mins to this Micro series across 5 episodes i'm not really taking pacing into consideration. I rated this purely off of proof of concept and what was achieved in the allotted amount of time. I remember seeing this on Toonami when i was about 11 years old and was taken aback by how cool it seemed. After viewing this it left me with a longing for more as it wasn't able to be properly wrapped up. We were then given news that a full series was being adapted due to this micro series success but unfortunately we were met...with the disappointment that they drastically altered the entire premise of IGPX and turned it into nothing more than a racing anime i.e. Robot Nascar. Now the full series wasn't awful but it was nothing compared to this micro series which was significantly better in character designs and personalities as well as overall premise and art style. Forever wishing this to be adapted into a proper full series, perhaps Netflix will pick it up one day as they seem to adapt obscure older anime that we've long since forgotten. Overall i give this a 10/10 for the Nostalgia but critically maybe a 7 due to its limitations of being a micro series. with the disappointment that they drastically altered the entire premise of IGPX and turned it into nothing more than a racing anime i.e. Robot Nascar.

The story they tell in 25 minutes or so is amazing and I wished that this type of writing was still done. It gets you so invested in less than half an hour. They even get you to ship the two evil characters. All the characters are unique and each has their own little quirk that makes them memorable. It's too bad that the second season didn't follow the original story because it would've been iconic. All they had to do was continue from where this season left off.

We inquire, then we are looking for an answer. This is our nature, this is how humanity manages to have absolute control over the planet.Spoilers start hereHave we made a good effort so...far? The only thing that is for sure, is that we have been trying our best. But have we reduced the number of our needs and questions? Are we able to hypnotize our existential crises, or maybe find the answer we\'re looking for?

Dog\'s nature is easily comprehensible, even to a child. Dogs are one of the simplest creatures; once you approach them with good intentions, play with them or feed them, they will give their heart to you. They are a mirror of your intentions and emotions. And that\'s the most common reason people adopt dogs, in order to have a guaranteed friend for many years who\'ll remind them to smile. Most of us find them dumb, and some of their actions funny or disgusting. But, in its ""dumbness"", once a dog fulfills his temporary need, he\'s happy. And its happiness is something fundamental many of us are lacking.In our story, the main protagonist is a common dog who wakes up and takes a walk in the city. He\'s just a dog fooling around with balls, drinking water from the ground and searching for company.During his walk, our protagonist spots crows, on the top of a tank-like vehicle. Crows symbolize transformation and change. The city is deserted. What happened to us human beings? Shortly afterwards, the question is answered.The dog encounters a humanoid robot.

Then, our friend continues its journey, lonely, strolling down the road.ConclusionThe humanoid robot symbolizes humanity\'s whereabouts if we only cared about  power, status, solving the unsolvable. Taking into account wars, egoism, greed and technological evolution just for our own convenience while harming the environment, becoming the robot is just a step further from our current situation.""I can\'t live without love, and there is no reason to live without love.""Satellite of Love / Glay (insert song)On the other hand, ""Je t\'aime"" (I love you) are the words the dog wants to say and hear. Though, this short film does not concern dogs, but people. This dog is humanity\'s hope for kindness, love and peaceful coexistence. But dogs are like mirrors, aren\'t they? If you treat your fellow man badly, it means you self-destruct.In the end, the ""dumb"" dog\'s pure heart won the fight, while the humanoid robot self-destructed.There are some things we cannot avoid to evolve mankind, but if we forget the true meaning of life, the little things that make us happy and mentally healthy, our future will not be bright. Try your best and say ""Je t\'aime"" more often. To your friends, to your family, to the world.', ""Note: Forgive me if I miss some parts or forgot to mention something. I saw it on premiere in an animation festival, so I can't rewatch it.Je t'aime is a fairly enjoyable short, but don't expect groundbreaking story mechanics of any sorts.The concept is relatively simple. Situated in a ghost town, there resides a dog that's aching for contact with another living entitiy. This is very obvious: the dog roams the streets without other living soul, and just wanders around with no purpose. These particular scenes would also show off how refined the backgrounds are.What I love about this movie is the stark contrast between...the two main characters; it's some sort of a modern approach to the beauty and the beast. It wouldn't be anime if it isn't put in an extreme way (one you would only expect from anime). One protagonist is an android, the other one is just a mere animal. And that's the premise of this whole story. As a viewer, you simply can't help but to empathize with this lonely dog.The music could be considered a minus. It's your good old melodramatic love song. When I watched the screening in the cinema, the western crowd -that most certainly isn't used to anime- burst into laughter. The reason is probably because it sounded so kitsch. I've personally never realized that before, due to the fact that anime is full of kitsch moments like that. But one thing is for sure. That incident did make me realize one thing: the fact that I'm used to it, means that this song most certainly isn't original. Maybe it's a bad thing, maybe it's a good thing. But it also means that it wasn't anything peculiar at all.Overall, I did enjoy a few aspects of this movie. The weird relationship between the two protagonists was touching. Other things like the detailed environment that set the mood, and the surprising plot made this anime somewhat memorable. the two main characters; it's some sort of a modern approach to the beauty and the beast.

And then it just loses me completely.Obnoxious musical stings and heavy soundtrack that do not belong in this story kick in and we encounter a humanoid. And, a contrived, silly message with it. (Probably.)Why was it done this way??You had a phenomenal premise, you could've done so much with it! A lonely dog's point of view after the rapture or apocalypse. Painting strong feelings of despair, fragility and cruelness of nature.

I don\'t know where it can be seen otherwise.All in all, it\'s an ovni in anime world. The story here is really simple. It is about a lonely dog who desperately wants to find someone to play ball with. You see him wander thoughout a desterted Tokyo, and there are hints that something terrible has happened not so long ago. Probably an idea of the end of the world.His day by day wanderings, on a music by Glay, leads him to meet some automated android, which purpose is unknow.Even though it\'s rather simple, it looks more like something you could...find in short movies. It\'s only 10 minutes long, but it\'s a really nice experience. The animation, direction, music, the way this lonely dog is presented, ... everything makes for a touching little story. What really happened? Even though there are some hints here and there, you will find no answer, and it\'s not the purpose anyway. The whole thing looks like someone suddenly found the urge to make a short movie about a lonely dog in a post apocalyptic world. It\'s not much more than a whim. But that\'s probably why somehow, you can feel love in the work.10 minutes is not long. I would recommend you to give it a try. There are definitely worse ways to spend 10 minutes of one\'s life. But don\'t expect me to explain why this is called ""Je t\'aime"". I guess it\'s one more occurence of my mother tongue being used and abused for some weird reason i can\'t get at all.

Although i personally watch happy films. Sadly, this one is a sad one. A mutt's travel through life with no friends. It really was heart breaking. The beginning and ending is never really explained. I will assume that for what ever reason human life could not function in that town and had to go. Animals like the dog and birds could so stayed.

And sometimes I think to myself, what would the dog do if it were free? They don\'t have the intelligence of a human being, but I still wonder if the dog would rather be free or if the dog would stick to its owner. I would assume the latter given what I have heard about the psychology of a dog, although I don\'t recommend you quote me, given how unreliable I am. Je T\'aime acts as a little reminder to that question as an answer for it; dogs want to be loved. That is all there is. As intelligent beings, we can think about stuff on an unbelievable large number of levels, and we do that every day too. Conspiracy theories, predictions, the meaning of life, whatever requires thought. But simple things like simple feelings probably don\'t get the attention that is shown here. For sure they are thought about a lot, probably more than anything deemed intellectual, but it isn\'t glorified. To be fair, there aren\'t many reasons to glorify them, as they are simply feelings, but they exist nonetheless. And as said, Je T\'aime is that reminder. A simple reminder for such a fact.The narrative is straight forward, there is a lone dog in a humanless world, just wants someone to play with, but that isn\'t possible. However, across the journey of the dog, it encounters a robot. Tries to play with that robot but all efforts come to null. You see, the dog is a simple being, the robot isn\'t. It plays well as an analogy of our mind. We have the simple parts, we have the complex parts. Everything about the characters correlates well in how we behave. The dog just wants to play, literally nothing else that isn\'t food, water, shelter or safety. The robot seems to have a mission, with its constant outgoings, it also has many complexities that I wouldn\'t be surprised about which went through a ton of thought and calculations behind it. But there it is, we think too much sometimes, even I find myself in a state where I think too much. Simple thinking isn\'t a bad thing. Je T\'aime shows that we need simple thinking for our minds, balance it out with complex thinking, I mean, the robot could have been programmed to play with dogs, then there would be a complex and simple union, something that probably wouldn\'t have been disliked as much as the war machine that is the robot. It is such a simple theme in an intrinsic state, probably because it may be looked over since what may first come to mind is the loneliness of a dog. Which makes this review ironic, given how deep I looked into this. The loneliness of the dog has a nice little connection to the freedom of a dog I was on about though. If that were us, we would be doing the same thing. We would be the dog, maybe in a more peril state, but if we managed, we would want the lovely things your current life may give to you. In other words, the simple things.Audiovisuals side of things, it was pretty well made for something out of 2010, fluid animation and what have you are present here. Visuals didn\'t get me as much as the soundtracks though. Given that this is my second time watching this, it has become more memorable, but I would imagine that even watching this the first time would still have some kind of impact on someone watching this. There were about 3 different sounds here iirc, all of which are very well made.Enjoyment wise, I am usually a logical, but simple thinker, in other words, the asshole of the story, and whilst the message still came across me, it was merely just a message, the entire short feels like one message to humanity. I won\'t lie, it was fun to deconstruct what is being given, but whilst viewing it, I can\'t exactly say it was the most entertaining thing in the world. Universal enjoyment might be different, shorts have this unique power to say a lot in a small amount of time. So you may enjoy this quite a bit.Overall - 7.4 (7)Never have I been so conflicted to give an anime a score, I would love to give this an overall of an 8 but the absolute score came out differently. Heh. In any case, MAL has this random tendency to bomb anime like so. As of now, Je T\'aime has a score of 6.57. I would say that is too low for such but people don\'t like short things, maybe they have forgotten about the simple things. I wouldn\'t know. But what I do know is that I would recommend Je T\'aime. I would imagine it will stay in your memories for days to come but otherwise, it is just one of those shorts that pull your heartstrings, it does that, but not in some dramatic flimsy manner. I had respect for its audience. And so I leave you with my interpretation of the dog\'s thoughts: ""I just want to play some ball y\'know.""

Just with some fantasy and isekai aspect.TLDR here's the recommendation: If you like slice of life with full on brain dead comedy anime, this is for you. If you come for an action pack with adventuring and drama, this isn't for youIts just another standard generic isekai.But for some reason, this one just have some family flair to it that is very enjoyable.There's no real harm nor action in this anime, and mostly just about the mc with his adoptive family in the countryside, with some occasion for the mc to show off his power.There's...also several classic and modern anime reference, and also many parody to animes style and genre. Most of the comedy do hit if you know the reference, and is just a fun and relaxing show to watch.In term of quality, I would say it's definitely average isekai quality. With mid pictures, OST, and characters and story. Nothing to add much really.In conclusion, its a fun isekai, which is actually a slice of life comedy in disguise. The quality is average for the isekai genre, but the comedy and characters interaction is somewhat fun to a degree and just a good show to past time on with no headaches. also several classic and modern anime reference, and also many parody to animes style and genre.

All the usual tropes you can think of, of a typical run of the mill isekai is more or less present here. So there is hardly anything worthwhile to talk about.Characters: Think something like the last five seasonal isekai you've seen. Now try to remember the characters. They are here as well, just with their names altered.Animation: As average isekais go, this is no different. Don't expect anything too...good, neither too bad, and you're set.Music: As generic isekais go, so goes this.Enjoyment: If you're an enjoyer of isekais, here is another one for you. If you're not, I'm afraid there is little to change your mind here. And if you happen to be the kind of individual who is wondering what the word Isekai means, you'd be happy to know it means mass debaters. good, neither too bad, and you're set.Music: As generic isekais go, so goes this.Enjoyment: If you're an enjoyer of isekais, here is another one for you.

Oh, I know! Let\'s change it up to an OP MC who, for all intents and purposes, wants to be a NEET and spread the Otaku love so that he does not need to get involved with all of the usual kingdom political bootlicking and BS? That\'ll be good.""If you ask me, we\'ve gotten used to the same old, tried-and-true Isekai reincarnation shitshows that have come out every season that try to sell their ""differing"" narratives for years now. But to bet on what is ""actually"" good (though ""good"" is calling it a bit of a...stretch here), it\'s no longer the premise nor its setting, but how it\'s executed, and for one certain author by the name of Sai Sumimori, the work-turned-anime that is Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita? a.k.a Am I Actually the Strongest?, has some peculiarities that make it stand out, though in my opinion, in a good way.A NEET in his real life to then only be reincarnated in another world where he wants to continue lavishing his NEET lifestyle — this is the crux objective for Haruto Zenfis. As a baby, once abandoned by the family he came from, he was adopted by a lowly family simply because he didn\'t fit the usual kingdom requirement of competent magical abilities. That, and how his magic was measured, meant that due to some faulty assessment, he was deemed a failure, but in retrospect, he\'s the same OP-ness of an MC, and of course, how would people know unless he unleashed this exact power? So then, the lowly Zenfis family accepted him into their household, where, as Haruto grows up, he just wants a life of relaxation and navigates all troubles to ensure he maintains his NEET lifestyle. And in this case, it kind of feels refreshing that the typical OP MC is not summoned and tasked to defeating some Demon Lord or King by gathering a dream team of a harem party and growing stronger; we don\'t need crap like that.I\'ve got to say that Haruto is an unhinged character. Aside from his usual typical OP stuff that he has magic powers to prove, all he wants to do is lie on the bed, read manga, and laze in the house day in and day out. Whoever the characters that come popping into his life, from the young female Fenrir of Flay, who, because of her tendency to go ham, Haruto essentially has to treat her like a dog; to his own adopted lil\' sister of Charlotte, who, despite her young age, is quite the intelligent and curious child that finds her adopted older brother being somewhat of an oddity. Even worse, because of Haruto\'s tendency for the NEET life, he introduces her to the otherworldly magic called the internet, and soon, she becomes the anime otaku chuunibyou to gather like-minded people and perform acts that only anime can do. Char\'s love for Haruto may be there, but her dedication to anime is just so over-the-top that in regard to Haruto clearing out the usual ""big bad"" trash, he has to brandish himself as the mysterious Dark Knight hero from time to time, which, if you know that design, good on you. The way that Haruto ""obtains"" his harem group may look like one, but it\'s a helper team that involves Char, Flay, and yet another blue dragon who has a NEET life like Haruto, for which he gave her the name Liza. And that\'s what I like about the characters here: they may be so much like the typical people who adore Haruto (and I\'m not gonna lie, they do), but they are saved out of necessity because of the common inklings towards him, which, take it or leave it, is a recipe for madness...in a rather comical way.This is Staple Entertainment\'s 2nd full-fledged series, and it doesn\'t look all that different from the newbie studio\'s debut work of last Summer\'s Kinsou no Vermeil a.k.a Vermeil in Gold in regard to animation quality. It\'s just decent and nothing noteworthy, despite the fact that the anime is actually following the manga adaptation of the LN to almost a 1-to-1 degree.

But I oblige to argue, because this is a show that\'s not meant to be taken seriously (hence the ""comedy is subjective"" argument) and watching Haruto\'s exploits for the Otaku NEET lifestyle and how hard he tries to avoid stepping out of the house gives me the chuckles for a show that has no right to be this good.Yeah, it\'s an average, typical Isekai, but a fun comedy gag-infused reference to pass the time. stretch here), it\'s no longer the premise nor its setting, but how it\'s executed, and for one certain author by the name of Sai Sumimori, the work-turned-anime that is Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita? a.k.a Am I Actually the Strongest?, has some peculiarities that make it stand out, though in my opinion, in a good way.A NEET in his real life to then only be reincarnated in another world where he wants to continue lavishing his NEET lifestyle — this is the crux objective for Haruto Zenfis.

The MC has no need for any sense of battle struggle which leaves a very empty feeling in what they call a fight scene - which really just looks like him kicking around dolls.The worst thing about it is his powers actually make no sense. This is especially true with the thoughtless attempt from the writers at adding in technology. His magic is barriers but he creates robots and tv?? Yes...really.Aside from the awful ability management the characters aren’t actually all too bad unfortunately… I mean they seem enjoyable and likeable personality wise, just badly written because of a surface level backstory.The writing to add to this is a bit sus and very odd. I mean it’s neither bad nor good, just some out of place and potentially tasteless humour.

If you’ve seen it once you’ve seen it a thousand times.Well, that's not quite accurate. Haruto may have formally been a worthless shut-in who died alone in his bedroom playing a shitty mobile game, but now that he's reincarnated in a fantastical world with enough magic power...to 1v1 Goku, all he wants to do is… be a worthless shut-in… again.After reincarnating as the baby of a generic fantasy royal family, he is quickly thrown out being seen as worthless because the appraisal orb couldn’t accurately read his stats properly or… something. Afterwards, he, a baby, fights a demon dog who becomes submissive to him, a baby and asks him, a literal baby, to have sex with her so she can produce for him, a literal baby, milk from her mommy-milkers. Luckily before the anime steps into criminal territory, Haruto is adopted by his uncle who raises him like a son surrounded by a loving family, and in return for such kindness, he learns how to create a perfect clone of himself so it can live out his boring aristocratic lifestyle for him whilst he stays in his room and watches anime using his magic which can connect to the internet in Japan… somehow.So yeah, the MC is worthless. The only likeable thing in this anime is his little sister, Charlotte who is admittedly very adorable and must be protected at all costs which he begrudgingly does. Not because he doesn’t like her, far from it. He's just lazy and doesn’t want to do anything. This does result in him poisoning her brain by introducing her to anime, specifically magical girl anime to try to get her off his back, but it results in her forcing him to dress up in bad Code Geass cosplay so she can watch him beat up bandits for her entertainment, which is admittedly funny, but the animation quality is so cheap it becomes less fun than it sounds.Honestly, this anime is trash. it goes from zero to baby-fucking and titty-sucking in the first ten minutes and although the story threatens to get more interesting with conspiracies, it’s hardly worth to effort of getting through the first four episodes to watch whatever unfolds.

Despite not reaching the point of abandoning it, the plot and the main character contributed to a constant feeling of boredom. The protagonist, far from embodying the desired qualities in an isekai, seems to resent every aspect of the adventure, from fighting to simple work or study. The plot, which promised a lot with typical elements of reincarnation, broken powers, and difficult missions, failed to fulfill any of its promises.One of the few redeeming aspects was the occasional entertainment provided by images during pauses. However, the overall humor left much to be desired. Secondary characters, on the other hand, lacked...depth and did not contribute or detract from the overall experience.

There really isn’t an isekai I’m not a fan of, just to imagine yourself getting reincarnated into a world with a different start to life.

This an easy-going comedy first and foremost. Yes there are a lot of typical isekai\'d OP character tropes/clichés, and yes I would put this in the ""guilty pleasure"" category, but even so it does enough to differentiate it and get past being complete trash like other run-of-the-mill isekai\'s being released every season (Saikyou Onmyouji Isekai or Kuro no Shoukanshi for ex.). It\'s a non-serious, feel good type of anime that I definitely wouldn\'t mind an extra season of (gives me similar vibes to TsukiMichi but...more comedy, less action/harem focused).The MC/Haruto isn\'t your typical protag-kun, he\'s got some pre-reincarnation baggage (but it\'s glossed over like a lot of things) and therefore he\'s stuck in his slacker shut-in ways (he even says it\'s a goal to keep slacking off for his second life), but despite that he finds himself with a loving family that changes his core outlook by the end. He\'s not trying to save a kingdom or the world, just trying to do good by his adopted family and those close to him, thereby actually progressing as a character due to his interaction with the main cast.The true protag Charlotte wins best imouto of the year, I love every scene she\'s in, truly a precious gem to be protected for all eternity.. and MC feels the same way, using his OP-ness to shield her from any possible threat as well as simply doing his best to comply with her whims, both for entertainment and to fit her image of him as a secret hero of justice. So despite his apathy towards putting effort into anything, he\'d ultimately do what\'s necessary to protect his new family (he\'d probably whine a bit at first/afterward tho lol). He even gets genuinely mad enough to slaughter the people going after them, this guy takes no prisoners! (aside from one person he probably would\'ve taken out if it weren\'t for the circumstances). The rest of the cast each add their own uniqueness when interacting with MC or adding comedy along with Char. Its funny how he struggles to keep Flay on a leash and how lax/understanding the dad Gold is, pretty much accepting of everything while remaining a good dude/role model. I also enjoy how there\'s no real ecchi harem stuff going on, no unnecessary romantics, and almost everything is played for laughs.The power system/magic of the world even has some thought put into it, like how the ancient magic MC uses is non-elemental magic and therefore sits completely outside the range of any modern elemental magic reasoning, also somewhat explaining why mana levels have dropped with the mainstream adoption of elemental magics. It also gives sufficient leeway to MC\'s OP abilities and how it\'s practically impossible for anyone else to deal with. But they\'re also willing to gloss over things for the sake of comedy, like how the F does he have an active internet connection?.. well for the sake of turning Charlotte into a little otaku of course, taking her comedy to another level with all the chuuni naming and posing lol.As for the story/plot, there really isn\'t much here for that. It\'s just MC going through his newfound life meeting people/demons/monsters and experiencing situations that cause him to take some kind of action, ultimately adding to his character growth. So its pretty reactional as things go, but that\'s okay in my book since its a light-hearted comedy for the most part.Overall I gave it an 8, purely because I enjoyed it that much (7/8 of those points go to most adorable imouto Charlotte BTW). The MC starts out as selfish lazy bum but due to the caring environment he finds himself in, even he notices himself changing for the better by the end (clone pun?). It\'s like he actually gained some insight and is now happily moving forward in his new life.. isn\'t that the whole point of a second chance isekai? This isn\'t a really serious anime anyway, things don\'t have to be so black and white.

The first two episodes served to establish the world and the backstory, and in my opinion, they did this task quite decently.However, I must say that from the third episode onwards, I noticed a significant decline in the storyline. The main character, Haruto, was the reason I started the anime in the first place, and it's unfortunate to see how he has developed. Even after his rebirth with incredible abilities and the highest magician level in this...world, his character has changed very little. His initial lack of ambition and unchanged behavior after rebirth are hard for me to understand. I would have expected him to evolve throughout the storyline or at least find an incentive to grow for himself and achieve something significant.If someone is mainly watching the anime because of an overpowered main character and expecting them to conquer the world or something similar, then I would advise against it.

I'd even go so far as to call it underrated.Animation / Art / General Visuals - 6/10-----------------------------------------------One has to be honest here, the show isn't impressive. The art style has a bit of a sloppy feel to it, which to be fair, is kinda endearing, but ultimately does scream low budget. The animations are similarly of low quality. The strongest point for the show are the character expressions, which get...to benefit from the lack of animations, as a still image of an expression conveys the emotions just fine. The MC's frustrated faces and the cutesy women are the high points.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10------------------------------------------Pretty standard anime stuff. Nothing noteworthy or particularly problematic.Story - 7/10-------------The story does not innovate or surprise in any way, but it is kinda fun and cute.Our MC that gets isekaid and given overwhelming powers, is a complete shut-in, so all he wants to do is absolutely nothing. So that is what the story revolves around. Around his attempts of shedding all obligations and doing jack-all, all day, every day.But nothing ever goes as planned. In his way is a dedicated follower, an overachiever of a little sister, high status, and loving parents. And his overwhelming power has made it all too easy to warp the world around him in ways that inevitably lead to him getting involved in more and more annoying things.It's honestly kinda fun to watch him struggle to sleep all day, as things keep happening that require his attention.The story spends most of its time in fantasy slice-of-life mode, though there is a decent amount of combat as well.The season concludes reasonably well, though it's clear that it is but an introduction to the full storyline.Characters - 7/10---------------------The characters are surprisingly fun. The MC is an absolute shut-in loser, but one that is just a right mix of kind-hearted, yet sufficiently merciless and vindictive to make use of the overwhelming powers he has been given. He is also surprisingly determined and goal oriented as far as chasing his dream of doing nothing is concerned.He is a bit of a dunce and socially inept, but a healthy dose of luck makes sure he always comes out on top.Secondary characters feature a subservient demon impressed by his powers.

Loving parents, a rival, and a few evil villains also make themselves known, but are quite sidelined.---Total - 7/10---Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita? is an enjoyable little show for Overpowered MC Isekai fans. It doesn't really break any new ground or stand out particularly much in any way. But it nails just enough of the fundamentals to bring enjoyment. to benefit from the lack of animations, as a still image of an expression conveys the emotions just fine. The MC's frustrated faces and the cutesy women are the high points.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10------------------------------------------Pretty standard anime stuff. Nothing noteworthy or particularly problematic.Story - 7/10-------------The story does not innovate or surprise in any way, but it is kinda fun and cute.Our MC that gets isekaid and given overwhelming powers, is a complete shut-in, so all he wants to do is absolutely nothing. So that is what the story revolves around. Around his attempts of shedding all obligations and doing jack-all, all day, every day.But nothing ever goes as planned. In his way is a dedicated follower, an overachiever of a little sister, high status, and loving parents. And his overwhelming power has made it all too easy to warp the world around him in ways that inevitably lead to him getting involved in more and more annoying things.It's honestly kinda fun to watch him struggle to sleep all day, as things keep happening that require his attention.The story spends most of its time in fantasy slice-of-life mode, though there is a decent amount of combat as well.The season concludes reasonably well, though it's clear that it is but an introduction to the full storyline.Characters - 7/10---------------------The characters are surprisingly fun. The MC is an absolute shut-in loser, but one that is just a right mix of kind-hearted, yet sufficiently merciless and vindictive to make use of the overwhelming powers he has been given. He is also surprisingly determined and goal oriented as far as chasing his dream of doing nothing is concerned.He is a bit of a dunce and socially inept, but a healthy dose of luck makes sure he always comes out on top.Secondary characters feature a subservient demon impressed by his powers. Strong, but a total Pon. Lacking any real ability other that combat skills. A little sister who is both a genius and a super clingy child who is star struck by her older brother's amazing powers.

Since there are so many Isekai out there, consider my grade mostly a comparison to other Isekai.It's power fantasy Isekai where the main character is strong from day 1, where the main character starts off as a baby instead of being plopped into a new body that's already grown, that takes itself at least a little seriously and has some good character interactions, and doesn't have RPG mechanics.Frankly I'm just happy to have another Isekai that doesn't have RPG mechanics in the world building. I always tend to like those...more.As far as Isekai goes, I think this is good, but not great.

He is of course forced to use his powers to protect the lifestyle he so desperately wants, which slowly makes him realize that he might not be...as weak as he thought.The plot and characters are pretty generic and are not that deep, it is more relying on its simplicity and humor.

Despite being a common archetype of the modern day medieval isekai trope, this series is no different in comparison; It lacks many things including character depth thanks to its cheap instant gratification.Art & Sound: 6/10The art and animation isn’t bad or ground-breaking, there is definitely some effort in terms of the animation for vectors and combat.

Overall, enjoyed it for what it was but don’t see much potential for it getting deeper into the lore and characters.', ""The storyline is very normal and already on the market.There's nothing new in my opinion here, this is just an Isekai anime with copy paste from other Isekai.The first thing that is very common is that MCs are unemployed, NEET, Hikikomori, or something like that, I like to wonder why unemployed people like this can suddenly go to Isekai and live a good life?You could say this is just a trick, and don't expect you to be like the MC in this anime.The second thing is the stupidity of the goddess who sent him to Isekai, I'm also surprised by this, how come she has...the name of Goddess but can make mistakes like this, MC was sent to Isekai with super powers, but stupidly didn't take it into account the strength meter there is not equivalent.Basically this is just a man-made Goddess, not a real Goddess who should never make mistakes.The third thing, the use of Square Magic, and I think this is a plagiarism from the Anime Kekkaishi, you can see it if you want! Even though the way it is used is different and too versatile, I still think this is plagiarism.The fourth thing, the comedy looks forced, unnatural and not at all funny.The fifth thing, the earliest story is that MC's parents quickly abandoned their child, citing low strength,Even though at the beginning They  was very happy with the stupid comedy.In closing, for those of you who are watching the Isekai theme for the first time, maybe it's something new, but not for us, who have been watching various Isekai-themed anime for a long time, we will definitely feel bored, especially with a general storyline like this. the name of Goddess but can make mistakes like this, MC was sent to Isekai with super powers, but stupidly didn't take it into account the strength meter there is not equivalent.Basically this is just a man-made Goddess, not a real Goddess who should never make mistakes.The third thing, the use of Square Magic, and I think this is a plagiarism from the Anime Kekkaishi, you can see it if you want!

I try to not spoil anything in it, because in the case I want to rewatch the show, I don\'t want to know too much about it other than what I think I will remember or surface level details that don\'t really matter much. I just want to make sure my future self understands a bit of how I felt about it and why I gave this mark.Review start:Two words: thrash isekai. Surprised, aren\'t you? No? Okay, I wasn\'t as well. I knew what I would get myself into by...the ratio of recommended and not recommended reviews and the mark... And I kinda share the same sentiment. I did finish it, so... yea... It is a thrash isekai, alright? BUT, it has one redeeming quality: it knows that and tries to make fun of that. Does it do well tho? Uhh... yea, I would call it hit or miss here. The MC realizes the cliches and stuff, but that really doesn\'t mean that he does much about them than pointing them out mostly and going with them. But it is a nice touch I guess. Also, the number of references to other animes... and the blatant copy and usage of them is... maybe funny to some.... Still had enough fun to finish it, so there is that.Story: 7What story? Brother reincarnated that is OP af and has a lil sister that he loves a lot and does whatever she wishes? And he keeps getting caught up in situations because he cannot say no? Even tho at each step he complains and wants to just be a shut in? And the story is something that when an event comes, right at the start, you can guess 90% of it? Yea, story.Art: 7Bro, pull down the damn lighting a few notch. For real though, I never seen an anime where I thought ""Man, why is everything so bring"", like you would do in photoshop on an image by increasing the contrast and such. Thank God that it wasn\'t in every scene... The art was okay overall, the fights, okay?. Nothing special in anything. Kinda weird character design, especially for the loli MC... idk, the eyes still put me off a bit...Music: 7Meh, generic OP and ED.Characters: 7Good characters? Character growth? Man, have you forgotten what this is? Thrash isekai. So yea, no wonder there isn\'t anything good when it comes to characters. There was one character growth that I actually seen and was surprised, someone gets a macho body, but he appears for like a few scenes and nothing more. Side character. The rest? Yea, they remain the same... no changing... no backbone... no nothing. MC still complains a lot but he also goes ""I gotta do it"", loli sister is still loli sister even after time skips (???), and the dynamic seems to be stagnant, only the environment changes. And because they are so one dimensional, you can actually know what will kinda happen. There are some surprises tho, but not worth to balance it back up to an okayish verdict. And they pull a lot of stuff out of their asses when it comes to a lot of situations... especially powers... Oh, mb tho, there was some character development for MC, but it came so suddenly and so out of nowhere and right at the end that it caught me off guard... but it s at the end, so it doesn\'t matter cuz most likely no season 2.Enjoyment: 7Enjoyed it enough to finish it, but I will most likely won\'t rewatch it. I was kinda relieved when I finished it...Overall: 8Right now it has 6.51 from 65.018 votes Ranked #6643 Popularity #1610 Members 137,511. It is an okay mark in terms of mal marks. I gave it a 7 because on my list it is what it deserves. It didn\'t make me cringe much or anything and it was enjoyable enough to finish it. But in the end, it is just another thrash isekai that you should watch to pass time and not think much.

Somehow watching it faster makes the even the unfunniest of the jokes this show throws at you tolerable and depending on your state actually funny. There literally isn't anything else good about this god forsaken anime. The artstyle for some reason has unreasonably bright scenes likes it's a bit too vibrant flashback that doesn't end until your suffering of watching this anime does. The character designs are uninspired even for Isekai standarts and...impressively somehow the author managed to not make even one of the characters likeable(that amount of ass requires real talent). The main character is so boring his self-made clone has more character than him. You have all the basic Isekai cliches here like MC being insanely OP from the start, loli dragon, half-animal girl, and many others. If you watch it on 1.5 each episode takes a bit over 15 minutes but feels like the length of Zach Snyder's Justice League. If you watch it sober this anime is somehow boring and repulsive at the same time. I rate it 1.5 Serbian Films out of 1 on the watchability scale. impressively somehow the author managed to not make even one of the characters likeable(that amount of ass requires real talent).

I think a worm is more impressive in personality than this self-proclaimed shut-in.  The whole show is centered around this SUPER powered idiot that's so bored, even in his reincarnated life, that he's still bored, still WANTS to be...a shut-in, and is apathetic to the point you want him to just bury himself in a hole.

Jidou Hanbaiki ni Umarekawatta Ore wa Meikyuu wo Samayou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52619/Jidou_Hanbaiki_ni_Umarekawatta_Ore_wa_Meikyuu_wo_Samayou,"[""I'm very sad with the current adaptation of this series. I've read the original source material (the light novel) and it was very intriguing and informative as it actually delved into the history, costs, mechanism and detail of unique and unconventional vending machines around Japan.That was the CORE of what made the series fun to read in the first place, learning all about what the author went out and researched to share with the audience so that one day they themselves might have a chance to try it.They also completely skip over hakkon's inventory management/coin management details, how he gets his upgrades/when he upgraded (except...for that brief mention of him increasing his stats during bandit abduction). Every time he takes on a new form in the light novel it's an eye opening experience as it details why he allocated his precious coins into it, the where he tried this vending machine out, how people felt about it, and more.Unfortunately, the studio and people behind the anime adaptation decided to ignore all this and simply adapted it to another adventure Isekai. The lazy animation, lackluster detailing, cliche dialogue, and more were all non-existent in the source material. The studio butchers it so hard that half the time you don't even see the details of the actual vending machine he transforms into just a bright ass light covering everything.First time leaving a review on this site as this series left a terrible taste in my mouth as I continue giving it more chances hoping it will become something more than a disaster. for that brief mention of him increasing his stats during bandit abduction).

Or is it...that leave ones to ponder so much about.At this point, I\'m pretty sure that all of us know about the genre that has become the repetitive joke of the AniManga industry, with works written by more people thinking that they can bring something new to the table (a la Okashi no Tensei a.k.a Sweet Reincarnation) yet fall short when it comes to the overall plot, delivering the same major pitholes that plague many works like it. However, that\'s definitely not the case for novelist Hirukuma\'s Jidou Hanbaiki ni Umarekawatta Ore wa Meikyuu wo Samayou a.k.a Reborn as a...Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon, which is a work of pure art that delivers exactly what it brings to the masses: a typical Isekai, but one that\'s laden as an infomercial entertainment that is both fun and engaging.Even if you have not been to Japan before, like the majority of weebs on Earth, the Land of the Rising Sun, is a literate Otaku to these vending machines. Japan\'s obsession for vending machines is a real phenomenon that you can only experience there for yourself, as you can see at least a vending machine at every nook and cranny all over the huge lands and mountains serving more than the usual food and drinks, even Mount Fuji itself has some of them.Even more so, this is Hirukuma\'s wild rollercoaster of a story creating this work, which after losing his father from a workplace accident, he closed down the family business and turned to writing novels, which the Shousetsuka ni Narou a.k.a Syosetu website is the haven of any Japanese individuals looking to publish their stories of fiction. This, coupled with his father\'s death akin to giving him acrophobia a.k.a the fear of heights, with death constantly on Hirukuma\'s mind, he constantly thought of the things that he wanted to do before his death, and after unsuccessful attempts to break the mould, he created this work, which this final attempt was 4 years in the making, having described that ""[it was] one that was fantastical and original, and one that I wanted to write [...] This wasn\'t a novel where I adjusted for the readers\' needs, or had to think long and hard about constructing a plot. Instead, I pursued my own style for it, and it garnered the most popularity of all my work."" And despite the web novel, turned into the 3-volume LN that was the best of his abilities, I\'ve gotta say that this is one very unique Isekai that finally breaks the ever-so-mundane mould of the typical, boring, copy-paste premise that\'s actually worth more attention than we intitally give it for.For Hirukuma to develop a story out of Japan\'s insane likening to them, while it may be far from the very first AniManga to feature vending machines, it is the first to be used in an Isekai reincarnation setting. And while this concept absolutely works, it is accompanied by being a derivative of the usual cliche tropes found in Isekai: the reincarnated protagonist isn\'t an action hero, but rather a lead who distinguishes himself through clever use of commerce. And that lead protagonist, who\'s unnamed in real life, dies by being crushed to death from a falling vending machine, whom like the Otaku weeb that he is, gets reincarnated into an immobile vending machine, with his speech being limited to only stock phrases, and like every other fantasy work, is imbued with magical abilities like a defensive force field, invisibility and shapeshifting. How this sentient vending machine levels up is through the dispensing of items, and with sales, converted into points that work like the usual JRPG, from increasing strength to agility and most importantly, modifications to his versatile vending machine body. Not long after, with the encounter of a young female hunter, with her speciality being ridiculous strong power though at the expense of control, after some ""Encounters of the Third Kind""-like familiarity, the two hit it off with a given name to the vending machine, both Boxxo and Lammis hit off to the wilderness, with the latter carrying the former on her back, and the story chronicles just as the show\'s title says: ""I Now Wander the Dungeon"".First off, Hirukuma\'s work here is just as many others have predicted: this is PEAK fiction, and it really is to an insane degree. Sure, you have TenSura\'s Rimuru and Kumo Desu ga, Nanika?\'s Kumoko, but Jidou Hanbaiki really pushes the level of creativity and originality of someone who was uncertain to meet death anytime due to his beloved late father, and that stress may have taken a toll on him, but it truly is a work that is a literate blessing in disguise, going against the formation of a story that catered to the needs of the audience and primarily with the pursuant of his own style. For better or for worse, I\'m glad that this is the comeback that Hirukuma would\'ve thought otherwise of achieving something significant with his life, and it indefinitely creamed the crop to rake in the popularity. Because where else in the Isekai space will you be able to see enemies be defeated with Mentos and Coke, as opposed to the same-old sword and shield know-how, only in Jidou Hanbaiki a.k.a Reborn as a Vending Machine will you experience the ingenious genuity of Hirukuma\'s fan-fictional work.I am a huge fan of Boxxo and Lammis\'s relationship, to be frank. And though if you ever had a whiff of thought of Boxxo turning back into a human, there is the possibility, but it also loses the charm of what makes this show work brillantly. That said, the versatile Boxxo is literally versatile at almost everything: being able to transform into different vending machines (which should pique audiences outside of Japan of the insane variety of vending machine types) that serve as the purpose goes towards the people it treats to, not just the female hunter, whom due with her special ability of the Blessing of Might, makes her strong enough to carry Boxxo almost like a bag of sorts, which allows her to control her strength better like a mutual exchange. And despite Boxxo having a crush on Lammis, the latter is a genuine girl who really cares for her friends and loved ones, being that her parents being killed by monsters, essentially making her an orphan of an outcast. And like friends having each other\'s backs, Lammis holds Boxxo close to her, and if he ever goes missing for even a single beat, she will not hesitate to find him wherever he might be. All of these, and it stil remains in Hirukuma retaining a common first-person style but that perspective remains entirely Boxxo\'s, which allows for amusing running commentary as he attempts to justify some of the purchases he made when he was human. As is given, more setting details would be desirable, but limiting the world information to Boxxo\'s perspective is the strongest choice, and where Boxxo does his MC job best.The supporting characters are a whole party town of fun as well. Lammis\'s childhood friend Hulemy plays the older sister character relationship despite her tomboyish personality, whom her real trade of work as a talented magical item engineer creates a divergent role towards Boxxo, being able to sense that within this vending machine, lies a human soul within. The party that Lammis and Boxxo spends their story chronicles is called the Menagerie of Fools, led by the skilled fighter-cum-Captain Kerioyl and his mercenary of various magic users, which for the most part, also have a mutual exchange since Boxxo provides most of the survival coverage, and since Lammis\'s super glue-like closeness dictates Boxxo\'s every decision to make parties with the people around him, they\'re like a pair that provides both the supply and demand that is a beneficial trade to everyone. Everyone is a friend to each other, and you absolutely do not want to get on their bad side.The production values for Jidou Hanbaiki aren\'t really the best, no thanks to the Studio Gokumi & AXsiZ collaboration, and that decision is somehow made better or worse thanks to director Noriaki Akitaya, who has to continue overseeing Ayakashi Triangle, which made its comeback in part of Aniplex\'s mismanagement to delay the anime. Of course, you\'ve heard me say this over and over again: a show that has 2 directors or a director who has to bide his/her time to take care of more than 1 anime at any one time is a recipe for disaster, though it seems that Noriaki Akitaya is more keen in this show, which makes up for the best of his directorial duties, even if seen here in its most miniscule of forms.However, the OST is just tip-top, the embodiment of a fan fiction work. BRADIO\'s OP ""Fanfare"" is a swinging banger of a song, but if you\'re like me who finds it uncomfortably slow, you can afford to tune the song at 10-15% faster speed to get some personalized beats, and if you do, it absolutely SLAPS. But please don\'t apply the fast speed at Peel the Apple\'s ED song, which can make you feel childlike all over again with its poppy, childlike tunes. Certainly, the one aspect where it reflects greatly to the show\'s accordion.Jidou Hanbaiki is a rather different kind of Isekai: one not to be forgotten for the ages as it easily has writing that is leaps and bounds above the average Isekai with its bizarre concept. It\'s a concept that is pretty hard to replicate novelist Hirukuma\'s success, transitioning from being a family business operator to a writer, and how personal tragedy played a key part in that. His hard-won success story is easily heartening, and I pray that if he has a chance to pick up and continue Jidou Hanbaiki, let the fate of gods be so, because this is an Isekai that I want to watch over and over again.It\'s a good breather and refreshing take on Isekai, I\'ll give it as much as that while it isn\'t perfect by any means. But what does matter is enjoyability, and if you\'re not put down by the absurdity of its deliverance, this will give you some good vending machines for the soul. Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon, which is a work of pure art that delivers exactly what it brings to the masses: a typical Isekai, but one that\'s laden as an infomercial entertainment that is both fun and engaging.Even if you have not been to Japan before, like the majority of weebs on Earth, the Land of the Rising Sun, is a literate Otaku to these vending machines.

And like friends having each other\'s backs, Lammis holds Boxxo close to her, and if he ever goes missing for even a single beat, she will not hesitate to find him wherever he might be. All of these, and it stil remains in Hirukuma retaining a common first-person style but that perspective remains entirely Boxxo\'s, which allows for amusing running commentary as he attempts to justify some of the purchases he made when he was human. As is given, more setting details would be desirable, but limiting the world information to Boxxo\'s perspective is the strongest choice, and where Boxxo does his MC job best.The supporting characters are a whole party town of fun as well. Lammis\'s childhood friend Hulemy plays the older sister character relationship despite her tomboyish personality, whom her real trade of work as a talented magical item engineer creates a divergent role towards Boxxo, being able to sense that within this vending machine, lies a human soul within. The party that Lammis and Boxxo spends their story chronicles is called the Menagerie of Fools, led by the skilled fighter-cum-Captain Kerioyl and his mercenary of various magic users, which for the most part, also have a mutual exchange since Boxxo provides most of the survival coverage, and since Lammis\'s super glue-like closeness dictates Boxxo\'s every decision to make parties with the people around him, they\'re like a pair that provides both the supply and demand that is a beneficial trade to everyone. Everyone is a friend to each other, and you absolutely do not want to get on their bad side.The production values for Jidou Hanbaiki aren\'t really the best, no thanks to the Studio Gokumi & AXsiZ collaboration, and that decision is somehow made better or worse thanks to director Noriaki Akitaya, who has to continue overseeing Ayakashi Triangle, which made its comeback in part of Aniplex\'s mismanagement to delay the anime. Of course, you\'ve heard me say this over and over again: a show that has 2 directors or a director who has to bide his/her time to take care of more than 1 anime at any one time is a recipe for disaster, though it seems that Noriaki Akitaya is more keen in this show, which makes up for the best of his directorial duties, even if seen here in its most miniscule of forms.However, the OST is just tip-top, the embodiment of a fan fiction work. BRADIO\'s OP ""Fanfare"" is a swinging banger of a song, but if you\'re like me who finds it uncomfortably slow, you can afford to tune the song at 10-15% faster speed to get some personalized beats, and if you do, it absolutely SLAPS. But please don\'t apply the fast speed at Peel the Apple\'s ED song, which can make you feel childlike all over again with its poppy, childlike tunes. Certainly, the one aspect where it reflects greatly to the show\'s accordion.Jidou Hanbaiki is a rather different kind of Isekai: one not to be forgotten for the ages as it easily has writing that is leaps and bounds above the average Isekai with its bizarre concept. It\'s a concept that is pretty hard to replicate novelist Hirukuma\'s success, transitioning from being a family business operator to a writer, and how personal tragedy played a key part in that. His hard-won success story is easily heartening, and I pray that if he has a chance to pick up and continue Jidou Hanbaiki, let the fate of gods be so, because this is an Isekai that I want to watch over and over again.It\'s a good breather and refreshing take on Isekai, I\'ll give it as much as that while it isn\'t perfect by any means. But what does matter is enjoyability, and if you\'re not put down by the absurdity of its deliverance, this will give you some good vending machines for the soul.', ""Let me start by saying that just like most people here, I came here to watch the anime just for shit and giggles (and also cause i'm a bit curious about how the anime goes due to the absurdity of the damn premise). Usually I'm the type to wait for an anime to end so that I can just binge-watch the show for later, but curiosity got the better of me and I decided to watch Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon (or Jidou Hanbaiki ni Umarekawatta Ore wa Meikyuu wo Samayou in Japanese) while it's still airing.And to my genuine...surprise, I unironically enjoyed it a lot (i know, i'm sorry). I enjoyed the chemistry between Lammis and Boxxo (or called Hakkon in Japanese) and find it quite endearing (in terms of how Lammis is quite understanding towards Boxxo, despite the problems that Boxxo in terms of communicating has due to being a literal magical vending machine), as well as other characters like Hulemy and more. And I also like how due to Boxxo's knowledge in vending machines, he creatively uses them to his advantage in certain situations, as such when the time when he got the idea to give a food to some chefs, then later gives them the ingredients needed to make said food to teach them how to make said food. And also because of the absurd premise, at times it can be funny (and it had gotten the laugh out of me sometimes).And also the opening and ending song of this anime is quite catchy (and the lyrics of the song are quite cheerful and nice, definitely fitting for an anime like this).Of course, as for whether or not I would recommend it, so far, yes, as long as the absurd and simple premise of the anime is something you wouldn't mind about. Also obviously despite how much i praise the anime, it isn't perfect, but so far it's quite enjoyable. surprise, I unironically enjoyed it a lot (i know, i'm sorry).

Well, apparently it is very high. In fact it is turning out to be one of the most refreshing ideas of this season. The Vending Machine Isekai may seem at first to be the last stray for Isekai before it went too far, but nothing is going too far it seems.Plot: The title itself gives away the plot, and it is really that simple. Though it's simplicity and earnestness is what makes this decent. The way things happen, the way people interract, react...and transact is eerily similar to how people would react if it were really real. So much so, that the fact there is a magical vending machine amongst the other characters does not make it seem any less believable or something to laugh at, because it is already that ridiculous.In fact, it seems fitting that things happen as they do even when the whole premise is way past bonkers to begin with. The humour may seem a little forced at times because of how outrageous the concept itself is, but overall it compliments well the idea.Characters: You'd think apart from the vending machine and the one looking after him, everybody would be a one note cut out of some trope. Surprisingly it isn't the case at all. For some reason the characters here have more personality then most other Isekais, which is even more perplexing.Animation: The quality of animation is surprisingly decent. This is hardly your run of the mill isekai level production values, it is certainly much more than that. The scenes are smooth and fluid unlike the janky mess that most shows pass off as animation.Music: It does it's job as it should. The opening and Ending music is standard too.Enjoyment: The fact that something so obnoxiously ridiculous could be done tastefully, and that too with a decent amount of thought put into it is itself a recipe for enjoyment. In the end people tend to care about the little things and that is where it seems to be thriving.For instance, there is a scene where the Vending Machine Isekai protagonist contemplates that he can't give away things for free before he has turned a profit. As the profit, or the points he earns by selling the articles he has to offer go directly in maintaining his health bar, and helps him acquire skills. If he is not cautious he will be dead. He can do good and become powerful after he has turned a profit, sold his articles, and to no one's surprise he does exactly that.This simple fact that most Isekais will gloss over these kind of little things, and make the protagonist all powerful without any serious thought put to it, without thinking of the consequences is what turn off most viewers. And, the fact that a vending machine of all things contemplates this much is what makes it this ridiculous.So is this the most ridiculously outrageous Anime of the season, possibly of the year, Yes, quite possibly of the last few years. Though, is it the most outrageously ridiculous Anime of the season, No, certainly not. There is enough enjoyment to be had here, but of course this isn't going to be for everybody. and transact is eerily similar to how people would react if it were really real.

I doubt you'd believe me. But here we are, and it's actually....Good? Let me explain.Story and characters: 6The story pretty much is as told on paper. Usual Isekai situation, but only this time, the person being isekai'd, becomes a Vending Machine in a new world. Being unable to properly communicate with anyone, unless it's through usual thank yous, and other phrases that a machine of it's nature will speak to you after using it.  But if it's...not the strange concept that draws you in, it's more the fact this feels like two animes into one. The Vending Machine in a sense is the 'main character' but because of the set up, it's presented as if he's a side background character, while still being able to help out. Which will stand out than other Isekais. Which will bring more eyes to the product as a whole.What helps with the characters more, is that they're not only a colourful cast, but because of how it's presented, you'd want to know more about the characters you've gotten.  As you also feel there is going to be more to it then it seems, with how some of the characters act, and are presented. With the sort of vibes you get from them. A highlight has to go to Lammis however, as she's adorable in all honestly. Very strong too. A character worth rooting for.However, I do feel that once the 'haha it's a Vending Machine' novelty wares off, it may be casted aside a little bit. Which isn't it's own fault if such happens, more that the thought of it would draw eyes, and if those eyes aren't entertained by what they are seeing, then they'll drift away.Art and sound: 7They really do well to capture a lot of things, from how characters look and sound, to how the backgrounds look like there has been detail of care about it, and not some off putting looking thing. The main questionable thing, of course will be the elephant in the room. Or should I say, the Vending Machine in the room. It's not bad, but more seeing anime eyes on a vending machine...It's gonna take some getting used to haha.A Vending Machine in a new world sounds real weird, but it's surprisingly good, and may continue to be such, if it grabs us with a compelling story. The main issue, is more that people won't give it a fair shot, due to it being such, but I'd say, give it a chance, and see how you like it. not the strange concept that draws you in, it's more the fact this feels like two animes into one.

It's mostly just a wholesome anime. The art and animation are simple, and the animators are probably overjoyed with a vending machine speaker half the time.

When I started watching I mainly looked forward to see how the vending machine communicates, how it moves around and generally problems that arise when somebody is suddenly a metal box. But the anime chose the easy way out. E.g.: How does the box even start communicating with humans? Random girl...starts talking to it and decides in 1minute that it must be an intelligent item or whatever; How does the box move around? Random girl decides to move it around.

It's easy to sympathize with them, whether it's the simple vending machine or the others, regardless of their gender.

There\'s a lot of great visual comedy from the things he dispenses and the world looks nice.Thankfully the series has been renewed for a second season, which I eagerly look forward to.

""Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon"" is one of those anime series that prompts a serious thought. While people my age are settling down, starting families, here I am, immersed in a story about a guy transforming into a vending machine. What\'s even sadder is that I\'m actually quite enjoying it.You see, the thing about Japanese vending machines are that they are a lot more Japanese, and are a lot more advanced. This anime brilliantly showcases the impressive capabilities of Japanese vending machines—serving...up hot meals, simulating motion, and even conjuring force fields.Let me set the stage for you. We have our nameless protagonist, who one day, while riding his bike, comes across a vending machine in distress. seizing the moment, he leaps into action, and as a result, meets his demise, only to be reborn as a vending machine. The intricacies of the power system in this anime are best understood by watching it, as it can get quite complex at times. It operates on an isekai power system fueled by money.Here\'s where our unnamed protagonist encounters his first challenge. He finds himself in the middle of nowhere, devoid of any intelligent life—until, wait, there\'s a person. Enter Lammis. She discovers him, famished and disoriented, and after sating her hunger, she attempts to communicate with our protagonist. The catch is, he can only utter phrases typical of a vending machine, such as ""Please Insert Coin"", ""Too Bad"", or ""Thank you very much! I look forward to your next use!"", is what women say to me in the red light district, but I digress.Later, Lammis decides to name him Boxxo. She then carries him back to her village with ease, thanks to her extraordinary strength. Once Boxxo arrives in the village, that\'s when the real high-stakes, adrenaline-pumping action kicks in. This doesn\'t mean Boxxo doesn\'t embark on the typical isekai adventures; he just approaches them a bit differently. And that, my friend, sets the stage for Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon.What really carries this anime is the vending machine character himself, Boxxo. He embodies the quintessential isekai protagonist—utterly average in every way. The only standout trait is his knack for pulling off Chinese scams. He went so far as to set up an entire Genshin gacha, and I\'m convinced he rigged the outcomes, much like gacha games have been doing to me for years.Then there\'s Lammis. Her main characteristic, besides being a kind and strong woman, seems to be her difficulty in controlling her punches unless she has Boxxo on her back, acting as some sort of aim assist. The characters lack the depth of real people; they feel more like marionettes being manipulated.As for the background characters, I struggle to find the words. They might just be the most background characters I\'ve ever come across.Now, I haven\'t been overly critical of the anime so far, but it\'s time to address some glaring issues. The animation can be quite goofy at times. While it\'s understandable that they saved time drawing the main character, given he\'s essentially eight lines and a fill tool, they only went all out on the animation once. I also played a little game called ""try not to spot a blurry background,"" and let me tell you, it was impossible.Admittedly, the animation didn\'t bother me too much since I was in it for the entertainment value. That\'s the thing about this anime. It falters in storytelling, pacing, animation, character development, conflicts, themes—you name it. Yes, it\'s a subpar anime, but I found a strange kind of enjoyment in watching it. It was so bad that it circled right back around to being oddly good, only to loop back into being bad again. A pretty decent isekai if you ask me though. 7/10.Thank you very much! I look forward to your next use! up hot meals, simulating motion, and even conjuring force fields.Let me set the stage for you. We have our nameless protagonist, who one day, while riding his bike, comes across a vending machine in distress. seizing the moment, he leaps into action, and as a result, meets his demise, only to be reborn as a vending machine. The intricacies of the power system in this anime are best understood by watching it, as it can get quite complex at times. It operates on an isekai power system fueled by money.Here\'s where our unnamed protagonist encounters his first challenge. He finds himself in the middle of nowhere, devoid of any intelligent life—until, wait, there\'s a person. Enter Lammis. She discovers him, famished and disoriented, and after sating her hunger, she attempts to communicate with our protagonist. The catch is, he can only utter phrases typical of a vending machine, such as ""Please Insert Coin"", ""Too Bad"", or ""Thank you very much! I look forward to your next use!"", is what women say to me in the red light district, but I digress.Later, Lammis decides to name him Boxxo. She then carries him back to her village with ease, thanks to her extraordinary strength. Once Boxxo arrives in the village, that\'s when the real high-stakes, adrenaline-pumping action kicks in. This doesn\'t mean Boxxo doesn\'t embark on the typical isekai adventures; he just approaches them a bit differently. And that, my friend, sets the stage for Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon.What really carries this anime is the vending machine character himself, Boxxo. He embodies the quintessential isekai protagonist—utterly average in every way. The only standout trait is his knack for pulling off Chinese scams. He went so far as to set up an entire Genshin gacha, and I\'m convinced he rigged the outcomes, much like gacha games have been doing to me for years.Then there\'s Lammis. Her main characteristic, besides being a kind and strong woman, seems to be her difficulty in controlling her punches unless she has Boxxo on her back, acting as some sort of aim assist. The characters lack the depth of real people; they feel more like marionettes being manipulated.As for the background characters, I struggle to find the words. They might just be the most background characters I\'ve ever come across.Now, I haven\'t been overly critical of the anime so far, but it\'s time to address some glaring issues. The animation can be quite goofy at times. While it\'s understandable that they saved time drawing the main character, given he\'s essentially eight lines and a fill tool, they only went all out on the animation once. I also played a little game called ""try not to spot a blurry background,"" and let me tell you, it was impossible.Admittedly, the animation didn\'t bother me too much since I was in it for the entertainment value. That\'s the thing about this anime. It falters in storytelling, pacing, animation, character development, conflicts, themes—you name it. Yes, it\'s a subpar anime, but I found a strange kind of enjoyment in watching it. It was so bad that it circled right back around to being oddly good, only to loop back into being bad again. A pretty decent isekai if you ask me though. 7/10.Thank you very much! I look forward to your next use!', 'When I heard about the premise of this isekai I thought its very existence was shameful. Having watched 7 episodes out of sheer boredom I can confidently say that I was right. Man is this show bad.It tries to be wholesome, which is nice I guess. But it never evolves whatsoever beyond its basic premise. It\'s about as dull as you\'d imagine an anime about a vending machine would be.Though let me dispel any illusions you may have: the vending machine can\'t move, talk, nor use magic. It\'s a vending machine. It can create a barrier, change the type of vending machine it...is, and change what it stocks. That\'s it. It has like 4 canned phrases it can say like ""Hello there"", ""too bad"", ""thank you very much"", and ""I look forward to serving you again."" That\'s it.And for added context I\'m a huge isekai fan. I like the vast majority of them. This just isn\'t it. is, and change what it stocks. That\'s it.

The concept is extremely simple, but that is what made it charming.  Take a MC who can only communicate with canned phrases, it\'s up to others to try and interpret what he means.  It also hilariously raises the question of ""what is a vending machine"".  At face value the anime isn\'t very interesting, but the story it tells and the world it builds are great.Think of the world outside and around you, are there people who have difficulty communicating and can only use a few phrases?  Are there...people out there in the world who cannot move around without the help of others?  Are there people out there who feel like their sense of worth only comes from what they can provide?  How can you overcome a language barrier using simple images?A person with a simple hobby of understanding and learning about vending machines; get to use their weird passion to be helpful.  Why wouldn\'t that be a really great idea to explore?  It\'s a simple anime, but I think that there\'s a lot to think about from the world and the premise that they formed. people out there in the world who cannot move around without the help of others?

He stood, in his new sturdy but immobile body, on a grass field near a lake in a place not known to him. As he considered his situation he remembered that he had died in a rather silly accident featuring a vending machine. After getting accustomed to his new situation and assessing his new...found skills and abilities, he makes another discovery. He has been transported into another world.While losing hope he meets a young, energetic and incredibly strong girl. She decides to take him to the nearest town. From that moment they form an unlikely team and go on adventures together.Yes, the premise is a bit twisted but at the same time pretty interesting. The main cast is pretty soli, even if a little cliche. Speaking of the main cast.Boxxo - the isekaied, reborn as a vending machine in a fantasy world, titular hero of the story. The name Boxxo was given to him by Lammis because she rightfully came to the conclusion that calling him “You” all the time would be a pain. He has very limited ability to verbally communicate with the outside world, given he can only speak a few lines straight from a vending machine.When it comes to his powers… yes… despite being a vending machine he’s still OP as most isekai protagonists. At first his abilities consist of selling his goods (it seems that he can sell anything that was in a vending machine that he had contact in his previous life), changing the assortment which he has unlimited stock as long as he has the points for it, changing into different kinds of machines and… oh yes… creating an impenetrable, magical barrier that can protect from virtually anything. You know… the standard vending machine stuff that we have in the real world. Nothing too fancy. As the show goes on he gains more and more abilities and forms. To the point that he is able to defeat a powerful monster that nearly offed his whole team, just by changing forms and using basic chemistry and physics. Near the end he becomes not only a source of nourishment for his companions but also weapons, plans and even healing. OP AF but in a way that’s not totally annoying. Except the bullshit in the last episode, that was garbage.Lammis - an energetic, positive (most of the time) young girl with a classical for anime allergy for clothes, as depicted by what she’s wearing all the time. She finds Boxxo near the lake after losing all her supplies. Driven by hunger she purchases some drinks as food from the vending machine and decides to take him with her. Of course she first asks for his permission. Despite acting like an air head she does have some analytical skills and can even think on the fly. She deduces that Boxxo isn’t an ordinary magic tool and even thinks of a way that he can, to a limited extent, communicate with others. She does have a personal goal but it’s not stated clearly in the show, but it is stated that she would like to have a proper conversation with Boxxo and maybe even for him to taste her cooking.Apart from that there isn’t much to tell about her apart from that she gets scared easily, doesn’t like ghost stories or anything horror related, can tell Boxxo’s state of mind… somehow, and is probably too attached to him. Seriously it’s bordering on obsession. Someone get her some help.Hulemy - she joins the main cast after being saved from the “geniuses” who kidnapped her and Boxxo. Truly the big brain move on the part of the villains. She’s a childhood friend of Lammis and a skilled magic-item engineer. She’s competent as an engineer and intelligent, she’s the first person to deduce that a human soul resides inside Boxxo. Unlike Lammis she’s more thoughtful with her actions but still gets involved with her friends shenanigans. When it comes to the main trio she’s the most mature but still loves to tease Lammis. She showed compassion to the victim when she witnessed the abuse of magic-item engineering. Showing that she has more respect both for the craft itself and its uses than some of her colleagues. The thing that’s strange to me is that an engineer didn’t want to disassemble Boxxo to see what makes him tick. I guess that after she found out about the human soul in him she might have started to see him in a different light but I would still like an explanation. She’s probably the most interesting character in the show and is criminally underutilised. I would love for her to take centre stage more often than just in two episodes.There are more recurring characters in the show but they don’t matter much in the grand scheme of things. They are just there to show how important Boxxo is to the adventurers or just make Lammis look like she’s more than just Boxxo’s transport.When it comes to the plot… yeah… there isn’t any overarching one. It’s just things that happen to Boxxo and ways that he deals with them. Thanks to the premise itself I don’t really mind that we have a passive protagonist. Something that I usually despise in any kind of medium. This time? I don’t mind it because having a vending machine with a grand goal would be even more insane than the story already is. So yeah. Congratulations show, You made me not mind something I usually hate. Gold star.Apart from that… it’s ok. Don’t get me wrong, I did have fun watching the show but it’s nothing too original when it comes to the plot itself. The originality comes from the uniqueness of the MC but that’s it. Because he’s passive, he usually just protects people with his barrier in the beginning from situations that You saw a million times in millions of other anime. But, because he’s mostly defensive there is still a little bit of drama. Not much but enough to not get bored watching. When he gets even more OP the show loses most of its tension. Even the last episode that had the most drama by far, was brought down to mediocrity level thanks to the bullshit that Boxxo pulled out of his… I want to say ass but do vending machines have those?I did find some things a bit repetitive and annoying. The amount of times Boxxo gets separated from Lammis is pretty ridiculous. I think only one of those times felt organic, when they were fighting the boss of the level. The other times it was just a pretext for the story to introduce new characters. I don’t want to say it’s lazy but it’s repetitive af and gets old after the second time. Another thing is Lemmis' obsession with our cuboid MC. I get that some people are avoiding her because of her blessing that makes her a bit clumsy and a hindrance to an adventure party but come on. There are times when the show frames her attachment as almost (I’m gonna use that word even if it’s not needed) romantic.. And Boxxo likes it! Granted from his perspective it’s more understandable, he was a young man with urges and she is an attractive lass, but what reasons she has to treat him like a potential partner are beyond me. Like “The Doors” sang: “People are strange”.All in all this is not a terrible show, it’s not great either but it is enjoyable. The comedy is a hit or miss, it did miss for me most of the time but there are episodes (interestingly enough all of them are without Lemmis much in them) that are pretty well written and prove that the show had potencial bo much more than just a silly comedy.I think it’s still worth a watch if You like anime that let You just relax and give Your brain cells a rest. found skills and abilities, he makes another discovery.

This is very much like any of your average Isekai, but with the hook that our MC is an OP vending machine.At first, it did seem interesting because how does a vending machine do *anything*? Well, that is simply solved by giving our MC all the usual benefits of an isekai world.1. He can turn into different kinds of vending machines by unlocking them. He can sell food, drinks, magazines, dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide), oxygen supply, water, petrol, AED, masks and the list goes on. we are really exploiting the vending machine hook to its...limit.2. And he can also learn more non-vending machine stuff like barrier where he decides what can passthrough and what cannot.

Conceptually a lot of it is ridiculous, and it\'s not even completely internally consistent, because Boxxo seems to lack a lot of qualities modern vending machines possess, like a more varied speech processor.

The animation is... fine, generally.  The music is nothing to write home about. I like the Japanese voice acting.  The story seems to be...moving along at a pretty decent pace.

But since seeing Tenken, which I really liked, I thought that this could be similarly good. I mean, the isekai genre is kind of oversaturated with all the generic stuff (which I can enjoy, but in the form of manga), so getting isekaid as an inanimate object brings some fresh air into the whole genre. That’s basically what I thought when I first saw this anime being announced. And honestly, I had...pretty high expectations, which I think were met.The story itself is pretty fun and lighthearted, with some dungeon crawling and fighting included. What I liked was Boxxo’s ability to transform into different types of vending machines. At some points I was like “The hell, there’s that kind of a vending machine?” Anyways, Boxxo’s adaptability and his ability to think of creative solutions to problems (like the dry ice, or the... protection, or even the balloons), combined with his good-natured personality, was something I really enjoyed. What also piqued my interest was that when he learnt that there might be a way to turn him back to human, he didn’t instantly think “Yes! I can be a human again. To hell with this vending machine body.” And he had some good reasoning to not want to return to being a human. So yeah, I think that Boxxo is a pretty interesting character.Speaking of characters, it was not only Boxxo who was entertaining and nice, the other characters were good too (at least for this type of story). Lammis is adorable and you’ve got that urge to protect her (though in fact it would be her who would do the protecting, given her inhuman strength). And one of the reasons behind that is not only Lamiss’ personality, but her VA – Kaede Hondo, who is the VA of Maple from Bofuri (who is an adorable fluff ball). Combined with quite similar personalities and the same VA, it’s obvious that I’d feel basically the same towards Lammis.Hulemy was also a pretty likeable character and the same goes for Shui. At first, I didn’t like her way of speaking, but then it actually grew on me.Overall, this anime’s been enjoyable and fun, and I like that it was focused more on the chill side. This all suited my tastes. Though I don’t think this anime is for everyone. The concept itself is pretty crazy, so if you are not up for something… different and a bit strange, then I don’t think you will like the story. The MC is a literal vending machine, so he can’t move and can only “talk” using some preprogrammed phrases.In the end, I’m pretty satisfied with the story – it was fun, it was entertaining, the characters were good, and it was something new. So, my personal rating for Reincarnated as a Vending Machine is – 7.5/10. pretty high expectations, which I think were met.The story itself is pretty fun and lighthearted, with some dungeon crawling and fighting included.

Most Isekais are aimed at 13 y/o and over, but this one feels quite childish, like its aimed at a younger audience. Nothing is scary, the stakes are almost never high, the enemies are cartoonish and the plot is braindead simple. But also, every now and then it makes references to rape, porn and condoms, so idk.As for the content of the show, the author very clearly had an idea and quite often these anime with outlandish premises end up being...pretty good, but this one is just kind of dull. The author sticks to his limitations of all the character\'s abilities being tied to being a vending machine, but he took no creative liberties with that idea. All the vending machine abilities he has acquired are based on IRL vending machines but I think the show would have been more interesting had he been able to vend fantasy items, of if he could more liberally modify the items he sells or if he could independently move or something. As it is, about 90% of the show plays like a vending machine commercial - Village needs X, main character turns into a vending machine that distributes X (typically some form of food) and the villagers rejoice.... and its that but like 3 times an episode for 11 episodes.They briefly introduced a point system that I thought might be an issue, its really the only sense of danger for him since he can heal any damage he takes with points, but we\'re almost never given the point total and it only gets mentioned every 4 or 5 episodes. Otherwise the points are used to diversify his products so they can continue the transaction loop narrative.They break it up with adventures to the most plain and generic adventure locations you can think of, a pond, a labyrinth, an open field, a stone cave etc None of these locations have detail or substance. You almost never meet new character and there doesnt appear to be any overarching plot, except kill the stratum bosses and amybe turn the vending machine back into a human.As for world building - its profoundly weak - Youre told the vending machine is in a dungeon divided into stratums, you arent told anything about the overworld, the kingdoms or governments that exist, the mechanics of the dungeon etc. If they leave the city they almost only meet one particular party of adventurers, if you go to another town you meet at most 1 or 2 new characters, which leaves the world feeling very dead and empty. This is a problem because that focuses all the attention onto the characters and the main character is a box who says ""hello"".You cant have isekai power fantasies since he cant move independently and all he can  do is sell stuff. You cant have character arcs or relationship growth since all he can really say is yes and no, the world is generic and empty, the characters are archetypal shells, the ingenuity of monster design extends to floating skulls and the main character is a box.Overall it felt empty.

I was really invested from the first episode until episode 8, but I just feel like this show suffers from the classic Iseki tropes that plague the genre. There were no substances that would make one continue watching after the world was fleshed out and you met all of the important characters. After that, it's just another show that does not make itself different from the others. I also think that as a result of the timing of this show's release, with so many other, really good and really anticipated shows being released around the same time, it has gotten washed...away in the amount of anime being released. I will give credit for poking fun at the most camp aspects of Isekis, but that alone could not save the show.

It was a creative and cozy watch that I enjoyed more than I thought I would.There’s been a noticeable increase in the number of strange isekai concepts over the past few years. I don’t mind, because I always look forward to something novel and fresh.

Honestly I just feel like this show has so much heart as well as a good sense of humor. The characters are all wonderful and the ride is unexpectedly enjoyable. Watching this show is very much like a walk around the block with a good friend, predictable and wonderful. "", 'Despite having potential on telling a story from point of view of inanimate object with human soul, story execution is simply bad. Dialogs and plot looks like targeted at preschool audience. A lot of uninteresting chit-chat about vending machines, foods, gamey isekai mechanics, etc.The way it goes is stupid. If we ignore for a second conveniently superhuman strength girl that carries MC around, we talking about 500kg of steel that can dispense water and food. Even if later it become more handy and useful, it is still ridiculous to take this thing with you on any journey on foot. I fail to see any logic...in taking this box with yourself instead of food and water supply of same mass, unless you cross some kind of desert for prolonged time. And even with that you still need to somehow figure out how to haul half a ton brick in such unfriendly environments where you have no easy access to water and unable to hunt.If we explore case in which MC stays at some human settlement then there comes up problem with effectively deleting money from economy. As he does not engage with local environment for resupplying himself, have no needs and no practical use for coins, he at some point would become filthy rich and suck out all coins from everyone around him.With that in mind he would either annihilate all valuable metals used for coins and eventually die from lack of points for transactions which serve as his subsistence, or will find a way to dispense money and reuse them. In first case he would eventually become all-powerful being with always present timer to his death. In second case he will do a speedrun to become an immortal god. There is also possibility that eventually he would start to accept paper money or credit cards, which in the end will lead him to godhood anyway. in taking this box with yourself instead of food and water supply of same mass, unless you cross some kind of desert for prolonged time.

If it were like that this show would be so funny.But no, it sadly is very average. Below average even.I watched at least an hours worth of this anime, and there was only one joke at the beginning that actually landed. After that we get introduced to incredibly shallow characters that you'd see in every average isekai.

This is not the type of show i usually go for however this season was kind of bare with only half a dozen good shows and curiosity on the absurd premise got me to give this a try and I can happily say it was a positive surprise.Plot: The premise is one of the most...absurd ones I\'ve seen and the story progresses just like any other bland isekai out there having as major differences from those usual shows a lack of ecchi/harem and a bit more slice of life content; if you just hear about it you\'ll probably think it is a horrible anime but after watching I got to say it chill and enjoyable for the most part and the wild premise just makes you think what kind of absurd plan will the main character use to defeat this foe. With all that said, of course, don\'t expect a mind blowing story or you\'ll be disappointed.Art: The animation is for the most part decent with no major flaws or inconsistencies that would ruin the mood for the episode, the fighting scenes aren\'t much fluid and they are relatively short but I didn\'t expect top tier jjk level type of fights for this anime from the start. One detail I thoroughly enjoyed was the two different styling animations used for the mc throughout the show where he would be more animated when he was the focus and look a bit more like a real vending machine when he was just in the background (for example in some of Lammis fighting scenes when mc is on her back).Sound: This category seems a bit awkward to review since it wasn\'t necessarily bad but at the same time there was nothing noteworthy about it so in one word it could easily be defined as average. from the opening and ending to the sound effects nothing seemed out of place but nothing seemed to be a good highlight. The opening is a bit better than the ending in my opining but both don\'t go above being decent and I will probably never hear them again unless I for some odd reason decide to rewatch this show. The ost\'s were average or even a bit below average in my opinion but not bad enough to diminish the engagement and enjoyment of the various scenes.Characters: The characters on this show is, in my opinion, the main highlight of the show once the absurd premise concept fades out and I believe the characters are actually really interesting and different especially when compared to other similar isekai anime where in most cases they purely focus on the mc and barely have noteworthy side cast or where they all feel like different variants of the same character. Hulemy would be my favorite character, Lammis and Boxxo have a good dynamic and really fit the whole vibe of the anime as main characters, the Menagerie of Fools seem like really interesting and mysterious characters where future development and plot could be explored especially the leader and Suori seems like a nice comedic relief. My biggest complaint in relation to the characters is the lack of good antagonists, all villains in the story were one and done random generic dungeon like monster however the last episode may have hinted to a future development in the villain cast which has my kind of exited for the second season that, at the time of this review, has already been announced but is not released.Overall: I give this anime a 5/10 because once you get past the crazy premise the anime boils down to a generic dungeon like isekai becoming relatively forgettable except the vending machine part. if you go to watch it without expecting some mind blowing plot and development and just try to enjoy the show at face value then you will probably not be disappointed and there is nothing wrong with that, it is simply an anime to tune in chill and enjoy the episode without giving it much thought. The art is decent but not exquisite. The sound is not bad but also not that great and the opening and ending are not good enough to be heard outside of the actual episodes. The characters seem to be the best part of the show and might give some amazing content for future seasons but for this one only 12 episodes we only got bits of each character sprinkled throughout and nothing too specific or mind blowing on any, however as already stated it is the category with most potential of the show. absurd ones I\'ve seen and the story progresses just like any other bland isekai out there having as major differences from those usual shows a lack of ecchi/harem and a bit more slice of life content; if you just hear about it you\'ll probably think it is a horrible anime but after watching I got to say it chill and enjoyable for the most part and the wild premise just makes you think what kind of absurd plan will the main character use to defeat this foe.

One detail I thoroughly enjoyed was the two different styling animations used for the mc throughout the show where he would be more animated when he was the focus and look a bit more like a real vending machine when he was just in the background (for example in some of Lammis fighting scenes when mc is on her back).Sound: This category seems a bit awkward to review since it wasn\'t necessarily bad but at the same time there was nothing noteworthy about it so in one word it could easily be defined as average. from the opening and ending to the sound effects nothing seemed out of place but nothing seemed to be a good highlight. The opening is a bit better than the ending in my opining but both don\'t go above being decent and I will probably never hear them again unless I for some odd reason decide to rewatch this show. The ost\'s were average or even a bit below average in my opinion but not bad enough to diminish the engagement and enjoyment of the various scenes.Characters: The characters on this show is, in my opinion, the main highlight of the show once the absurd premise concept fades out and I believe the characters are actually really interesting and different especially when compared to other similar isekai anime where in most cases they purely focus on the mc and barely have noteworthy side cast or where they all feel like different variants of the same character. Hulemy would be my favorite character, Lammis and Boxxo have a good dynamic and really fit the whole vibe of the anime as main characters, the Menagerie of Fools seem like really interesting and mysterious characters where future development and plot could be explored especially the leader and Suori seems like a nice comedic relief. My biggest complaint in relation to the characters is the lack of good antagonists, all villains in the story were one and done random generic dungeon like monster however the last episode may have hinted to a future development in the villain cast which has my kind of exited for the second season that, at the time of this review, has already been announced but is not released.Overall: I give this anime a 5/10 because once you get past the crazy premise the anime boils down to a generic dungeon like isekai becoming relatively forgettable except the vending machine part. if you go to watch it without expecting some mind blowing plot and development and just try to enjoy the show at face value then you will probably not be disappointed and there is nothing wrong with that, it is simply an anime to tune in chill and enjoy the episode without giving it much thought. The art is decent but not exquisite. The sound is not bad but also not that great and the opening and ending are not good enough to be heard outside of the actual episodes.

What the heck, anime has gone too far... or so I thought.This show is SO CUTE. It's so wholesome and adorable. Our main guy is passionate about vending machines. He loves them, he spends his life admiring them. One day while driving down the road he sees a vending machine in trouble so he goes to save it, but falls to his death. As a reward he is reincarnated into a vending machine himself. He is now the beautiful existence of a vending machine. That's a little interesting... but good for him lol. So now he's in...a dungeon of a beautifully animated fantasy world with really cool monsters, people, classes of adventures, etc. What follows this intro is just pure wholesomeness.He is a sweet vending machine guy fixing the worlds problems one vending machine item at a time. He really thinks about the people he interacts with and how to best help them. What items will improve their life? What can HE do as a VENDING MACHINE, in a fantasy world where there are battles, hunger, quests, etc? (This is very important because the perspective is entirely different from any other show. What can he do, specifically, as a VENDING MACHINE, in a fantasy world? What does he bring to the table, what can only he do?)There's light fanservice, there's wholesome friendship, sense of community, sense of purpose and helping others- its great.Also the magic is beautifully animated-the fire glows, water is very fluid, blessings have glowing particle effects of light, etc. The characters also have diverse and interesting designs and are easily distinguishable from each other-even the more plainly fitted ones.If you want a mindlessly cute show, about being a vending machine of all things, then this is a great watch. Its a great watch overall. If you really like wholesome, sweet, and slower paced slice of life isekai in a fantasy world then you should go watch this. a dungeon of a beautifully animated fantasy world with really cool monsters, people, classes of adventures, etc. What follows this intro is just pure wholesomeness.He is a sweet vending machine guy fixing the worlds problems one vending machine item at a time.

What better way to garner interest than having an absurd story premise? However, Reincarnated as a Vending Machine isn\'t the first to have a protagonist turned into a non-human entity. There\'s been a gimmick for many different animals and objects over the years including a spider, sword, pig, slime, and even a magical girl\'s wand. This brings with it a dilemma on how our protagonist interacts and adapts to a world, with the challenges of not being humanoid.Isekai has the potential to create...excellent world building and drama, a story to relax to with a fun day-to-day environment, or just a power fantasy for the reader to project or follow along with. Reincarnated as a vending machine falls under the ""relaxing"" category.  Despite that, a decent part of the shows runtime has Boxxo adventuring. Our protagonist\'s strengths are non-combat oriented, being a producer of food and materials. He cannot move or talk outside of a few scripted phrases. While having a vending machine deal with a fantasy fight certainly seems interesting, every fight and encounter falls flat. There is no real tension or danger to any characters, and conflicts are easily solved. The way how Boxxo contributes in battle is underwhelming since most of what he does is provide an item or material to assist. Some of the items produced COULD lead to interesting strategy, but they way they are used end up being mundane. The restrictions of not being able to move or speak ends up backfiring in this kind of situation. The item gets produced, someone immediately figures out the intended use, and the item is used. Any case where this type of situation doesn\'t happen is just as dull, as any fantastical elements have nothing interesting going for it.So how does Reincarnated as a Vending Machine handle its non-combat elements? A story needs interesting characters with good chemistry for this. The characters Reincarnated as a Vending Machine are boring and have no personality. Boxxo has as much personality as a vending machine on a wall, and the only interesting thing about Lammis is that she can somehow tell what Boxxo is feeling. Some characters have a single quirk that set them apart, and some don\'t even have that going for them. I am almost offended that most of these characters were named and showed up on the screen more than once. The slice of life elements are not funny, interesting or cute. Nothing really gets added to the story, and any attempt is shallow. The implications of having modern food and luxury items dropped into a fantasy world isn\'t really expanded on. People think its tasty and people want Boxxo for themselves, that\'s it. How our protagonist became a vending machine and came from another world would be an interesting narrative, but instead there are supposed ""wish granting"" items that can be collected. Since the characters have such little personality and motivating force, its hard to care if they reach that goal. By the end of this show I was only hoping to have Boxxo communicate and get a human form, which completely undermines the entire story since its built on the vending machine gimmick.As for visuals and audio, I cannot think of a single well animated moment in this show. The CGI effects they used were integrated well, but outside of that there are many still frames and action scenes hardly move. The backgrounds are incredibly empty and bland, and the character designs are basic.I think the OP song ""Fanfare"" is a nice tune, but it doesn\'t fit with this series. The lyrics do not match with the story and characters. The visuals are a complete mess and are only there to showcase the cast. The ED ""Itsumo no Soup"" has a much better tone to match the visuals, and actually has some lyrical connection. The watercolor aesthetic was a good choice to clearly transition the show into the ED. The OST used for the other parts of the show were extremely generic and forgettable.In summary, Reincarnated as a Vending Machine has an interesting premise but fails to deliver anything. It lacks meaningful conflict, has bland characters, and is not even funny or cute. Its audio and visuals are a big mess, despite a couple of positives. The show is watchable, but hardly enjoyable.3/10 excellent world building and drama, a story to relax to with a fun day-to-day environment, or just a power fantasy for the reader to project or follow along with.

I had high hopes for this to either be a wacky parody or an unusual approach to the typical setup, but unfortunately the show plays its premise completely straight and has no creative way of telling it. The guy is a vending machine that\'s also an adventurer for the guild that helps with clearing out monsters in the labyrinth. I\'m very sad to report that somehow it isn\'t anywhere near as fun or funny as that description would imply.It has every flaw you\'d expect from a generic isekai - the supporting...characters are one-note, the main character is extraordinary through no personal effort and is easily capable of handling most problems out-of-the-box, there isn\'t really any serious main plot to get invested into, the setting is almost completely unexplored, the show has fairly cheap and uninspired animation, etc.The most annoying problem is that all of the interesting issues you might run into if you were suddenly a sentient semi-magical vending machine are handwaved away as soon as they are brought up. Vending machines can\'t move around, but wouldn\'t you know it, there\'s a cute girl with superstrength that just loves to carry him around. He needs to sell things or he dies, but everyone loves what he has in stock and he\'s always in a populated area where everyone is wealthy enough to buy what he\'s selling, so it\'s never a real problem. He can\'t defend himself, but he can just buy the ability to create an impenetrable barrier strong enough that major monsters can\'t touch him. He can\'t talk to people outside of a couple canned phrases, but people just phrase everything as yes/no questions and interpret specific canned responses to mean yes or no.A braver and much more interesting show would, for instance, make it so that there are no humans to interact with. Or make it so that he can only roll around on slow treads on flat surfaces. Things that make it so that the protagonist has actual problems that need clever solutions or hard work. I mean, this vending machine can single-handedly defeat boss monsters - clearly being a vending machine is not an obstacle in this story.One mildly interesting point of the show is that the main character can become any kind of vending machine, so sometimes we get a quick history lesson on strange vending machines in Japan. Fun trivia aside, these new vending machines can be frustrating from a story telling perspective because of the communication problem. Since the MC can\'t talk to people to explain or coordinate his plans, most fights end up exclusive relying on some cool thing he can do. Occasionally, the other characters get to play and win the world\'s hardest game of charades to figure out how they fit in. And they ALWAYS figure it out without completely misunderstanding what\'s going on and entertain us by catastrophically ruining the plan.A much better show in this oddly-specific niche would be ""So I\'m a Spider, So What?"", which actually plays around with the ideas of living in a world that\'s oddly like a video game and the complex limitations associated with being non-human. And of course, if you just want an isekai, there are many others that are more unique, or have better production values, or have more interesting characters or settings (Re:Zero, Mushoku Tensei, Ascendence of a Bookworm, to name a few).This isn\'t to say the show is horrible, just that there\'s nothing remarkable here, and the unremarkable parts are done much better elsewhere. The reason you\'re probably considering this one is because of the vending machine gimmick, and that\'s just not executed very well. If you\'ve already watched every other isekai rated 7 or higher and need something new, this might just work out.

All things considered, however, it isn’t entirely the “pure hate watching” or “so bad...it’s good” experience I had initially expected.The jokes can best be summed up in this format:Event happens > Other characters are either talking or looking for a solution > Boxxo dispenses something ranging anywhere from ‘legitimately helpful’ to ‘WHY?’, with the latter outcome being the main source of comedy.While this anime is by no means a masterpiece, it is hardly the worst isekai we’ve seen be pumped out in recent seasons. Rather, Vending Machine Isekai actually manages to take full advantage of its downright idiotic premise for the sake of a rather unique style of “I am physically struggling to accept that this is actually real” comedy.Being far too novel and intriguing to drop, Vending Machine Isekai seems to evoke a sense of “yeah, it’s a train wreck at times, but I can’t look away” for viewers, leading to this entry ultimately being one of the most popular shows this season, even prevailing (in terms of members) over many actually anticipated anime such as Dark Gathering and Ryza no Atelier.There isn’t much else I can say in a review - In short, Vending Machine Isekai is the type of anime you really have to watch for yourself to determine if the comedy is a hit or a miss by your personal standards.Have fun, and happy vending! :) it’s good” experience I had initially expected.The jokes can best be summed up in this format:Event happens > Other characters are either talking or looking for a solution > Boxxo dispenses something ranging anywhere from ‘legitimately helpful’ to ‘WHY?’, with the latter outcome being the main source of comedy.While this anime is by no means a masterpiece, it is hardly the worst isekai we’ve seen be pumped out in recent seasons.

A story about a nameless vending machine otaku getting hit by Truck-kun and getting reborn into a fantasy world as a vending machine. It’s a premise that you can only laugh at for its creative bankruptcy.Or so I thought, for I was kind of shocked at how interesting the premise became once it was put into context. How does a vending machine defend itself against monsters when it can’t move? How...does it communicate with other people when its dialogue options are limited to things like “Please insert coins” “Hello” and “Thank you very much”? How does it utilise itself best when the only thing it can do is dispense tasty treats and beverages? The way the show explores these questions are pretty interesting and had me invested for a time.However, at the end of the day, it is nothing more than a gimmick painted over the same familiar medieval European-ish fantasy isekai land with stat screens, skills and levels that don’t mean anything in the long run.

It’s also especially weird when the anime starts suggesting that the strong blonde side girl with big anime titties is romantically interested in… a vending machine.

None of the scenes have anything to write home about.Like seriously, there\'s a scene where a ""sly business"" character comes in to try and buy the protagonist, gets refused once and just leaves bummed out. Nothing else happened.  The scene feels like it was written by a 10 year old, and it offers absolutely nothing to the story, and the anime is filled with these.This anime woulda been so much more interesting if it had more to offer, but it does nothing with it\'s premise. The protagonist feels like a side-character, and all the side-characters feel like forced plot devices, or just better left out entirely. This woulda been better as a single episode story arc in a better anime.This anime is like a polished turd, you can\'t help but wonder why would anyone even attempt making it.', ""Isekai, oh isekai. The one genre that never seems to change. Well, sometimes it adds a minor twist to each show, but it’s not like it helps make them much better. Isekai is essentially what a writer resorts to when they have zero ideas. That way they can pour their last two braincells into whatever story they make without it being rejected by publishers, which makes for unoriginal and dull material and later for some reason that material gets adapted into an anime.Jidou Hanbaiki ni Umarekawatta Ore wa Meikyuu wa Samayou or Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon is yet...another example of a show that falls into the never-ending spiral of unoriginality and bland writing that is isekai.The story isn’t very exciting, really. It’s once more your typical “x died and now x is reincarnated into another world” story. It only ever adds one twist which is that the main character gets reincarnated as a vending machine and can dispense your average vending machine items. These items prove to be useful to people around him. The people find a way to communicate with the vending machine… and then the story goes on like a typical isekai. (And somewhat like Akame ga Kill?? Take that with a grain of salt, though.) For the sake of spoilers up to the third episode and to save me from writing the rest of the mundane shiz, I won’t elaborate further, but I’ll assume you know what I mean.The animation handling is just okay. No major flaws to it, but we’ve seen much better. It doesn’t stand out but serves well for the show. Honestly, a higher budget would’ve been a waste, so a mediocre budget is better than anything else. It just fits with the anime, you know?The comedy is the weakest point of the show. It just isn’t funny no matter what. I can see some seven-year-old getting a chuckle out of this and that’s it. Now this might be due to my preference of gag humor over normal comedy, but a normal comedy would at least have me grinning once or twice. Not this, though. My face stayed rock solid and unmoving. Actually, it’s like they didn’t even try to make it funny. The demographic I assume would be young teens, but honestly, in this day and age, I can’t see anyone like that cracking even a smile at this show.Now, as for the music, the background music isn’t too special. it’s just… isekai music. I know, I’ve put music used in an isekai into a subgenre of itself. It’s reminiscent of every isekai soundtrack ever. If I recall correctly, there’s one trancey-techno track that breaks through the rest of the stale soundtrack, but that’s all. Now on to the better side. The OP is pretty good. It’s a pretty funky track and sets the mood well. It’s good to know that it isn’t just another generic J-pop opening and that the director actually thought about using something unique, but sadly, the ED takes “unique” the wrong way. The ED feels like it was ripped straight out of a children’s or slice of life anime, and overall doesn’t work. A very strange choice for an ED.I wouldn’t recommend this anime if you’re looking for something to watch this season. The comedy appeals to no-one; it’s unfunny and you’ll probably only manage a weak smile. The animation handling is the best bit of this show, but sadly even that only reaches a “fair” rating. And finally, the music was a bag of strange and bland. If you plan on watching this show, just consider that it’ll probably be another uninteresting isekai to you.Aren’t the anime community and audiences in Japan tired of these isekai shows already? The anime industry is basically repeating itself over and over again with shows like this. It’s as if isekai is becoming a trademark that defines anime just as shounen has done, except most shounen aren’t repetitive or lackluster in ideas. If isekai shows were kept to a minimum and the writers didn’t rush to come up with ideas, maybe they’d be more enjoyable than now.Thank you for reading my review.(this hunk of mindless text is so borung that i'm on the verge of deleting the review. i've deleted enough of my old reviews already, though, so this snorefest is off the hook for now. for some reason some preliminary reviews pop up on already-aired shows, so right now i'm at the mercy of MAL's new shitty review system. if you're reading this, the fuck are you doing and go read my BETTER reviews (or worse, if you for whatever reason prefer to put yourself to sleep by torturing yourself over being entertained)Now I TRULY thank you for reading my review, as well as this note I added at 5 AM out of pure insomnia-driven boredom. another example of a show that falls into the never-ending spiral of unoriginality and bland writing that is isekai.The story isn’t very exciting, really.

Its hard to judge a 7 minute clip farely, but they definitly used a situation that felt very patlabor. They made sure to have people complaining about SV2 or whatever they are called now.The characters feel really modern, so if you arent crazy about 1990s character sterotypes and prefer the modern ones youll love this, though this is the one thing that kept me from giving it a 7-8/10. As for sound it was average, cant say patlabor is famous for music to begin with. ( Well Maybe...Patlabor 2)Overall its Definitely  worth your time its 7 minutes.

The adaptation to modern times seems effective and smart enough, by which I mean it's basically our current times but with labors, so again, in the same spirit of the original, but as a proper reboot.The CGI blends quite well with the 2D and...the music is a definite standout.I would've appreciated a bit more of effective comedy, since we only get a glimpse of what could be and it's not quite hilarious, so that's a concern.My other main concern is character design, since it's both cartoony AND a bit stiff, which is pretty much the worst of both worlds. I'm aware that the original had a similar issue, sorted out with very lax morphing of expressions and some great talent behind the pencils and direction, so I'm not terrified, but hardly impressed either.All in all, it's just 7 minutes of a glimpse into a promising new series about being a good cop in our current world, but with plenty of giant, clunky robots, so might as well check it out. the music is a definite standout.I would've appreciated a bit more of effective comedy, since we only get a glimpse of what could be and it's not quite hilarious, so that's a concern.My other main concern is character design, since it's both cartoony AND a bit stiff, which is pretty much the worst of both worlds.

Kidou Senshi Gundam NT,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37764/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_NT,"[""As someone who has yet to see Unicorn Gundam, I was worried that my enjoyment of Gundam NT would be hampered. To my surprise, however, the quality of the film is irrelevant to whoever has watched Unicorn Gundam or even has seen a previous Gundam series at all. Gundam Narrative is just bad. Whether the person watching it is a die-hard UC fan or a newcomer to the franchise, the movie is terrible on its own merit.Story: 2/10Here is Gundam NT's biggest flaw: its paper thin and boring story. The story, at least, does a decent job of explaining the events that happened previously which...are relevant and important to the events of NT, meaning that people who missed out on Unicorn won't be completely lost. The big issue here, however, is just how uninteresting. The film just drags on and on with this philosophical nonsense about how humans should not be tampering with the power of gods or the corruption of the Federation in testing on children. It doesn't do anything profound to portray these themes, and the characters just talk about these issues in rather bland dialogue.Another issue to note with the story is how detached it feels to the viewer. It attempts to portray violence or traumatic events in such a way that the person watching the movie will feel shock or empathy, but it fails at this task. The movie shows these events, but fails to show to a significant extent how the effects of such horrors. The beginning of the film, for example, shows the destruction caused by Operation British, in which a colony was dropped on Earth, in the original Gundam, but it is presented like something out of a Hollywood film. It lacks any sort of nuance or emotional attachment.Art:7/10Considering that this is Sunrise, it is to nobody's surprise that Gundam NT's animation is absolutely spectacular. It's fluid and detailed. The mecha action is well animated and fun to watch. My biggest gripe, however, concerns character design and mecha design. On the topic of character design, Zoltan's design just looks ridiculous. He has such an over the top and blatantly evil look as if he were pulled out of a Saturday morning cartoon. His one red eye is just cheesy and unnecessary. On the topic of mecha design, it was pretty disappointing. Considering the story only takes place one year after the events of Gundam Unicorn, I wasn't expecting a huge departure from that series' designs, but I expected more than what we got. The Gundam Narrative's design, the Narrative is what this film's lead Gundam is called by the way, looks generic and uninspired, as if the designers simply slapped elements from previous Gundam designs together and just called it a day.Sound: 4/10The English dub I honestly have no complaints over. It's well acted and gets the job done. My biggest gripe, however, is the music. Having heard tracks from Unicorn Gundam and his work in other shows such as Kill la Kill I expected something decent at least. I will admit that I am not the biggest Sawano fan, but I just couldn't bring myself to like any of the tracks he made. The vocal songs were just generic pop songs and failed to induce any excitement in the scenes they were present. The instrumental songs were insignificant, and I honestly can't think of a single track that I enjoyed.Character: 2/10Here is Gundam NT's other greatest flaw: it's characters. I honestly couldn't believe just how annoying and uninteresting the characters were. For starters, Jona Basta is a terrible lead. He fails to show any character development or growth throughout the movie and simply mopes his way through the film's duration. He has no outstanding qualities or anything that makes the viewer care for him. The film does nothing to ensure the viewer actually becomes invested in Jona's character or his struggles because of how lackluster he is.Another character that requires special mention is the main villain, Zoltan. Zoltan is a terrible villain because, like Jona, he has absolutely zero unique qualities or anything that makes him unique. The writers fail to give Zoltan any depth, for there is literally nothing about him that we learn. We learn nothing about his past, motivations, or struggles. His only purpose in the story is to serve as some sort of arbitrary villain for the main characters to fight in some sort of grand finale. He's just some crazed guy who only seeks to fight for no reason whatsoever. The only character in the entire story which shows some sort of growth or development is Michele Luio, but even that is hardly anything to talk about.Enjoyment: 1/10The fight scenes, though fun to watch, were still boring in that I had no emotional investment in them. It was like I was watching some guy clash two toys together. Why should I care about these characters possibly dying if I have no reason to? Why should I be watching this when I could be watching something else? There were times were I was legitimately tempted to walk out of the theater simply because of how bored I was with it.Overall: 3/10The creators of this film state that this will be the start of another chapter for the Universal Century, which has me worried for future entries. Just read the summary online if you really want to be caught up with the lore. It's a waste of your time. are relevant and important to the events of NT, meaning that people who missed out on Unicorn won't be completely lost.

WARNING LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD!Mobile Suit Gundam NT Review:Story: This adaptation is based off the Unicorn lightnovel which initially was completed but due to the popularity of the series, was inserted late into the whole Gundam UC Timeline. All i say is that you need knowledge prior to watching this (or better yet watch the whole UC animes) if not you will not know what is happening. They don't even throw a bone. So its hard...to watch this as a standalone movie. Sideline-wise, at least i am glad they didn't discard the original ZZ timeline & abandon the Zeta movie ending instead. Also too many backtracking to the past then to the present, but diehard fans will appreciate all these easter egg nuggets (hence why i mention that watching the previous UC series since the beginning of OYW is a bonus). They also touch on the neverending topic of being a Newtype/ Cyber Newtypes & how society deemed them. For me as a hardcore Gundam fans, i give this movie a 7.Story 7/10Art: Same as Gundam UC movies/Series, the art is great with not much of complaints. Of course since this is a big budget movie, the art is reminicing of the older Gundam movies. I gave this a 9.Art 9/10Sound: As Sawano Hiroyuki is part of the team again (who doesn't listen to Gundam UC soundtracks & screams epic!), the soundtrack is superb & there is some hints of familliar to UC. No complaints here, i gave this a 9.Sound 9/10Character: Again the way how this is being portrayed, going back & forth with storyline-wise, it's rather hard to like the new characters. Their motives, resolve.... Its difficult to vote them at all. Too messy i can say. Still the saving grace is that there are cameos round so... I can only give a 7Character 7/10Enjoyment: like i said if you are not a diehard fans, it is difficult to enjoy this as a standalone movie without prior knowledge. But since i am a hardcore Gundam fan, i do enjoy watching it, with all the references as well as the action scenes. There's even one part which i was caught surprised with. The only complaint that i got is that it does seems to be abit messy with the storyline. Overall i gave this a 7Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: Again to highlight, for those who have yet to watch a single UC series, i will advice that it is difficult to understand the whole plotline. For those like me, you will enjoy the ride. As a bonus, it would be advise to know Mobile Suit Gundam UC: One of Seventy Two (a short movie that was shown at G-Dome which unfortunately had not been screen outside Japan) plotline before watching this. I gave this a 7Overall: 7 to watch this as a standalone movie. Sideline-wise, at least i am glad they didn't discard the original ZZ timeline & abandon the Zeta movie ending instead.

I gave this a 7Overall: 7"", 'Mobile Suit Gundam NT ReviewStory (5/10) MediocreMore Specifically (5.75/10) GoodThe story for Mobile Suit Gundam NT was mediocre, it follows a tri-protagonist story about three children known as the miracle children that were known to predict an upcoming catastrophic event that happened during the time 0079. This causes the future of these three children to be used and manipulated for the ravages of war between the Earth Federation and Neo Zeon. I thought the overall execution was good but this movie definitely requires a hefty knowledge of at least Gundam 0079, Gundam 0087 Zeta, Gundam 0093 Char\'s Counter Attack and Gundam 0096 Unicorn. For a...heavy Gundam fan this is fine but for everyone else that is indeed asking a bit much as this movie will constantly flashback to scenes of the series or movies that I mentioned. So if you have no knowledge of them the call backs will indeed fly right over your head clean. It\'s indeed a double-edge sword but seeing as this was only in theaters for 1 day, Sunrise assumed only hardcore Gundam fans would be there for this so it is what it is. Nonetheless I thought it was wasn\'t anything worth complimenting.Art and Animation (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+The art style I felt for this move was very good and so was the animation. Although the mech fights were cool at times it would get so chaotic sometimes, you could easily loose track of what\'s going on. So it can get high maintenance to keep track of everything when the going gets tough. The CG animation on the Phenex Gundam wasn\'t as bad as I thought it would be but it is a tinsy bit weird to see everything else hand drawn while the Phenex is in full CG and sometimes it\'ll go handdrawn itself so the consistency between that, I wouldn\'t be surprise if it bothered people like it did me.Sound (9/10)More Specifically (9.50/10) GreatThe sound in the movie was the best thing about it, the background music ost of VigilaNTe made every scene it played it two times better to me, I watched it in English dub and I thought every voice actor did a great job, nothing outstanding but definitely nothing big enough to complain about to any degree.Characters (6/10) Good {Minor Spoilers}Like I said in the story section this movie is a tri-protagonist movie, which was a new different take for a Gundam. At first I didn\'t really have an issue with the three but after a bit of hindsight, Jona Basta didn\'t really showcase any good characterization to really care commend. He wasn\'t a bad character but he definitely wasn\'t anything to compliment, we was just there continuously talking about his mission where you could see his character wasn\'t right in the head for basically the entire movie (and also his piloting skills weren\'t all that either). Rita is a bit more interesting as she was positive with hopes and dreams 24/7 but you know where that usually leads you in a Gundam series, nonetheless I thought the little dialogue she did have was interesting enough to say she was a good enough character. Michele is the one that surprisingly gets the most characterization and character development of the three as her actions causes her to go down many different paths through the movie one of jealously one, one of self discovery for both herself and humanity and lastly one of redemption, she may be the least likable but from a character standpoint I would definitely say she\'s got the most depth to her. That antagonist of this movie I felt could have been handled a bit better as his backstory and reasoning behind doing what he does wasn\'t really explained as well as it should have been in my opinion, it was hard for me to care for anything he did.Enjoyment (8/10) Very GoodAs I watched the movie, all I wanted to see was some good ole Gundam action, but I also did get a decent enough story and characters. The many call backs I appreciated and the return of ""you know who"" at the end of the movie.Overall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.60/10) Good+Overall the movie wasn\'t very good but I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad either. I thought it was enjoyable for the most part and that\'s mostly probably because i watched it on the big screen.Can\'t wait for Hathaway\'s Flash! heavy Gundam fan this is fine but for everyone else that is indeed asking a bit much as this movie will constantly flashback to scenes of the series or movies that I mentioned.

Rita is a bit more interesting as she was positive with hopes and dreams 24/7 but you know where that usually leads you in a Gundam series, nonetheless I thought the little dialogue she did have was interesting enough to say she was a good enough character. Michele is the one that surprisingly gets the most characterization and character development of the three as her actions causes her to go down many different paths through the movie one of jealously one, one of self discovery for both herself and humanity and lastly one of redemption, she may be the least likable but from a character standpoint I would definitely say she\'s got the most depth to her. That antagonist of this movie I felt could have been handled a bit better as his backstory and reasoning behind doing what he does wasn\'t really explained as well as it should have been in my opinion, it was hard for me to care for anything he did.Enjoyment (8/10) Very GoodAs I watched the movie, all I wanted to see was some good ole Gundam action, but I also did get a decent enough story and characters. The many call backs I appreciated and the return of ""you know who"" at the end of the movie.Overall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.60/10) Good+Overall the movie wasn\'t very good but I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad either. I thought it was enjoyable for the most part and that\'s mostly probably because i watched it on the big screen.Can\'t wait for Hathaway\'s Flash!', '“In my next life, I hope I get to be a bird!”The Universal Century, the main timeline of Gundam. For years it’s always been a huge point of love for Gundam fans. Since it’s creation, the Universal Century has been revived with the likes of Gundam Unicorn and it’s somewhat confusing Laplace Box shenanigans. However even with Unicorn’s problems, it showed that the heart of original UC remains in the creators of Sunrise, and this film represents that well once again.I’ll begin this review with a few questions. First off, do you love the original 4 Universal Century entries? Ignore the side stories, OVAs,...everything. Focus on the original shows and film. Do you love the original Mobile Suit Gundam? Do you love Zeta Gundam? Do you love ZZ Gundam and Char’s Counterattack? If you do, if you really do, then you should probably watch this movie.Did you think Unicorn was “neat but not amazing” but still enjoyed all the callbacks to UC? If you do, watch this movie.Are you curious on what the potential of newtypes are, and what things they offer? If you do, watch this movie.Narrative is similar to an Avengers: Endgame of UC, and I’ll explain why in the review.Story: 7Before the colony drop in Australia, 3 children go to a beach and see a vision of a colony drop. They warn their town and convince them to evacuate, this leads to a town surviving the colony drop. Their premonition was recognised as a stronger version of Newtype power, and became known as the “miracle children”. Years later, they’re taken in by the Federations in order to study newtypes, and they would eventually be experimented on for further newtype research.In truth however, there was only one miracle child, the Rita Bernal. Her abilities are found and she’s modified in order to become the pilot for the third Unicorn Gundam unit, Phenex. However during joint evaluation tests with the Banshee, the Phenex loses control, turning into destroy mode, destroying the bridge of the “Shallot”, and escaping the federation in an event known as the “Shallot Incident”. Since then, the Phenex was lost and never seen again. However, due to the events of Unicorn and it’s usage of psycoframe, the Phenex reappears, once again showing mystical powers like dismantling machinery and communication of souls, something that we saw during the ending of Unicorn. Since then, both the Zeon and Federation want to recapture the Phenex, and harness the power that it has obtained since then.The story follows Jona Basta, one of the false “Miracle Children”, and a very, very close friend of Rita. During The Shallot Incident, Rita went missing along with the Phenex, and her disappearance has haunted him since. He joins the operation with the intention of one goal, to see Rita again. There’s a lot more to the story of course, but I’ll leave that to the actual movie to showcase. This film is very focused on newtypes and their potential, far more so than any other UC entry. If you’re a fan of realistic war stories of UC like 08th MS Team or War in the Pocket and only those, you aren’t going to find a lot of that here. Of course, the theme of “war sucks and people in power are awful” still holds true, that’s a Gundam staple, but in comparison, Narrative delves far more into the mysterious side of UC.Gonna be honest, the actual story can be considered a problem, simply because not everything is explored enough. Not everything gets an explanation, it also expects you to piece together parts of the story through your prior UC knowledge. The newtype potential is never actually given any solid answer of explanation, and you can take this one of three ways. The first one is lazy writing and leaving plot holes. The second one is seeing it as messages left to interpretation or theorise about. The third, and what I believe, is that the writers want to keep newtypes a mystery, as the theme of newtypes being impossible for humans to truly understand is an underlying theme.The story could’ve also been longer in order to focus more on the actual lore of certain characters but if you ask me, it’s not a requirement. This is why you watch this as a fan of UC. It generalises a lot of origins of characters and events because it’s assuming you’re familiar with UC, however that’s also the merit. There are an insane amount of links and callbacks to the entirety of UC. Characters remember events that happened in earlier UC series, that or they were literally directly affected by them. This is why I compare this to Avengers: Endgame, there are so many things in Narrative that mean nothing if you’re not familiar with UC, but if you are, they become some of the best scenes and callbacks to it, and you like the characters because of it.The story is not perfect, but it’s serviceable and if you ask me, heavily enjoyable, and if you’re a UC fan, you’re going to get a lot out of every little reference.Art: 8The art style is very similar to Unicorn before it, with a style that relies heavily on color usage and scene palette that while looks nice, isn’t too cleanly “refined”. It’s got little streaks in the lines and movements, like it was less “digitally made” and more “physically made” even if it’s obvious this is mostly digital animation. It’s a style that makes Narrative feel like a modern UC work like Unicorn, but also has the “imperfect” tone of the much older Gundam series, obviously to give the best of both worlds.What I love about the art style is that, it captures the tone of classic UC series perfectly while also taking the advancements in anime animation. There are a lot of cues and imagery used from classic UC, like the Newtype flash and the purple scene pallet for newtype mind immersion, but reimagined and refined in a more modern light. It’s main charm is how well it captures UC rather than the quality itself, not saying that the animation is bad by any stretch though. Things like the Phenex’s psycoframe is beautiful, and the mech animations are on point. But the usage of homages and such is what really stands out.Sound: 10Easily the best part of the film from a quality standpoint. The sound design is top notch in every category. Starting with the foley and SFX, everything is amazing, from the power of the beams, the force of the thrusters, and the mystic powers of psycoframe, the sound is top notch. Everything sounds so good, I cannot exemplify it enough. The sound design is godlike and everything sounds super well down. Not painfully realistic, but if you’re into high tech sounding stuff and huge force, you’re gonna love it.Score-wise, it’s perfect. Hiroyuki Sawano is always known for his fantastic use of techno beats and drops to make some truly epic scenes feel that much more impactful. Some of the tracks are remixed tracks of Unicorn, but that doesn’t change the fact that those tracks to begin with was top Sawano. The hype doesn’t just come from the drops, throughout the movie there’s a constant thrill created by Sawano’s fast techno tracks that just convey the rush of the power of these machines and the speed of the chase. It’s an absolute ride and Sawano’s score completes every combat scene. Even when it’s not combat, the tracks can be peaceful and have a beating heart that fits the scene it needs to. The ending has this accepting open sounding song and I can’t say enough, the sound design is perfect.Character: 7This is probably the weakest part of the film overall due to one thing: movie runtime. The characters simply are not fully delved into or properly developed due to it. A lot of the characters’ motives and origins are left for the watcher to assume and piece together as they watch the film, and it never explicitly states enough of the backstory for the film to truly make these characters realised.Despite this, I can say this, the characters are very likeable. A lot of the characters are simple but all do their job, although the only ones I can really talk about are the main cast. Jona Basta is a very simple protagonist with the sole goal of being with those he loves. His family was killed at a young age, and he’s only left with his best friends Rita and Michele, they are figuratively his everything, especially Rita, who acted as a guiding light to his early life. When Rita disappears and Michele seemingly betrays his trust, he’s left distraught and full of regret, with his only goal in life being to find the Phenex and reunite with Rita. I like Jona, his goal is simple but believable. It’s only natural for him to want to cling onto the remaining people he loves.Michele is by far the most interesting of the three. She is the only one that isn’t “pure good”, as while every goal she has is well-intentioned, she is also willing to do questionable things in order to reach them. As she was adopted by the Luios through lying that she was the real Miracle Child, she was let out from the newtype training facility. As a result, Rita and Jona were left to be studied as newtypes, which is why Jona felt betrayed by her. However, her intentions were not selfish, and that she merely wanted power to retrieve her friends when she could. By then though, Rita had already disappeared along with the Phenex, and she has to hold that burden. She has the most depth and interesting concepts, however the movie doesn’t focus on her enough to have everything she represents resolved perfectly.The final character, Rita, has the least to say about her actual character. Rita is the definition of a purehearted and kind girl, being the one who kept Jona’s spirits high since childhood and is a guiding light. We aren’t shown much about her, but we are shown that she was very close to the two, and cherished them a lot. Sadly, despite being the miracle child, she was experimented on and made to pilot the Phenex, and she lost herself when the Phenex ran wild and escaped. I won’t say more, as most of the things related to her are spoilers to the actual plot. But I will say, Rita is the most important character in the entire film and continues to be the most kindhearted, and it all relates to the Phenex.The Phenex itself can also be considered a character of it’s own, which you’ll see become very evident once you see the film. The Phenex has a will of it’s own and acts on it’s own. It is a guardian of humanity, but will not allow itself to be restrained by them. It appears for the sole purpose of protecting humanity, and that’s even made evident by the theme “VigilaNTe”.Other than that, there isn’t much to say. Zoltan is very energetic as a villain but is also very barebones and underdeveloped, he could’ve used more depth to him. The Schezarr team are probably the most grounded characters, Iago especially is likeable for his relatability as a pilot and due to something that’s revealed in the film that I’m sure audiences that know their UC can relate to. It’s characters have fantastic concepts, and the biggest problem is that they aren’t looked into enough.Enjoyment: 10Even with these flaws, I’d be lying if I said I was bothered by them. I’ve seen this movie three times in 24 hours, enjoying it to hell each time and connecting the pieces together, with the story making more and more sense upon each rewatch. It’s thrilling, it has unique concepts that delve into the possibilities of newtypes and humanity’s control on it. The space chances were thrilling, the Phenex was amazing, and seeing it all with beautiful animation and Sawano’s intense score made it such an experience.A lot of people criticise the film for being too short and underdeveloped, and I understand it. However, I think the film doesn’t REQUIRE it either. We know what we need to for the characters, we know their goals, the story, and the intended message. Sure, Zoltan is very basic as an antagonist, and the characters in general feel underdeveloped. Still, I’ve never felt unsatisfied on any of my watches, if anything, I get more impressed by the narrative (heh) of the movie and the story it tried to tell. I love Jona, and I merely want him to be happy with his friends. I love the Phenex, a beautiful machine that humanity cannot understand. The symbolism, the meaning, combined with awesome fights and sounds made it all so enjoyable.Overall: 8This film is not for every gundam fan, it will never be by nature of focusing on an aspect of gundam that’s always been very wishy washy, that being newtype shenanigans. However those that are able to see the characters and the story as what they are instead of what they could be can potentially really enjoy the movie. Narrative is just a thrilling ride of pure mecha action that’s still combined with the classic Gundam message of humanity’s conflicts, the underlying themes of oldtypes misunderstanding the idea of Newtypes and trying to use it as strengthening power rather than letting people change for the better and be free.There’s so many scenes that mean so much to those that are fans of the UC, and if anything, this movie was clearly made by people who loved the original UC series. It’s for fans of UC, it’s for those who know their lore and want to see a continuation of the early stages of the timeline. People may not love it, and that’s fine, but if you’re a gundam fan, consider giving it a watch, you’ll find something to enjoy. everything. Focus on the original shows and film. Do you love the original Mobile Suit Gundam? Do you love Zeta Gundam? Do you love ZZ Gundam and Char’s Counterattack? If you do, if you really do, then you should probably watch this movie.Did you think Unicorn was “neat but not amazing” but still enjoyed all the callbacks to UC?

Whether bc of lore, locations, power scaling, characters, or the geopolitical situation, this is not an entry level Gundam. On one hand that’s good because it can get right into the good stuff, but on the other hand, it’s a damn shame bc this was an excellent Gundam movie, and not as many people can enjoy it.The fights were beautiful, flashy, and made sense based on power levels (looking at you original Gundam). Of the Gundams I’ve...watched, this one has the most dialogue during battles, which I’m not sure how I feel about but it definitely wasn’t disruptive enough to be a strong negative.The story was great and told really well. It used flashbacks to the MCs’ childhoods a lot but they did it in a way that was both interesting and non-repetitive and mostly non-disruptive. My biggest complaint would be that the antagonist was a “Big Bad Guy” something that really no Gundam (that I’ve watched) had done. Big Bad Guys aren’t nearly as interesting because the second you see them you automatically think “oh this guy is evil.” You don’t get the chance to hear them out first - if they even have anything to say. Sgt Zoltan, the Big Bad Guy, actually did have a real motivation which was revealed in the last few scenes but even that was only inserted at the end when you already had an unchangeable opinion of him (the motivation sucked anyway which is also a negative).

The first one was ""how can I make sense of all the newtype bullshit in gundam?"", ""How can I make a thematic end to UC?"" and, ""Why is there no psycho-frame in F91?"" Fukui tried to make sense...of what a newtype is by retconning everything we previously knew about new types by giving his own definition. But to understand what the issue with this is we will need to understand what a newtype is and what\'s so wrong with NT\'s version.Newtypes have never been easy to explain but if I had to sum it up in two word\'s it would be ""wordless understanding"", one of the major themes of gundam is understanding. If all humans could understand what everyone felt then we wouldn\'t have these petty conflicts beyond ourselves, if humans could understand each other they could stop fighting and build a better world for each other, and not trying to make it worse. This is the direction char\'s counterattack went and it works as a perfect conclusion for that as it sums up all of gundam\'s thematic ideas as well and laying to rest the story of the characters. Then there is gundam NT which tries to change it so newtypes are ""humans who can reach into another dimension where the souls of the dead exist and that they can manipulate this dimension to do all kinds of things, including time travel"". Does this answer some of the newtype bullshit present in other series? It can but at that point, you are bending over backwards to provide an answer for gundam because it is not giving you one. Does this completely damage any of the previous thematic aspects of gundam? Absolutely, if new types are more akin to Jedi\'s or sorcerous then some of the pivotal moments of the series lose all their impact.

Just don\'t take its plot ramifications too seriously. of what a newtype is by retconning everything we previously knew about new types by giving his own definition. But to understand what the issue with this is we will need to understand what a newtype is and what\'s so wrong with NT\'s version.Newtypes have never been easy to explain but if I had to sum it up in two word\'s it would be ""wordless understanding"", one of the major themes of gundam is understanding. If all humans could understand what everyone felt then we wouldn\'t have these petty conflicts beyond ourselves, if humans could understand each other they could stop fighting and build a better world for each other, and not trying to make it worse. This is the direction char\'s counterattack went and it works as a perfect conclusion for that as it sums up all of gundam\'s thematic ideas as well and laying to rest the story of the characters. Then there is gundam NT which tries to change it so newtypes are ""humans who can reach into another dimension where the souls of the dead exist and that they can manipulate this dimension to do all kinds of things, including time travel"". Does this answer some of the newtype bullshit present in other series? It can but at that point, you are bending over backwards to provide an answer for gundam because it is not giving you one. Does this completely damage any of the previous thematic aspects of gundam?

Nothing about this felt like a Gundam property - the returning cameos from Unicorn are barely seen and look awful without YAS's guiding hand - Mineva Zabi looks okay, but mostly because she stays seated in a chair and doesn't turn her head or change expressions.    The rest of the characters look like turn of the century central casting - the female lead looks like low-budget Faye Valentine, the flashbacks to the kids...look like Elfen Lied.    And everything has a bad fit and finish to it - even the promotional stills for this have a grainy, digipaint quality to them - nothing like the high polish of Unicorn.      Oh yeah - and did I mention that there's this time travelling golden 3rd Gundam that looks like a throwaway concept from Zoids?    Everything about this is a weird revival of the worst tropes of late 90s/early 2000s anime - fisheyed cockpit views of maniacal unglued evil guy while he cackles being the thing I keyed in on.     Anyway, this was just a giant disappointment and in the Fathom Events showing I was at, there were people from 5 to 70 watching and NONE of them seemed to be very enthused by the time the credits rolled. look like Elfen Lied.

None of the characters are particularly interesting or fleshed out. Especially the ultimate villain. He's literally nothing and his mecha are just retreads of stuff from the Unicorn series.There's interesting nuggets in the overall story but nothing to actually give this movie a reason to exist.ART: Also messy. The designs are good, but the actual implementation and animation are not great all the time. Some returning characters look really derpy.SOUND: Sawano score so if you've heard one of his OSTs you know what you're in for. Dub...was fine. Not amazing just fine. Good overall sound design for the foley.It's a fine ride (in theatre) but outside of the theatre its not worth it imo. It doubles down on the most controversial part of UC Gundam (newtypes) so if you're a 0083/08th MS/Thunderbolt kinda fan, don't bother.

Personally, I actually enjoyed this more than Unicorn, but that\'s because enduring Unicorn is like watching paint dry, paint that retcons several important story elements of the universe with an incredbly silly central conflict. NT strives to improve on the formula by not having a central conflict instead.Much like my review, this film is a mess. By the virture of it being mercifully shorter than Unicorn, I enjoy it a bit more. It still suffers from nearly every problem that it\'s predecessor does. Lame characters, thin narrative, and too much super robot nonsense. I know...the franchise isn\'t afraid to dip into the supernatural once in a while, but NT officially jumps the shark into science-fantasy territory, as the powers of newtypes are expanded once again to include time travel. Nearly every battle in NT is resolved by people shooting mind lasers at each other. The conflict in this film is absolutely impossible to care about as a result.The ""story"" of this movie is as follows, three children are credited with saving a town after they have a vision of the incoming colony drop that begins the war in UC 0079. Decades later, a mysterious golden gundam is inflicting havoc on zeon and federation ships. In search of the secrets behind the psycho-frame system, both the federation, zeon and private companies begin moving to capture it for themselves. The three children find themselves interwoven with this mysterious machine, as it links to their past together.About halfway through the film, this plot is thrown out of the window. Eventually, everybody has a big fight and the film kind of ends without an actual conclusion.The main antagonist is a generic crazy man who looks like he walked out of a Tokyo Ghoul cosplay event. He\'s also yet another attempt to clone char, becuase NT is a distilled parody of everything people hate about modern UC. For some reason he completely derails the plot near the end and takes over the entire movie. He sucks. He really sucks.The protagonist is a strong contender with Seabook for blandest Gundam protag in history. He has no personality, barely has any scenes to himself, and generally just goes along with whatever people tell him to do. I won\'t hold it against the film that he\'s not the main focus, becuase there is something that resembles an attempt to make an ensamble cast here, it just fails at it. Most of the characters aren\'t on screen long enough to leave much of an impact.The writing in this movie is completely wretched. From the moment that the film makes it\'s first bird allegory you know you\'re in for a bad time. Discussions about god, heaven, and how being a bird isn\'t possible for a human being follow. If this sounds like something that would make you want to bash your own head in, please heed my advice and avoid watching this. The film also likes going through the same flashback over and over again, which feels like padding.This film is not good. I really hope that somebody puts this poor, abused timeline out of it\'s misery before any more of these get made. the franchise isn\'t afraid to dip into the supernatural once in a while, but NT officially jumps the shark into science-fantasy territory, as the powers of newtypes are expanded once again to include time travel.

After I fully watched and completed all of the UC timeline, I realized this movie has a lot in such a small package. It\'s a great culmination of everything that has happened in the UC timeline so far, we get some really nice fanservice, and we also get some great story with it. So I would definitely recommend watching the UC timeline up to Unicorn before watching this, or else you\'ll just be watching great animation and great music but nothing else. The characters are really awesome, and as always, Sawano kills it...with the music, even remixing some of his tracks from Unicorn. Back on my first watch I thought some of the scenes were kinda ""Ok this doesn\'t make sense."" but then I rewatched CCA, Unicorn and Zeta, and it actually does make a lot of sense that they\'re like this. Narrative adds a lot to the UC timeline and gives some new perspectives on events that we\'ve already experienced in the timeline so far, and I would say it\'s a must watch for anyone who wants to enjoy the UC timeline to the max. Seriously give this movie a try if you\'re a UC fan. with the music, even remixing some of his tracks from Unicorn.

Powerfull songs like Vigilante (that I'm quite sure represents Jonan and Rita relationship) and the ending them by LiSa, Narrative make you feel that this 1,5 hour...movie is pretty worth.If you are new to the franchise, I won't recommend you to start here, since there is a lot o references you will miss from past series, if you are already hooked on the UC timeline, this is one of the best stories told about this universe. movie is pretty worth.If you are new to the franchise, I won't recommend you to start here, since there is a lot o references you will miss from past series, if you are already hooked on the UC timeline, this is one of the best stories told about this universe."", '[Edit] As someone who watched all the Gundam series, I must say that I was excited for NT Gundam. Although the movie is fair, I have some complaints and some mixed opinions about it. Overall I think that if this was a series it would be 100% better. See more below.Story: Good story but badly directed. NT Gundam is the latest release of the UC (but not the last, chronologically), taking place after Unicorn. I would say that you need to have seen MS Gundam, Zeta Gundam, Char`s Counter Attack, and Unicorn Gundam before attempting to see NT. The story takes a HEAVY, and I...must emphasize a HEAVY focus on Newtype lore. If you are used to the UC, you know Newtypes are a big deal in this universe and NT Gundam brings them to new heights - and that`s my complaint. The UC, in general, always had a balance between the political aspects of the world and the Newtype lore, which is by default metaphysical.  NT Gundam has no balance and its 80% metaphysical. Don`t get me wrong, it is a fair movie, and you should watch, but don`t expect a compelling story. Since the Newtype lore is only acceptable by metaphysical terms, they spend half the time explaining this reality so it becomes acceptable by us, the viewers. This takes away the focus on the story and creates a gap that is filled by something we don`t actually care about and never cared until now. So far, the Newtype lore was acceptable like ""Ok, we don\'t need to understand more because is metaphysical, now give me more politics and war"". Now is ""Ok, get this, Newtypes are the core of the UC and we will revolve around them"". Thus, the story lost me in this aspect because it wasted so much time trying to convince me of the Newtype reality instead of just delivering me a story. But it is well done in its psychedelic reality. If this was a series I think it would be 10.000x better because this Newtype focus would be diluted and not invasive as it was. Also, there are way too many flashbacks and that\'s pissed me off, particularly.Art & Sound: It is the latest Gundam, so... HD, good sound, solid OST, nothing to complain. I am, though, not a big fan of the kind of rock they put in there, its a sort of pop-rock. I rather have some epic orchestra ou harmonics. But hey, it is not bad.Characters: I feel that the characters are well done and would be marvelous if this was a series. They clearly have depth, emotions, motivations, and an intricate relationship with each other, but that got rushed and butchered because of the nature of NT (a movie, not a series). Hence, you have no time to explore these characters. I don\'t have much to say here except that they are good, but they didn\'t have the time to explore them. I, once again, blame the directors. The writers did their job, but the directors\' choices butchered their potential. And surprise... no character is annoying. Victory!Mechas: Hohoho. Saying the mechas look amazing is not enough. Phenex, the major Gundam of NT is f****** amazing! Narrative is also magnificent and the others look all awesome. Phenex, of course, is similar to Unicorn and Banshee, but Narrative looks like an RX-78 Mark II fused with Unicorn. I liked to the point I want to build their gunplas now.Overall, this is a decent film, a solid addition to the UC. However, the metaphysical focus of the story created a major problem in therm of the script which diminish your enjoyment of the story. The constant use of flashbacks also affect the pace and that\'s why this should have to be a series instead of a movie. All the elements for a potential ""best UC story so far"" are there, but they did not play their cards right.

After Unicorn, NT follows and expands dramatically on the Newtype. On the other hand, there\'s much too much focus on Newtypes that it drowned all the other parts of the story. This film feels weak, though it starts to develop in an interesting way with the ever evolving Newtypes, and mankind\'s new mission to become immortal among some of the characters. Hardly any of the new characters are likeable. Jona is the only decent one though an hour and a half movie and the weak story didn\'t do enough for his character.He\'s friends with Rita,...a Newtype who really wants to be a bird. The more she said that, the funnier it got. They debate whether or not there is a heaven or hell, or reincarnation. Rita, however, is devoid of any real character, or a face for half the film. She spends the movie flying around saying the same things and talking like a child. I don\'t blame her since she was sliced up and experimented into oblivion. Michele is the third friend of the group, and has a plan the rest don\'t necessarily agree with. Compared to the other two, her interest lies with immortality and her interest in how Newtypes can still live on and communicate after death. At least, one thing this film does is show what happens to Newtypes and how harsh the experimentation is on them to the point one child busts her head open on thick glass from being so unstable.Zoltan is by far the worst part of the film. He annoyed me more than Katz. He\'s a Char reject that failed to become the new Frontal. As a result, he has this extremely annoying over the edge personality and horrible facial expressions. He is a bastardized version of Char without intelligence. Even so, he\'s so comical I couldn\'t take him seriously. I can\'t take several parts of this film seriously, in fact. There\'s the Dragon Ball tier detections the characters get, and I laughed at ""It psycommu-jacked it!"" The Newtype powers are even more out of control this time, and along with Rita and Jona\'s meaningless like bond, it felt like the climax of a kids film. Jona isn\'t even that good of a pilot, he just happens to have the ridiculous powers of the glittery rainbow. Then there\'s the poster for this that looks just awful. Mineva doesn\'t do much besides sitting in the dark which is a waste of her character after her build up in Unicorn.I can\'t be too harsh at least. The best parts of this definitely were the original Gundam, Zeta, and ZZ flashbacks. Unicorn characters do return, though the poor production values made many look unrecognizable or bland. Some of the new minor characters are drawn so odd they feel out of place.With this film I was fighting with the pause button for better things to spend my time on. The production values dropped so much on this film that it feels depressing. It could have tried to be better as a theatrical release, and yet the downgrade is so painfully obvious.

Otherwise, the story is very thin granted just enough to be its own 90 minute entry.Gundam NT has amazing art, animation, score (thanks Sawano), the VAing can get your spine feeling chilly for how well the actors played their part, the MS designs don't stray from previous entries...yet feel distinct enough for you to pick certain models out from a crowd.TLDR, Gundam NT is an enjoyable movie thanks to the visual and audio design, only let down by how much context is required and how little plot they tried to fit into a 90 minute timeframe. yet feel distinct enough for you to pick certain models out from a crowd.TLDR, Gundam NT is an enjoyable movie thanks to the visual and audio design, only let down by how much context is required and how little plot they tried to fit into a 90 minute timeframe."", 'After seeing Dragon Ball Super: Broly on the big screens (and the last couple of DB movies) I really wanted Sunrise to put out a good Gundam movie.

This movie proves that Sunrise has no respect for their franchise and that the Japanese Gundam fanboys will literally just accept anything because of their love for robots punching face.

If you enjoy the Gundam\'s Universal Century timeline entries for its grounded take on mecha combat, and for pioneering its approach to ""real robot"" mecha lore, Gundam NT is NOT the film for you.I\'m going to cover most of the things I disliked about it, and then end on a positive note with some things I enjoyed. I will do my best to avoid major spoilers but be warned there may be some.First off, do NOT see this movie if you\'re not caught up on all the other UC shows, at least through Zeta, and preferably through Char\'s Counter Attack. All of which...are pretty much mandatory for background going into Unicorn, which NT is an extension of. So there you go. If you go into this blind you will have absolutely no clue what it going on.With Gundam NT, they\'ve taken the Newtype Space Magic and leaned even more heavily into it than they did with Unicorn, while also recycling ideas from Unicorn. In other words, between Newtype Powers seemingly being the answer to every problem, and the ""Destroy Mode"" of the Unicorn and Phoenix type suits, we\'ve pivoted fully away from Real Robot and into Super Robot. This alone was enough disappointment for me.As far as characters go, the new ones are pretty interesting, or at least they could have been. Our protagonist Jonah is the audience proxy character, he is largely devoid of agency as we are supposed to see ourselves in him. He\'s fine. The female lead, Michele, is the most compelling of the three but her motivations are somewhat convoluted. The third character, Rita, seems like she\'ll be really important at the beginning but becomes grating for reasons I\'ll mention later. We\'re given the impression that we\'re supposed to care about her, but we\'re never really given a reason to, so when a certain plot beat hits, it rings empty, because I didn\'t really care about her one way or another.Existing characters are great to see on the big screen. I really enjoyed the references to the older series, especially the flashback to Zeta and hearing Char giving his speech, and glimpses of older Gundams. While these were probably my favorite moments of the film as a fan of the classics, the other appearances of existing characters seemed more out of fan service than in service to the narrative. When Banagher appears, he does and says nothing of importance other than exist. Minerva Zabi seems to only be on screen to remind us that she\'s alive in her big empty throne room.But, that brings me to the main villain. Oh, boy. Not only is he a literal Char Clone, he seems to be pulled straight out of some kind of 2008 teen movie with a super emo bully antagonist. He is poorly written, his motivations are ridiculous - he\'s just a bad guy because he\'s the bad guy, there is nothing compelling here. Every time he had screen time I just cringed. It\'s such a shame because Gundam has had so many compelling rival / villains, and to know that Zoltan will be in the same league of rivals as Char Aznable and Anavel Gato is disappointing.As far as the mechs go, they\'re ... fine. The Phenex Gundam is an interesting design, but again, it\'s very Super Robot. Same for the Gundam NT, which is not only not really given enough time to shine, but has its own Super Robot leanings like its magic box trap thing. It seems like in most Gundam shows the mechs themselves are characters, but in Gundam NT, they seem like afterthoughts, only there to sell Gunpla (more than normal).The animation, in action, is messy. I can relate it best to seeing one of the Michael Bay transformers movies. You know there\'s robots fighting, but they\'re moving so fast that it\'s hard to make out any of the details, it\'s even hard to follow the action itself. Again, back to super robots - gone is the weight and power of classic UC Real Robots. It\'s like the difference between Pacific Rim 1 and Pacific Rim 2. Finally, there\'s an ""ass-pull"" in the ""final boss"" mecha that Zoltan pulls out of nowhere. I literally rolled my eyes. It is unoriginal and nonsensical.I think the most grating thing in the movie though is Rita, and more specifically, a flashback that plays over. And over. And over. About every ten minutes you\'ll hear Rita say something about how she doesn\'t know if heaven is real, but that she knows souls are real and there is an afterlife. I don\'t know how many times you will hear this, I lost count, but it\'s a lot. It\'s too many. By the time you see the whole scene at the end of the film you\'re already sick of it.And speaking of that phrase, so much of this movie has to deal with supernatural space magic stuff. Yes, I understand that we have established that Newtypes have at least some ability to exist after death, but I always interpreted it as having been imprinted into the souls of other newtypes, like with Amuro taking on the strength of Lalah. But in NT, they pretty much clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that there are newtype spirit ghosts that haunt things. And it\'s just ... kinda silly.Music was a little over the top at times, but not terrible. Coming off the heels of Thunderbolt, which has amazing music, this was also disappointing.The story itself felt really stretched out. I was checking my watch about halfway through the movie. I dont know if it\'s a pacing problem necessarily or that they tried to squeeze too much in, but for as simple as the story is, it felt really long-winded. It also starts with a plot hole, which is never a good sign - Rita as a child has a Newtype vision of the 0079 colony drop and manages to save a town of people. But if she\'s an Earthling, how does she has newtype powers? Who listened to an unstable child enough to say yeah let\'s evacuate off this crazy kid\'s hunch? Right?On the plus side. Parts of the movie are very well animated, particularly the opening scenes during 0079 with the birds. When the Gundams are still they look great, like when the Narrative Gundam is in the hangar bay and Jonah is being extracted while other pilots watch. The action scene with some grunt suits chasing down a car was really neat too, I enjoyed the scale shown there quite a bit. As I mentioned, the references to older series was a highlight for me, though all too brief.In conclusion:+ Nice art & animation, when you can see it+ Fun references for veteran fans+ It\'s new- Uninteresting characters- Meandering story- Action scenes are hard to follow or enjoy- Bad villain- - Excessive Newtype Space Magic Nonsense- - Hearing a quote about Newtype Space Magic Nonsense over and over againI sincerely hope the next UC movie, which trailered the end of this film, is better than this one was.

Unicorn was good, not the best but good. This is just 89 minutes to waste your time.It doesn't add anything really new to the series. We know there's life for newtypes after death, It's been there since the start of the series with Lalah and Zeta and ZZ and pretty much most of the mainline UC media. The flashbacks that aren't series call backs just waste your time with the same lines being said as if you forgot the words said 5 minutes before. or in the last hour. The story is just a waste...since there's nothing good in there. Characters are meh at best and the villain is the blandest one possible with no defining character trait. There's nothing new and is just a rehashing of everything of the prior mainline UC media. We had better in the prior and you should've watched that prior.Art is worse than Unicorn, not terrible but okay at best.Sound is good for the most part, beam rifles sound bland AF compared to even the older rifles.One of the most skippable of the series. it doesn't even add much from the prequel that it's coming from. We only learn that Psycho Frames are banned. Nothing on the ramifications of the Laplace's box, not even how people feel about newtypes being officially noticed and treated as a protected class.There is no reason to watch this. since there's nothing good in there.

I don't think people should be biased coming into this, since as a stand-alone it definitely doesn't deserve to be rated under 7 (for context Yugioh ArcV is at 6.88).Gundam has been pretty disappointing when it comes to fights recently. But I disagree with the shits who prefer fights from spinoffs like Gundam Build Fighters to Thunderbolt or NT, Thunderbolt...and NT's stories may be substanceless but undeniably the art and soundtrack make them much cooler (and the whole point of watching gundam is robot freud manly coolness). The fight from the trailer between NT and Phenex was badass and more hype than some of the Unicorn fight scenes. The final boss fight and ending is kind of meh, but it's passing, a 7/10. The art definitely carries, and I don't think the soundtrack is bad - people hating on the genre probably shouldn't be allowed to rate it, it would be like telling someone who doesn't drink to rate a chardonnay.The MC is kind of a pancake but given the amount of content they wanted to cram and the story direction it's kind of hard to do any meaningful character development. I've seen worse for less satisfaction. A lot of this is really based on how cool the suits looked, the battles, and the consistency. and NT's stories may be substanceless but undeniably the art and soundtrack make them much cooler (and the whole point of watching gundam is robot freud manly coolness).

I just wanted to clarify that the information was accurate, well I want to say is that this event indeed happen during a time when the three main characters where just innocent children caught up in a terrible situation. They did the best hey could to survive, all of them. The fact they made this type go gundam to catch another? proves that both the feddis and neo zeon were both indeed desperate people, bought fighting, but fighting on opposite sides of...one another. one another.', 'I went in into Narrative expecting a dumpster fire of a movie that tried to piggyback itself into the heart of the viewers by referencing older Gundam works, want to guess what i got? Yeah, it couldn\'t even do that, it couldn\'t even made me go ""Oh! look, that\'s something that Kamille did in Zeta!, or look! i know that! that\'s like the ZZ\'s High Mega Cannon!""STORYBut, let\'s start from the beginning, aka, the story, this part of the review contains spoilers for the entire movie, and its gonna be long, very long, but the thing is so bad i just HAVE to talk about...it, also, i actually encourage you to read through it so that you can save yourself an hour and a half of time and fucking go watch De:vadasy or something.The story is...so paper thin, that you could say its literally two-dimensional, half of the fucking story doesn\'t make any sense and has no explanation whats so ever, except for ""Newtype Autism!"".I actually believe it was written by somebody who just glanced over the wikipedia page for the classic UC quadrilogy and thought ""well, adding this and this would be neat, oh, of course my characters must shit all over Amuro, Kamille and Judau! who cares about them? Banagher? oh yes, yes, he is shit too compared to my characters!"".Starting in, if you watched 0079, you probably remember that the Feddies started taking Zeon seriously when they dropped a goddamn colony on Sydney and killed millions, but...what if, nobody was actually killed? why? cause of three random kids that randomly developed newtype powers and advised everyone to get the fuck out of there? yes, if you are asking, no, those kids never went to space, they just randomly got Newtype autism out of nowhere.The story continues in UC.097, one year after the Laplace box incident, we find ourselves involved in a peculiar situation...a Gundam chase, so then, what Gundam are we chasing? is it the Unicorn? did the Nu return from Beyond the time? did Jesus Yamato open a portal to the UC timeline? is Gigantis (cough cough Ideon) out for blood? no, unfortunately, but well, what if i told you that there was another Gundam in the UC project, one even more powerful than both the Unicorn and the Banshee: The Phenex, a Gundam which went missing the day that the Laplace box was unsealed.After a small fight scene, we are introduced to our main characters back to earth, Jona and Michele being two of three grown up kids that saved the Aussies back in the day.Then, the movie tells us that after Laplace box, the Federation dismantled both the Unicorn and the Banshee cause they where too dangerous to be left functioning, and then, for some retarded ass reason, they created another Psycho-frame, NTR...D capable Gundam, called ""Narrative"", Jona, being the main character of the movie, is of course the pilot of it.The second character of the trio, Michele, is introduced as a fortuneteller and is somewhat able to see the future using her Newtype abilities, she used this apparent power to make her company ""Luio e Co"" rise to be successfull and gain support from the federation.After being introduced to them, we are immediately shot up in space, where we see the Narrative Gundam in action during a training session, and see that Jona is actually a pretty bad pilot all things considered, even tho he is supposedly Cyber-Enhanced, or at least the pilots he is training with believe so.Oh wait, let\'s talk for a second about Cyber-Newtypes, or Enhanced humans as Japs like to call them, in particular, the ones that the Feddies made: rolling back our story a bit, after the trio of kids that saved Sydney, nicked, Miracle Kids where discovered, they where immediately sought after by the Titans, and where brought to one of the many institutes that enhanced people to create Newtypes.The conditions where very harsh to our poor trio of protagonists, since the Titans discovered that only one of them was actually a decent newtype, and so where thinking about something that would cause the kids to reveal who is it between them, considering that they also had to deliver the NT to a company: Luio e Co.Things weren\'t really the best for our protagonists too, especially cause Michele wanted Jona to throw his sausage into her hallway, but the latter would have much rather thrown in into the the third miracle kid: Rita, with Rita being the true Newtype of the trio.The Titans come out with a plan, if they don\'t spill the beans about who the Newtype is, two of the kids are gonna end up dead in the end, Michele overhears them, and convinces Jona to reveal that Rita is the Newtype...and then things start making much less sense, with Michele being taken to Luio e Co instead of Rita? the latter being Cyber-Enhanced and Jona living on without modifications of any kind and getting kicked out once best girl Kamille lets the AEUG win the Gryps war.Returning to 0097, our protagonists are able to track down the Phenex, and follow him...but they aren\'t alone, a band of Neo Zeon remnants is also tracking down the Phenex, with one of them being a failed Full Frontal that went crazy due to the modifications done to his body, piloting, a Sinanju stein that also uses a Psycho-frame, also, has another Neo Zeong prototype just lying around.So, both sides enter a side 6 colony to follow the Phenex, but discover that the Psycho-frames where resonating and their respective detectors picked up eachother instead of the Gundam, so a fight starts, and the Narrative is losing pretty badly to our failed Full Frontal.The Phenex intervenes and we discover that the pilot of it is none other than Rita, who lets us in on 30 minutes of flashbacks in which literally nothing happens, Jona gets angry cause he discovers the truth about why Michele made him spill the beans, and starts going Berserk, so much so that he drags the Neo Zeong prototype out of FFFs mothership and starts wrecking the poor colony killing tens of thousands at the very least.Rita stops him using Newtype autism and reveals to him that she is actually dead, and that the only thing keeping her alive is the psycho-frame that keeps her soul anchored, and then...cut to another 10 minutes of flashbacks, Rita uses her omega-newtype retardation to go beyond the speed of light, and then back to some ship talking, that reveal the intentions of Michele:And bear with me, this entire paragraph will be some of the most retarded shit in any Gundam mediaBasically, she wants the Phenex\'s Psycho-frame so that she can use it to make everybody immortal by trapping their souls in machines...cause, that makes any fucking sense, oh, and apparently Newtypes are now some kind of higher dimensional entity and the Neo Zeong is also not from this dimension, why you may be asking? cause Char gave the plans of the Psycho-frame to fucking Full Frontal after his death with Newtype wanking, even tho technology similiar to it, like the Psycommu was in use since fucking 0080 at least, or, are you telling me that the Gundam Alex is a not from this dimension? or that some random Newtype ghost came in and gave the plans to the feddies or something?.I swear, when i first read this, i thought i had the wrong subs or something, checking in...no...seems like i this is it...Anyway, this leads to the final fight against FFFs Sinanju/Neo Zeong, it goes down as expected:The Narrative and the Neo Zeong fight, then Phenex shows up, and the Neo Zeong pulls up his trick card, FFF intends to pull up Gundam Villains favourite weapons: Gas, and make it explode so that it destroys an entire colony side, the debris would then fall to earth and...you know where this is going, freeze the earth and yada yada...Long story short, the Neo Zeong uses ultra autism to win, but then Michele sacrifices herself and lets the Narrative go all sparkly and Jona to have his anime moment, culminating in him getting into the Phenex and kicking FFFs ass, and using the Phenex retardation powers to stop the gas from exploding.In the end, before he goes beyond the time, he gets saved by our favourite Banana making a cameo, and the movie ends here, even toh both Rita and Michele are now dead lol.So...let us make a Tl;dr out of all of this""MY CHARACTERS ARE THE BEST THING EVER! AND NEWTYPES ROCKKK!!!!""That\'s this movie summed up, all of it, from Rita going at the speed of light using Newtype autism to the entire Phenex thing, to a trio of kids retconning the start of the OYW out of existence, there is nothing, in this story, that you can find likable, at least as long as you have watched at least 10 decent anime and aren\'t a complete newfag to the genreARTI am gonna be rather short, the art is good and the animation is solid, this being a Sunrise anime after all, but i still don\'t like the CGI mixed in with 2d artSOUNDInstead of Unicorn\'s orchestral soundtrack, in Narrative, there\'s a generic J-pop mix, along with some other modern genres, for what there is in there, its even mediocre in of itselfCHARACTERSJona ""Rita have my children"" BastaMichele ""Jona why won\'t you give me your children"" LuioRita ""I have the biggest Newtype dick of them all"" BernalZoltan ""I am another Char clone but i look like a punk now"" AkkanenENJOYMENTIf i was a masochist, i think i would have had the biggest boner of my life, but, i am not, therefore, i found no enjoyment in Narrative, and if you aren\'t new to Gundam, neither will you, so, don\'t watch it and forget it ever existed, there is nothing redeaming about this, while Unicorn had a ton of problems, at least it had a solid base that you could work on and find some positive aspects, and Miss Marida of course, which was my light in the dark while i was watching it.But Narrative? Narrative had nothing going for it, the story was vomit inducing and a collection of tropes, the art was just okay (which is not enough for a fucking Sunrise film, a company which held the top spot in animation by 1987 when CCA was released), the music was bland as fuck pop , and our protagonists where some of the worst and most stereotyped characters to ever come out of any anime.If works like G Gundam, After War X or 00 make me believe that other authors are actually able to approach the Gundam franchise in a decent manner without help from Tomino, and create fun stories that are absolutely worth sitting in 50 episodes, and that make you feel pure emotions of Joy and Sadness, then works like Narrative make me believe that Tomino should just prohibit anyone else from writing Gundam and secure the copyright for it forever it, also, i actually encourage you to read through it so that you can save yourself an hour and a half of time and fucking go watch De:vadasy or something.The story is...so paper thin, that you could say its literally two-dimensional, half of the fucking story doesn\'t make any sense and has no explanation whats so ever, except for ""Newtype Autism!"".I actually believe it was written by somebody who just glanced over the wikipedia page for the classic UC quadrilogy and thought ""well, adding this and this would be neat, oh, of course my characters must shit all over Amuro, Kamille and Judau! who cares about them?

or that some random Newtype ghost came in and gave the plans to the feddies or something?.I swear, when i first read this, i thought i had the wrong subs or something, checking in...no...seems like i this is it...Anyway, this leads to the final fight against FFFs Sinanju/Neo Zeong, it goes down as expected:The Narrative and the Neo Zeong fight, then Phenex shows up, and the Neo Zeong pulls up his trick card, FFF intends to pull up Gundam Villains favourite weapons: Gas, and make it explode so that it destroys an entire colony side, the debris would then fall to earth and...you know where this is going, freeze the earth and yada yada...Long story short, the Neo Zeong uses ultra autism to win, but then Michele sacrifices herself and lets the Narrative go all sparkly and Jona to have his anime moment, culminating in him getting into the Phenex and kicking FFFs ass, and using the Phenex retardation powers to stop the gas from exploding.In the end, before he goes beyond the time, he gets saved by our favourite Banana making a cameo, and the movie ends here, even toh both Rita and Michele are now dead lol.So...let us make a Tl;dr out of all of this""MY CHARACTERS ARE THE BEST THING EVER! AND NEWTYPES ROCKKK!!!!""That\'s this movie summed up, all of it, from Rita going at the speed of light using Newtype autism to the entire Phenex thing, to a trio of kids retconning the start of the OYW out of existence, there is nothing, in this story, that you can find likable, at least as long as you have watched at least 10 decent anime and aren\'t a complete newfag to the genreARTI am gonna be rather short, the art is good and the animation is solid, this being a Sunrise anime after all, but i still don\'t like the CGI mixed in with 2d artSOUNDInstead of Unicorn\'s orchestral soundtrack, in Narrative, there\'s a generic J-pop mix, along with some other modern genres, for what there is in there, its even mediocre in of itselfCHARACTERSJona ""Rita have my children"" BastaMichele ""Jona why won\'t you give me your children"" LuioRita ""I have the biggest Newtype dick of them all"" BernalZoltan ""I am another Char clone but i look like a punk now"" AkkanenENJOYMENTIf i was a masochist, i think i would have had the biggest boner of my life, but, i am not, therefore, i found no enjoyment in Narrative, and if you aren\'t new to Gundam, neither will you, so, don\'t watch it and forget it ever existed, there is nothing redeaming about this, while Unicorn had a ton of problems, at least it had a solid base that you could work on and find some positive aspects, and Miss Marida of course, which was my light in the dark while i was watching it.But Narrative? Narrative had nothing going for it, the story was vomit inducing and a collection of tropes, the art was just okay (which is not enough for a fucking Sunrise film, a company which held the top spot in animation by 1987 when CCA was released), the music was bland as fuck pop , and our protagonists where some of the worst and most stereotyped characters to ever come out of any anime.If works like G Gundam, After War X or 00 make me believe that other authors are actually able to approach the Gundam franchise in a decent manner without help from Tomino, and create fun stories that are absolutely worth sitting in 50 episodes, and that make you feel pure emotions of Joy and Sadness, then works like Narrative make me believe that Tomino should just prohibit anyone else from writing Gundam and secure the copyright for it forever', 'Can\'t escape feeling like a spinoff rather than sequel.I enjoyed the movie and it\'s quick pace. The core relationship between the three main characters was interesting enough, and the show had plenty of callbacks to prior events in the Universal Century timeline of Gundam. However, beyond some the delving into the power of Newtypes and the Psycommu system, the show can\'t shake the ""direct-to-dvd unofficial sequel"" feel.As someone who enjoys the supernatural aspect of the Newtype mythos, this movie was very informative for me, confirming longheld theories I had about what a newtype is and how key events in earlier shows manifested themselves. This is...held back by a poor enemy that really has no importance or motives beyond being deranged. Gundam is at its best when the enemy can make a good a point; this one doesn\'t even give a point besides one throwaway line.As a sequel to Unicorn, it may make some fans of the series sad that such an event happens so soon after the resolution of that series. That is the nature of the world in Gundam though; war always returns. I think as a popcorn movie it is great, for fans of Newtype shenanigans it is good, but for other Gundam fans that are hoping for more relatable and grounded themes I can definitely see where the disappointment comes from. held back by a poor enemy that really has no importance or motives beyond being deranged.

Its plot is also not significant enough to have to watch before watching the Hathaway movies.At first glance, Gundam NT mimics Gundam Unicorn with its beautiful animations and catchy soundtrack, but it falls short in terms of characters and plot.  Despite having seen most of the Gundam series from the Universal Century, including the small ovas, I was left confused as Gundam NT left out a lot of explanations for...events that ""supposedly"" happened between Gundam Unicorn and this movie.  I had hoped all of this would be explained later on in the movie, but it never was and it left me feeling like the movie was a waste of my time.In short, just skip this movie and listen to its awesome music soundtrack instead.  If you just watched Gundam Unicorn, just skip this and go straight to Hathaway. events that ""supposedly"" happened between Gundam Unicorn and this movie.

If you just watched Gundam Unicorn, just skip this and go straight to Hathaway.', 'I\'ll get this out of the way:  I hate this movie.  I went out of my way to see it and still almost walked out to stand out in the cold outside rather than watch it to it\'s predictable mind numbing conclusion.Positives first, the animation, art, and sound are all good, I am going to make this a backhanded compliment by saying that with this budget and time they really don\'t have an excuse not to be but there you go.  If you want don\'t want your eyes to bleed than this is for you.  And while the sound...quality won\'t make your ears bleed, the sounds themselves and the words they form might do that instead.Okay now to dump on the rest of this.  First of all the poster Gundam isn\'t the titular Gundam Narrative, but the Unicorn 3.  Yes somehow there was a 3rd one made that was also all gold, for some reason.  Part of me liked the first Unicorn\'s design because it looked like an actual unfinished prototype, that wasn\'t dressed up for anything other than field testing.  The Banshee I was kind of willing to overlook as the finished model but the Phenex (yes that is what they call it because subtlety doesn\'t exist in Gundam anymore) I don\'t get what they were thinking with that one.  You may be saying ""Why is this a problem?  It is the main focus of the film as the McGuffin everyone wants.""  Well it doesn\'t do anything but fly around for most of the movie, powered by what I can only assume is New Type magic another irritating holdover that doesn\'t seem to want to go away.  The Phenex seems less valuable than the other two Unicorns, it just happens to be possessed by a really powerful 23 year old force ghost.  And the problem is that while the ghost just wants to \'fly\' because symbolism, at some point you think ""Okay but maybe do something about the people chasing you besides flying away?""  Oh and the Phenex went wild a year before Unicorn happened and yet it wasn\'t important to be noteworthy until a year after the whole Laplace thing happened, so figure that one out UC historians.The conflict is completely contrived, the Zeon only really want it because of corrupt politician man, and they only come into conflict because they let an actual barely functioning psychopath lead the operation.  The Federation wants it so they can file an insurance claim I guess, or maybe the Vists filed a theft report after they and the Titans got it possessed by a force ghost.  Our protagonist wants to find it so he can find his old friend that piloted it.  Now if you haven\'t seen any promotional material or trailers you probably wouldn\'t have guessed that the pilot was dead, even though I spoiled it twice already, but from the outset it is incredibly obvious that is what happened, which is a theme throughout the entire movie.  It would honestly be more shocking to me that someone didn\'t see where this was all going than what was actually in the movie.  And the ending tries to play itself as bittersweet but the emphasis is entirely on bitter with no sweet within the context of the climax.The characters are devoid of personality, except I suppose the crazy person, who still comes off as generic crazy.  The main character is a charisma void, something that the other characters and his love interests are willing to overlook because the script needs them to grow attached to him thus making him the main character.  These characters might have worked in a medium length series that gave them time to get fleshed out, but as is they are just devices to get us to the terrible ending.  And we are introduced to another super New type who makes Char, Amuro and Lala combined look like jokes.  And she is just so pure, which means that awful things keep happening to her because this movie is bold and totally unique.  Luckily the characters are likely totally self contained to this dumpster fire, meaning that the attempt to rehabilitate Hathaway into a likable character won\'t be tainted by NT\'s terrible cast leaving Hathaway\'s Flash to combust on its own.I said the art was good but the choreography for the action is bland and forgettable, I remember the staging for the action scenes because they were interesting but what was happening was completely uninteresting.Ultimately my rating may seem hyperbolic, and maybe it is, but that is how I feel.  After watching all this Gundam I expect more from the franchise now and it really keeps letting me down and this was the biggest let down yet.  I\'m tired of watching different series paying \'homage\' to each other by ripping each other off.  I\'m tired of New Types having access to the force.  Why even watch anything from the franchise when it has become so predictable?  No I didn\'t enjoy this movie at all, it made me question why I like Gundam to begin with, leave me alone.

KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/602/KO_Seiki_Beast_Sanjuushi,"['Back in the early 90s anime was undergoing a transitional phase. One of the problems many studios faced was figuring out what would appeal to the new Western markets that had opened to the medium thanks to movies like Akira, Wings of Honneamise, Patlabor, etc. It was during this time that anime spawned some of it\'s stranger titles, one of which is KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi (KO Century Beast Warriors).The story is set the future, at a time when the Earth has been split in half. Humanity has fled to the Southern hemisphere, and the Northern world is now ruled by the Beast Tribes. However,...humanity is now attempting to reclaim the planet in an attempt to find the mysterious treasure known as Gaia. In order to facilitate this, Uranus (leader of humanity), sends V-Dan and V-Zhon, along with their sidekick Akumako, to capture the heirs of three of the main Beast Tribes - Tgier, Mermaid and Bird. Enter then, Wan Dabada, Mei Mei and Badd Mint, three of the strangest (and in the case of Wan and Badd, dumbest), prisoners/hostages in anime.Now, some of you will have noticed that the names I\'m using are different from those on MAL, Wiki, etc. Well there\'s a good reason for this. The names are taken from the original AnimeUK release of the OVA. The names were changed slightly in the US release some time later. Of the two versions though, the UK release is by far the funnier, for a number of reasons.One of the reasons why this is a very strange anime is because the show can\'t make up it\'s mind. The OVA begins as a straightforward combat comedy, however it then heads off down a mecha route, with added touches of mysticism, science fiction, and fantasy. In all honesty, while the story isn\'t particularly bad, the lack of any coherent plot direction means that the reasons for events and actions sometimes gets confusing.But that\'s only if you\'re taking this show seriously.KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi is, above all else, a comedy show, and it provides that in abundance (especially the AnimeUK release with it\'s dodgy accents). The puns and visual gags are quick and punchy, and while the comedy is a little dated in comparison to shows like Gintama, the OVA still has the capacity to make you giggle.As far as looks go, this is a fairly well animated show, especially for it\'s time. The colours are bright and bold, and while the character designs are a little on the spikey haired side, they\'re not as bad as some I could mention. The characters move well for the most part, however the animation does suffer from little oddities in a number of places, in particular during the hand to hand action sequences (surprisingly enough, the mech action sequences are pretty decent).The music for the OVA matches the visuals fairly well, however the tendency to switch from happy-boppy to overly dramatic can cause some confusion, especially when it happens before any dramatic event. The OP is a bit confusing because there\'s two to choose from. The revamped US version features a heavy rock track called B-O-M-B-E-R, which isn\'t a bad song, but I actually prefer the original, annoyingly catchy J-Pop theme tune that began ""Wandabadabadabdatta, Wandabadabadabadabadatta datta"". The original track is so annoying in fact, that you\'ll find yourself humming it decades later, even if you\'ve only heard it once.As for the voice acting, oh my, where do I begin. The revamped US version of the series is nowhere near as funny as the original AnimeUK release, and while the UK version only covered three episodes, they were a damn sight funnier because of the voice acting than the later version. That\'s not to say the voice actors were good though, as the acting is fairly mediocre in either release (I have, sadly, yet to find the Japanese version), however the UK release had one major advantage - accents.Much like the notorious accents found in the original Catgirl Nuku Nuku OVA (which, ironically enough, also came out in 1992), KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi featured a range of differing accents, from fake cockney (also known as mockney), to American, and a whole bunch in between. It\'s because of these accents that the original release had a charm that just wasn\'t present in the US re-vamp.The characters are, on the whole, a bit hit and miss. The main three in the UK release, Wan, Mei Mei and Badd, are pretty fair as comedy leads, with V-Dan and V-Zhon being suitably evil and funny as well. Unfortunately, the US version loses a lot of what made the characters funny, especially as the emphasis in that version is not on comedy, but on action. Because of this the characters, who are underdeveloped anyway, go from being decent comedy roles to mediocre action heroes/villains. The characterisations simply aren\'t strong enough to support this shift in perspective, so the viewer is left with relatively hollow characters that, while not being bad, will never be good either.To be completely honest, I prefer the original AnimeUK release to the American remake. The UK version has a charm about it that is missing from the later version in particular because a lot more thought was put into the dialogue, but one can\'t ignore the impact of those accents.That said, there will be many people who may not ever get to see the UK version, as it is a rarity in anime these days. The US version, being easier to get hold of, isn\'t a bad show on the whole, and I will admit to a degree of bias in my preference for the UK release, however the flaws are more obvious in the US version because of the emphasis on action.This, like most anime, won\'t appeal to everyone, although comedy enthusiasts and fans of mecha may enjoy it. It may also appeal to people who just want something odd and funny to watch, although there are some better choices these days.Given that there\'s more comedic diversity in anime now though, imagine what it was like trying to find funny anime in 1992. humanity is now attempting to reclaim the planet in an attempt to find the mysterious treasure known as Gaia.

Koukaku no Pandora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32214/Koukaku_no_Pandora,"['Oh man, where should I even begin with Koukaku No Pandora. First, the show didn\'t have much of a ""wow"" factor to me. I wanted to like it because it certainly was unique in its own ways however, it lacked entertainment and engaging story. Surprisingly, it failed to keep me interested and entertained. To me it seemed like the characters were forced to be cute. To explain a bit further it was like in the directors and animators minds, they were saying ""Oh lets force a clueless reaction face or cute face on Nene or Clarion to make them look cute."" Rather than having things...like that happen naturally, it was like everything was forced, and the animators, producers etc were telling me to enjoy it, however it was just so unappealing.Story- 6/10The story wasn\'t doing much for me. I could not find any joy or pleasure in watching for the story or plot... I did not feel like anything could\'ve stood out. Like, for me, there was no real ""wow factor.""Art- 8/10To a certain extent, I did like the character designs. I love cyborgs, androids, etc so seeing characters with mechanical parts is always pretty rad. I mentioned earlier that my biggest dislike was the reaction faces. I felt like they overdid the reaction faces. I strongly felt like it wasn\'t necessary at all to have reaction faces after every 2 sentences or so. The biggest thing that I disliked, about the whole damn series (In art department) was B.U.E.R. Single most annoy-ingest character in the show.I hate it\'s design that stupid third leg (penis pun, I\'m assuming.) B.U.E.R was a huge pain to look at.Sound- 7/10Yet another series where I didn\'t pay much attention to the soundtrack or BGM. I sort of hate shows like these. There are shows where the soundtracks really stand out and some shows where it\'s so dull or generic sounding that I don\'t really pay it much mind. This is one of those. Moving on to the actual voice actors, I don\'t think that this show would count as one of their best roles. Except for Junpei, he\'s hardly in anything anymore. Overall, not too impressed.Characters 6/10I couldn\'t like them, as mentioned earlier, they had too many faults for me. Not appealing in personality nor appearance. Characters in the show came off to me  as more annoying than cute or anything else.Overall, I seriously wanted to like this show. I thought at first that it had a really cute vibe to it so I figured ""why not watch it."" In the end I just do not think it was worth watching... Go figure huh?Final thoughts, Unfortunately Koukaku no Pandora just didn\'t live up to my standards or exceptions. I was very disappointed with this series in the long run. My overall rating is 5/10 it could perhaps be a lot better if certain events were taken seriously. like that happen naturally, it was like everything was forced, and the animators, producers etc were telling me to enjoy it, however it was just so unappealing.Story- 6/10The story wasn\'t doing much for me.

My overall rating is 5/10 it could perhaps be a lot better if certain events were taken seriously.', 'Koukaku no Pandora may not be for everyone (if you don\'t like moe hijinks or care about shoujo ai GET OUT), but I guess it just struck the right chord for me. While everything else about the anime was sort of ""okay,"" the characters and enjoyment value were a perfect 10 in my opinion. To break it down:Story: 8 The main plot isn\'t as important to the show as the interaction of Nene and Clarion with the other characters. Also I didn\'t really pay that close attention to the plot. In the simplest terms possible, the scientist Uzal builds a doomsday device, it goes crazy,...city is almost destroyed, cyborg Nene and android Clarion save it, Uzal disappears, bad guys try to steal the device...It\'s whatever. HOWEVER, I thought the actual setting and atmosphere of the story were really cool, mainly because I love the idea of humans attaining robotic bodies or enhancements, connecting to the web with brain implants, and in Nene\'s case, even temporarily acquiring new skills (and magical girl transformations) by downloading them. Plus there are subplots with Nene and Clarion stopping various disasters with the powers of advanced technology and friendship.Art: 7 The animation quality is kind of...lazy/budget-saving actually BUT the aesthetics are Quite cool at times (watch the OP).Sound: 7 The ED is good, everything else is fine.CHARACTER: 10. THIS is where the series shines brightest. The cast is very sweet and caring, most apparent with MC Nene, but even the minor characters are very kind. Especially the minor characters. Robert, Amy and Anna are impossible not to love. And the characters who are more self-centered, with the exception of the main villain, are hilarious so it\'s okay. Shout-out to BUER, Takumi, and Vri especially.Enjoyment: 10, especially for the shoujo ai factor.Overall: 8 city is almost destroyed, cyborg Nene and android Clarion save it, Uzal disappears, bad guys try to steal the device...It\'s whatever.

It manages to blend action, comedy, and fanservice in such a way that they don't detract from one another. When I watched the first episode, I immediately fell in love with Nene and Clarion. They are both extremely likable, and their interactions are some of the best moments of the show. The story manages to be coherent without being too simple or too complicated. The soundtrack is also spectacular, with a catchy OP and ED with cool background music. The only issue I see people having with...this show is the animation. Watching the show, you can see that they didn't have a very high budget. That being said, I don't find it to be terrible nor distracting, but I can understand why it would turn people away. All in all, Koukaku no Pandora is an extremely underrated show that deserves to be rated higher. While the animation is lacking, the story, soundtrack, and characters make it a show that I would recommend anybody check out. this show is the animation.

What we have is mostly cute robot girls doing cute robot things. Normally, I wouldn\'t mind that, but if it were a slice of life series. It also is supposed to be a comedy, but, though it was in there, it was mainly a bunch of running gags that went stale after the first reoccurrence.Characters, including the main cast,...by the end remain two-dimensional with little to no development.

This show also have a good mixture of its insane randomness and random comedy moments in the background that makes it so enjoyable to watch.Definitely would recommend to give this series a try!"", 'Ohhh so this is what happens when Ghost in the Shell turns into a moe yuri show.And coincidentally, what with LA finishing the first season of Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex quite recently as LA writes this review, this anime is a different take on this kind of setting.So Koukaku no Pandora follows a very distinct formula after it\'s introductory first episode or two. Vlind voiced by Satsumi Matsuda starts the episode off with her running gag of never saying her name out loud, next focuses on our main leads Clarion voiced by Manami Numakura a robot assigned to be Nene Nanakorobi\'s bodyguard,...this being due to Clarion\'s original owner Uzal voiced by Atsuko Tanaka ordering her to protect Nene, have Takumi Korobase voiced by Marie Miyake try to spy or her trying to secretly hack Clarion or get her hands on B.U.E.R and fail and once a huge incident (or just a simple problem arises) have Nene and Clarion ""transform"" in the most yuriest way possible (don\'t ask) and have Nene effectively solve the problem just like that. Ohh and have sprinkles of a secret ""evil but not really"" organization here and there making some backstage dealings before the major plotline arrives. End Episode. Rinse and repeat until Episode 10.Yeah, the show is incredibly formulaic and at worse, it\'s diabetically induced with it\'s yuri elements and seems to care more about it than it\'s world building (though it still does world building) as well as it\'s thematic themes of ""world peace"" which is heavily manifested in Nene due to her belief that she can bring ""World Peace"" to the island of Cenacle Island which is a cybernized island filled with problems. The yuri elements are blatant to say the least what with Nene\'s transformation is having Nene go near Clarion\'s crotch region and touching a spot to activate her Decode series (you just had to ask...), Clarion and Nene\'s relationship has the entire bodyguard tsundere and ditzy main protagonist vibe all the way through as expected moe to drive the point that this anime is more about the girls relationship with each other than the world building.The anime feels like it wants to dive into topics like ""appearance before personality"" through the difference between those people cybernized completely and just being human with cybernized parts (look at Nene\'s situation) which is something Ghost in the Shell does sure, but Ghost in Shell actually looked and dived into it\'s topic subtly, Koukaku no Pandora only lightly looks at this topic but bashes you in the head with this topic like a blaring SOS sign that yes...we get it don\'t look at appearance alone. It\'s other themes it has though LA is gonna be loose with this theme is that overly reliance on technology though it is a bit ironic in this regard due to the fact that Nene USES advanced technology to solve any wanton problem at hand for the ""sake of world peace"". LA\'s biggest problem with this is that the driving theme of this anime is world peace and Nene essentially being the almighty janitor EVERY SINGLE TIME, sure the anime KNOWS this and the anime is suppose to be a story about how a girl meets girls to achieve world peace as it\'s central focus instead, but LA just wished it could develop it\'s other themes as well and not just be a throwaway theme to add to it\'s screentime, though it is welcomed nonetheless.To this anime\'s credit, Koukaku no Pandora KNOWS what it is, even from it\'s tagline, it\'s about a girl meets girl story, NOT about Nene\'s world peace beliefs and the technological world this anime has set itself in (but more an element to it\'s story at best) and this is best presented with our two main leads of Nene and Clarion, Nene is the moe yuri element to this entire anime and sure she\'s the all mighty janitor to this entire anime but her moe tendencies do link to her and Cenacle Island\'s beliefs of wanting world peace through all the gibberishingly technological changing world the anime has set up to it. On the other hand Clarion is the more serious one and the other half to the yuri element of Nene\'s moe side of things, always serious and deadpan and is the PRIMARY source of badassery and tackling the issues that Nene presented and trying to solve it. Koukaku no Pandora\'s genre elements may be slightly weird and off for some wanting to see a more serious cyberpunk thriller as such, but Koukaku no Pandora just isn\'t this and IS NOT it\'s intention of doing so, it\'s simply a girl meets girl story interlaced with cyberpunk elements and to that LA will say it DOES have some merit in seeing something different even for the cyberpunk ""grungy"" genre we see time and again.If there was another strength LA would say to Koukaku no Pandora is the fact that this anime does try alot to keep it\'s minor cast (aside from Uzal because, mastermind and everything will be explained thus no story and all) in the loop even after their introductory episodes and even if the running gag characters like Vlind are nothing but running gags, these characters DO get their screentime and aren\'t throwaway characters (though Vlind is a bad example...hmmm Ian Kurtz voiced by Junichi Sawabe and Bunny voiced by Rie Murakawa are better examples).In terms of animation by Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ, the animation is ok at best with some weird stylistic choice of having Clarion only be it a white silhouette only at times for no reason, sure the anime is subjected to comedic chibi animation time and again even when it\'s NOT trying to be comedic and the animation does have technical merit in it\'s background and cybertech architecture is decent at best. The character designs are are exotic as the background though making the anime style expectedly moe. Overall, the animation is all over the place but seems to have some focus to knowing it\'s own style of both being moe, comedically chibi and detailed cybertech.In terms of voice acting, LA found Sanae Fuku would voiced Nene to be expectedly hyper genki, but NEARLY annoying to say the least, Manami Numakura was LA\'s favourite voice actor of her voicing the deadpan yet badass Clarion (and is LA\'s favourite character). Junpei Morita as B.U.E.R waxes poetic and his probably the most unique yet annoying vocals LA heard from the anime right next to Marie Miyake as Takumi what with her ""daiya!"" accenting. Finally Atsuko Tanaka as Uzal was decent for what was her screentime she was given. If you didn\'t want hyper moe vocals littered throughout the anime...your not gonna like this voice cast this much. As for LA...it was ""meh"".The final arc of Koukaku no Pandora does get somewhat serious with Clarion being the clear goal and for a girl meets girl story it\'s typical for this to be the case and with it\'s cyberpunk ""grungy"" elements creeping into the forefront, LA thought it kinda lost it\'s way, what it\'s own it was trying to develop during the more episodic format but still having the stake of Clarion kept LA interesting albeit slight moodwhiplashed however what with the B.U.E.R, Takumi and the clandestine organization finally comes into focus by this final arc along with Clarion and Nene\'s involvement in all this during the first 2 episodes and it reaches a climax where LA didn\'t expect and coming from an anime about two cyborgs girls meeting each other and wanting world peace, the tone this climax went...became expected especially from this kind of anime that firmly knows what it is, this is mainly because our main antagonist wanting the cliche world domination but wanting world peace through it (which makes him a more sympathetic yet arrogant villain who has the same beliefs as Nene\'s but HOW he does it is vastly different). This final arc if anything brought upon a book ends to this entire anime and at the very least tied all plotlines concerning B.U.E.R and our main leads\' wish for world peace and because of that as well as Uzal\'s scheming that bore fruit from the first two episodes...LA will say this ending is acceptable and typical of the anime by that point.Koukaku no Pandora is overall a pretty mediocre anime with some wasted potential it had for a premise even as an anime blatantly paying homage to Ghost in the Shell among other mythological gags to add to it\'s name. Koukaku no Pandora however does have one thing going for it and it KNOWS it wants to be a cybernized yuri anime and ""loves"" being blatant to self-aware levels about it and LA can\'t fault this anime for wanting to do what it wants no matter if the audience doesn\'t like it or not. It\'s better than an anime that DOESN\'T know what the hell their doing anyways... this being due to Clarion\'s original owner Uzal voiced by Atsuko Tanaka ordering her to protect Nene, have Takumi Korobase voiced by Marie Miyake try to spy or her trying to secretly hack Clarion or get her hands on B.U.E.R and fail and once a huge incident (or just a simple problem arises) have Nene and Clarion ""transform"" in the most yuriest way possible (don\'t ask) and have Nene effectively solve the problem just like that.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦Story✦Absolutely adorable story presentation with some touch of lewdness. Long story short. It\'s straightforward moeblob with rather enjoyable quirks and traits. It\'s a bit more ""refined"" moeblob than the more stereotypical shows. But I did absolutely adore how everything was conveyed, expressed, reacted and presented along the storytelling. It was enjoyably, but nothing too interesting. Characters and presentation methods made it fun.✦Art & Sound✦Straightforward, flat, colorful but extremely fun art style. There were so many facial expression that I would gladly save on my...harddrive and use them as reaction/emoji. Overall character design was as well adorable and fun. Action was solid, transformations were rather kinky and misc designs were as well quite fun.OST And music I did notice, there were some rather nice ones. But don\'t have anything else to add as they were simply ""good enough"" for me.✦Character✦Yes, main characters duo was adorable. And the robot cat maid, I absolutely loved. There were plenty of other interesting and quirky characters.Weakest links were probably the progress development characters that somewhat pushed on the story itself. I found their existence rather useless and unmemorable.✦Enjoyment & Overall✦Adorable Anime with great reaction faces. It was simply fun to watch, it\'s simple and fun, but nothing that special.

Simply joyful and cute.', 'Ok I am going to start off by saying I would NOT recommend this anime to anyone! I could not stand anymore then just 3-4 episodes before I dropped it.The first EPISODE had some cool ideas but fell flat...(which is why I rated the story as 1). It always pains me when i see stories that have potential but decide to go in the opposite direction or just uses this for fan service.The jokes were immature, and the story line boring as heck feeling like each episode lasted forever.I honest do not see why this anime exists...I mean I see some people giving it high...marks but for what? The charters were very one note (especially the main charter- the usual upbeat protagonist), the story dragged on forever really going nowhere, the joke immature (like B.U.E.R....seeing him and his ""third leg"" always just made me feel uncomfortable-just wanted to hit the person who came up with this stupid perverted charter design).So story is a: 1For having this cool futuristic idea with robots and androids, but FAILING to use these cools ideas dedicating the story to instead pander to fan service. Along with stupid immature jokes Giving us no real background of any of the charter, any background on robots (which would have been so awesome) or world building, no charter growth. Just no anything of real substance.Art: 7Ok the animation is smooth and it does have SOME actions scenes and has some details...although nothing really groundbreaking. It is pleasing to the eyes.Sound: 5?Maybe..? I really didn\'t notice anything in the background music (although for a couple times. The voice acting was ""meh""..everything was ""meh"" since there really wasn\'t anything that stuck out. (although for this it is better then me hating the music for being ""to cutesy"" or something..could have been worse)Charters: 4YES A 4! Wanna know why? because the main charters were GENERIC as heck! The main charter (as stated above) is the most generic bubbly cutesy, goodly two-shoes charter- there are a handful of main charters like her!Some examples are: Aria the Origin, Snow White with the Red Hair, Madoka Magica, Tokyo Mew Mew...just to name a few. (The best use of this type of charter would be Sakura from Card Captor Sakura)Although Nene has to be the worst of them all! It\'s like they didn\'t even try with giving her charter a twist that would really define her (besides giving her robot limbs)!

The charters were very one note (especially the main charter- the usual upbeat protagonist), the story dragged on forever really going nowhere, the joke immature (like B.U.E.R....seeing him and his ""third leg"" always just made me feel uncomfortable-just wanted to hit the person who came up with this stupid perverted charter design).So story is a: 1For having this cool futuristic idea with robots and androids, but FAILING to use these cools ideas dedicating the story to instead pander to fan service. Along with stupid immature jokes Giving us no real background of any of the charter, any background on robots (which would have been so awesome) or world building, no charter growth. Just no anything of real substance.Art: 7Ok the animation is smooth and it does have SOME actions scenes and has some details...although nothing really groundbreaking. It is pleasing to the eyes.Sound: 5?Maybe..? I really didn\'t notice anything in the background music (although for a couple times. The voice acting was ""meh""..everything was ""meh"" since there really wasn\'t anything that stuck out. (although for this it is better then me hating the music for being ""to cutesy"" or something..could have been worse)Charters: 4YES A 4! Wanna know why? because the main charters were GENERIC as heck! The main charter (as stated above) is the most generic bubbly cutesy, goodly two-shoes charter- there are a handful of main charters like her!Some examples are: Aria the Origin, Snow White with the Red Hair, Madoka Magica, Tokyo Mew Mew...just to name a few. (The best use of this type of charter would be Sakura from Card Captor Sakura)Although Nene has to be the worst of them all! It\'s like they didn\'t even try with giving her charter a twist that would really define her (besides giving her robot limbs)!

Go for the manga instead, that's the summary of what I'm going to say.This anime was quite subpar. I read the manga and then watched the anime version since you often find quite a lot of differences between versions and it's nice to see it from a different perspective and with voices etc. The problem here is that the manga and anime is almost exactly the same. I sped up the whole anime by three times to manage watching it all. The end result is that the only pretty big difference is the last half of the last episode, but...even then it's not worth watching.In the first place, it was fairly nice in manga format, not the best, but enjoyable nonetheless. It had a lot of negative aspects, mainly in terms of characters(personalities and attitudes) and plot holes/flaws/unclear parts which made the score drop. However, I generally enjoyed the setting and relationship between the mc and clarion, I also found a lot of things to be pretty cool, like the mc's special power, when it wasn't suffering from the flaws, it was a solid 7 or 8/10 in score. The manga could be read through rapidly compared to the anime which moves at a snail's pace and it had much more content. However, this just DOESN'T work well in the anime version. It's honestly quite boring, dragged out and lacking, I also didn't like the voices or music, the art was good but kinda average.So, 3/10 is a fair score for the anime, as for the manga, it gets a 5/10, overall average but very enjoyable now and then. even then it's not worth watching.In the first place, it was fairly nice in manga format, not the best, but enjoyable nonetheless.

It brings basically nothing new to the table, it\'s just your typical action-fest of smacking enemies, just a generic sci-fi show with way more ecchi scenes than it needs, it\'s another fan service show.Art(5/10) - One word, ""unexceptional"". It doesn\'t have the spark or anything remotely visually engaging, but it\'s not atrocious. Nothing special, the animal can be described as ""meh"", the character designs are overall pretty good, but it\'s not raising the bar higher enough to go over the average mark.Sound(8/10) - I always forget...this aspect in most of my reviews, for an apparent reason, this aspect will either be a 5(Average) or a worse score. And most of the time there won\'t be much for me to talk about, so I just skip over this part since it doesn\'t contribute much to the plot. But this opening is a banger, ""hopeness"" by ZAQ, I just love the song. Other than that, just your typical voice acting and sound, nothing to write home about.Character(2/10) - Generic, common, etc. I don\'t think I need to list out a list of synonyms for the meaning of ""bland and general"". The characters are not explored in-depth, it feels one-sided most of the time. Not to mention the non-existent character development.Enjoyment(5/10) - Art can be defined as feelings, you can feel misery and sorrow, you can feel delighted and inspired, and you can feel crossed and offended, this shows me that I can feel emptiness. I feel nothing after watching this show, I wasn\'t sad by any actions taken by the characters, and I wasn\'t glad and joyful after watching this fan service, I just felt confused by this mixture of this hot mess. I am just confused why this existed in the first place, it felt meaningless after watching this.Overall(3/10) - Don\'t waste your time watching this, I\'ve heard from manga readers that anime is just a poor adaptation(Just like what every manga/LN reader says), so I decided to read a bit of it. It wasn\'t a masterpiece, but I liked it way more than the adaptation.Take-away from this review: Read the manga or watch other shows, as this one is pretty dull. this aspect in most of my reviews, for an apparent reason, this aspect will either be a 5(Average) or a worse score.

Here are my thoughts:The plot of this anime is borderline incoherent.Poor animation quality with CGI used in the action scenes. If I could describe the animation in one word it would be 'sloppy.' Much of it is out of proportion and off-model. In fact the entire production has a very low-budget feel to it. Maybe that is part of the charm though? Which leads me to my next point: this is a pretty fun show. It doesn't take itself seriously. It is completely ridiculous and self-aware of that fact, and...as a result it is a pretty fun watch. It feels like some kind of yuri sci-fi fever dream.Okay soundtrack. The music is unique but suitable for the show. Actually the audio production quality in this is okay overall (in stark contrast with the visuals). I liked the ED song and felt myself singing along to it. Voice acting had lots of variety among the cast with each character being very distinctive.Very erotic at times. Without going into too much detail, I spent a lot of time rubbing my nipples thinking about hot digital cyborg intercourse with sensitive port connections and things like that.Some neat sci-fi stuff in here. Most of it isn't explained well at all, but nevertheless it is very much a sci-fi series. The android main characters and their respective abilities were kind of neat. I liked the sci-fi elements in this, particularly with the cute silly spin on things.Character interactions in this are really enjoyable. Nene and Clarion are great together. Takumi is also a funny character. Overall the cast is likable and cute.In general the series feels very creative. This is not your modern design-by-boardroom commercial anime. It feels like artistic freedom was permitted liberally. Is it a masterpiece? No, but it is unique and creative, which is something that I value very much.I really like the artistic vision and the spirit of this show. This anime is unique, fun, cute, and most importantly creative and authentic. However it is also somewhat poorly executed, mainly from a technical perspective.My overall rating: 8/10I really enjoyed watching this. Criminally underrated anime, in my opinion.I didn't find out about this until after I finished watching the anime, but apparently the manga is written by the same person who created Ghost in the Shell.I haven't been able to find the 'Pandoradio' specials anywhere, unfortunately. as a result it is a pretty fun watch.

Megaton-kyuu Musashi 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50559/Megaton-kyuu_Musashi_2nd_Season,"[""As a sequel to an adaptation from a game that wasn't too advertised outside of Japan, I had my reservations about this being any good. News about delays in their schedule certainly didn't help and so I decided to wait for it to be completed in order to give it my fair judgment. Having just finished it I can certainly say it was the wise choice.On the one side, the characters from the previous season make a comeback but also new and quite relevant ones make their dayview. Along these 15 episodes we see their story develop in this war with some twists, revelations, feelings...and a certain someone getting a huge boost in development. But that's not all as the main attraction is the giant robot fights, the ones from the game, and if you were a fan of them before, you're in for a treat. New robot transformation sequences alongside new moves, fluid 3D action scenes and the frantic music in the background made for some of the best mecha fights I've watched so far.However, it's not all a bed of roses as there were some aspects I was apprehensive about. Firstly, and weirdly enough, the 2D animation still looks average to bad. Outside of a few scenes, many interactions can look a bit bland. In fact, one of the latter characters to be introduced has curved pupils drawn and it was so distracting to watch them that I had to rewind a few scenes. Oh and speaking of said character, here comes my second gripe: the development of his arc.It might sound contradictory to what I mentioned above but that's not really the case. For the most part the series follows a clear story plot line with enough exposition for new details to be processed nicely. In this case, every episode started and it felt like some explanation was missing or cut short. My guess is that with its production issues the series might have been reduced in length, leading to certain interactions feeling either unnatural or out of place. In other words, even with longer than average episodes, the final arc in particular was rushed in its setup and the result was quite disappointing.Taking all this into account, this is a perfectly watchable anime if you manage to find it and were curious where the first season was gonna go. I went back and forth with how I felt about it since I'm sure it could have gone better, but oh well, what's done is done. and a certain someone getting a huge boost in development.

"Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!",https://myanimelist.net/anime/13367/Kono_Naka_ni_Hitori_Imouto_ga_Iru,"['The story is a bit original, because this guy have to marry a girl who can accidentally be his younger sister. And lucky the protagonist isn\'t an mediocre idiot, but still not a Don Juan.The art is good so far as i saw, good quality.Nothing to say about the music, not bad. You must watch if you like romance, and harem. it\'s quite enjoyable if you look for an ""ecchi comedy romance"". But don\'t be fool and don\'t look for a ""Clannad"" or ""Death Note"" in this anime. ', 'Just plain trash just skip this.The story could have been good. Its a interesting setup but it gets turned into a stupid clitche harem.The dialogue is so bad that I actually have a hard time watching because it makes me feel embarrassed for the characters.The storyline has no pace and is just random stuff coming out of nowhere.I will admit tho the art and animation is pretty good but thats about the only good point. ', ""Kono naka ni Hitori,Unlike many other shows, the main character actually has to urgently get a wife which helps develop the plot unlike many other romance stories where the story gets no where. The twist is that he lost his childhood memories and he has a lost sister who is trying to marry him.The main character seems like a really nice well rounded person as he is not too much of a pervert, loser or gets into too many accidents. However, as most characters do, he makes stupid decisons that piss people off. The people around him all seem to have their own unique personalities.So...far, it has been enjoyable without too uncomfortable or stupid moments.Overall, i would give this show an 8 as it is nothing special but nothing bad either. If you watch it without expectations you'll probably enjoy the comedy and the progression of the plot. However, as most harems are, its not perfect but at least the story is going forward ( doesn't look like a back to where you started story). It's obvious that the main character does not do things the easy way or else there would be no plot and a simple resolution.I would recommend people who enjoy nice romance anime to watch this.  However it isn't a show for people who want a clever main character that uses strategy to solve his problems like code geass or death note far, it has been enjoyable without too uncomfortable or stupid moments.Overall, i would give this show an 8 as it is nothing special but nothing bad either.

Shougo, heir to the Mikadono Group, knew he didn\'t want to bone his sister, so he became a temporary Private Investigator, searching and uncovering the identity of his long-lost sister. Will he succeed? Or will he bone his sister?With his naive, kind, and determined personality, he ventures forth into the unknown school called Miryuin Private Academy and searches...for his sister. There, he encountered many women, like the blond, competitive princess Rinka, or the childish and quiet student council president Mana, or the mysterious witch girl.

The anime is totally focused on this mystery and to help in this development appears several other girls in the protagonist's life when he starts attend the college, the anime works fine its mystery story leading you to believe that is one of the girls and it's nothing you of a smack in the face and you already start to distrust another person holds the anime and you're wanting solve the mystery and find out who is the sister that, if you love to solve mysteries and uncover clues like a detective advise you to watch this anime.Proof of it all, is one that appears 2 or 3 girls with the same cell that changes the voice, the question is which of the three who can be? Or is it someone else? Who supposedly said on the radio for the school Shougo (protagonist) who stop looking for her sister? Who was the girl who called him six hours every day? Whoever stole the phone of one of the girls who had thrown it in the trash? Whom is actually the person who helps Shougo and lives on his side?That's just some of the mysteries that await you, who seek to be unraveled by someone!How about you become a bit like detective?Note: Since the goal of the anime is the suspenseful if I dwell too much on his description I could end up giving spoilers and many Eventually grace.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------History: 10Suspense is the essence of this anime, and he is very well done in this part, as I said above still can not solve the mystery, and keep seeing the episodes to see if I can find any clues.He will play for one side to the other and making you believe a track that is not true and nothing you're already distrusting someone else (as I said above), every detail leaves you intrigued and each new track makes you seek links with other previous tracks to try to solve the mystery, it really is exciting in that respect.Art: 9The anime art is good, and very detailed, perhaps a bit too colorful and glossy, but you get used to it,scenarios are well made in every detail and the characters also has appearances quite pleasant with well defined traits.Characters: 7I think it might be one of the weaknesses of this work, I really think that it ta strong in its suspense because the characters do not make you like them, do not have a work upon the feelings of the characters, what they think, what they think, really the whole work is focused on suspense.Sound: 7The sound should be the weakest part of the anime, are not well placed, in the opening scene has a sound more or less, the closure is a bit better, if you expect an anime Kimi to Boku like that in my opinion has a fantastic sound and good choice of songs, Kono naka probably will not suit you.Some scenes even have music and they do not fit the times he has, but as the anime style is mystery, suspense think to understand a little of that side, the strong anime of this genre does not have to be sound (is how I see it)Enjoyment: 7The anime is fun and provide a sense of wondering what will happen next, if you expect an anime filled with comedy, comedy scenes without forced and more natural, you probably will not like this anime.Now if you expect that anime makes you actually engage with it, try to understand what goes into it, that detail is what this show is for you. essence of the work (his main focus is the suspense, you should not expect he works upon the characters and how their feelings etc. ..) and I come here to try to convince people to give a chance to the anime.Good talking a little anime itself.He tells the story of a son of an owner of a large company who dies and leaves everything to his son but for him to assume the company he has to get married first, on the day of the funeral of his father appears a person saying his sister by  (his father would have had her with another woman who is not the mother of the protagonist), the protagonist moves to a school after the death of his father to find a woman to marry, but before that he needs solve this mystery and find out who is his supposed sister by father (because he does not want to marry his sister.)

Whom is actually the person who helps Shougo and lives on his side?That's just some of the mysteries that await you, who seek to be unraveled by someone!How about you become a bit like detective?Note: Since the goal of the anime is the suspenseful if I dwell too much on his description I could end up giving spoilers and many Eventually grace.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------History: 10Suspense is the essence of this anime, and he is very well done in this part, as I said above still can not solve the mystery, and keep seeing the episodes to see if I can find any clues.He will play for one side to the other and making you believe a track that is not true and nothing you're already distrusting someone else (as I said above), every detail leaves you intrigued and each new track makes you seek links with other previous tracks to try to solve the mystery, it really is exciting in that respect.Art: 9The anime art is good, and very detailed, perhaps a bit too colorful and glossy, but you get used to it,scenarios are well made in every detail and the characters also has appearances quite pleasant with well defined traits.Characters: 7I think it might be one of the weaknesses of this work, I really think that it ta strong in its suspense because the characters do not make you like them, do not have a work upon the feelings of the characters, what they think, what they think, really the whole work is focused on suspense.Sound: 7The sound should be the weakest part of the anime, are not well placed, in the opening scene has a sound more or less, the closure is a bit better, if you expect an anime Kimi to Boku like that in my opinion has a fantastic sound and good choice of songs, Kono naka probably will not suit you.Some scenes even have music and they do not fit the times he has, but as the anime style is mystery, suspense think to understand a little of that side, the strong anime of this genre does not have to be sound (is how I see it)Enjoyment: 7The anime is fun and provide a sense of wondering what will happen next, if you expect an anime filled with comedy, comedy scenes without forced and more natural, you probably will not like this anime.Now if you expect that anime makes you actually engage with it, try to understand what goes into it, that detail is what this show is for you."", ""NakaImoFast review.StoryThe problem with this anime is that it was predictable, the story is good but predictable and in the 9th episode i knew who the sister was, it was obvious if you payed attention to the things they said and what they knew till that episode, and even in the first episodes i knew she was going to be the sister with another suspect that i had, but i knew it, was predictable so the story was fine.Art & AnimationBeing an ecchi harem anime this should have great art, but it was just good, nothing amazing or great, the uncensored parts were fine, Ikusu...parts were good and funny, it was good overall, don't expect much nudes.SoundIt was fine, the voice acting was good, but the background music was ok, the OP and ED were boring, overall was fine.CharacterAlmost everyone were ok, just Miyabi and Ikusu were interesting and sometimes Konoe, but it was fine because of somethings that you will see, if you get to watch it.EnjoymentI enjoyed the art and the comedy mixed with the ecchiness, it was fine. parts were good and funny, it was good overall, don't expect much nudes.SoundIt was fine, the voice acting was good, but the background music was ok, the OP and ED were boring, overall was fine.CharacterAlmost everyone were ok, just Miyabi and Ikusu were interesting and sometimes Konoe, but it was fine because of somethings that you will see, if you get to watch it.EnjoymentI enjoyed the art and the comedy mixed with the ecchiness, it was fine."", 'Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru anime, like most recent animes, is an adaptation of its manga.Story: Shougo Mikadono is the son of a famous business man that is left with a will which states that he will be the successor of the company also has to marry before graduating highschool. However his long lost sister, who keeps her identity anonymous, states that she will marry him. Of course incest is creepy shit, so Shougo wants to avoid this but the imouto (sister in japanese) will attend his highschool where she will try to make him fall in love with her. Remember he...doesn\'t know who she is which poses a problemThis idea is actually pretty intresting but oh. my. god. it was poorly executed. Now you obviously know that the girls on the cover are part of Shougo\'s harem which means character development would be quite difficult. But its like the team barely put any effort at all. Based on the 1st episode a girl suddenly shows a romantic interest. Now this probably would send a message to the audience that ""hey this girl seems to already have feelings already which makes her suspicious already."" But god damn when the 2nd girl was introduced she also SUDDENLY have feelings. Now you can tell that this story was rushed beyond believe, and will continue, because 2 of the 5 girls were introduced where they are in ""good"" terms with the male without any decent reason. i honestly wouldnt be suprised if all the girls ""fall in love in first sight."" If thats the case then Shougo is a lucky bastard.Now that i established that character development is not even present in this anime i\'d like to say that the dialogue is just terrible and ive already scene a typical boy-meets-girl cliche. *spoiler alert* The girl with black hair, Tsuruma Konoe, was saved by an incoming truck by Shougo who pushed her out of the way. no wait....THE BUS FUCKING HIT HER. I\'m not even kidding folks she was smacked by a truck. Next thing you know the boy runs to ask the girl if shes okay and she didn\'t even have a bruise....wow hulk mode. *spoiler ends*I want to quickly top this off by saying that this is a generic harem bullshit. Actually this reminded me of other generic animes such as Fortune Arterial and R-15 and guess what, same director. I also realized he did kissxsis which was actually decent-good but how coincidental is the fact that both animes are related to incest.Art- Not jaw-dropping but okay. You obviously won\'t see the insane animation works from Hironori Tanaka or Takashi Hashimoto but the actual art is goodI give it a 7....i give the artists a 10 for having the balls to stick through this project. -respect-Sound- I\'m not even sure how to rate this. everything sounds normal. Now if your talking about the OP and ED, those are just so annoying to listen that i had to skip them. the voice seems typical but the background music for the OP is just a mess. The different sounds aren\'t even aesthetically place. Its just a messy bunch imo.  But in the end its whatever the viewers preference is because music is music.character: Oh god....Okay let me start by saying you will probably never see any character development but there are distinct personalities with each girl. Shougo is just a failure...excuse me he\'s just really typical guy who happens to be rich. Now that could be ideal for his situation but when you start to see him talk and move around...you would much rather see him be an asshole or some cocky person where he can be somewhat intresting.Here\'s my take on the girls. they are all going to be distinct but ridiculously bland in their category. the tsundere in this story probably blushes by looking at the cloud that Shougo is looking at. Nah I\'m kidding but don\'t expect to see very very good tsunderes like aisaka taiga or louise (both voiced by kugimiya rie i might add)...hell don\'t expect anything that would make you grow attached to them. oh yea the dialogue is just bad, no intresting conversations whatsoever.enjoyment: I was actually frustrated and bored. I\'ve read the manga and found it pretty interesting so i was somewhat excited by the anime adaptation of it but boy i was disappointed. With this very bad start to this show it almost seems impossible to bounce back and have a good finish. I gave the story a 6 because it had POTENTIAL...lets just hope the anime can use the interesting plot to their advantage....probably not.Overall: it is generic, boring, and boring and boring.In all seriousness its just bad in my opinion but i won\'t be surprised if other people enjoy it.

But as soon as I started watching the anime, I was pleasantly surprised, it was way better than I expected it to be, in my opinion the anime is highly underrated, and deserves to be rated better.Story: 7/10The story of Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru! was pretty good in my opinion. Sure it wasn\'t...something unique, just another school romance anime with some harem, but there is no way I would call it boring. The story itself kept me intrigued untill the very end. Anime seemed to be dragged out, and the second half of it wasn\'t even close to being as good as first half. Then the humor was typical, boring jokes and of course how without accidental tits squeezing situations. The ending left some questions in my head. It just felt too rushed and incomplete. I don\'t know If I can expect another season, since the anime wasn\'t successful. Probably not. :(If you\'re looking for something impressive or unique, this anime might not be for you. But if generic school romance comedy is what you looking for, you might be left satisfied with this.Sure this isn\'t maid-sama, or toradora but definitely ""worth giving a shot"" anime.Art & Animation: 8/10This section is pretty hard to talk about, because there\'s not much action, where the animation capabilities could be seen properly. But anime itself was pretty pleasant to watch, characters seemed to be drawn modern, didn\'t really felt like watching 90s anime. Only downside I disliked was the shining redness on girls shoulders, knees, and everyone knows where else.Characters: 7/10If the story is cliché and generic, could the characters present themselves as deep, interesting personalities?

The only condition is that you should get married first. So you enroll in a school so that you can find your typical waifu (wife) then, suddenly, you have five awesome and beautiful girls sorrounding you. You can choose one of them so that you can marry her and lead...the company.Sounds like a dream life eh? You get to choose who you want to marry and become rich at the same time. It's like hitting two birds with one stone.The TWIST: One of those 5 awesome and beautiful girls is your long lost, blood-related Imouto (Little Sister) who was separated from the family long ago because she is an illegitimate child.NakaImo is a little original when it comes to the story part. A harem anime typically consists of three or more girls fighting for the love of the male lead but the twist is what made it original. I can't even imagine myself being in the shoes of the male lead because it's so hard to choose even though some guys are saying that there's only 20% chance that the male lead can choose his Imouto by mistake. It's only a little original because the characters have the same personality for a harem anime. (Which will be discussed later in the character part)Art: The art is what I liked most about this anime. The girls are, well, how can I say this? Have a little moe (as in moeblobs from K-on!! or Upotte!) and then all of them are kawaii (Like those girls in Visual Novels). I admit, I have a crush on all of the girls in this anime (especially on Konoe Tsuruma).Sound: The OP single (Choose Me ♥ DAARIN by StylipS) is what's catchy about this anime. I usually repeat this song again and again on my phone when I'm on the bus. I can't find anything else about sound that caught my attention.Character: The typical harem anime. We have a genius, silent-type, class president, vice-president (not to mention a TSUNDERE (by the way, I'm also a big fan of Tsunderes. I want to have a Tsundere girlfriend in the future)).Enjoyment: If you're looking for a typical harem anime with a not-so-typical storyline, then NakaImo is for you. After all, the fanservice given by this anime can make you squeal. (I don't want to spoil you but I can't get the sound Konoe made when she was squealing out of my mind).Overall: If you're a big (and I mean BIG) fan of Harem animes, then this is for you. The love story isn't too heavy unlike Mashiro-Iro Symphony (or Princess Lover!) and it isn't too light unlike Hoshizora E Kakaru Hashi. the company.Sounds like a dream life eh?

And that is Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!, shortened as Nakaimo, premise. So allow me to vent out my thoughts for the show.STORY: 5/10It may not be the first to feature this, but Nakaimo still delivers a story that has been retold by many animes before. From the start of the story, the show made it clear that it will definitely include some incest - specifically brocon - which I am now getting used to.Nakaimo centers around Shougo Mikagami,...the next head of his late-father's successful company who is sent to Miryuuin Academy to look for a life partner but is thwarted when news of him having a little sister who attends the same academy as him came in and is now struggling to find her. Along the way he meets various girls that took interest in him but Shougo is having trouble choosing from them fearing that one of them maybe his little sister.The story's a first but the main concept is as bland as ever. But a plot twist in the end did earn a few points for me. However, it alone can't make this stand out from the bunch. The story can also be humorous from time to time while fan service is just waiting around the corner preparing for a proper scene to show off some thin fabric and skin, which kept me either ogling or annoyed when it became too much. The story all throughout didn't exceed my expectations but what was surprising is the revelation on who Shougo's true little sister is. Wanna find out, watch it yourself.VISUAL QUALITY AND AUDIO: 7/10Like its story, the visual is what you'd expect from the given genre. The art emanates warm colors found in the well detailed backdrops. Character design is pretty especially how they highlight a given character that it separates it from the rest of the cast. Animation's decent too.Voice acting is well delivered and greatly mimics the character's expressions. Soundtrack is good but not all memorable.CHARACTERS: 7/10Nakaimo features a cast of wacky people; the protagonist, the busty honor student, a tsudere swimmer, a cross-dressing ninja, a blonde elitist, a gluttonous president, a young shop manager, and even a loli teacher. Given that, their personalities and characteristics are quite unique but it still what you'd expect from an anime of this genre. Their girls' ways to approach Shougo  is quite amusing and sometimes humorous. Character development takes place as the story progresses.OVERALL: 7/10Not the kind of an anime that will go against the flow but Nakaimo delivers a fun-filled romance story. I greatly enjoyed this that I finished the series and I'm still willing to watch it all over again. So Nakaimo is worth checking out in your into the common harem genre. the next head of his late-father's successful company who is sent to Miryuuin Academy to look for a life partner but is thwarted when news of him having a little sister who attends the same academy as him came in and is now struggling to find her.

I guess I could start by saying that Nakaimo: My Sister is Among Them!, or Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru! if you prefer the Japanese name, is an ordinary harem/echii anime. Or, at least, that's what I thought when I began this series. In all reality, it's a unique series to it's genre, and I mean the harem genre, not the echii, since there are multiple animes with similar echii aspects.As for the story, I found it unique and interesting throughout the entire series, and quite enjoyable really. The story goes like this: The president of a highly...successful company has just died, leaving his entire company to his son, however, in order to inherit it, he must get married by the end of his high school life. So he has been sent to a new high school to start looking for a bride-to-be. But, there's another catch, he has a sister that his family never knew about, and she goes to the same high school as him, and what's even more surprising, she's in love with him and wants to marry him. So now, he has to figure out which girl is his sister out of an entire group of girls that are potential wives. When I found all of this out, it got better each episode. The thing is, you never know who his sister is until the very end, and the series keeps making you think one thing, but then takes a giant curve and gets you thinking about another thing, and I never saw the ending coming. Very good story.Artwork, similar to most animes being made these years. The designs of the characters are well made, you are able to tell them apart easily, and the setting seems modernly realistic. All aspects in which make a good anime.As for sound, voice acting was well done, I recognized some actors and actresses from other animes. I didn't like all of them, but that's just me. Overall, very professional and well done.I think what I liked about this story were the choices in characters. The main guy seemed really cool, and down-to-earth, unlike some characters you may find in animes these days. He was mature in some parts, but had just the right amount of a perverted side to him as most normal teenage boys would, so he seemed real to me. As for the girls, I liked them all, especially Rinka, my personal favorite. They all had different personalities, and they were all in love with the main guy, or at least I assume so. In the story, they each get their moment in the spotlight, so the screen time was evenly distributed between them so they each have about 2 episodes about themselves, and the moments in this anime that made me laugh the most were always where the girls were thinking that Shougo has a thing for guys whenever something weird is happening between him and Ikusu (which obviously isn't a guy).I can honestly say that I didn't hate this anime. In terms of fanservice, believe me, there's plenty of that. There were moments of awkwardness that made me cringe, which is common in most echiis these days, and of course, there's always just enjoying one guy getting loved by a bunch of girls to an extent where you wish all his girl troubles were yours. It wasn't until the end where I was unsatisfied on where the story went. This isn't really spoiling anything, but like in most harems, the main character never chooses which girl he will get with, it'll end with all of them proclaiming their love to him or something like that. Even though it had an unsatisfying ending, I do recommend this to anyone looking for a harem/echii with fanservice and a good storyline. successful company has just died, leaving his entire company to his son, however, in order to inherit it, he must get married by the end of his high school life. So he has been sent to a new high school to start looking for a bride-to-be. But, there's another catch, he has a sister that his family never knew about, and she goes to the same high school as him, and what's even more surprising, she's in love with him and wants to marry him. So now, he has to figure out which girl is his sister out of an entire group of girls that are potential wives. When I found all of this out, it got better each episode. The thing is, you never know who his sister is until the very end, and the series keeps making you think one thing, but then takes a giant curve and gets you thinking about another thing, and I never saw the ending coming. Very good story.Artwork, similar to most animes being made these years. The designs of the characters are well made, you are able to tell them apart easily, and the setting seems modernly realistic. All aspects in which make a good anime.As for sound, voice acting was well done, I recognized some actors and actresses from other animes. I didn't like all of them, but that's just me. Overall, very professional and well done.I think what I liked about this story were the choices in characters. The main guy seemed really cool, and down-to-earth, unlike some characters you may find in animes these days. He was mature in some parts, but had just the right amount of a perverted side to him as most normal teenage boys would, so he seemed real to me. As for the girls, I liked them all, especially Rinka, my personal favorite. They all had different personalities, and they were all in love with the main guy, or at least I assume so. In the story, they each get their moment in the spotlight, so the screen time was evenly distributed between them so they each have about 2 episodes about themselves, and the moments in this anime that made me laugh the most were always where the girls were thinking that Shougo has a thing for guys whenever something weird is happening between him and Ikusu (which obviously isn't a guy).I can honestly say that I didn't hate this anime.

That being said it could have some more comedy as most viewers want mostly two things from a harem anime and that is fan service and jokes. So if you are a fan of the genre and also a story lover more than the fan service and jokes I would recommend this anime. ', ""This is my first review so please bear with me.A TL;DR synopsis of this series is a guy who's trying succeed his late father's company, but has to find a lover first. Twist? One of the prospects is his unknown sister.Story - Score: 5As far as story and plot goes...well.... This was something that hasn't been done before (the core plot theme anyways), but for some reason it kinda makes you shake your head all the same. Another interesting develop-able plot turned into another generic harem situation, which this anime pretty much is. As one of the other reviewer stated, this was...just a dragged out cat and mouse game. To be fair, it's supposed to do that because that's what the main plot theme was supposed to be: him trying to find a lover while to trying to avoid picking out his sister. However, he makes it plainly clear that he's trying to avoid at all costs. So people who are looking for a wincest anime? Don't get your hopes up please.Like many wincest potential animes, they are all doomed to deliver. And this one is no exception, if his views and stance is not clear enough. This isn't a spoiler per say because honestly the majority consensus not only in the anime industry but in society in general for incest is terribly harsh. Therefore the wincest element is always just reduced to a plot device or attraction gatherer. And the true ones are tend to be very niche. Don't trust me? You can go see it for yourself.Anyways going back to the story itself. This is a fairly paced story. It doesn't drag out too long, but in doing so it sometimes feel like it's been a little rushed at times. Also the ending will leave you perplexed due to the anime covering only a portion of the light novel it was adapted from. So honestly it's not even a finished anime. And a second season seems to be not a possibility anytime soon, so you would have to rely on the original source for the conclusion...IF anybody decides to revive that project. It seems like it has a poor fan base, considering that the source material had already wrapped... years ago... So honestly you're probably better off having to read the wiki or scouring through the net to learn how it all ends.Art - Score: 6Nothing too special, nothing thought provoking nor anything that would push the envelope. Something that was nice and safe. Just your standard typical anime art style. Ecchi art style at that.Sound - Score: 6Like the art, your standard run of the mill music. From its opening to its ending. Pretty forgettable to most. Few of the scenes music was pretty nice almost like from a generic visual novel game or something, but that was just it. Just pretty nice.Character - Score:5Run of the mill characters as well. You got from your nice, kind, ideal girl to your tsunderes to rich proper lady, to the airheads... Your basic harem staple. Nothing new.Same with the protagonist. Standard guy who's a closet perv, but is afraid and wish-washy to go far with any girls, but this time with the mystery sister as an excuse.Enjoyment - Score: 6Honestly I gave this a fair rating just because of the fact that even though there were times when it made me groan, it also made me chuckle a bit when things started to get a bit wild. Not in the ecchi sense, but the weird moments sense. So I don't wanna be mean and give it a poor score just because it didn't please me all the time, but that does not mean it has fully redeemed itself. Nowhere close.Overall - Score:6Warning: This show is not for everyone. People who like a bit of story alongside with their dish of moe and fanservice stuff rolled into a harem sushi? Then this show is definitely for you. People who expected incest. Sorry. See my story review comment above (If you all came here because of (a) certain reviewer(s) from youtube said this is incest..well..they were slightly right?). People who wanted a great, complex, mind blowing or even a concrete story? Umm.. ha ha ha... You're in the wrong section, friend... This show have deviated a bit far from it's original source to become an ecchi/fanservice guilty pleasure sin. Typical fate of good number of anime adaptations or even original creations at times.Personally speaking that's where the whole show should've focused on. Just be your typical ecchi with some comedy moe moments at the side. At least that way it could've been another staple of the ecchi/moe genre, but instead it tried to mix both it and the original source's story in an attempt to deliver something that all fans could enjoy, resulting in a shaky mess....All in all, it was not bad... but definitely not good. It was a stable harem series. Nothing more.Honestly this should've been a VN (visual novel) or even a galge (gal game)...

It was suggested to me by someone on reddit, and I thought y\'know...why not? The idea here is that it\'s a typical harem setup...with a funny twist!Story - 2 (Dreadful)Kumagoro Mikadono, the owner of a company with his namesake(Mikadono Group), ends up dying and leaving it all to his supposed heir, the main character Shougo. However, he placed one stipulation here before the company truly gets handed over to him. He has to get married and have a wife first. This is where your typical harem type comedy comes into play. He transfers to a new...school, and obviously with a last name Mikadono, the same as the company, women are throwing themselves at him left and right for various reasons. So getting women couldn\'t be easier! Except the twist comes. Kumagoro Mikadono had an illegitimate daughter, and Shogo doesn\'t know her nor does he remember a good bit of his past due to an injury. So he has a sister....and she goes to the same school as him.Yikes! The premise essentially becomes him trying to find a wife, with his potential sister being among them. The first couple episodes hilarity definitely ensues, where he\'s even placed in bed with two of the women he suspects to be his sister. He had been fed sexual enhancement foods prior, and he has to strain himself all night to not make a fatal mistake while these women get comfortable next to him. Sounds hilarious, doesn\'t it?And then the show falls apart after we establish a plot. There are so many plot holes, tedious moments, and overuse of fan service it becomes overwhelming. At times I just wanted to turn the show off. The series also tries to adopt a type of mystery feel as it progresses, where Shougo tries piecing together clues and moments of his past to find out that one simple question. But that aspect just feels forced, and at times it feels like Shougo is just going around accusing everyone of being his sister anyway. The amount of coincidence and convenience for plot in this show is also obscene, where some of these girls knew him prior to the accident that gave him the scar on his forehead(which caused his memory loss). Not only did they know him prior though, they also loved him back then as well. It\'s ludicrous.**SPOILERS**The anime isn\'t even that bad, funnily enough, compared to the light novel adaptation in terms of plot coincidence/convenience. Seriously, go read a wiki on it. There\'s so many forced twists for the sake of things, you can\'t help but laugh out loud at how far fetched all this is. One girl  believed to be his sister ends up really just being his cousin instead(Which doesn\'t make things any better, by the way). The girl he eventually chooses for his wife actually ends up being the illegitimate daughter anyway. Then it\'s revealed he\'s not even really Kumagoro Mikadono\'s son, so he\'s not blood related to the ""sister"" making it k.One word summarizes this: ""Wat""**END SPOILERS**Art - 5 (Mediocre)Nothing to write home about here.

I think the aspect that honestly makes me scratch my head the most isn\'t even the beta main character surrounded by T&A constantly, not just one but two generic  tsundere characters, ditzy genki girl, or even the red herring used to purposely throw you off  incessantly.

We later learn that Mister X is actually a woman(surprise...not really), but also has to expose her skin everyday for specific periods of time, to become one with the atmosphere and eliminate her presence(explained as her odor). So how best to do this? By being naked from head to toe in Shogo\'s room while he\'s there.

An investigation full of twists begins..."", ""Shogo Mikadono had been living a comfortable, carefree life up until high school.  As the only child of the Mikadono group, a wealthy network of the Mikadono family and it’s friends and business partners, he’s been selected as the sole heir to the company and family name that his father, Kumagoro Mikadono, has dedicated his life to strengthening and expanding.  Unfortunately, on the day of his ageing father’s death, when Shogo is finally given a taste of what’s written in the family patriarch’s will, it’s revealed that in order for the young heir to inherit his father’s very lucrative estate, he must undergo...one final task;  To enroll at a certain high school, fall in love with a dignified and agreeable classmate, and make her his fiancee, with whom he’ll be sharing untold riches on the day of their marital vows!  It might not be the most romantic grounds for a proposal that anyone’s ever heard of...  Still beats the idea of having to come together to repopulate the earth, when you get right down to it...  But for a rich man to marry an attractive woman who’s only interested in business and money isn’t a new concept, and it certainly isn’t unheard of.However, as is the unfortunate pattern of life, even the simplest plans must become complicated somewhere down the line.  Not long after hearing about this stipulation, he’s confronted from just out of reach by a soft, reassuring voice that he won’t always be alone...  That the owner of the voice is his long lost sister, who has every intention of marrying him and staying by his side forever.  Wait, did I say soft and reassuring?  Because I meant deeply concerning, as it turns out that his father did in fact father an illegitimate daughter who’s been separated from him since birth, and to make this revelation even more shocking is the fact that the girl with the voice is also going to his new school!  Now, his attempts to pluck a bridal rose from a garden full of crazy weeds is being hampered by the fear that one of his sultry suitors may actually be his secret sister!  This matrimonial minefield is made even harder to cross by the fact that with each step that moves him forward, he’s being confronted by red herrings that are only pretending to be his sister for their own ends.  Can Shogo safely pick the woman of his dreams and collect his rightful inheritance, or is the only thing he’s bound to inherit a deformed child and a one way ticket to Alabama?You know, the longer I do these reviews, the more likely I am to cross every single animation studio off of my list at some point.  This time around, we’re talking about Studio Gokumi, a company that spun off from Gonzo in the early 2010’s.  The name literally means Studio Group 5, which...  I don’t know.  I have no idea what that does, or even COULD mean on a larger scale.  In any case, they haven’t done very much work, although I have seen two of their shows before, namely A Channel and Yuki Yuna is a Hero, two shows whose best qualities were their visual qualities.  A Channel, like most of Gokumi’s early work, was low budget, but managed in such a way that it’s lack of funds could never hurt it in any noticeable way.  Yuki Yuna, like most of Gokumi’s later work, was gorgeously animated with a lavish budget that the producers took full, appreciative advantage of.  Between the two, Nakaimo is closer to A Channel, being one of the studio’s earliest projects, and it looks way better than it really needed to look, given the nature of the material.True to form, Nakaimo looks perfectly fine.  The visuals aren’t mind-blowing of world-challenging, but they’re more than serviceable enough to be above complaint.  The animators were very clearly working with a tight budget, so the movement on screen is never exactly fluid, but the characters still move just as much as they need to to convey a sense of life.  There are shortcuts taken, which is kind of inevitable in such a situation, as movement occasionally has to be limited to save some money, but it’s never prominent enough to bother even the most astute viewer.  Not to mention, these shortcuts pay off with interest when the show DOES want to dazzle us with more impressive shots, such as one of the main characters swimming in beautifully animated water, or when they need to show us random CG effects like a can flying at someone’s head from off screen.  I’ve said before that given the choice, I’d prefer a well-managed low budget over a lackadaisical high budget at least seven times out of ten, and Nakaimo easily delivers on what I wanted to see from it.The artwork is also very pretty, with it’s only real flaw being certain shots where the background has an unnatural sort of heavenly shine to it.  It doesn’t happen often, thankfully, but it’s irritating when it does.  The backgrounds are fairly well drawn, and while most man-made backgrounds to have a surprising level of intricacy in their design and range of details, things like grass, trees and bushes do blur a bit when you look at them closely.  The characters themselves are drawn to type, milking the most cliched archetypes of the ecchi genre dry, extending all the way to the teacher being a little girl.  You’ve got the cosplaying loli, the pigtailed flat-chested tsundere, the overdressed goth-loli sweetheart girl, and of course Itsuke from Haruhi as the protagonist.  It’s saving grace is that once you get past the clichés, the characters are still designed and drawn really well, although the constant blushing can get extremely annoying.  The lighting and filtering effects are also utilized well, if not very often.The soundtrack is a bit on the generic side, but it’s not bad by any means.  It’s very pretty in it’s orchestration, but it’s also really repetitive, as any given track just loops around every few seconds or so.  It does it’s job well enough, and you’ll hardly notice it, unless it’s doing the one thing about it that impressed me...  Instead of playing off the little sister mystery as sexy or romantic, moments dealing with the mystery...  AKA phone calls allegedly from the sister and certain off-color remarks tying into it...  Are paired with music that actually manages to make the concept feel creepy or ominous, which is how it damn well should feel, so props for that.  The opening theme, Choose Me Darling by StylipS, is your typical fast, catchy song from multiple harmonized female singers, but what makes it awesome is the percussion underneath it, which creates a pretty memorable beat.  That, and i’m pretty sure a decent amount of the animation budget went into it, as it makes for a pretty awesome watch, and it goes out of it’s way to introduce the characters and several plot points that happen throughout the show.The English dub was produced by Sentai Filmworks, and before I start doling out the praise...  Of which I have plenty to go around...  I’m going to have to go into some negatives, because Nakaimo’s dubbers made two huge mistakes.  First of all, I was shocked to see that Steven Foster wasn’t on this dub.  Yeah, he quit a while ago, but I’ve only ever seen lip-synching this bad under his direction.  In his heyday, his response to the critics blasting him for his translation choices was to release dubs where he stayed true to the original Japanese right down to the letter, and stopped giving a fuck about lip flaps.  These were his *better* dubs, so I’m kind of assuming the company figured out from him that they can do this to save some time and effort and still remain on peoples’ good sides.  This purely speculative explanation, whether true or untrue, doesn’t excuse the final product, where characters talk while their mouths are closed and stop talking while their mouths are still open.  It’s over-all a pretty sloppy job, but the other mistake is even worse.See, there are several voice actors in the anime industry who have immediately distinctive voices.  I like to bring these individuals up as...  How can I put this gently...  Target practice for beginner voice chasers.  You don’t need much experience in voice chasing to recognize voices like Greg Ayres, Luci Christian, Monica Rial, Brittany Karbowski, J Michael Tatum or Hillary Haag, because while these are all fantastic actors, they can not disguise their voices for shit.  This usually isn’t a problem, as you don’t need to be a chameleon to be a good actor, but Nakaimo presents a unique circumstance.  The plot of the story revolves around finding out which member of the harem is Shogo’s little sister, and right in episode 1, we’re given a brief clip of the sister’s real, unfiltered voice.  Sentai was clever enough to not credit this voice, but it uses the same actor as the eventually revealed sister character, and they used the most distinct-sounding voice actor they had.  They could have used Emily Neves, who’s actually really good at disguising her voice, but nope!  Even the most unseasoned of viewers can figure out the mystery as soon as the sister talks again.For this reason and this reason alone, I almost want to recommend the Japanese track with subtitles, as the sub didn’t make this mistake, but if you did that, you’d be sacrificing what actually turns out to be a pretty awesome dub.  I’ll admit that Clint Bickham is a bit awkward in the beginning, but he grows nicely into the character before long.  Monica Rial and Brittany Karbowski play his two most prominent love interests, and of course, they’re more than reliable even with the worst material, which is good, because by the end of episode 1, they’ve respectively gushed to themselves over how puffy and cream-filled their boobs are and tried to badger Shogo into sticking his tongue into them through convoluted logic.  I would not trust lines like this to any other actors, so thank god the director knew what material to drop in front of what actor.  Most of the actors are newcomers and less-popular names, with the exception of veteran Tiffany Grant as the trio’s homeroom teacher, and while everyone does a pretty damn good job, none of them stand up enough to be brought up on the same platform as our three leads.  If it wasn’t for the serious misstep I mentioned earlier, I’d tell you to skip the dub and watch it in Japanese...  You know what?  Screw it, just do that.  Good acting isn’t worth spoilers.Off the top of my head, I can pick out two genres and one trend that have dominated the anime landscape in recent years, earning an equal amount of ire from anything but the lowest common denominator of the anime viewing community.  These genres are Harem and Moe, and the trend...  One that many critics wish would just go away and die already...  Is incest.  Specifically little sister incest, because incest without focus apparently isn’t abrasive enough.  The harem genre has been a mainstay for decades at this point, and in it’s trek through time, it’s become one of the laziest, samiest things imaginable.  I mentioned earlier that the characters were drawn to type, and that’s because there are a lot of repetitive types to draw from.  Moe hasn’t been around quite as long, but it’s become just as repetitive with it’s sexist characterizations and shameless melodramatic tragedy porn.  These three elements are copied and pasted to death because they work...  People flock to them, both here and especially in Japan, so nobody bothers changing it.  That would be all well and good, if it wasn’t for the crushing feeling that people pushing out this material know damn well that they don’t have to try.Well, this was more or less what I was expecting when I bought the series on DVD, but I was very quickly astounded to notice just how much this series DOES try.  It puts forth genuine effort to be more than the some of it’s parts.  If you haven’t had the mystery spoiled for you...  Which means you’re probably watching the sub...  It’s a shockingly good mystery, played out through a story that’s way more interesting than anybody should justifiably expect it to be.  A character is introduced in episode 2 who’s supposed to be the show’s stand-in for one of the worst harem tropes imaginable, the ever insulting “Trap” character,  and while I won’t tell you just what their deal is...  It’ll be more satisfying that way...  I can think of two reasons the character was introduced.  The first I’ll get to later, but the second ultimately makes them my favorite character in the show.  Instead of acting as a member of the harem, they exist to help Shogo unravel the mystery of his sister through their epic set of ninja investigation skills.  This in turn adds a little more depth and attention to the plot, which can often be forgotten among the tons of fanservice.The story has many twists and turns, and a handful of the characters do get individual arcs, which is a common enough way for a story like this to explore each member of the harem, but Nakaimo does it a little differently.  While each arc ties into the fleshing out of an individual character, they also revolve around the mystery of his sister’s identity, with each one setting up what we’re supposed to believe is a new red herring for him and his gender-neutral ninja sidekick to discuss and solve.  Each character with the exception of the student council president has their own backstory, their own tough circumstances, and their own reasons for getting tied into the mystery.  What they don’t have, however, is individual reasons to pursue Shogo, because guess what?  Half the harem don’t even really want him!  Only three of the six girls compete over him, with the other three busy pursuing their own interests that he may or may not be relevant to.  It’s a pretty sad commentary on the repetitive nature of the harem genre that THAT’s a breath of fresh air.  Having said that, I liked these characters, underwritten as they may have been, and I genuinely cared what happened to them.  Shuffle and Maken-Ki didn’t make me feel that way.After all that praise, you’re probably expecting me to call Nakaimo a genre defying masterpiece, right?  Oh God no.  It may be one of the better products of it’s genre, but it’s still a product of it’s genre, and as such, it comes with a lot of the same trappings.  When it comes to the writing that carries the series to it’s full run, coincidence is the rule, not the exception.  It’s hard not to roll your eyes at how the different arcs incorporate themselves into the little sister theme, from a girl claiming to be his sister to promote her little sister maid cafe to the entire school thinking Shogo’s so awesome that calling him Big Brother becomes a trend.  Even when the plot gets really interesting towards the climax, it doesn’t...  DO...  A climax, and very little is actually followed up on.  Also, I should probably mention that there’s a ton of nudity in this anime.  Not only that, but they go out of their way to show every female character named at some point...  Well, thankfully, this excludes the teacher.  I generally separate nude scenes into categories of integral, incidental and forced, and while Nakaimo’s are all over the place, most of them feel forced.  Hell, the other reason the gender-flip character exists is to guarantee maximum flesh output.  Seriously, they’re excuse for casual nudism makes the chick from MGS who breathes through her skin seem legit.Oh, and by the way, if you’re one of the special little snowflakes who gets triggered when they hear a work of fiction called ‘sexist,’ you might want to jump on over to one of my other works.  “You can’t call a fictional work sexist, that’s stupid, it’s not real!”  Yeah, well, there’s a reason the term pop culture has the word culture in it.  The way you write people is a reflection of the way you view them, and the popularity of the work is a reflection of how accepted that mindset is.  Nobody watches Coal Black without thinking “That’s racist.”  On that note, there are several character constructs of the harem genre that I consider sexist, and while Nakaimo only hits a few of them, it’s still really bad.  Girls holding onto a crush for well over ten years is sexist and unrealistic.  Girls becoming obsessed over a boy over a misunderstanding that makes her think they’re betrothed is sexist and paints women as idiots.  Girls being so thirsty for the D that they claim being a pedophile is better than being gay is...  Well, I’ll give them this, at least it’s a new one.  But it still ties into the harem genre’s age-old insistence that girls will obsessively want the self-insert male character, and through him, the lonely male viewer.If there’s one area where this show actually did come close to impressing me, it’s with the actual little sister character.  While the series begins on a note that some sexy, exploitative Imouto hijinks are about to go down, you find out by the end that while the plot line is wildly misguided, it does manage to follow a more scientific interpretation of incestuous feelings, ala the idea of Genetic Sexual Attraction.  In a nutshell, it’s been more or less proven that when two blood siblings aren’t raised as siblings, they’re genetically predisposed to find each other attractive later in life, and yeah, Nakaimo does adhere to this, whether intentionally or not.  Unfortunately, I don’t think the writers really know what they had with this material, because it’s an uncommon enough subject matter that it still deserves to be taken seriously, and some serious groundwork needs to be laid down before it can ever be approached with this level of ecchi kitsch.  I won’t spoil how the series ends, obviously, but like with all of it’s other promising aspects, it winds up dropping this ball pretty hard.  Like I said before, I do appreciate it for trying.Nakaimo, My Sister is Among Them is available from Sentai Filmworks, and can generally be found on Blu-Ray and DVD at a very generous 30-40 dollar price range.  The set comes with an OVA episode 13, and while it kinda ties something off, it's ultimately not that important to the story.  The original light novel by Hajime Taguchi is not available stateside, and I’m kind of feeling like that’s a good thing, because it continues way longer than the anime, and some of the spoilers I’ve heard about the extended story have been pretty cringeworthy.  The manga adaptation, illustrated by Mottun, is also not available stateside.Despite it’s unfortunate history, harem anime don’t have to be bad.  They can be great, just like any other genre.  The difference is that all the good harem titles I can think of were high concept works that used the genre as a backdrop for a clear, ambitious plot that received most of the writer’s focus.  A few good examples would be Chobits and some versions of Negima.  I wouldn’t put it anywhere near the same playing field as those titles, but for what it’s worth, Nakaimo DID vastly exceed my expectations.  Of course, I was expecting it to be a 1/10 piece of filth, so that’s admittedly not saying much.  It tried, and at the end of the day, that alone made me develop a soft spot for it.  There was some genuine effort that went into making this title stand out among it’s genre, and while that effort might have ultimately been bogged down and silenced by the trends and clichés of the genre, it still makes enough of an impact to show what the genre CAN be.  I enjoyed this show, I’d watch it again, and I’d even recommend it to a few people, but I’d be a bad critic if I didn’t judge it as a whole.  I give Nakaimo: My Sister is Among Them a 4/10. one final task;  To enroll at a certain high school, fall in love with a dignified and agreeable classmate, and make her his fiancee, with whom he’ll be sharing untold riches on the day of their marital vows!  It might not be the most romantic grounds for a proposal that anyone’s ever heard of...  Still beats the idea of having to come together to repopulate the earth, when you get right down to it...  But for a rich man to marry an attractive woman who’s only interested in business and money isn’t a new concept, and it certainly isn’t unheard of.However, as is the unfortunate pattern of life, even the simplest plans must become complicated somewhere down the line.  Not long after hearing about this stipulation, he’s confronted from just out of reach by a soft, reassuring voice that he won’t always be alone...  That the owner of the voice is his long lost sister, who has every intention of marrying him and staying by his side forever.  Wait, did I say soft and reassuring?  Because I meant deeply concerning, as it turns out that his father did in fact father an illegitimate daughter who’s been separated from him since birth, and to make this revelation even more shocking is the fact that the girl with the voice is also going to his new school!  Now, his attempts to pluck a bridal rose from a garden full of crazy weeds is being hampered by the fear that one of his sultry suitors may actually be his secret sister!  This matrimonial minefield is made even harder to cross by the fact that with each step that moves him forward, he’s being confronted by red herrings that are only pretending to be his sister for their own ends.  Can Shogo safely pick the woman of his dreams and collect his rightful inheritance, or is the only thing he’s bound to inherit a deformed child and a one way ticket to Alabama?You know, the longer I do these reviews, the more likely I am to cross every single animation studio off of my list at some point.  This time around, we’re talking about Studio Gokumi, a company that spun off from Gonzo in the early 2010’s.  The name literally means Studio Group 5, which...  I don’t know.  I have no idea what that does, or even COULD mean on a larger scale.  In any case, they haven’t done very much work, although I have seen two of their shows before, namely A Channel and Yuki Yuna is a Hero, two shows whose best qualities were their visual qualities.  A Channel, like most of Gokumi’s early work, was low budget, but managed in such a way that it’s lack of funds could never hurt it in any noticeable way.  Yuki Yuna, like most of Gokumi’s later work, was gorgeously animated with a lavish budget that the producers took full, appreciative advantage of.  Between the two, Nakaimo is closer to A Channel, being one of the studio’s earliest projects, and it looks way better than it really needed to look, given the nature of the material.True to form, Nakaimo looks perfectly fine.  The visuals aren’t mind-blowing of world-challenging, but they’re more than serviceable enough to be above complaint.  The animators were very clearly working with a tight budget, so the movement on screen is never exactly fluid, but the characters still move just as much as they need to to convey a sense of life.  There are shortcuts taken, which is kind of inevitable in such a situation, as movement occasionally has to be limited to save some money, but it’s never prominent enough to bother even the most astute viewer.

It doesn’t happen often, thankfully, but it’s irritating when it does.  The backgrounds are fairly well drawn, and while most man-made backgrounds to have a surprising level of intricacy in their design and range of details, things like grass, trees and bushes do blur a bit when you look at them closely.  The characters themselves are drawn to type, milking the most cliched archetypes of the ecchi genre dry, extending all the way to the teacher being a little girl.  You’ve got the cosplaying loli, the pigtailed flat-chested tsundere, the overdressed goth-loli sweetheart girl, and of course Itsuke from Haruhi as the protagonist.  It’s saving grace is that once you get past the clichés, the characters are still designed and drawn really well, although the constant blushing can get extremely annoying.

The manga adaptation, illustrated by Mottun, is also not available stateside.Despite it’s unfortunate history, harem anime don’t have to be bad.  They can be great, just like any other genre.  The difference is that all the good harem titles I can think of were high concept works that used the genre as a backdrop for a clear, ambitious plot that received most of the writer’s focus.  A few good examples would be Chobits and some versions of Negima.  I wouldn’t put it anywhere near the same playing field as those titles, but for what it’s worth, Nakaimo DID vastly exceed my expectations.  Of course, I was expecting it to be a 1/10 piece of filth, so that’s admittedly not saying much.  It tried, and at the end of the day, that alone made me develop a soft spot for it.  There was some genuine effort that went into making this title stand out among it’s genre, and while that effort might have ultimately been bogged down and silenced by the trends and clichés of the genre, it still makes enough of an impact to show what the genre CAN be.  I enjoyed this show, I’d watch it again, and I’d even recommend it to a few people, but I’d be a bad critic if I didn’t judge it as a whole.  I give Nakaimo: My Sister is Among Them a 4/10."", 'The ecchi scenes were marvellous, they were very erotic and some of them were coated with a touch of romanticism that made this anime stand out from the rest. Unfortunately all this build up gets thrown out of the window by the stereotypical ""friend"" or ""event"" that ruins the mood, nevertheless still a very enjoyable show.The girls were really pretty and hot, I wish more anime studios weren\'t afraid of showing nudity as ten years ago... good old days.Nakaimo gives you a good ending, no the best but still a good one, in my opinion you wont be disappointed considering how the plot developed...and how things turned out I think that ending was the most adequate one.Nakiamo delivers what it promises, a little sister anime with great ecchi moments. I had a great time watching it and if you just want to have fun with some lewd scenes this is it. and how things turned out I think that ending was the most adequate one.Nakiamo delivers what it promises, a little sister anime with great ecchi moments.

There are plenty of words to try and accurately describe how terrible this anime is, however you may feel like I\'m over exaggerating. Simply put, think of a deep exasperating sigh and the feel of dragging frustration and boredom, and you will have the feeling of watching this anime.The story starts off poorly but at least alright enough to watch. Our male MC Mikadono, Shougo is attending his fathers funeral when through the wall a female voice comes and tells him that she is his sister. His mother arrives and...tells him that to inherit the company he also needs to find a woman who he truly loves and marries her. This leads to the troubling mystery premise of our show. Shougo must attempt to find a wife at his school and his sister could turn out to be the one he chooses, which he is fervently against.As the story progresses we are shown around 6 different girls, two being the most likely to be chosen. While all the girls gather around we have some of these girls pretending to be his sister for various reasons and personal gains. This is where the story becomes tedious and aggravating. We watch as shougo gets bothered and tricked and lied too, then he learns the true identity and all is forgiven, then the cycle repeats. We do eventually get to find out who his sister is however nobody is chosen to be his wife.The art and sound were not bad. Art was a bit old. the music was pretty good and the voice acting again pretty good.The characters were stifling. Shougo was too nice and understanding yet sometimes dominant. Most of the girls were clingy and un inspired blank molds. They didn\'t even bother to give them personality. Two girls out of the bunch stood out, one being a professional assassin who likes to reduce her scent by being naked in shougos room and the other a witch clothed spectacled girl who runs a maid cafe. I\'m not even going to bother naming the cast because it just doesn\'t matter.I hated this anime. I started watching it and it seemed like it might get a 6, however after the third sister impostor and the terrible writing and scenario scripting I nearly dropped it. I can\'t believe people can give decent harems low scores then look at this and say, ""yeah that wasn\'t bad, have an 8"". I love these themes and tags too, so it isn\'t like I dislike the anime for what it is at its core. It was just poorly written and planned out. Don\'t watch this, save yourself the time.TLDR: This anime is terrible, don\'t wast your time. Poor writing and scenarios, no personality characters, no conclusion to the romance. tells him that to inherit the company he also needs to find a woman who he truly loves and marries her.

However I understand why, the fanservice is pretty over the top and in the first 3 episodes they have several momentum breaking fanservice scenes for no good reason. These scenes are so bad I might have dropped this anime had I not read a review advising to stick with it and that it got better, I hope that others will do the same as well.Story: 8.5First off this story seems a little shallow with the ""Don\'t accidentally date your sister!"" plot device seeming like it won\'t get much done. However the story decides to throw twists in pretty...constantly, doing a good job to keep you on your toes and doubting what you know. The liberal use of fanservice aside they actually create a desirable main lead and a reason for these girls to be interested in him. For a harem they also take the interesting route of starting him off with 2 romantic interests and then expand the cast, however by the end of the anime there are only 3 real competitors so it hardly feels like a normal harem, and that\'s a great thing. This anime is a Mystery Harem in the order, never letting go the fact he can\'t figure out his sister yet keeping it interesting by throwing in new characters and motivations. The MC gets in a load of stereotypical ecchi harem situations but unlike most actually has reasons to be in them. A good example of this is when the female cast believes he is \'gay\' and decide to try to straighten him out through seduction. It gives us several scenes that you would typically see in an ecchi anime but actually bothers to make up a logical and fun reason to have it, and for that I thank this anime. Also tangent here, the MC in this can actually dance, I couldn\'t even of another Harem where the MC could dance well, this sadly is ruined a bit by the fanservice they smash in during this time however.Art 6.5:The arts not bad, but the animation is rather weak, the intro is utterly guilty of this feeling like its shot at half frame rate, I checked 3 different sources to see if this was an error but its really is just bad. It feels like they might have done the intro after making the whole rest of the anime. The show itself uses a lot of still shots with pan and zooming. The characters are drawn well enough (though the breast size seems to be whatever is convenient for the scene...) to be quite likable, but when comes to backgrounds and animations they\'re bellow average.Sound 8:The sound design of the anime is quite fitting, its not impressive like some anime (Fate/NGNL) which sweeps you off your feet but I never felt the lack of it or mixed feelings like I\'ve gotten in shows like Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. The voice actors do solid jobs so I have no complaints, only sad there are no standout tracks that make me have to go look them up (Date-A-Live) on the spot.Characters 9:How can I give a 9 to such generic characters? Honestly its because they act like they\'re supposed to. The cast are pretty stereotypical character models for harem females for the most part but they act like it. They are over the top and do stupid things but doing so in character makes them much more likable, I wouldn\'t mind if they were more complex characters. However that\'s what gets you a 10 in my scores, so despite the fact that I really liked them I had to dock them a point for not having too much to them. I will say this is the first time I\'ve been interested in 3 female leads in a harem. Normally only one will stand out, two at best but possibly because they don\'t dig too deep with them they\'re all fun and I don\'t harbor strong feelings towards the one I want to win like normal.Overall/ Enjoyment 8:I rate animes off my enjoyment of the world. I\'m a bit different from others in that I like the world created to be intriguing enough to want me to learn more about it. This anime made me go check the wiki for info about it after I finished, that automatically gets an 8 from me as I wanted to learn more about. Sadly very little of the manga is translated and none of the light novel, however the twists keep coming from what of the wiki I read. This series really suprised me, while I wouldn\'t call this a masterpeice it was well worth my time and its a shame so many will give up on it after reading these reviews constantly, doing a good job to keep you on your toes and doubting what you know.

As undoubtedly noted in synopsis, this follows a young lad slated to helm his father\'s company. To that end, he\'s transferred to a prestigious school with the goal of choosing a wife. To add a plot twist, he gets a mysterious caller who names herself his sister--and in that culture, marrying your sister is a terrible scandal!That\'s most of the story. Most of bits remaining consists of Shougo\'s getting along (or not) with the various girls. This is a harem story and ecchi genre, so panty shots and other lewd stuff happens. The aforementioned mystery begins appearing in episode 9,...but if you\'ve read any detective or mystery stuff, you\'ll probably be able to guess some of it.Overall, the story was meh. I don\'t mind some suspense, but had to force myself to sit through very bland characters and their schoolgirl doings to get to the ""what\'s really going on behind the scenes?"" Just me, but the story felt stilted aside from the mystery.Art\'s pretty straightforward. Each girl is reasonably pretty, and the expressions look human enough.

Maybe my high standards, but it felt like the anime\'s producers were rushing to get it done rather than get high-quality work.Characters...eesh, seen better. Shougo is very much not a confident guy, always easily pushed around. It\'s only when he decides to take on the mystery that he suddenly becomes fascinating. Even after, nope, he doesn\'t have any confidence with girls; frequently it\'s the girl who asks him on a date, he just goes along with it.Now the girls:1) Konoe is a typical ""easy catch for harem guy""2) Myabi, your really insecure girl3) Kunitachi, student council member who puts on a fierce air to hide her own bashfulness around Shougo. If this is an tsundere character, that never gets explored nor explained.4) Tendou, student council president, is just a rambunctious kid with great love of food5) Sagara was genuinely interesting for a bit, as she is involved deeply in the mystery and doesn\'t fall for Shougo suddenly, but after the series she\'s just another has-beenEnjoyment...if you come without standards, maybe you\'ll enjoy the suspense and fan service. I prefer anime with a good story, believable characters, and solid plot. Definitely not a good choice for serious anime fans.Overall, it was very bland.

But surprisingly this anime tries to approach the viewers with a mystery story for the next 12 episodes while the main character looks for his sister so he doesn't accidently marry her. To make it worst, his sister has a brother complex which doesn't help at all.So in conclusion, bad mystery (easy to guess whats going to happen), obvious harmen, and insest to wrap it up. Skip this anime unless you are here for the mediocre butts and nudes.Overall Rating6.2 "", ""Nakaimo attempts to deviate from the normal harem trope using the common moe cliches of little sisters and archetypes, changing from an average harem to one that ends up being somewhat opposite of just that. However, because of the more dramatic and serious tone of the show, the impact of the story falls flat in an attempt to maintain its drama with an environment of moe blob archetypes and underdeveloped characters.There's nothing special to be seen in Nakaimo. The art and animation are sub-par at best, and most if not all of the character designs are nothing special, other than hair color and someone who...wears a witch costume through a good portion of the series. Music did not stand out, nor make much impact on any dramatic scenes that deserved the attention. At the very least, the story itself is unique and a bit of a departure from the normal harem trope, but for reasons to be further explained in spoilers, it can't achieve its full potential of drama.The biggest weakness of this anime is its story-telling and pacing, and the characters involved in it. A good harem would present its cast of characters, and put them through some emotional trial, and force them to go through dramatic character dynamics to help them grow and form more intense relationships with each other. Unfortunately, for Nakaimo, rather than having regular character development, it puts the viewer in the same position as the main character; unaware of his surroundings, and confused.What makes this anime different from other harems is that instead of having to build relationships with multiple girls, our main character has to tread lightly and meticulously pick a suitor to marry, and is also wary of being lured in by his illegitimate little sister. So with this atmosphere, Shougo is constantly suspicious of the girls around him, hindering the relationships between them to grow. This is the exact opposite of what we need in a main character and his relationships with other girls.-Minor Spoilers, but In-Depth review follows-As if that itself wasn't enough of a problem, each girl has her own reason to actually go out of her way to fake being Shougo's little sister. This is the show's method of presenting trial for our main character, but in doing so it actually lowers the quality of the show. Being that it is a short series, each girl gets roughly 2-3 episodes to herself with her scheme of trying to pretend to be Shougo's little sister, and considering we don't actually find out who it was or why they did it until the end of their arc, there is little to no actual development of the character herself, nor any growth in the bond with Shougo.When the final mystery of the anime is revealed to the audience and main character, the unfortunate truth is that the revealed character didn't receive the proper development over the show. Even the last few episodes that should be dedicated to this character were not, and further hindered the climax of the show. but it is fair to say that she receives the most attention and development compared to the other girls (which isn't saying much).

I don't normally just say that first but this one warrants it.Bad being subjective, let me follow up with the objective good. It has a proper ending. If you were into the show, and cared, it resolves the main plot issue of the anime. The others that it hasn't really touched upon yest are left open for further development. Unfortunately I seriously didn't care so YMMV.The series big problems ?It's a comedy that didn't make me laugh, NOT ONCE!!!!! . It did manage to put me to sleep so it may have some value there.  There were opportunities but they weren't well...used. I did watch it dubbed so maybe the humor was thee in the original Japanese and didn't make it over.It's a romance ? Nah not really. I certainly didn't feel it. Maybe it was the whole setup of having the main character forced into the situation, maybe it was the fact the attempt of a mystery element overshadowed any possibility romance. Or maybe, it was just the fact that what passes for romance is, really weak.Mystery ? I went with my first instinct and was right. Kind of killed it, but even if that wasn't the case it still wouldn't of been a good mystery. To make a mystery work, you need the riddle, you need clues, and you need motivations for the actions that make sense, and you need tension. There was no tension here. Can't say more without giving away too much of the structure. There was no real motivation for most of the key actions that were meant to contribute to the mystery. If the killer isn't a psychopath they need a reason to kill. Here you just kind of scratch your head.  The clues are just annoying. You get clues, that are important, accurate and then invalidated for silly reasons.The story fails on multiple levels. The hook is novel and interesting. It has an incredible amount of potential but there's just too much you have to overlook. No spoiler here, but at the beginning you are told, the father had been dying for 6 months and it's clear he wasn't comatose, yet the takes no time to convey information needed to his children, or provide for them, undercuts the premise. After that it goes down hill on trying to draw you in.  As mentioned up top, the arc resolves, so there's at least that.Characters. Shougo is interesting. He has his motivations, mostly acts believably in dealing with the insanity. Some of his reactions are off even taking into account the restrictions of the genre but that's hardly unreasonable. The other characters take 2D women to a new level.The art is OK.  Faces are distinct and expressive, emotions well conveyed. Backgrounds could be better. The artwork was meant to be a supporting feature not the star and it does its job.The sound, oh the sound. The music was nothing special, but the voice acting was annoying. Most of the female characters sounded either weird, flat, or annoying, occasionally all three at the same time. used.

Or maybe, it was just the fact that what passes for romance is, really weak.Mystery ? I went with my first instinct and was right. Kind of killed it, but even if that wasn't the case it still wouldn't of been a good mystery. To make a mystery work, you need the riddle, you need clues, and you need motivations for the actions that make sense, and you need tension. There was no tension here. Can't say more without giving away too much of the structure. There was no real motivation for most of the key actions that were meant to contribute to the mystery. If the killer isn't a psychopath they need a reason to kill. Here you just kind of scratch your head.  The clues are just annoying. You get clues, that are important, accurate and then invalidated for silly reasons.The story fails on multiple levels. The hook is novel and interesting. It has an incredible amount of potential but there's just too much you have to overlook. No spoiler here, but at the beginning you are told, the father had been dying for 6 months and it's clear he wasn't comatose, yet the takes no time to convey information needed to his children, or provide for them, undercuts the premise. After that it goes down hill on trying to draw you in.  As mentioned up top, the arc resolves, so there's at least that.Characters. Shougo is interesting. He has his motivations, mostly acts believably in dealing with the insanity. Some of his reactions are off even taking into account the restrictions of the genre but that's hardly unreasonable. The other characters take 2D women to a new level.The art is OK.  Faces are distinct and expressive, emotions well conveyed. Backgrounds could be better. The artwork was meant to be a supporting feature not the star and it does its job.The sound, oh the sound. The music was nothing special, but the voice acting was annoying. Most of the female characters sounded either weird, flat, or annoying, occasionally all three at the same time."", 'This anime has probably been one of the strangest shows I have ever watched. I am aware of unpleasant stigma surrounding ""imouto shows"" and yet I found NAKAIMO to be a genuinely nice show. Regarding all the tags the show is labeled with: Comedy is only from interactions with the harem, Ecchi a very appropriate tag considering the bizarre abundance of nudity and fanservice, Harem is well self-explanatory but there are only really 3 girls so rest assured, Mystery is probably the most relevant tag since there is actually a decent amount of intrigue that is built up, Romance is honestly not really developed like...in most harem anime, School is self-explanatory around 98% of the story takes place in the same city. NAKAIMO isn\'t a typical imouto show, it subverts those tropes rather well but falls I admit it does indulge in very common harem tropes.Story: 7 (Better than I expcted)It\'s quite a mild story, but it does not create BS elements that change everything. It is fairly linear, following the protag\'s analysis of each girl and determining whether or not if they are his sister. However there are patterns you can observe and thus deduce who the culprit is. Major plot events have a decent amount of emotional and subtle foreshadowing behind them. All in all, the story will honestly surprise you as it differs greatly from conventional harem anime.Art: 6 (A bizarre amount of nudity?)It greatly baffled me when I saw the first slice of nudity from this show. Most of the nudity isn\'t even used for ecchi moments, just when the girls are in a bath/shower. The weird thing is that sometimes you would see nudity in these scenes whereas others featuring the exact same character wouldn\'t. They probably should\'ve tried to stick hard to one demographic, either adult or adolescent but the story would probably be more enjoyable for an adolescent. The fan service is usually pretty short and obviously embarrasses the girls in various ""cute"" ways. Regarding character or background design, nothing really stands out too much. I will probably forget the names of most of the characters in a few days.Sound: 6 (Falls into harem tropes)The music played at any given point will usually indicated to me what was going to happen next. For instance, it was really obvious when a girl was going to walk in on the protag\'s accidental molestation of a different girl. The OP is pleasant and probably the best musical part of the show. Didn\'t really watch much of the ED.Character: 5 (Sometimes? more depth than you think)Of all the main characters, only protag and one of the girls (not listing cause spoiler) gets thorough development. Both individuals learn about each other and form many friendships with other students. The other students however, are typical school council or harem tropes unfortunately. Protag\'s mom is barely in the show and all the businessmen he talked to are pretty much one-note. You would think that harem shows are usually character driven, but this show doesn\'t follow that trend.Enjoyment: 7 (Overall enjoyable)Although stale at many points in the last few episodes, this show was able to keep me entertained through revelations in the story. Some loose ends are probably intentional left unfinished but the ending was passable. If you\'re watching this for the ecchi, this show probably won\'t do you much good. If you want to watch a harem, this show is unique enough to provide you with a different experience (I\'ve watched quite a few harem anime up to this point). Comedic parts of the show are pretty lacking, often relying on tried and tested rom-com scenarios (shopping for clothes, falling on each other, etc.).Overall: 6 (Good if your standards are low)NAKAIMO is my no means a must-watch anime and I honestly wouldn\'t recommend watching this show if you are trying to enjoy some anime or are getting into it. If you\'ve watched a lot of anime and know what to expect from the ""harem"", then this show will be a good time waster. If you want some soft-hentai material, this will probably suit your tastes (it has nipple shots but nothing else). This really feels like a show that is made for horny teenagers given the premise of the show and how horny every female character is towards the protag. The protag\'s scenario can\'t really be related too and you\'ll probably forget bascially everything about this show a few weeks after you watch it. in most harem anime, School is self-explanatory around 98% of the story takes place in the same city.

All is good for a great plot, there\'s only one problem with this: They fked it up.When creating a mystery what you want to do is to leave clues for other people to guess and figure things out, not leaving the answer. That\'s exactly what this anime did, create a mystery ONLY TO GIVE AWAY THE ANSWER AT THE VERY NEXT SCENE making to whole thing pointless. While yes...the main grand mystery only left clues and revealed itself in the end but the small one like the girls pretending to be his sister was handled very clumsily that it gave away itself faster then you can say ""best waifu"". Even when the anime tried to create a twist at later episodes it was also handled poorly giving away the answer before giving any clue.Plot aside how about the rom-com? the characters? well...it\'s a somewhat a mixed bag. while some girls are likable and quite fun to watch but the creator made them into horny sluts who would strip and temped the mc to make love with them even when it made no sense to do so. ""Childhood friends?"" ok let me feed you ""hard on pills"" and sleep topless on your bed next to you. ""Pretending to be lover?"" sure let me strip naked at school in an empty room and climb on top of you. ""Tomboyish girl?"" an excuse for me to be literally naked in your room. This made scene that were meant to be relationship building between the mc and the love interests only to be fan service moment (yes some anime can do a good job with both relationship building and fan service, not in this anime though). What about Shougo? While he is a decent mc but he is also the dumbest smart person, he was able to solve the mysteries but at the same time had the tendency of giving away crucial/secretive information to complete strangers without even knowing them first.This anime had so many potential with it\'s great setup and fun characters. what a disappointment. the main grand mystery only left clues and revealed itself in the end but the small one like the girls pretending to be his sister was handled very clumsily that it gave away itself faster then you can say ""best waifu"".

So it is supposed to be mystery anime in which main character, Shougo Mikadono, is looking for his future wife, but among those girls there is also his mystery sister. OMG what a twist!This guy doesn’t think incest is wincest, so he wants to find out who is imouto and avoid choosing her accidentally (imouto for some twisted reasons wants to be chosen though… she is...one of those incest-imoutos like Kirino Kousaka from Oreimo or Akiko Himenokoji from OniAi, if that's your thing this anime is must-see I guess).There may be some spoilers ahead. But I think I don’t even need to tell you who is imouto to ruin the mystery, show ruins it without me.At first this concept sounded pretty stupid to be honest, but also kinda promising comedy-wise so I decided to watch. I like harem, comedy and ecchi combination and mystery sounded refreshing addition, how that would  even work?Well… it didn’t work.Mystery was just not very good. Honestly I guessed it right before watching any episodes, judging by the character designs alone I had a hunch who is imouto and it turned out to be right very soon with all those little but obvious hints and even more obvious red herrings… That was very disappointing, I was almost expecting to be proved wrong because that would’ve made mystery good, or actually I wanted to be proven wrong. But it was just as predictable as I feared. Predictability is of course a curse in mystery genre and this anime suffers from it a lot.And yes I also predicted that after the mystery Imouto is revealed (the end of this anime) eventually it turns out they are not siblings after all (in light novels) - that guess was right too it seems. Sighs… Plot twists in light novels are honestly just ridiculous and confusing to be honest, but not surprising in a good way. Good mystery is surprising, but simple. This was anything but…I only talk about anime from now on, so imouto remains imouto for me, I am not planning to read light novels and honestly seems that anime is at least better than them… It doesn’t mean much though.Story: 3 Good ideas here and there, but mostly gone totally wrong. Everything goes as you expect or then your expectations were too high. Seeing those hints or identifying red herrings doesn’t make you feel smart but makes you wonder if you are expected to be stupid. Fortunately show seems to realize this at times and don’t dumb down the most obvious. But it still doesn’t save the mystery from being predictable which makes it boring and frustrating to watch.Art: 6 Mediocre. Nothing special, not ugly, but pretty simple and rather generic character designs. Very light colors, which is a pretty interesting stylistic choice. There is nudity which means some bare oppai here and there. You’ll be warned.Sound: 6 Nothing especially stands out, for better or for worse. VAs do their job, OP and ED are there but I don’t remember them anymore... that tells something.Characters 4: There is this usual harem-cast, one guy and his girls. I personally liked Shougo, he is generic and has not much character, but he is not a complete loser. He is actually somewhat capable, not just kind. He can dance, reason and control his sexual impulses pretty well even in those lucky pervert situations he finds himself in all the time. And he is also rich, future president of his father’s company and sort of guy that girls would actually be interested in (for monetary reasons alone). Problem in many harem animes is that the main character is very useless in all ways, yet all the girls fall for him just because he is after all a nice guy. Shougo is a rich guy who is also nice. Yet he is boring as main characters usually are, there is nothing especially personal in him, and he doesn’t develop much. There is also this cliché that he has lost his memory and these ”new girls” are actually his childhood friends who have (of course) always loved him. Yes they have that cliché too. Girls are also pretty unoriginal. Tsundere, airhead, another tsundere who is elitist, cosplaying genius, reverse-trap modern day ninja and girl that is practically just boobs. Honestly that is how I would describe Konoe Tsuruma, she likes cream puffs alright, but other than that her character traits are just... her cream puffs (more ways than one). Okay she is also revealed to be homophobe, not a redeeming quality. Another homophobe is the tsundere Miyabi Kannagi. She actually says that the incest is better option than homosexuality!?.... Like what is wrong with this anime?! I understand that many in Japan are rather conservative, but I haven’t seen such a homophobic anime before that says incest is better option…. It’s just those jealous characters in that one episode but still… very weird and frustrating.Cosplaying genius Mei Sagara and elitist-tsundere Rinka Kunitachi are a bit more promising characters, but development is minimal and all girls have pretty much same arcs, they are all suspected to be sisters for some reason, they fall in love with MC and join his harem after misunderstandings are cleared up. Airhead class president Mana Tendou joins the harem just because all others do and has no arc of her own.Mizutani Ikusu or Mister X, and of course she is really a girl that surprises no one after you see and hear the character and Mister X is also the cause of previously mentioned unneeded burst of homophobia. She is some sort of joke character and as spy, or sort of ninja, she tries to uncover the identity of the sister along with main character, she also hangs around naked for ninja-related reasons (just fan-service) and despite her cross-dressing and obvious lack of sexual education she is probably the best option of all those girls.Enjoyment  5: I’m easy to please, yet this mystery was so lacking. Comedy was at times poor as well and overall predictability made this anime mainly boring. It had some ok jokes though but not much, not enough to make it enjoyable. I was expecting a surprising twist.... it never came.Overall 4: Predictable attempt of ”mystery”, ecchi was mostly just mediocre at best, characters were cute but rather shallow and had no development. There were boobs though.... so I give decent I guess.

Most series write some kind of socially debilitating trait into either the protagonist or the girls to prevent them from resolving situations in a sane way and allowing for the escalation of increasingly improbable hijinks.In contrast to this, in Kono Naka has comparatively sane and level characters on both sides. Instead, they build the tension through the mechanism hinted at in the story's title: one of the girls in the harem is secretly the protagonist's sister (and he knows it). Since the protagonist has to get married...before graduation he's under immense pressure to find a girl he likes (and there are plenty interested in him). Over the course of the series, these two forces push him back and forth between playboy and gynophobe.It's refreshing because the actions of all the characters are (more or less) relatable; there are no insane characters or total idiots -- you can imagine these events actually taking place.It's not perfect of course. The anime is composed of three arcs. The first arc is by far the best (4 episodes). The second arc is quite weak (it could be cut without losing anything important). The third and final arc is ok; it picks up where the first arc ended but it's pretty predictable (my guess of the outcome made during episode 1 was validated in episode 12).To summarize: It's a show with a neat premise and OK execution. It could be better in the middle and the ending is predictable, but if you like harem comedies this is one to watch. before graduation he's under immense pressure to find a girl he likes (and there are plenty interested in him).

I hadn\'t heard much about this one so I put it off for a long time, but I\'m glad I finally got around to it. Although there are some stupid moments I could\'ve done without (people pretending to be the main character\'s sister for no apparent reason), overall I enjoyed the show. I spoiled myself to figure out who the real sister was from the beginning so I could have more enjoyment from the start of the show (since I\'m 100% not interested in the non-incest pairings), but your mileage...may vary.  For me though I was satisfied with the level of interactions the real sister has with her brother, and although the ending isn\'t totally satisfying, it\'s not as annoying as some.The show suffers in the same way that many ""harem"" anime shows suffer in that women endless love the main guy, sometimes for really illogical reasons, and nothing is ever decided as to who he actually picks. I  much prefer shows where a winner is chosen, but this one was fun enough, and at only 13 episodes you can get through it quite quickly. It\'s not a hentai so there are no nice sex scenes, but there are quite a few nude shots and lots of ecchi boob grabbing moments and similar.Art and animation were pretty nice, though fairly standard. I really enjoyed some of the voice acting for some of the characters, Miyabi, Shougou and Kunitachi especially. The story line with Sagara seems unexplained/weird, but other than that I enjoyed it. I\'d really like to see a season two, though from my understanding the continued story in the light novels gets very convoluted and I\'d prefer the anime to maintain the relationships as they are at the end of the series.Anyway, if you\'re looking for a somewhat light-hearted incest-positive anime, give it a go. You may not love the end results (incest is still frowned upon in this world), but the journey there is somewhat fun. may vary.

I mean seriously, he's getting girls by the minute, and these romantic situations are getting just plain old.But alas, my love for harems continued to spring and I decided to give this anime another shot and I'm pretty glad I did. The latest episode explains everything to why the characters act a certain way and the plot is actually pretty good once you finish the latest episode. Trust me, nothing is that great about the anime until episode 4.But, the anime still has its cons that make it not that enjoyable, but it still shouldn't...get overally bad ratings by people who just watch the first ep (like I did before) since the plot and the story clear up later on in the story. get overally bad ratings by people who just watch the first ep (like I did before) since the plot and the story clear up later on in the story."", 'WELL this is one of those typical harem, shounen genre anime where the girls just fall straight into the protagonist\'s lap and love him for who knows what reason.

I have to wonder, why did I decide to watch Nakaimo in the first place? I guess because the premise seemed interesting. Sadly, it turned out to be a total waste of time.Story:The premise of Nakaimo is pretty simple: a standard harem with one twist. Unlike something like Oreimo (where the protagonist knows who his sister is and is fine with dating her), the protagonist of this show didn\'t even know he had a sister (because of some poorly explained head trauma), and is doing everything he can to...not end up with her, even though the sister makes it clear that she plans on marrying him. I guess the appeal of this premise is the mystery behind who the sister is, but with one look at the poster, I guessed who it was perfectly. Once that aspect is gone, you get a completely bland, forgettable mess. The pacing was horrible too. The harem has a whopping six girls (one who is added later), and within 12 episodes, they try to give each of them at least 2-3 episodes of focus and ""character development"". These episodes only exist to make you frustrated about who the real sister is. It\'s not spoilers to say that each girl is framed as the real sister at least once, and it\'s just annoying to see that be thrown around so much. I\'ll get into how that went later, but the pacing ended up a mess because of it, and any attempt at a story is buried behind a ton of worthless fluff. In the first episode, one girl is hit by a truck. There are no consequences or impacts on the story. It\'s just something that happens.Art:The actual animation wasn\'t that bad, but the art was a pain to look at. The character designs were bad and the quality was the definition of low budget, and that\'s not even mentioning the ridiculous amount of fanservice found in the worst places. Also, I don\'t think the animators knew anything about how things look. There was a scene where a girl\'s dress strap goes untied, which actually can happen, but the animation makes it look like some sort of invisible pervert was untying it behind her back.Sound:This is harder to talk about because I don\'t actually remember any of the OST (that\'s how boring it was). But, the opening was catchy, and that\'s probably the only good thing about the show.Characters:Take your standard harem cast, boil down any potential interesting character development, and you\'re left with the starch-bland cast of Nakaimo. The protagonist is so generic that I can\'t even remember his name, and he\'s the kind of character who acts however the episode wants him to act with no continuity to his ""established"" personality, which is the worst type of character. The girls are all standard tropes, but instead of being entertaining or having some sort of twist like characters in other harems, they get no development whatsoever. I mentioned that the show tries to give each of them a few episodes of their own, but those attempts always fell flat on their faces. The characters are boring and generic with no depth at all, and to top it off, they\'re not even designed well.Enjoyment:This anime was a chore to watch. After starting it and then neglecting it for weeks, I had to sit myself down and watch the remaining episodes in one go. Even if I liked harems, I wouldn\'t like this show. I mean, right before this, I watched Nisekoi (which I actually really enjoyed), so I guess I just got my hopes up.Bottom line: this anime is a boring, generic, ugly waste of time. There\'s no reason you should watch it. Even if you\'re into fanservice harems, you\'re not going to find any enjoyment here. not end up with her, even though the sister makes it clear that she plans on marrying him.

After his father's death, he is left as the sole heir to the Mikadono Group. A large corporation which Shougo's father ran. In order to take head of the Mikadono Group, Shougo must find a woman he likes, and marry her. That's all the plot info you really need to know, so let's get onto the review...-Story: The story of the anime is pretty original, the biggest twist, is the little sister. At the very beginning of the series, Shougo learns he has a step-sister on his father's side. He then...learns that his sister not only wants to marry him, but goes to the same school as him. So, while trying to find a suitable bride, Shougo must uncover the mystery behind his little sister. The story in the anime is slightly better than mediocre for me. Of course, everybody has opinions.Moving onto the Art; The show is not a masterpiece, but it's not terrible. The animation is fluid, and the style of art is nice. To make this paragraph longer, I'm also going to throw in this sentence, as well as the sound review. The sound is not too bad. Nothing really stands out to me. So I give it a decent rating.Characters... Oh, the characters in this anime. We'll start off with the main character: Shougo Mikadono. As I explained above, he is the heir to a wealthy corporation and must find a bride by the time he graduates. I honestly can't think of words to describe him...There are 5 candidates able to be Shougo's sister. Konoe, the cute girl, whom Shougo meets first. Miyabi, the Tsundere who loses her Tsun-. Mei (Sagara), the owner of little sister cafe, and tends to like cosplaying (Or just dressing up). Rinka (Kunitachi) the vice-president of the student council, and a true tsundere. Finally, we have Mana (Tendou) the president of the student council, and a happy-go-lucky, ditsy character.Our final main character is X, or Ikusu. Is a girl, the same age as Shougo. At his school, she pretends to be a boy and passes off quite well. She is actually part of the Mikadono Group sent to help Shougo. She pretty much does whatever she likes, whether it be pretending to be with Shougo (Making people think he is gay) or parade around Shougo's apartment naked.There are a lot of characters and some are pretty interesting.My enjoyment I'd say is not too high. I prefer to watch it when I'm done watching all my other animes. This anime is filled to the brim with fanservice. From large breasts, of which the nipples are being covered by hair, towel or a shirt, to at one point, an incredibly short skirt. But, I expected as much from it. I'd say as far as enjoyment goes, 7/10.Overall, the anime is a light hearted anime and should be treated as such. The amount of awkward social situations Shougo finds himself in astounds me, and amuses me at the same time. Still, I've seen better anime. Overall; 6/10 learns that his sister not only wants to marry him, but goes to the same school as him.

And we know what that means? Try to figure out from a couple of grills who's your blood relative, while every fn last one of them teases you with brother stuff. Yeah,...that. Anyway, you can get the general idea who the sister is around the 9th part, and it is revealed.There are a couple important characters, beware, spolers, again.Konoe Tsuruma a big tiddy THICCC waifu, who will become the MC's wife in the endMiyabi Kannagi she is the Sister of the MC, big reveal, shes a flat loli type character, pretty cute ngl.Ikusu Mizutani a tomgirl i guess.. he looks like a boy in uniform, so reverse trap? anyway, she tries to help the MC figure out whos the sister. nickname MR.X - henlo umbrella you want back your name? too bad, honestly, the most important characters are just Konoe and Miyabi. even tho there are like 6 mains.The characters are cute, well modelled, every way, and hence its a fanservice ecchi anime, yes you can see boobies.8/10 would NOT watch it again, too predictable, and a slow phased story, overly built on fan service and the mysterious whos your lil sister stuff.But a good anime to watch and add to the collection, pleasing to look at it, not just at the naked parts, but at all. Although its predictable, the story stands for a pretty good anime. Just. Good. (got an8 because of horny stuff) that.

However, this show has following unique features1. Kinda strong plot, because search for his Imouto will be one of the reason you'll look forward into next episode.2. Nice humor, situation and character traits occasionally will take place during the show. If only there were more numerous. "", 'Nakaimo is basically as average as you can get. So average in fact, I forgot everything about it, including having already seen it, and watched it again. I had this marked as completed on MAL for who-knows-how-long, but could recall literally nothing about it, including the answer to the titular question, “who’s the MC’s little sister?”This is a PLOT heavy show that is heavy on actual plot. The premise is that the main character’s father has passed away, and he’s soon to become the head honcho at his dad’s company, so he’s going to attend a new, elite school, where he’ll become a refined, adult,...and find a wife… but, the catch is that his little sister, the illegitimate child of his father, also goes to the school; so, he’s gotta find a wife, and not ALSO bang his sister by accident in the process.This is a fan-service loaded, echi, rom-com anime that can’t decide if it’s for the incest, or against it. Honestly, I’m not a big fan of little sister incest plots. They have a bad tendency to come off as really weird, and fetishist most of the time. This time, it was even weirder when they’re passing around literal DNA tests trying to determine who the MC’s related to by blood.So, honestly, I question why I continued the show. I found that there were three reasons why I didn’t drop it and give it a 2 or a 3.1. I was perplexed that I’d seen this and didn’t remember it at all, and didn’t want to admit that I’d checked it as complete without seeing it at all.2. Once I started watching it, the plot actually did leave me guessing, because it seemed to be wrapping each question inside another question and leaving so many different flags, and red herrings that I couldn’t make heads or tails of what’s what.And the last reason is probably the most critical…3. The voice cast of this show is perplexingly loaded with all-star seiyuu on the Japanese side (no idea about the dub, I watched the sub).Keep in mind this series came out in 2012, so for some of these people this was fairly early on in their career, for others, not so much.The main character is played by Takahiro Sakurai (Reigan Arataka, Oshino Meme, Suzaku Kururugi), a VA legend, who’s been been in the business for a LONG time. He’s surrounded with female actresses who’ve also played some huge roles:Koshimizu Ami (Kallen Satdtfeld, Holo, Matoi Ryuuko)Ayane Sakura (Uraraka Ochako, Nakano Yotsuba, Gabi Braun)Kaori Ishihara (Souta from Dragon Maid, Aladdin from Magi, Murayama from DxD)Rina Hidaka (Milim Nava, Last Order, Filo)Ayana Taketatsu (Nino Nakano, Kirino Kousaka, Azusa from K-ON!)So in the end, what kept me from dropping this show was the voice cast for the most part. It was so crazy loaded with talent that I couldn’t pull myself away and forced myself to finish it, even though I didn’t really get any satisfaction out of the ending or the plot.So, I don’t really recommend watching this, unless you want to witness some VA’s in roles they’re DEFINITELY not known for. If you’re kind of a seiyuu nut, like I am, than watching this, and listening to their performances will leave you scratching your head, but will prove to be a moderately pleasurable experience. Hopefully I’ll remember I watched this series better now that I’ve written a review about it.If you decided to watch it, it can be found streaming on Hidive. and find a wife… but, the catch is that his little sister, the illegitimate child of his father, also goes to the school; so, he’s gotta find a wife, and not ALSO bang his sister by accident in the process.This is a fan-service loaded, echi, rom-com anime that can’t decide if it’s for the incest, or against it.

I tried my best to word things w/o spoiling anything.***Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru! is an anime that while the initial premise really pulled me in, its inability to provide thought provoking plot twists and just a sheer amount of unnecessary content really dragged it down.Story: 3/10So like I stated above this show actually had a pretty interesting concept. The show revolves around Shougo who is to become the head of his deceased father’s company. In order to do so however he must complete a guideline set forth by his father. This guideline demands that Shougo...must attend a certain high school, attract a mate, and marry before taking his spot as the head of the company (what an awesome dad). I didn't have a problem with this premise at all; in fact I thought just by hearing that first it could be an interesting harem. The story’s conflict arises early on when someone begins posting as his ill legitimate sister which could affect his position with the company. This is again another great idea to make the story more interesting. Where it goes wrong however is when it accuses every female character of being his sister. It’s also very easy (at least for me) to come up with a reasonable guess on who the real sister is very early on in the series. I guess where the series goes wrong the most is how predicable it is. There are really no interesting twists or misdirection that make me think, “Wow didn’t see that coming”. Another flaw in the overall story is how much pointless content is included in the middle episodes. I kind of feel like there was a struggle to make episodes the required length in episodes five through nine before the final “twist” was introduced. The show leads up to the final episode and in all honesty I felt like it was a letdown. Overall the story had a chance to bring something new to the harem genera but it ended up not hitting its intended marks.Animation: 8.5/10One great thing about this show is the stunning animation. Everything appears in very light colors and the use of reflections is done very well. The character models are all pretty detailed for both the main cast and some of the extras in the backgrounds. The scenery is colored much of the same way helping to keep the mood of the current scene. The main settings for the show, the school, Shougo’s room, and the café are all very detailed each time we are present.Sound: 7/10I am usually very picky on sound since most of my spare time is spent recording music or just listening to different types of music. The music of this anime while not amazing was still pretty good and helped set up some interesting scenes. The voice actors also did a pretty good job matching the personalities of their characters.Characters: 6.3/10This category is hard to score because while some of the characters did grow on me, every one of them are pretty generic. You have your elitist, airhead, tomboy, and cosplayer. We have all seen these roles countless times in other anime so why should we bother with these empty shells? That’s what I first thought when introduced to each character but to my surprise I actually grew to like some of these characters due to some character development. While some of them where pretty much cast aside without any development (Mana) most of the cast received one to three episode character arcs that pretty much set up why they fall for Shougo. The show should have done a better job fully utilizing the cast but overall they did a good enough job.Overall: 6.2/10While it isn’t a masterpiece, if you can look past some boring parts that lead to nowhere, predictable plot twists, and a forgettable anticlimactic ending, this show may offer you something worthwhile. There are some really good, sweet moments and some great animation and sound to be found here.Enjoyment: 5.8/10Thanks for reading my review!

(Hensuki) in that the main character must uncover the central mystery and just happens to plow through cute waifus making them fall in love with him while he\'s at it.(Spoiler) While this didn\'t change my rating, this show would have been infinitely better had the dub not ruined the mystery via voice on the first episode. I assumed it was done purposely, which kept me hooked on the show, but no it was a genuine...dubbing mistake. So without revealing anything, the sub is more recommended. (/Spoiler)The central cast get introduced quite quickly and the first few episodes can feel like charcter overload but the author then does an excellent job of creating plot which helps with you getting to know them. Very few characters are added after episode 2, meaning you get time and develop an attachment with each of them.Overall, Would recommend, especially for harem fans, dubbing mistake.

(2012)This show started off fairly well but quickly takes a steep decline especially with how obvious the story components are and how clueless characters are made to be and has an ending that doesn't have any real resolution to anything just we know who the sister is but it is easily figured out many episodes beforehand.Grinding my gears a bit is Ikusu Mizutani is so obviously drawn female that to have everyone be so oblivious would make it seem like she is unattractive yet fawned over by so many.Some plot devices are a bit stupid like...for example in episode 5 the associated issues would be resolved by using silent on the phone and thus the episode would be basically ruined but sorted.A big positive to look forward to in episode 6 with the Neko maid girls with ears and tails that react to emotion which was quite honestly SPECTACULAR.The artwork comes across far more gloomy than it should be considering the show is fairly old but also pretty modern. It looks nice and the ecchi is all good but the tone of the whole thing doesn't match up.The OP is good and the ED is good but neither is memorable. Voices are pretty good too with the voice actor for Shiga doing amazing with such a high pitch character voice. Generally, sounds are good enough going through.Character develops due to how much the show is trying to do is beyond rushed but at the same time, it is also very slow because of how unbalanced the show is. You get to know everyone but some just have major changes in personality like Rinka. The president Mana is at least consistent from start to finish.The show itself I honestly looked forwards too but it just did not meet the expectation of what it could have brought to the table. The main issue is that the story just sort of ends even with the 13th episode. It doesn't resolve any of the issues like the bad people and just leaves holes everywhere.I want to say various girls are best girls but I honestly only think Mana or Konoe are the honest girls where everyone ran the to main due to money as the primary factor as Konoe is more normal and Mana is honest with her snack desires. I think it is a pretty brutal show in that regard but at the same time at least the whole school didn't run forwards.I would give it a 4/10 which feels harsh but deserved, I wanted to give it higher but I just cannot. A final good point is Rinka as a catgirl in the episode preview at the end of each episode running in a circle is super cute.4/10. for example in episode 5 the associated issues would be resolved by using silent on the phone and thus the episode would be basically ruined but sorted.A big positive to look forward to in episode 6 with the Neko maid girls with ears and tails that react to emotion which was quite honestly SPECTACULAR.The artwork comes across far more gloomy than it should be considering the show is fairly old but also pretty modern.

Its not exactly emotionally gripping, like Oreimo was, but it is nearly as cute.The story is about a young man named Shougo Mikadono, who is the only son of the head of a huge and successful company. Unfortunately his father has passed away, but his dying wish was for Shougo to find a bride by the time he completes high school. So his mother arranges for him to attend Miryuin Acadamy in the hopes he would find a...suitable young lady that way. The problem is, Shougo is rumored to have a secret half-sister who is also reportedly attending the same school. He doesn\'t know what she looks like so he has to be very careful in his romances with any girl attending the school.I enjoyed the series. The plot was a bit tortured, but still interesting. The dialog and story line was decent and the characters were pretty cute. Definitely PG with occasional ""naked barbie doll"" fan service. I think it deserves 6/10 but I am going to push it to 7/10 just because it made me smile so many times... suitable young lady that way.

While this can be pretty amazing show to newbie anime watchers but this is not for experienced watchers.Lets get to the point, you have someone who is supposed to like you, but you have no reason to support it except with that she is lusting after your newly found wealth. The characters are introduced very quickly which do not result in poor character design and failing to deepen their characters. Even...though this is a comedy anime, you don\'t expect it so far in the game.Considering this to be a harem anime with bits and pieces of ecchi and mystery, the animation just doesn\'t add up to the feeling, its somewhat pale in comparison to the story. The soundtracks aren\'t very noteworthy either.The anime uses lots of cliched concepts, situations and fan-service which we have seen in countless anime before this one dampens the feel of the originality of the anime.In short for a siscon/brocon anime, it doesn\'t even stand up to its alternatives (like Eromanga-sensei or OreImo) though this is a comedy anime, you don\'t expect it so far in the game.Considering this to be a harem anime with bits and pieces of ecchi and mystery, the animation just doesn\'t add up to the feeling, its somewhat pale in comparison to the story.

Don\'t waste your time.  Some spoilers below.Story: High school student Shogou is being set up as the heir to his father\'s company, but is given the instructions that he must find a wife by the end of the year to inherit it.  Complicating this is the fact that he has a mysterious little sister who is attempting to be the woman he marries, so he tries to find out who the sister is before deciding on a wife because marrying his blood relative would create a scandal for the...company.  If this sounds like the setup for an unusually plot-heavy porn video, I can assure you that it\'s not written much better than one and has almost as many bare breasts.  Though I won\'t spoil who, you do eventually get an answer to the question of ""who is the sister?"", but no answer to the question of ""who does Shogou marry?"".  The 13th episode OVA strongly hints at a particular outcome to the latter question, but if you\'re looking for a scene where one character ""wins"", you won\'t find one here.Inconclusive romance aside, the real sin here is the mystery of the sister, which sounds like an interesting twist on an otherwise generic harem series on paper.  However, the mystery itself is so convoluted and poorly written that you should abandon any pretense of trying to solve the mystery yourself.  There are multiple fakeouts where characters pretend to be the sister that make no sense at all unless you view them purely as red herrings, because they really don\'t have any reason to be pretending to be the sister except to fool the audience at home.  It takes a bunch of pointless turns, new characters and evidence get introduced out of the blue as plot twists, rendering any attempt to figure out what\'s going to happen next an exercise in futility.  After a few episodes of this, I was just checked out completely on the mystery and did not care who the real sister ended up being.  If it was at least interesting, I could forgive some of the bad writing here, but it just ends up being confusing and boring.Audio/Visual: Below average in both respects.  The animation is stiff and generic, and the VA work is subpar for most of the characters.  It feels like barely anyone that made this thing was putting in any effort.  However, the girls are cute and they\'re topless pretty frequently, so if you\'re into that sort of thing, you\'ll probably enjoy that aspect of it at least.Characters: All the harem tropes you know and loathe are here.  Pervert MC that freaks out at a girl getting close to him but always manages to somehow fall on top of girls and grab their boobs in the process?  Check.  Tsundere that beats up the MC for seeing them in a compromising situation even though it was their fault?  There are 2 of them actually.  Girls having literal contests with each other for the MC\'s affections?  Almost every episode.  It\'s almost shocking how cookie-cutter the characters are.  Of the main girls vying for Shogou\'s affections, Konoe is your typical childhood friend, Kannagi is your typical tsundere loli, and Kutunagi is your typical ice queen ojou-sama.  There is nothing more to any of them than that.  The only sort-of exception is that Konoe initially shows a bit of a playful prankster side that\'s kind of refreshing, but even that is quickly squashed flat and barely mentioned after a few episodes.  Shogou himself is a total blank slate harem protagonist, although somehow even denser than usual and constantly causing problems by jumping to wrong conclusions in the sister mystery.  The only characters that are even mildly entertaining are the peripheral members of the harem, the food-obsessed student council president Tendou, and witch-cosplaying senpai Sagara.  Neither of them have any romantic chemistry with Shogou and seem to be almost reluctant harem members, showing only token interest in a relationship with him.  Thankfully that frees them from the cringeworthy antics of the 3 main competitors and gives them space to just be goofy weirdos that provide the sole moments of entertainment to be found anywhere in this godforsaken series. company.

PetoPeto-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/612/PetoPeto-san,"[""Petopeto-san... a short and quirky 13 episode series about the racial divide that's prevalent in a society with youkai (monsters) and ningen (humans). Think Kamichu! without the god, but with the same age of the characters dealing with everyday problems.Animation: The budget for this anime wasn't very high, and it shows. Some panning here and there, and low framerates of some of the scenes make me dock 2 points off. It's not BAD, per se, but the animation could've been done a lot better. Episode 10-11 suffered a lapse in character design consistency, as all their faces look distorted. Great backgrounds though, and the last...episode brought the animation up a notch.Sound: Brilliant opening/ending combo. When I first heard the opening, it sounded very hoary, but it gradually sticks on to you. The ending song is a peaceful ballad sung by the same singer as the opening, and fits the theme well. Sprinkled background music throughout, and a great use of enka (old style music) to convey a feeling of poverty for the Fujimura family. All in all, music added to the experience, and didn't distract from it.Story: A great start with a slice of life opening and a brief explanation of the world Shingo and Petoko lives in. The first episode might seem ecchi, but it's actually a very innocent show. The Little Sister Heaven ruined the story though, since it brought the anime off focus and into the bizarre. Satisfying ending that gives to open interpretation and goes back to the story's monster racism roots.Character: The characters made this show. From the monsters Petoko, Jeremy, Sekiya, Kugugu and Chochomaru, along with the humans Shingo, Yuri-sensei, Petoko's father, all of them were very memorable. YUG's character designs shine here, and they're all drawn very distinctively. Petoko is a ero-ero monster, and Kuguru and her sister are Kappas. Sekiya is an undead samurai, and Jeremy is a faceless monster. A bizarre cast, but one that meshes very well.Value/Enjoyment: Petopeto-san is a good short anime series which caters to the moe crowd. (Note the awesomely cute designs of the concrete sisters, Konuri and Nuci-chan). There's also a little romance sprinkled in, so fans of that genre will find what they like here. I also enjoyed this anime tremendously, having fansubbed its entirety. episode brought the animation up a notch.Sound: Brilliant opening/ending combo.

The Pichu Bros. have a problem and the other Pokemon help them out. It's nothing special and nothing amazing happens during it that changes the main goal for a bit.Art: The art is the same as the show with a few moments of CG. The CG is used sparingly and really only at one point of the short. Other than that, it's pretty good and can fully show the power of certain things, like Totodile's water gun.Sound: The music isn't really anything memorable like with other shorts I've...seen. The only song I can remember is the intro song, which is a country song with Pokemon lyrics. Everything else is just Pokemon noises.Character: The only real character to talk about is the narrator.

As for the others, they're cute and playful, just like the other shorts.Enjoyment: I didn't enjoy this one as much as other shorts, mostly due to nothing spectacular really happening and the music wasn't catchy or memorable.

Pokemon: Pikachu no Fuyuyasumi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4874/Pokemon__Pikachu_no_Fuyuyasumi,"[""This anime is terrible, I would give it a -10/10, but unfortunately MAL's scoring system does not go that low. A disgusting display of mindlessness, no real direction as it is just a bunch of Pokemon running around. Worst of all the 10 minute segments are completely squandered, there could have been real character development, when will Pikachu grow up and become a real man.Ok, Ok, I'm just kidding there, now for the real review. This is a Pokemon Christmas special that focuses on the Pokemon themselves rather than the Trainers. It is basically the Pokemon getting into all sorts of cute hi-jinks. There is...no deep story, and the animation and art is about as good as you'd expect from anything from the Pokemon franchise. I am not a fan of Pokemon at all but I enjoyed this quite a bit. It's cute and entertaining. It really isn't something that needs your full attention, which would make it ideal for putting on while you and your kids wrapped presents or decorated the Christmas tree. All and all a bit of inoffensive holiday fun that kids and Pokemon fans are sure to enjoy. no deep story, and the animation and art is about as good as you'd expect from anything from the Pokemon franchise.

Shows which start off as a romance/comedy/harem but tend to portray tasteless nudity and constant pop-ups of of unnecessary fan-service,2. The  shows describing a plot regarding TABOO relationships eg: bro x sis, pop x daughter, bro x bro, mom x son etc.Now, in  the recent years shows like KUZU NO HONAKI(2017),25-sai no...Joshikousei(2018) and DOMESTIC NO KANOJO(2019), garnered a lot of attention for displaying the psychological pressure on committing this TABOO, but mainly earned HATE from it, for no real reasonWith these points in mind, a show comes in Spring 2019, which is not afraid in displaying this topic, but not in a dark light, in a light which can be accepted by children, ranging from the age of 13Considering all of these, i will write a short review on each aspectPlot/Story/Story Setting - 7.23/10The plot is a simple unfolding of short stories wherein student and teacher get into eroge-situations, nothing more or nothing less, its set in a school for obvious reasons, and mainly centers around four students in a span of 12 eps, This is neither good or bad, but pretty average, this is the  only point where the anime loses pointsImplementation - 8.78/10One of the strong points of this anime, and the reason which makes this anime unique.

So why?... Why the hell are you here, sensei?!!""It\'s along those lines that you will start every episode of Nande Koko Ni Sensei ga?! seeing our main character Ichirou Satou meeting Kojima Kana the sexiest teacher you could think of, in several unexpected places. These introduction scenes are followed by absurd situations where the sole purpose of the author is to get Kojima denuded in the fastest way possible as well as getting physical contact with our MC.Well, it sounds like another...one of those thrashy, bad animated shows where there is absolutely 0 plot except two giant milk-balls bouncing around as if gravity wasn\'t a thing.BUT, it is here that Nande koko ni Sensei ga?! surprises you.The art is simply as stunning as the size of Kojima’s boobs. No seriously, for only its 3rd anime, Tear-Studio has done a really great job. Not one animation is off. It’s just a real pleasure to watch this in 1080p. It really differs from the others shows of its genre because of it, the first episode will give you a good glimpse of what I’m talking about. And it’s keeping its consistency every episode.Unlike others, the story of Nande Koko Ni Sensei ga?! is a fair one. Not as light as the majority of ecchi shows that are out there. It seems it can have some development since the characters are somewhat related by some events that occurred in their respective pasts.

Therefore, the anime is really enjoyable to watch, especially with friends, you would laugh your ass off seeing and reacting together at the WTF scenes which Japan has accustomed us to.

(be sure to have no one unfamiliar with anime behind you while doing so.) one of those thrashy, bad animated shows where there is absolutely 0 plot except two giant milk-balls bouncing around as if gravity wasn\'t a thing.BUT, it is here that Nande koko ni Sensei ga?! surprises you.The art is simply as stunning as the size of Kojima’s boobs. No seriously, for only its 3rd anime, Tear-Studio has done a really great job. Not one animation is off. It’s just a real pleasure to watch this in 1080p. It really differs from the others shows of its genre because of it, the first episode will give you a good glimpse of what I’m talking about. And it’s keeping its consistency every episode.Unlike others, the story of Nande Koko Ni Sensei ga?! is a fair one. Not as light as the majority of ecchi shows that are out there. It seems it can have some development since the characters are somewhat related by some events that occurred in their respective pasts.

The manga is nothing short of guilty pleasure that borderlines on hentai while containing immense amount of ecchi content and nudity. Somehow, it got announced for an anime adaptation because why the hell not.To put in the most straightforward way possible, this show is fan service fest dealing with rouchy, unbridled ecchi. The plot is hardly noticeable as you’ll be far too distracted into the fan service than anything else. The groans, sexy moans, and those colorful choreographed camera shots are what you’ll see all the way for each...episode. Beach episode? Check. Trashy drama in the infirmary? Check. Sexy Santa outfits? Check. In fact, you’ll be checking off a list of ecchi content on the bucket list by the time the show is over.But what’s wrong with a show like this? Don’t we have enough fan service nowadays that all over the place each season anyway? Well, that’s true but it’s more tempting to say this show is nothing short than a sex education in disguise. It seems the show follows a path to get us to understand something about adults; or perhaps more specifically, teachers. The first few episodes decorates this anime with fan service, suggestive camera shots, and even some “fluids”. Anyone healthy male can understand what that implies, right?Meet Kana Kojima, the high school teacher at Kawanua West. The episode immediately puts her into compromising positions whenever it gets the chance with her student, Ichiro Sato. It flirts with their relationship by throwing those two into erotic moments. In fact, every main protagonist somehow gets thrown into a compromising position in way or another. There’s no hidden motive or anything. It’s just what this show is. The other faulty members in the show – Hikari, Mayu, and Chizuru all falls in the line of being a walking billboard of fan service. Hikari has her fine toned body, Mayu is armed with a busty chest and boobs, and Chizuru has that “I don’t give a shit” attitude while undressing herself. But you know what they say….sex sells. These ladies fills the role of being sex education instructors.On the other side, there are the male characters who all get their sexy time with the adults. Characters are paired together to bring the most out of each other through skit-like storytelling. Each episode contains several scenes that collectively tells a short story. In fact, this anime is only half the length. Besides all that, I think it’s safe to say the male characters are the more innocent and pure types. Satou is the friendly kid who somehow always ends up in Kana’s chest or ass. Somehow, Mayu’s chest attracts Rin like a magnet. Takashi gets treated like a kid by Hikari without realizing their age difference. And, Chizuru…can we just put an anchor on her ass? Once you’ve realized who is paired up with who in the show, it becomes obvious why this anime exists. It’s to sell sex without the actual sex.Now with that said and done, it's up to you to judge whether you should watch this anime or not. However, I would say that anyone with a fully functional brain will realize how ridiculous this anime can be. It’s a guilty pleasure show carved from every male fantasies imaginable. Every episode aims to try getting the guys to reach orgasm. The amount of ecchi jumps out at you like pouring rice. I do admit that sometimes, I can feel a bit of guilty pleasure from watching this. But at the end of the day, it’s better to avoid this show and go get yourself laid for some real pleasure. episode. Beach episode? Check. Trashy drama in the infirmary? Check. Sexy Santa outfits?

No doubt about it, this is trash anime.So then, how come…I’m masturbating to it?Psshhh, I’m lying.  Not a single person is spanking their monkey to this censored pile of unfulfilled expectations.Why the hell are you here, Teacher!? features an ‘average’ high school student, Ichirou Satou, who happens to be the luckiest bastard alive because he always finds himself in scandalous situations with the school floozy (i.e. Kana Kojima).  Who, by the way, happens to be his sexy teacher.  The story is relatively straightforward.  Each episode begins with a monologue from Ichirou (regarding his skepticism in finding...Kana in a state of undress), and the awkward/comedic consequences of circumventing that situation.The situations, themselves, are absurd.  Mirroring the randomness and irrationality of a Japanese ENF (Embarrassed Naked Female) video.  Which is acceptable, if the intent is to have the viewer spritz their computer screen with high fructose porn syrup.  But when censorship runs amok, limp noodles are sure to ensue.  In terms of tickling the viewer’s ‘funny bone’ — which was the objective — it came off as uninspired, dull, and unambitious.The main characters, Kana and Ichirou, are beyond bland.  Kana has two emotions: embarrassed and pissed off.  And, on rare occasions, both at the same time (actually, it’s not that rare).  This may seem like a detriment — which it is — but it’s not as awful as Ichirou’s perpetual awkwardness and dearth personality.  Not only are the ‘random’ happenstances contrived, but the gags lack an element of unpredictability.  Any comedy worth its weight in salt, disorients the viewer into believing a certain outcome will occur, then pulling the rug at the last moment to deliver the punchline.

The anime that puts teacher and student in situations that defy all sense of logic and realism to convey an almost non existent story, but oh wait! There is boobies!Story 2/10Nande koko ni sensei ga is yet another fetish show this time on taboo relationships - Teacher X Student. Three dense main characters and a shota embark on their thrilling quest to confess love to their teachers. That\'s the entire plot so how can they make that interesting in 12...episodes? Boobies.It replaces development of the story with fanservice and unconstrained ecchi, does absolutely nothing special to differentiate itself from countless other shows almost identical in format. Panty shots, nip slips, waifu bait, females who moan whenever they are touched, an awful censored version and half assed emotional moments. It\'s a 12 year olds utopia! But sadly, I\'m not 12 so instead of beating my meat I watched this shit in awe pondering how a sane human could possibly choreograph such ridiculous scenes. I don\'t have the vocabulary to express how utterly absurd this show is. It\'s 12 episodes of situations that could never happen in real life, its not creative more desperate: they try find any possibility to fit an ecchi moment in the situations that they\'re originally in and come up with some of the dumbest scenes you\'ll ever witness. I would honestly call this closer to a comedy due to how stupid this show takes itself. Teacher jumps in the ocean, happens to have venomous sea snakes, he offers to suck out the venom, she happens to get bitten next to her genitals, so he follows through accordingly. Kid gets a happy meal and doesn\'t get the toy he wants, the teacher offers to trade toys with the kid, they trade the toy is thrown in the air lands inside her bra, the child then hugs her as a thank you, it starts vibrating on her nipple then the teachers potential counterpart bends down to put the umbrella over her and the handle goes on her genitals and she orgasms in front of two children and a teenage boy. enough? no, want more? Guy sits in the cold and gets light headed then straight up gives this teacher head because he\'s thirsty. No that seriously happens, isn\'t that a little too unrealistic? and by the end of the show you\'re desensitised so it just gets predictable and boring as this happens about 3 times an episode.Characters 2/10Meet Satou Ichirou, a braindead nerd that\'s too dense to understand that his teacher who kissed him actually l-l-likes him!?!? There is really nothing to talk in terms of Satou as a character because everything I just explained is his entire personality, but that\'s not it. The worst character is his mum, now I don\'t know about anyone else but my mum didn\'t desperately encourage me to have sex with older woman and make me give her grandchildren as a 17 year old boy. Well I guess they had to make it legal so they added a parent who encouraged it, but she didn\'t encourage it she borderline peer pressured her own son to have sex with someone. Instead of developing her character and giving an explanation as to why she\'s rushing her son into having sex so young, they leave us completely in the dark making it painfully obvious that she\'s just cash grab waifu bait in the off chance this anime became wildly popular. Kojima Kana otherwise known as ""Kojima the demon"" is a teacher known for her rash and cruel methods of teaching, this may have been an underlying metaphor for not judging someone off how everyone perceives them, oh who am I kidding this is nande koko ni sensei ga. The thing that frustrated me most was instead of having a natural voice change they have two completely juxtaposing voices: shouting furious, the voice of a damn loli. I understand they\'re appealing to horny 12 year olds but I doubt they need their hand held so much that you\'d begin to believe this teacher has multiple personality disorder. As you progress the story the characters get more tropey and easier to condense descriptions to a sentence or two. Big angry looking man, kind in the inside, Shota boy who\'s matured, shy virgin boy and a dense omega virgin. Small teacher with loli features, very shy. Free willed teacher who\'s immature and a tsundere who doesn\'t understand shame; strips in public. All with they\'re ridiculous nicknames e.g. ""Holy Mother Matsukaze"" and ""Absolute Zero Tachibana""Art 5/10Relatively average new-gen art style and animation, environments are on the most part quite nice and consistent. Nothing much to say here its nothing to hate this anime for but also nothing to really praise it for either.sound 5/10Music is extremely average on the whole besides one or two relatively good songs on the ost, but their placement of the songs are absolutely dreadful - Bra gets undone by accident, calming jazz music! Guy has to suck venom out of a girls genitals - sad piano music! I really didn\'t like the opening sequence and the ending song was quite good in my opinion.Enjoyment 4/10If you try desperately hard to ignore the boat load of flaws thrown into your face and take this show as stupid as it takes itself, then you can get a decent amount of enjoyment from it. The first few episodes were very enjoyable, you weren\'t desensitised from the absurd scenes so you could keep guessing and start laughing at the unreasonable moments, but as you progress the story you begin to be able to guess what\'s going to happen and if you guess wrong you\'re still not surprised with the outcome. Overall it accounted to a 4 as you\'ll speed through the first 6 episodes and then it will just gradually fall to slow pace despite the 10 minute episodes.Overall 3/10Definitely not the worst anime I\'ve ever watched but I have watched a higher amount of better animes then I have worse.

Primarily focusing on this guy hooking up with his teacher due to the fact they are always ending up in compromising situations with each other.Usually on its ecchi nature Teacher would be just fine, nothing spectacular, but it the kind of show that has a specific demographic in mind.  That said if you are a fan of this kind of show stay far far away from it. In its current state Teacher is severely neutered by censorship.  Teacher is pretty much unwatchable with...all the ""no no no"" type screens. Now generally for these kinds of shows, there is an uncensored version a couple of days after the initial episode release which good news there is one, but the bad news is that it\'s not so much uncensored as ""less censored.""  This odd censoring has lead many I have talked with about Teacher to speculate that the studio producing this is trying to get more money by holding the truly uncensored version to the Blu-ray release.Personally, I don\'t mind ecchi shows they generally are just mediocre, and typically the highest I will rate them at is a seven if I am generous. Teacher does not do anything out of the ordinary, and for that reason is only meh I would not recommend even starting this even if one is a fan of the genre and if for some reason you absolutely have to see this wait on the Bluray. all the ""no no no"" type screens.

The production values are very high, the look moe-ish, the comedy ok - and yes, it\'s sexy. The show doesn’t try to hide what\'s offered - comedic soft-hentai of high quality, take it or leave it.*** Story ***What story? This is a soft-hentai ecchi about four age-gap ""female teacher loves underage student"" relations. The four teachers represent classic male fantasy types. We have two Innocent Fanservice Girls (""Emotionless Girl"" and ""Childhood Friend""), one tsundere Waifu (""She\'s good to children and wants...a family!""), and a shy Moe-blob. You\'ll see their tits twice per episode, each of which is split into two 6-minute fantasies. Subtract 1 minute excuse plot per fantasy and 3 mins OP/ED and you get 7 minutes of ""plot"" per episode.The fetishes presented by far exceed the usual groping and pantyshots, we talk about for example golden showers, nurses, and bondage fantasies. Definitely beyond Prison School standard. A highly voyeuristic camera makes sure we don\'t miss any part of the four teacher\'s voluptuous bodies. There\'s hard censorship in the TV version, both with overlays and completely blanked screens. An uncensored OVA is announced to become available in time for the Christmas 2019 season. In one uncensored shot from the OP you can clearly see that the pantyshot type used is the one with the camel toe visible trough the fabric.One problem I had is the fact that I\'m pretty much watching reverse pedophilia, because all boys are underage. Abusing a teacher-student relation would lead to a tough sentence in the real world. One of the four boys is drawn overly young, basically a male loli equivalent. In an attempt at self-aware humor, in one of his episodes (#9) the school is haunted by his teacher in a bear (sic!) custome. But yea, it\'s just anime.Overall, story and presentation are way more explicit than vanilla ecchi, but also much softer than real hentai. It\'s definitely a guilty pleasure if you are into heterosexual voyeurism, big-boobed active girls, and arguably spicy excuse fantasy plot with a sprinkle of comedy. If that\'s what you want, you found a near perfect product. Just don\'t expect anything you didn\'t see before in porn. (2/10)*** Animation: ***Animation quality is very high for the genre, with interesting and varying backgrounds, smooth movement, and detailed expressive faces. The eyes are not plate sized, giving it all a relatively ""realistic"" feel. It isn\'t ufotable, but nevertheless two ticks above average. (7/10)*** Sound ***The show has a very catchy OP (with pretty explicit lyrics), make sure to also watch the live action MV which doubles the anime by presenting three very young boys watching a half-naked singer (Kana\'s voice actress) in lewd poses. Sound effects are pretty average, and the ED is ok-ish but not memorable. Overall very average. (5/10)*** Character ***This was already covered under ""Story"", because the stereotype females and their fetishes are all you get. No development, they are hopelessly in love from day one and stay in that mode. The males are all forgettable and do little more than to play the passive counterpart to the teacher\'s not-so-subtle seduction attempts, which all eventually succeed. (2/10)***  Enjoyment ***Hell yea, I enjoyed this. This is one of these shows you have to admire for production values and no-nonsense fap appeal, but you wouldn\'t watch with your girlfriend. Given the age-gap and dependency situation of the protagonist couples, some bad taste I\'m familiar with from Eromanga-sensei remains. I\'m not sure how this type of sexual fantasy works for women, I wouldn\'t exclude the possibility some are attracted by the age-gap setting.The show delivers exactly what\'s on the tin in high quality, and it makes no attempt to be anything but soft-hentai with comedic elements. That\'s an honest offer, take it or leave it. (4/10) a family!""), and a shy Moe-blob. You\'ll see their tits twice per episode, each of which is split into two 6-minute fantasies.

In one uncensored shot from the OP you can clearly see that the pantyshot type used is the one with the camel toe visible trough the fabric.One problem I had is the fact that I\'m pretty much watching reverse pedophilia, because all boys are underage. Abusing a teacher-student relation would lead to a tough sentence in the real world. One of the four boys is drawn overly young, basically a male loli equivalent. In an attempt at self-aware humor, in one of his episodes (#9) the school is haunted by his teacher in a bear (sic!) custome. But yea, it\'s just anime.Overall, story and presentation are way more explicit than vanilla ecchi, but also much softer than real hentai. It\'s definitely a guilty pleasure if you are into heterosexual voyeurism, big-boobed active girls, and arguably spicy excuse fantasy plot with a sprinkle of comedy. If that\'s what you want, you found a near perfect product. Just don\'t expect anything you didn\'t see before in porn. (2/10)*** Animation: ***Animation quality is very high for the genre, with interesting and varying backgrounds, smooth movement, and detailed expressive faces. The eyes are not plate sized, giving it all a relatively ""realistic"" feel. It isn\'t ufotable, but nevertheless two ticks above average. (7/10)*** Sound ***The show has a very catchy OP (with pretty explicit lyrics), make sure to also watch the live action MV which doubles the anime by presenting three very young boys watching a half-naked singer (Kana\'s voice actress) in lewd poses. Sound effects are pretty average, and the ED is ok-ish but not memorable. Overall very average. (5/10)*** Character ***This was already covered under ""Story"", because the stereotype females and their fetishes are all you get. No development, they are hopelessly in love from day one and stay in that mode. The males are all forgettable and do little more than to play the passive counterpart to the teacher\'s not-so-subtle seduction attempts, which all eventually succeed. (2/10)***  Enjoyment ***Hell yea, I enjoyed this. This is one of these shows you have to admire for production values and no-nonsense fap appeal, but you wouldn\'t watch with your girlfriend. Given the age-gap and dependency situation of the protagonist couples, some bad taste I\'m familiar with from Eromanga-sensei remains. I\'m not sure how this type of sexual fantasy works for women, I wouldn\'t exclude the possibility some are attracted by the age-gap setting.The show delivers exactly what\'s on the tin in high quality, and it makes no attempt to be anything but soft-hentai with comedic elements. That\'s an honest offer, take it or leave it. (4/10)', ""It s an anime for a perverted audience, nothing more. It s not even an hentai so what s the point. I m not a fan of pantie shots and ahegao faces however i think even that in this anime is wasted, it's not sexy, erotic, nor interesting. The art is not good at all, really bland and generic, without depth, and I don't understand who decided to make an erotic anime with such non erotic art and designs.There s a useless story, which is only used in order to make weird situations between the two main characters. I think it s suposed to...be funny since the characters are drawn with exagerated emotions, almost like chibis. However it s just weird (like who would laugh about someone putting some medicine in the butt of someone else? only six years old would find it funny but this is clearly not the audience expected for this show). The soft porn jokes are really out of place and messed up, the comedy always feels forced with the exaggerated expressions and voices.The music is inexistant. I mean they clearly had zero budget for this anime.Maybe if you put your brain away you could enjoy this anime? honestly i don t know.

Well it’s not good, but it’s more like an anime that you watch before going to hentai.StoryI think the story is what makes this anime trash. It actually doesn’t even have a well-written story it’s more softcore porn. It’s basically going somewhere and then saying ”why is my teahcer here?!!” and then they show you some ecchi scenes. The story which I still don’t understand is basically trash and I would give it a 3 out of 10ArtEven tho I wasn’t a...big fan of the story, But I am a big fan of the art! The art is really and surprisingly good I would Give the art a 9 out of 10.SoundWith a lot of anime’s there aren’t a lot of things that we can talk about. However I still do appreciate the OST’s and the ending and everything. So I will basically give it a 6 out of 10.CharactersNow when we talk about this show’s characters I just wanna say that the author did A great job making them. Kojima Kana, Tachibana Chizuru, Hazakura Hikari and Matsukaze Mayu. All of these HOT Characters Are written in a way that they are all similar YET you love them all. I don’t know if I can call this as a appreciation or as liking the characters, But I really liked them all. Since it’s a softcore porn, I don’t have Anything to say about the MC Satou, Ichirou. I mean we all know how the MC’s Are shown by hentai and ecchi series. So I will give the Characters a 9 out of 10.EnjoymentNot gonna lie I don’t know if I enjoyed it or not, because at one side it’s really basically stupid. But at the other side I find it Really Good with the art thing. So that is why I will look at it in two ways. One way which is a serious way. And the other way is as a horny little otaku brain way. Judging from the First way I might give it a 3 out of 10. And judging from the second way I might give it a 9 out of 10.OverallOverall not just as the ”horny little otaku brain”nor as the ”serious” way. I might give it a 6 out of 10 because I think that the story is missing something. The author focused on The harem genre more than anything.

It's a show about students falling for their teachers after getting into lewd situations with them, I mean it just sounds like something stupid to laugh at, and you would be right. But it ends...up being a bit more than just that, seeing each of the characters how they end up being with each other and how they bounce off their partners is just rather cute, and you still get to laugh at the insanely ridiculous lewdness they get into. It is not complex, or deep, or has much of a overarching story, but its fun, cute, a bit of heartfelt, and you get to see hot teachers in compromising situations.

Each girl is finely crafted like a set of Bavarian dolls not beheld to the typical tropes that plague the current anime landscape. The soft-spoken yet not at all shy Mayu-chan, the outgoing Hikari-chan with a tough exterior yet bashful true colors, the innocent and loving Kana-chan who knows how to keep it classy, and the misunderstood Chizuru-chan always working hard to better her ability to communicate. These girls are carefully crafted to avoid the pitfalls that a typical series might fall...into and provide a comically fresh atmosphere.To those that enjoy situational comedy as I do, this should be a perfect fit. To those who spent their childhood days fantasizing about their favorite big busted teachers, this is not a great fit. The craftsmanship of the girls is of course spot on, but the sensei element is only prevalent in the Valentine's day story close to the end of the series, one small moment of sensei, and that's all you get. If you were to take out the Sensei from the name and just make this about four separate high school girls, the plots wouldn't have changed much at all. None of the teachers, minus Chizuru-chan, actually cared about their occupation at all. It took me multiple episodes to even realize that Hikari onee-san was a P.E. teacher at all, and not just Takashi-san's childhood friend. The sensei element in this is completely missing, but of course, that doesn't matter much.The point of this anime is four romance stories, and each is actually very heart warming and touching in their own way. The build-up to confessions, the wholesome trust building, the atmospheric romance of the dates, and all the laughs along the way were all well above par. Is it realistic? No. But is it good? Yes, very good. Also, very original at that, most romantic comedies follow a set of strict guidelines, the flirting, the test of courage, the fight, the apology, the makeup, the confession, that's gone. Feelings come out as they should naturally, not out of some forced situation, and that's something great this has that much else doesn't. Nothing here is forced, it's a natural progression of events that flow from one another in a reasonable and original way. This provides situations that almost make you tear up how much you want something to be said and how it's actually done right then and there, instead of sat on and milked like a typical romance. As a romance, on its own if you were to remove the comedy aspect entirely, this show would still get an 8/10. The comedy is gold, but keeps the show rested on the score it could get without the comedy, because in the end, this show doesn't need to be funny to be good, it already is good.So, if you are looking for something wholesome to cozy up to in a blanket and watch while drinking coffee; if you want an original cast of very high quality girls, if you want to laugh and cry and feel accomplished after watching something good that isn't a waste of time, this is the right anime for you. Respect, admiration, love, it's here to warm the soul, just don't expect any Sensei.Also, reading my fellow reviewers, I am shocked and appalled that most could not look past the ecchi and actually read between the lines...

TBH, I jaz can\'t wrap my head around as to why do I even bother to watch this thing......I mean regardless as to how it goes, each pair does the same thing and it doesn\'t matter how each arc ends, It was all annoying and quite frankly studio  tear-studio should\'ve gamble on other sensible mangas...to be given an anime adaptation.....The thing about studio tear-studio was that it only has 3 anime\'s in its belt and none of them were on the top, as for the original creator, and yes this "" Soborou"" character, maybe he should just consider a new line of work, cu\'z this works of his was just nothing more than child porn , where the victims were guys and the perps were woman, much like the case of a teacher who has an illicit affair with his student in the US, where the teacher now faces jail time. Frankly, this ""Soborou"" guy made this kind of work to highlight his fantasy of banging an older woman or as we called them ""MILFS"". So storywise, there really wasn\'t anything for me to mention given that each plot were just the usual, like a tsundere teacher to a 17 year old,a deredere teacher that looks like a loli to a mature looking 16 year old, a bokuko teacher to a 16 year old chibi guy, and a kuudere teacher to a 17 year old megane guy. Art, well this is the interesting and the annoying part , IMAO, it\'s either you make a uncensored ecchi anime all the way or you don\'t do it at all, cu\'z those this anime has a less censored version, it was more like something that pulls a rug under you, since studio tear studio, make such this as half ass, that you might wanna puch the face of whoever pulls the rug under you, since such action has cause you to slipped and land on your ass, that it produces such pain.......Next, Character, ok let\'s go over each of them in their respective arc:Kana Kojima X Ichiro Sato: basically their arc was that of Tsundere Teacher to Graduating student, how they met was more like an oxymoron since how did a once shy and timid girl whom Kana was in her teens get to become a demon of a teacher that has command such respect and fear. For the guy, I kinda hate that he has to be Kana\'s bitch.Mayu Matsukaze X Rin Suzuki: what we see here was a typical lolicon romance were if Rin is an adult he would basically go to jail. Also, for Mayu to be this clumsy deredere loli was just child porn, and it doesn\'t matter if she has  the boobs, seeing her was just one way for original creator "" Soboru"" to express his sexual fantasy , in fact Rin could have been pattered after him.Hikari Hazakura X Takashi Takahashi: To me, I see Hika as a sexual predator and Taka as the victim, cu\'z basically their arc was something that would attract the attention of Child Protection Services.Chizuru Tachibana X Ko Tanaka: Chizuru maybe a kuudere, but then again she basically a retard, Ko on the other hand would pass as a caregiver whom would abuse her if nobody is looking.Ok, so how do I enjoy this????? On the ecchi side it was good until a rug gets pulled under you, but the thing is that everything about this anime was just way too predictable and quite frankly if one would just be after the uncensored ecchi then one would be better off going with the manga.So, how do I score this?????:Story- Poor 3: Each arc were just the usual as in any anime or manga that has an ecchi , comedy and romance thing.Art- Good 7: For the bikini services of Kana and Chizuru, underwear services of Kana\'s black underwear,  Mayu and Hika\'s white underwear, and Chizuru\'s all purple from the underwear to her bikini, but if you want the full uncensored nipples then just go to the manga.Character- Poor 3: Cu\'z them teacher here were just a bunch of deredere with a side of tsundere, deredere 2X, Bokuko and Kuudere, they guys were the usual of making themselves to not be a bunch of predator when they should be.Enjoyment- Pathetic 1: I might consider if this were hentai....maybe.Overall- Pathetic 1: Original creator, "" Soborou"" would have been better off being a sexual predator that making something like this and studio "" tear studio"" should consider about going into another line of business, since they\'re not doing good anyway.

You should get some laughs out of it, and if you wanted hentai, well you should have gone for something that's says it's hentai not PG-13"", ""Story: the story is divided in 4 arcs, but the main theme remains in all of them: a romantic relationship development between a female teacher and a male student, involving a lot of acidental erotic situations. And this anime excels in creating those sexual incidents. There wasn't even a single episode that I haven't applauded when seeing a completely new way of creating a sexual situation out of nothing. I thought that To Love-ru was the master in this matter, but I was wrong. Adding to this, the stories that lead to the romantic development of the couples are actually very cute and humorous. Watching...it really makes you happy. The pacing of the plot is good, not too rushed, given that the episodes are only 12 minutes long, the staff made a good job. Each arc is unique in its own terms, giving to the viewer different choices of taste. Most people will feel empathized with at least one situation, and cheer for their favorite couple.Art: The main focus of this series in terms of art is the female body. In this matter, this anime is great. The fluffiness of their bodies makes you believe that 2d girls are real. It makes you wish that every anime had cute teachers like these.Sound: The soundtrack is remarkable. When I remember a moment of the anime when a student is surprised by finding his teacher in a unusual situation, the soundtrack automatically starts playing in my mind. It is so well done and matches perfectly to the situations.Character: Each male protagonist has personality, not being too indecisive or naive. When the time arrives, they act as true males. As for the females, they all are perfect in their own way. The one I most liked is the teacher of the first arc, but I also liked the third one, even though i didn't like the 3rd arc itself, since I'm not a fan os shotacon. But in general they are all lovely and unique.Enjoyment: As I've said before, I applauded every episode, and laughed a lot. The comic situations constantly overcomes your expectations.Overall: This one of the best short ecchi animes ever produced. It is a must watch for any appreciator of ecchi anime. it really makes you happy.

Kana Kojima, Ichirou\'s generic love interest. Is one thicc gal, can have her tsundure bitch mode activated with a flick of a switch and with one drop of beer turns into your stereotypical snapchat thot, one bit of attention and their over you like a rash.2. Mayu Matsukaze, Rin\'s generic love interest. Your bog standard anime girl where when she says something ecchi ish about the male character and he semi catches...on, she flat out denies it *cliché*.3. ""The sports teacher thingy"" Hikari Hazakura, that 10 year old\'s generic love interest. Has a fetish for sticking that poor kids head into her boobs but you know, i\'m feeling jealous!And the 4th one who\'s called Chizuru Tachibana and she\'ll appear soon and can be possibly guaranteed to be the same as the others but idk yet.This anime i think is quite funny and i look forward to seeing the rest of it in the upcoming weeks bc the characters chemistry\'s are quite intriguing..Thanks for reading all you need to know about the 4 (currently 3) horny mid 20\'s teachers and who their generic love interest is. on, she flat out denies it *cliché*.3.

So let\'s get this review started in the usual step by step judgment.The art on this show is mediocre at best....Honestly, I\'ve seen a hentai series with better art and story direction than this one here. I\'m not trying to be prejudged but the story just does not hit me off as something good that I\'d want to wait every week to watch the next episode.The voice actors do a great job on every anime (ahem, blesser of axasdasdxxa) and I respect that a lot.. but sometimes its the opening that makes or break the shows. Here it does the latter and I don\'t even need to elaborate on that.The characters are pretty bland containing the cliche traits every \'romance\' character does. The author doesn\'t even put any effort to make them distinguishable. The 4 main \'heroines\' are in one word \'bland\'. Somewhat better is the 4 main male leads as I would need eight words to describe them as compared to one and those being, \'typical lead\', \'pitiful Yankee\', shotacon\'ed\',  \'typical-Kaichou\'.You may think after all this, after all the cluster fuck this show is at least it has some redeeming quality since it got an anime adaptation and all but oh boy how wrong would you be. The only reason this series got anime is due to the ecchi scenes and nothing else.A group of students who are acquaintances, fall in love with their teachers who also happen to know each other. But since its an anime I\'ll let this slide.I\'d have rated this series a bit higher but the \'romance\' tag on this forced me to make this review. With great series such as Kimi no Na Wa, something something pancreas tabetai, spirited away, RE:LIFE and a few novels you may have not read expanding on the shitstorm that love is, this series right here comes and throws that all out of the fucking window.Because it seems all what love is, is a bunch of erotic encounters with a person you barely know, get sexually attacked on a train, have them such your tits while you\'re sleeping, a weak and an un-understandable backstory that\'s weaker than my dick after I ejaculate 5 times in a row.Whew well, that took some time. and as I was saying, if you had time to read this review till the end, you have enough time to avoid this series. If you wanna get some sort of cancer or tumor you\'re free to try it but proceed with caution. This was not what I paid the monthly subscription on Crunchyroll to watch but I\'m happy that through my sacrifice many others may avoid this clusterfuck of a show.

there\'s really nothing else to say about this thing.\xa0 It\'s such a boring watch that when the only \'good\' parts of the show get censored, what\'s left to say?Characters:You got the \'normal\' guy and the \'demon teacher\', the intimidating teddy bear and the legal \'oppai loli\', the shota and pushy gym teacher, and the desperate one with his kuudere.\xa0 Their traits aren\'t all that interesting as characters, and really only serve as framework for the series to use as a means to get these people to get together through various means and personality clashes.There are however a few upsides to this cast that I will give it.\xa0 One, the characters do ultimately becomes couples, something that so many romance don\'t do that it\'s weirdly refreshing despite the method of getting there.\xa0 Two, the characters are all weirdly familiar with the stance that everyone is taking by dating their teacher (especially since they\'re all friends), and it\'s actually kind of amusing seeing the four male leads just sit in a room and talk about how cool they are with the whole situation.Aesthetics:There\'s not much to say about the artwork in all honesty.\xa0 tear-studio is a relatively small studio with very few things in its resume to begin with, so I wasn\'t expecting anything amazing for the art.\xa0 For the most part, the art is standard, but falters commonly due to a lack of consistency for the male cast.\xa0 The female cast fares better, but ultimately there\'s nothing really to note about the art.I\'m also genuinely confused why they even bothered to put this series up for TV broadcast.\xa0 Because of the source material, at least half of the show is covered up to the point that at several points, all you\'re seeing is a giant pastie saying ""No"" with barely sections of the corners giving you enough detail to make out what\'s happening.\xa0 As such, it\'s actually kinda hard to evaluate the visual style of the series because writing this, the censored version is all I have to work with.I\'m not really a fan of either of the tracks we\'re presented with, though I\'m pretty sure they\'re just there for the sake of giving the show a bit more oomph to it.\xa0 Sumire Uesaka\'s Bon ""♡Kyu♡Bon wa Kare no Mono♡"" is a song that exemplifies the \'cutely\' lewd nature the show exudes with each version of the OP having a silhouette of the current female to give the audience I guess a warning as to who we\'re talking about.\xa0 ""Ringo-iro Memories"" follows this trend by also having four versions, each sung by the VA of the female lead to I guess cap off the episode.\xa0 Not really a fan since it\'s a song without substance, but oh well I guess.Personal Enjoyment:Want some hentai that\'s not hentai?\xa0 Fuck, do I have the show for you.\xa0 I can say (unfortunately) with confidence that the show is on the ball with the source material, but that\'s about all the credit I can give this series.\xa0 It\'s such blatant fanservice for the sake of giving the men in the audience stiffies that I\'m not even surprised at this point why series\' like these get the adaptations they do.I\'m honestly just glad the show\'s finished because now I don\'t have to look at this series anymore.\xa0 I don\'t think I\'ve ever been this bored watching porn or anything remotely sexual, and that is saying something considering it usually entices some kind of emotion out of me whether that be surprise or anger.\xa0 You can probably take any episode from the series at random, and you\'ve basically seen the whole show.\xa0\xa0So really my recommendation is for even hentai reasons, skip it, at least until the blu-rays come out.\xa0 Just generally speaking, there are better hentai that are more entertaining than this show that exist.

The way they got the 4 ""couples"" together was kinda similar like there was an order to things that was predictable. The story was easy to follow along up to the point when Tanaka does his flashback to his school trip with Tachibana, I was kinda confused because I thought I missed an episode. I think if they had an episode revolving around that it would be more helpful the reason...why I thought that specific flashback didn\'t work is mainly because its done as if we knew about this ""school trip"" while the other flashbacks were the ordinary childhood or how they first met. The school trip one barely had context. Also something else that I\'m gonna correct myself on before that point we are shown that all the characters know each other somehow I get Satou and Suzuki connection to each other and borderline kinda know Suzuki and Taka though they are shown to have met it never really seems like they become good friends I don\'t get how they all are related so closely to each other and thats confusing there is no backstory on how they all became friends. when Suzuki and Mayu met Taka and Hikari it seems like there first time so they don\'t really show a history to begin with. Same with how Hikari is so friendly with Mayu but I think that might just be her personality. why I thought that specific flashback didn\'t work is mainly because its done as if we knew about this ""school trip"" while the other flashbacks were the ordinary childhood or how they first met.

The sexual scenes are graphic but they get covered by strategically placed censorship messages.Ecchi comedy is the main focus, but they also included a romance angle in an attempt to dignify the vulgarity....My opinion:It fails at everything it tries to be: Comedy, Romance, and Erotica. There isn't anything worthwhile from any angle.I'll admit I thought the first scenario in the restroom was funny. At first, it’s amusing how something so stupid and grotesque was made into a relatively mainstream anime. That is where I should have quit, because it gets old really fast, like by the fourth scenario, and there was still 20 more left to go.I thought that as the season progressed, and introduced each new teacher with a different personality, it would bring some freshness and variety to it, which is why I kept watching it, but the scenarios kept feeling the same with nothing special or different, even getting more and more non-creative and unimaginative.The romance is quickly hacked because the ecchi takes up most of the 6 minute scenario and it’s put together with often nonsensical dialogue. It takes the characters getting to third base, not once, but multiple times, for them to finally realize each other's feelings. Three of the students expressed negative views about their teacher's personality at some point.I wouldn't even recommend this as something to get off to, if that's what you wanted. At times, the censorship gets so big that you have no clue what exactly happened, but it's clearly all poorly-animated generic hentai anyway. There is no interesting build-up, or a good sense of anticipation to the erotic scenes, nor anything creative in the way that they happen.They did everything they could to kill off the taboo of dating a teacher. They made the teachers immature (one of them even acts like a loli). The students look older and more mature than the teachers, not to mention that they're just weeks away from graduation. The mom encourages her son to have sex with the teacher. They made them childhood friends, which makes that relationship supersede their student-teacher relationship. So why did they make a show that taps into the dating a teacher fetish and then backpedal from it as much as they can? I don’t get it. They're trying to say that, on paper, they are technically teacher and student, but in fairness, they practically aren't. Then what the hell is the point!?In conclusion:It's not funny. It's not romantic. It's not erotic. Gets old and repetitive. Lacks more imagination and thought put into it. It’s really not worthwhile.

What, you don't believe me? I don't know why you wouldn't considering that this show definitely doesn't have scenes where a student gets into a ridiculously compromising situation with his young, hot teachers. No, there is definitely nothing like that in this show.You won't be finding scenes where a student takes his teacher on a piggy back ride that causes her clothes to slowly fall off and for her naked body to end up being pressed against his bag, no, not in this...show.You won't be watching scenes where a small hermit crab latches itself onto a teachers nipple, prompting her to get her student (that she is vacationing with) to grab it but he gets the wrong nipple and gropes her instead.There isn't a scene where a student and a teacher get stuck in a cave together and the student gets sick, causing him to go a little weird which makes him suck on his teacher's teet and eat her out for no real reason. If there was a scene like this than I wouldn't feel comfortable showing this show to my teachers at school so luckily there isn't anything like that in this show.This show also absouletly does not have a scene where a teacher is scaring students in a bear costume, is caught by her student who somehow ends up inside the bear costume with her, face first into her under-area which happens to be bare since she decided not to wear panties that day. That would be shameful and disgusting and has no place in a show like this.There definitely also isn't a scene where a teacher wants to give a student a chocolate but the chocolate falls and splats onto her breasts causing the student to say: 'Surprise Chocolate Fondue!' and then having him fall onto her breasts and eat the chocolate off of her teet. That would be weird and perverted and thankfully this show is free from anything like that.Overall, this is a very wholesome romance anime that has some of the cutest and least perverted scenes I've scene in anything recently. If this show was raunchy and perverted then surely the teachers would get fired for sexually harassing their students and constantly putting themselves in sexy and compromising situations. But it's not so I don't have to worry about logistic problems like that. Even if it was I wouldn't complain. To conclude, this is a very sweet romance anime that is perfect to show your parents, younger siblings and especially teachers. Hell, I showed this show to my cousin who was in love with one of his teachers which inspired him to act on his urges which ended with him in a juvenile detention center and the teacher serving five years in prison.Hmmm, you know what, this show might actually be extremely perverted and raunchy. Well, honest mistake. show.You won't be watching scenes where a small hermit crab latches itself onto a teachers nipple, prompting her to get her student (that she is vacationing with) to grab it but he gets the wrong nipple and gropes her instead.There isn't a scene where a student and a teacher get stuck in a cave together and the student gets sick, causing him to go a little weird which makes him suck on his teacher's teet and eat her out for no real reason.

Hell, I showed this show to my cousin who was in love with one of his teachers which inspired him to act on his urges which ended with him in a juvenile detention center and the teacher serving five years in prison.Hmmm, you know what, this show might actually be extremely perverted and raunchy.

Each episode of twelve minutes is separated into two parts, each of them containing its own closed series of event to showcase the teachers' naked body.This is going to be a short review, as there isn't much to evaluate.PLOT:There is actually no plot followed here - there is only a concept that a teacher is attracted by a student and that she frequently gets semi or fully naked in front of him by pure chance. Whenever there is an interaction with their bodies by a student,...it is also by chance. All this is done in a joking fashion: she never really intends to get naked, though she is always quite alright with the situation. Every three episodes, the two current main characters change, so we can't get attached to any of them. All guys are friends from the same school, and they all have affection towards a different one of their hot, young, gifted teachers.As you can imagine, the series features little to no character background, motivation or development. It hints at some background sometimes, though I can't recall more than two of the eight characters' ones. There is no room for that in a series as short as this one, with a focus on jokes and on exposing the female body. After finishing episode 12, I can't even remember the names of any of the eight characters, which says something about this anime.However, all is not lost. The art style is quite good, there is a good usage of bright colors and shadows, and, in general, characters are pretty. The one grip I have with this is that, for all teachers, their breasts are bigger than their own head, which is probably the norm for this type of anime. Regarding the sound direction, I really did not pay attention to it, which is to say I did not love it nor did I hate it. Characters voiceovers were fine, as well as... their... moans and groans.At first, the jokes were surprisingly funny, though they grew old quickly. By the time the third set of characters entered the scene, I was mostly unsurprised, and neither did I laugh at the absurd events as I previously did. Each episode followed the same pattern: Student does something somewhere and his teacher is there as well, which surprises him; they talk a bit and he wonders about the whole situation; she showcases her amazing body to him due to an absurd event; they both leave that place, wondering what had just happened. Rinse and repeat this for the second part of the episode, and all of this for all episodes.CONCLUSION:What will I remember the most about this anime? The female body nakedly showcased due to absurd circumstances - and that is despite having watched the censored version. Some of the jokes were cool and did made me laugh out loud, though most of them were underwhelming. This s not an anime for everyone - it definitely wasn't for me.

It was portrayed in a comedic way and is not child friendly due to the jokes and the scenes. The main characters were Kana, Chizuru, Hikari, Mayu, Ichirou, Rin, Takahashi, and Tanaka. The story revolves around the teacher with their respective students in awkward, but ""wholesome"" situations.The plot overall was predictable, but unique. The students were forced into weird ""sexual"" situations that helped increase their love for the respective teacher and vice versa. When it came to episode 2, I realized that the...plot was going to repeat over and over again which made it a bit boring. The anime felt very forced due to the unrealistic physics that brought them into ""sexual"" situations. Despite all of that, there are separate and unique endings for each student and their respective partners making the story balanced.The dialogue was funny and interesting. The voice actors did a really good job in portraying most of the scenes. There were funny moments and wholesome moments and I would say that the voice actors did a really good job. The voice acting enhanced the dialogue because each scene felt that they were really confused and really lovable. The character\'s design fit their personalities and there was character development the more episodes passed by. Overall, I can say that the plot was enhanced by the creative elements, not held back.In my opinion, the plot was fair. Not the best, but not bad either. It\'s better than most NTR anime\'s and they portrayed it well. I didn\'t get bored at any scenes whatsoever. The wholesomeness was godly. The balance of the wholesome scenes and the holesome scenes made it easy to watch and made the plot really clear. It is a good watch in my opinion, just not in NNN.In conclusion, the anime is a good watch. A 7/10 overall.

(2019)STORY:A set of individual but over lapping stories about the struggle of high school teachers who have fallen in love with students, and how those coming of age have to deal with the mix of emotions as they come to bear this forbidden fruit.The first about a teacher whom is a family friend of the main character initially seen to which they grow closer with the Ecchi encounters that we know and love. The teacher known as almost a demon to students shows her true side.The next is the best friend of the previous guy who has been...seemingly ditched in a move by the previous guy who now has a girlfriend (his teacher). Bit of a bad move on a guy perspective but works out when the shy teacher whom struggles to get across her points in hilarious ways again pursues him. Ultimately, it works out.The third is an outgoing teacher who has been somewhat a big sister to the male to which she harbours true love towards. It grows in a different way this time with almost a growing up style of a relationship that blossoms.The final a teacher who shows little emotion and is thusly named by her students as such ends up with her student. This one having more of the moral high ground over the others in not wanting to directly engage in her passion until the guy has graduated and is no longer a student. (although not always what happens)Finally, a group trip planned (I assume the OVA due in December 2019) and the paths cross as they have all graduated and have intermingled to move forward to the exciting lives ahead.ART:The art obviously is broadcast firstly with heavy censorship and a few days later with less. Ultimately a non-censored version is due later on in the year after its completion before the OVA release which should refresh the previous viewers. The art style used is enjoyable and fitting with its genre. Attention is paid to the necessary details and is enjoyable to watch.SOUND:The sounds have a good comedic effect to the story and helps to enhance it. The OP and ED both are fitting for the show and are nicely performed.CHARACTER:Character development is quick due to the 12-minute episodes and not long for each couple in the grand scheme. It is however a very enjoyable development as you get enough back story to each person to fulfil the story. You don’t get a load of unneeded background characters involved either.ENJOYMENT:The show is very fun to watch and is definitely a re-watchable experience. You can definitely watch it and come back to the uncensored version later on. The plot line is funny and rude at the same time as it is supposed to be.OVERALL:Overall, we have a funny, enjoyable show that is definitely worth a watch that could bring further enjoyment. The OVA is definitely something to look forward too. A second season could even suit the programme as to give more funny encounters. The episode length is not an issue with this and is suitable to the show.--------------*This review has been done to give as little away as possible by not referring to characters actual names to avoid spoiling the series.*Other anime mentioned in the review is because they are worth watching and make great examples. seemingly ditched in a move by the previous guy who now has a girlfriend (his teacher).

(although not always what happens)Finally, a group trip planned (I assume the OVA due in December 2019) and the paths cross as they have all graduated and have intermingled to move forward to the exciting lives ahead.ART:The art obviously is broadcast firstly with heavy censorship and a few days later with less. Ultimately a non-censored version is due later on in the year after its completion before the OVA release which should refresh the previous viewers. The art style used is enjoyable and fitting with its genre. Attention is paid to the necessary details and is enjoyable to watch.SOUND:The sounds have a good comedic effect to the story and helps to enhance it. The OP and ED both are fitting for the show and are nicely performed.CHARACTER:Character development is quick due to the 12-minute episodes and not long for each couple in the grand scheme. It is however a very enjoyable development as you get enough back story to each person to fulfil the story. You don’t get a load of unneeded background characters involved either.ENJOYMENT:The show is very fun to watch and is definitely a re-watchable experience. You can definitely watch it and come back to the uncensored version later on. The plot line is funny and rude at the same time as it is supposed to be.OVERALL:Overall, we have a funny, enjoyable show that is definitely worth a watch that could bring further enjoyment. The OVA is definitely something to look forward too. A second season could even suit the programme as to give more funny encounters. The episode length is not an issue with this and is suitable to the show.--------------*This review has been done to give as little away as possible by not referring to characters actual names to avoid spoiling the series.*Other anime mentioned in the review is because they are worth watching and make great examples.', 'SPOILER FREE. Not that it matters.You jerked off to this. A full-screen censored anime about a boy groping his teacher. I don\'t normally watch ecchi, but was in the mood to watch seasonal anime and figured ""ah screw it, no one\'s home anyways."" Big mistake. The art is good, save for some weird facial expressions and character designs (namely the mother of Satou. Oh my GOD she\'s ugly.) Sure, the love between the two was ""cute"" towards the end, if you\'re even generous enough to give it THAT, but need I remind you that the ""love"" they feel is from accidentally ending up in scandalous...situations out of nowhere? Not to mention I had NO clue who the hell these people were until, well, their episodes were done. By the time I even felt REMOTELY invested, a new teacher and student were groping it up together somewhere else entirely. I don\'t know if the first couple will reappear at any point in time, because I haven\'t read the source material (and will not be doing so at any point in time, ever.) No, I don\'t care about some ugly dude and a teacher that sounds like a 12 year old. No, I don\'t want to know why these adult women are trying to bang high school boys. No, I did not want to watch a teacher take her medicine. No, I can\'t recommend Nande Koko ni Sensei ga!?

Unfortunately it is far to heavily censored at the time of writing this review. I'd rate it higher but the censor is just far to much. Considering the fact that they censored normal nipples I have to give it such a low rating.If it weren't for the censoring i would have made this much higher and maybe this anime actually couldve become a guilty pleasure for me. But the ecchi isnt the only thing this anime has. It has some comedy in it too. Most of it...though is just something over exagerratedly wacky. Like one scene where the main character accidentally lick the girls vagina by accident and when his little sister accidentaly undoes the teachers swimsuit then starts sucking on her nipple.So in conclusion if this were to be uncensored it wouldnt be this low. I'd probably give it about a 7 around there. though is just something over exagerratedly wacky.

It seemed like you're typical harem ecchi-heavy show until you realize how massive of a following it had.“Nande Koko ni Sensei ga?” is relatively short series that politely asked you to leave every shred of logic you'd expect and just enjoy the ride for what it is.

They might say love is a battlefield or some cliché crap, but this show makes you question your life choices and making you start wondering, “Did I go to the wrong school?”.- Art (7/10):As average as the topic it tackles, it was nothing special, very generic but just about enough to keep you watching. You better not expect any high budget over 60 fps fluid eye candy, that is, if your definition of eye-candy is something entirely different which I totally agree with, then you'll probably end up disappointed, however, to the meaty kind of eye candy I was alluding to, you bet you're going get your fill. Beautifully illustrated erotic shots make up at least 60% of the episode, which is always the selling point for this kind of shows, a welcomed feat by the way.- Sound (7.3/10):As long as my eyes enjoyed the view, my ears didn't really get anything of nearly similar quality. Very basic voice acting at best, but when you come to playing roles that involve in dialogue with more moans than words, then you've got a great excuse.On the other hand, the opening and ending songs were just amazing, I'm expecting those to appear on the next popular Anime song quiz on Youtube.- Character (6/10):I'm going to have to be fair in here, that's not the greatest cast of characters I've seen, and not nearly the worst either.All pairings were very unique with respect to each other. But not nearly enough depth to them to make them that memorable, I haven't been able to memorize any names from the show, ending up forgetting about them just after I read them on every subtitle.

Starting off every episode with repeating the same words that make the title of the series “Nande Koko ni Sensei ga?” made for hilarious moments, even though they always seemed heavily predictable. The ships were all great except for the dangerously pedophilic one (The athletic teacher and the petite boy).- Overall (6.68/10):I'm quite surprised with how low it scores on paper, I was preparing to drop a rating around 7 and 7.5, however, I can't recommend it highly enough if you're in for some short ecchi comedy heavy show that really pushes it as far as it can and not nitpick about every detail. meet at a school.

It promotes wholesome family values and shows how much that same boy cares for his mother and infant little sister.  As we tag along with the adorable further adventures of this boy and girl, we can see how this girl learned to open up to people despite being incredibly shy in her youth.  Labeled by a ""demon"" by her students for her strict tutelage, in time we are able to observe that this girl has a super-cute side...as well, with the same kind of hopes we might expect any girl to have, like getting married, becoming a mother, and finding love.The upskirts, boob-shots, pantsu shots, accidental groping, unintentional kissing, unplanned stripping, incidental statutory molesting of student by his teacher, and strictly-for-survival purposes oral sex are purely all coincidental.  One wonders how so much coincidental hentai, er, I mean touching displays of affection can be crammed into a 12 minute episode, and the producers of this anime do their best to find out just that.If you want to enjoy this show, you must absolutely give up on things like thinking clearly or having concern for ethics and human decency.  I want to say something like, ""this could never happen in real life,"" but the newspaper headlines prove me wrong.  Apparently, older teachers do indeed have improper affairs with their students while they are just students and minors.  So your enjoyment is going to really hinge upon your ability to see why this student and teacher might be a good couple in the future despite their completely inappropriate relationship in the meanwhile.The art starts off merely ok, but seems to improve later in the series.  The opening theme is provocative but if you can, try to find the music video for it (Bon Ku Bon) on YouTube.  It\'s not even accurate to call it ""over the top"".

It is amazing how each of the men (and teachers) all appeal to certain fantasies that go on in my head. Not just that, but the proportions of each teacher was beautifully drawn.

I would rather read hentai than watch hentai, but this show has inspired me to look for more voice actors who moan as good as these 4.Characters:Sadly, for this segment, I can not give much input. Throughout my viewing experience, my brain was turned off as I always appreciated what was in front of me. If you are into complex, in-depth character studies, this show is sadly not for you. However, if you like men (and women) who look bad as hell, then this show is a worthwhile binging experience. Bring your family as well, my family and I watched this show together and we can all agree that we are sexually attracted to at least 3 members from the entire cast BARE MINIMUM.Enjoyment:Enjoyment would have gotten a 10 for me, but my issue with the episodes is that they were too short. I relate to this problem, but I won't lie to you, the fact that I could not finish what I started for every episode made me feel like a total jackass. Luckily, however, I was able to solve this problem by watching eps 4 to 6 in one go. With that, I was able to use my pent up urges from the previous episodes and take them into the next one. Still remaining honest, busting the nut excited me because it finally gave me the final push I needed to make this review. Now, I do not feel horny and I feel like (or felt like) all my emotions and sentiments towards the show have been written down in this review. damn, that feels good.OVERALL:After busting a nut, I then asked myself. What the fuck did I just do. What did I just watch? Was all this really worth my time? I have multiple things I have to reflect upon, from watching, to writing. I did learn a lesson though. I need Jesus. After finally realizing I wasted so much time and effort watching this show, there were so many things I could have done that bettered myself. Shows like this should not stop you from thinking clearly and logically, so I advise you, with an unclouded mind, to not do this. Watching this makes you nothing short of a degen, and if you enjoyed this, try watching this after ejaculating. It will surely show you the disgusting true colors of the show, and with that, it gets one. Yes, I purposely put it in word form to not stand out. Did you enjoy this review?

However, if you like men (and women) who look bad as hell, then this show is a worthwhile binging experience. Bring your family as well, my family and I watched this show together and we can all agree that we are sexually attracted to at least 3 members from the entire cast BARE MINIMUM.Enjoyment:Enjoyment would have gotten a 10 for me, but my issue with the episodes is that they were too short. I relate to this problem, but I won't lie to you, the fact that I could not finish what I started for every episode made me feel like a total jackass. Luckily, however, I was able to solve this problem by watching eps 4 to 6 in one go. With that, I was able to use my pent up urges from the previous episodes and take them into the next one. Still remaining honest, busting the nut excited me because it finally gave me the final push I needed to make this review. Now, I do not feel horny and I feel like (or felt like) all my emotions and sentiments towards the show have been written down in this review. damn, that feels good.OVERALL:After busting a nut, I then asked myself. What the fuck did I just do. What did I just watch? Was all this really worth my time? I have multiple things I have to reflect upon, from watching, to writing. I did learn a lesson though. I need Jesus. After finally realizing I wasted so much time and effort watching this show, there were so many things I could have done that bettered myself. Shows like this should not stop you from thinking clearly and logically, so I advise you, with an unclouded mind, to not do this. Watching this makes you nothing short of a degen, and if you enjoyed this, try watching this after ejaculating. It will surely show you the disgusting true colors of the show, and with that, it gets one. Yes, I purposely put it in word form to not stand out. Did you enjoy this review? I did at first, but as I said a while ago. The mind of a male pre and post ejaculation work in completely different ways, and that my friend, is one of the phenomena of life."", 'How to say it... its good anime for relax from some other anime, if you watch a lot of action anime, fight or something creepy this short anime is ideal BUT! At best its average, there is no story, almost no nothing, only big tits jumping aroud. Its predictible and characters are generic, maybe too much. One of the two things i like in this anime is animation, i like these kind of animations, smooth, colorfull and basic. But i must admit, its kinda funny, i have grat time watching it, but only as ""filler"" anime. Just as i said if you want to watch...something short to relax, go for it. something short to relax, go for it.', ""This is a cute and quaint anthology of episodes. I appreciated all the characters and had fun watching the series all the way through, especially the uncensored moments of course. It's maybe not super original but I never got bored. Definitely worth the price of admission if you haven't seen it.I really appreciated the first teacher's and the nurse's story arcs, although every arc was funny and endearing. It was even more interesting having them all be friends, or at least familiar with each other. It definitely made for a unique OVA and ending to the series.Most people would only watch this show...for the cultured elements, however, it stands on it's own as a genuinely good series. It had moments of mild suspense, romance, and comedy, thus making it, in my opinion, a well rounded series and not just a one trick pony. for the cultured elements, however, it stands on it's own as a genuinely good series.

Basically theres a group of students who go to this school where apparently only really hot teachers who really love there students work lol.  About every 3 episodes your introduced to a new teacher and student love interest, they all know each other tho so the stories eventually meet up.  I actually saw the censored version first so saying I only loved it for the boobs and hentai like moments would be false, not that I don't love that.  Let me...tell the the uncensored version definitely has those to so make sure you know which one your watchinig.  The situations that they find themselves in with the teacher are absolutely so unbelievable but oh my does it work perfectly and its quite hilarious.  If your into ecchi, comedy, and romance animes theres no reason you won't love this one.  Intro his very catchy and the lyrics are hilarious, the song has been trapped in my head for awhile now!!! tell the the uncensored version definitely has those to so make sure you know which one your watchinig.

Intro his very catchy and the lyrics are hilarious, the song has been trapped in my head for awhile now!!!"", 'You may think ""hmm, an Ecchi show, it should be trash!"" And yes, it is trash... but in a good way.Let me elaborate, Think of Komi Can\'t Communicate for example, you see the romance in it, but all characters are very shy and won\'t express their feelings, or for another example White Album 2 where someone will always get the short end of the stick in the relationship, and it will hurt MC.In ""Nande Koko ni Sensei ga"" on the other hand all the relationships shown have a distinct path that leads to a relationship with a wholesome ending, and doesn\'t beat around the bush...for any of of the relationships, and end without a need for any real need to continue past the 12 episode run.As I said it was trashy in a good way, it knows what it is and wants to be, it\'s a romance with ecchi themes, you know there will be some nudity. IT HAS A STORY, and it is there primarily told through revealing moments and compromising situations, but between all this there is a distinct path of love for all the characters.(Past here is the reasons why this show gets poor reviews)First off, THIS IS A DIRTY PLEASURE, because it\'s an Ecchi series that shows nudity.Those who actually rate it as an anime series have less brain cells than a gerbil since you know what it is as by the genre (Ecchi), so why hate on it when it is marked down that it has nudity and ecchi content, and then be upset that it has fan service??I actually enjoyed it as something that didn\'t take me actual time to think of ""why do the characters do this or why won\'t they confess???"" as a most romance anime\'s would be like, what I\'m trying to point out is that the characters are very direct and expressive of their views and thoughts involving one another (No Clannad Visual Novel mind-play between characters and their love towards MC that make you question their sanity).The main reason people hate this show is that people think teachers and students should not have relationships, but the thing about this show is that it doesn\'t really focus on the school aspect for much of the encounters and more on the way they all became attracted to one another, although I do agree the topic is weird without realizing a few other aspects to the story.These teachers are like right out of college and are around the age of 20-24, that\'s a max age gap of 6 years because the students are 18 years old, and I know plenty of people dating/married to people that are 2-6 years older or younger, so I wouldn\'t consider this age gap to actually matter that much for any typical romance, the only thing exemplifying this issue is that it is teacher-student, any other setting and no one would care.Obviously this is just my take, but this show lower than a 7 is kind a bit extreme, it\'s not even bad in any story sense or plot wise. This show doesn\'t deserve to be around the rating of School Days and other mediocre romances at a 6.5×, the romance in it is at least a 7, and it is enjoyable for what it is.If you like my review, please don\'t be afraid to give it a helpful rating! for any of of the relationships, and end without a need for any real need to continue past the 12 episode run.As I said it was trashy in a good way, it knows what it is and wants to be, it\'s a romance with ecchi themes, you know there will be some nudity.

Even as an ecchi fan myself, I didn’t have high expectations of this one. And yet… Nande Koko ni Sensei ga turned out to be a positive surprise.Let’s start with the core of this show, ecchi. It was on more hardcore side - borderline-H some might even say. Ecchi scenes were quite good, and while they relied on boobs a bit too much, it didn’t feel like cheap ecchi you usually find in shounens. Camera angles, character positions and their facial emotions worked very well....Simply put, it was erotic. Major downside here is that, author went for diverse cast of female characters, but forgot to give them diverse bodies. Really, in this kind of anime you’d expect at least one girl with not-huge (forget small!) breasts. Ecchi scenes also had some repetitive elements - nipple stimulation being the biggest offender.With all of the above, Nande Koko ni Sensei ga would be in upper part of average ecchi anime. What puts it above average are “story” and characters. I don’t think I need to explain why I put quote marks around story - this anime doesn’t have much of it, but general progress of relationships and event sequences, while often ridiculous, were actually nice and satisfying to watch. More or less the same can be said about characters: they don’t have some deep, layered personalities. But they are cute, fun and play their roles well. I can’t really expect more here. Biggest flaw was short duration and resulting very quick progression.Final thing that made me enjoy this anime more than I expected was comedy. However banal that might sound, comedy has to be fun. I know it’s more personal thing, and jokes I liked might fall flat for someone else. Nonetheless I rate comedy in this anime to be above average.Now, when talking about anime focused on showing us women in various states of undress, this anime obviously needs good art. Nande Koko ni Sensei ga art was… ok? It’s nothing special but I also can’t complain about anything in particular. Personally I really liked character designs and I feel like facial emotions added a lot, both in comedic moments and in ecchi scenes.Overall very enjoyable anime, both as a light comedy and as heavy ecchi, depending on your mood. I\'d recomment it to anyone who isn\'t ""intellectual"" with a stick in that one place, and doesn\'t get offended by ecchi. Simply put, it was erotic.

At first I thought it was going to be some decent Comedy anime but man was I wrong!The story revolves around multiple student-teacher relationships(to be precise 4). With relationship I mean romantic ones. A 12 min ep with tow parts. The characters somehow end up together at a spot and then things happen (basically NUDITY). Through these incidents the characters realize their own feeling towards each other.Now as for the review...*I'll try to keep it as spoiler free as I can*Basically each episode is a Replica of the last one. The couple ends up together at...a spot and then some Mishap occurs which leads to Nudity. Which makes the show hard to watch if you don't like a lot of nudity, 'cause I think this basically is a Hentai, With no sexual intercourse(I mean yea...). The only thing decent is the enjoyment and the comedy 'cause, I myself am not a big fan of Ecchi shows but still, I didn't hate the anime in itself. The romance was dealt in a more peculiar way compared to other romance. They don't focus on the fact that the relationship takes place between Teachers and Students. But again if they did, it would not be as fun as it is. One of the biggest problem is the basic repetetion of the episodes. As for the comedy its's pretty good.So yeah if you like your nudity you can watch this show but if you would rather happen to be that you don't like this stuff don't watch it.... Anyways if you do watch it..*Watch It Uncensored* ;-) a spot and then some Mishap occurs which leads to Nudity.

It’s an anime about school teachers getting it on with their students, I can only assume you found this anime because you were looking for something trashy to watch. While I won’t call it entirely trashy, it’s what I would call peak ecchi. It serves its purpose of being horny, and does it in a satisfying way.Comedy: truthfully it has like a single...joke, it is something I tend to look forward to tho. I stopped laughing after like the fourth time seeing it, but it’s not really something to complain about. This show is categorized as “romcom” but yea, don’t expect to be hollering every episode.The girls (teacher): for those offput by the concept of teachers getting with their students, you are valid. The show does actually go out of its way to show that it’s not really in uhh the pdf file kind of way. At least not creepily. The show takes place around when the students graduate. Having said that tho one of the teachers was pining for a certain student for three years. Take that how you will.Having said all that tho, again, it’s not a creepy show, it doesn’t have characters going out of their way to say things like “oh yea I like em young” unlike a certain character from that one Gal girlfriend anime.The guys (students). Surprisingly good. The work well enough to be a self insert but they really do fit their counterpart. Nun else much to say about them except (fuck I wanna be them so bad why couldn’t I be them lord why have you forsaken me etc.)Romance. It’s 80% ecchi and 20% romance. It’s a nice romance tho, we get enough time for each character. Nothing drags really, if anything I want to see even more. I wasn’t exactly looking for it but there is actual nuance to the romances for some reason? Like it actually makes sense why one character likes the other. It isn’t just lewd hijinks, it’s lewd hijinks with tasty romance. Still mostly lewd hijinks tho.The Ecchi: The sweet juicy Ecchi, oh my god, I was NOT joking when I said it had every trope. It had the “raining outside so I have to get wet and groped” scene like twice I think? Several beach episodes, that one innocent vibrator toy thing, and (the poon poon got ate 3 times pretty sure). If you’re going into this for the nonstop Upskirt pantyshot moaning, you’re in the right place gang.The dub is fucking great: it’s better than the sub imo. Especially that last one. She’s supposed to be the most reserved one but wowie wow AWOOGA her va her sound so…I realize that I’m posting this publicly so I won’t go into detail. Shit smacks tho. The va for the first guy is also voiced karma from assassination classroom, I expected him to be good. All in all good cast tho all the girls did great.Conclusion: I’m putting this right under my girlfriend is a call in terms of peak ecchi content. It’s high for me because I’m not usually one to enjoy older female + young boy ecchi. They all seem to devolve into a mother son relationship, which is fucking weird because they are apparently supposed to be in a relationship? This one was good tho.

Continue reading.Although this anime is very lewd and consists of awkward and unrealistic scenarios, I think it\'s been an enjoyable watch nonetheless. The episodes are divided into several different events with the general plot consisting of an accident or incident leading towards lewd and or sentimental exchanges of words or just horny thoughts. Bonk!Since there are twelve ten-minute episodes there\'s a total of two hours of watch time. This is where this anime falls apart...in my opinion. To fit four different relationship development stories in this two-hour-long anime is quite hard I believe. Therefore, the story results in a dry and unpolished finish with very little character development. All the episodes are very hectic and there\'s almost no room for character insight nor empathy. The story gets 3 points.The art, on the other hand, is good. I mean, really good. The attention to detail is pretty average but the art is satisfying to watch even tho the story lacks a lot of aspects. The characters don\'t have any distinct features and look pretty average compared to other mediocre anime releases during 2019. but the fact that we\'re able to follow four different ""couples"" that doesn\'t look like one another at all, excluding big busts, is something that I like about this anime. The colors, the atmosphere, and the character design would get a solid 8 from me.If we\'re to move on to sound I don\'t have much to say other than that the soundtrack is pretty good, kind of average. The sound effects and voices are decent but yet again, nothing really stands out of the crowd. The sound gets 6 points.Moving on to characters, as I mentioned before, there\'s a huge lack of personality and character development. They sure have their distinct superficial personalities like being kind, shy, ignorant but we never get to learn anything about the characters on deeper levels. The characters are quite disappointing and will receive a score of 4 points.So all in all, did I enjoy this anime? Surprisingly, yes. I did enjoy this anime. Quite a lot. Although it didn\'t have a direct impact on me, and the fact that I will probably forget about this anime in about a year, I enjoyed it to it\'s fullest at the moment. The humor is good and very enjoyable, it puts you on edge with all the awkward situations. The episodes are fast-paced and the girls are cute, huge plus! I believe that this anime is misunderstood as said in other reviews but you need to watch it with a grain of salt. This anime is basically an open door to all the strange fantasies in this world, and that\'s interesting and also fun to watch.The best way to describe this anime is ""a filler"". Something you watch between animes with a lot of episodes and seasons. It\'s easy to jump into the action with the fast-paced episodes and you\'ll probably finish it in one sitting. in my opinion.

The attention to detail is pretty average but the art is satisfying to watch even tho the story lacks a lot of aspects. The characters don\'t have any distinct features and look pretty average compared to other mediocre anime releases during 2019. but the fact that we\'re able to follow four different ""couples"" that doesn\'t look like one another at all, excluding big busts, is something that I like about this anime. The colors, the atmosphere, and the character design would get a solid 8 from me.If we\'re to move on to sound I don\'t have much to say other than that the soundtrack is pretty good, kind of average. The sound effects and voices are decent but yet again, nothing really stands out of the crowd. The sound gets 6 points.Moving on to characters, as I mentioned before, there\'s a huge lack of personality and character development. They sure have their distinct superficial personalities like being kind, shy, ignorant but we never get to learn anything about the characters on deeper levels. The characters are quite disappointing and will receive a score of 4 points.So all in all, did I enjoy this anime? Surprisingly, yes. I did enjoy this anime. Quite a lot. Although it didn\'t have a direct impact on me, and the fact that I will probably forget about this anime in about a year, I enjoyed it to it\'s fullest at the moment. The humor is good and very enjoyable, it puts you on edge with all the awkward situations. The episodes are fast-paced and the girls are cute, huge plus! I believe that this anime is misunderstood as said in other reviews but you need to watch it with a grain of salt. This anime is basically an open door to all the strange fantasies in this world, and that\'s interesting and also fun to watch.The best way to describe this anime is ""a filler"". Something you watch between animes with a lot of episodes and seasons. It\'s easy to jump into the action with the fast-paced episodes and you\'ll probably finish it in one sitting.', 'TBH, i think almost all of these types of shows have been judged too heavily. with some of these gag shows receiving high praise while others get blasted like this one. with a low low score of 6.50.You watch this because you know what you are in store for, if not you would be sorely dissapointed. Story and character arcs are basically completely absent in this show. The art however i thoroughly liked.One of the best parts of this show is the openings change whenever the show focuses in on another teacher, this was genius i tell you.The absurdity of every single...damn student in that school wanting to get their little sprout into a milf is truly something to enjoy, you just gotta know that this is what you are in store for. However, i have not found an uncensored version. Which is a damn shame because ecchi anime like this requires the need of seeing naked nipples. But this show is sort of hardcore so it is understandably censored. Otherwise it is actually one of the closest things to Hens tail damn student in that school wanting to get their little sprout into a milf is truly something to enjoy, you just gotta know that this is what you are in store for.

But this show is sort of hardcore so it is understandably censored. Otherwise it is actually one of the closest things to Hens tail', 'tl;dr: A student/teacher multi-couple anime that focuses pretty much entirely on hilarious ecchi accidents.This anime is about the formation of four male-student/female-teacher couples. This anime is composed of twelve half length episodes, so it has about the content of six standard episodes. Most episodes are split into two halves as well, so this anime could be seen as a series of 5 minute shorts. The first four episodes are about the first couple, the next five have the second and third couple intermixed, and the last three episodes are about the fourth couple. Once a couple is formed it isn’t really focused on, but you...still do still see them in the background as it focuses on other couples which is kind of nice. Due to the short length, obviously it doesn’t really have much romance or drama or anything like that. The general flow of things is pretty much just that the couple end up getting involved in a series of ecchi situations and then end up going out. The teacher aspect is mostly just window dressing and isn’t taken all that seriously. If you’re looking for something that actually deals with taboo romance you will not find it here.The writing in terms of characters for the most part wasn’t all that great. The first couple involved what’s supposed to be a really strict teacher but that part wasn’t really emphasized much and the boy had pretty much no personality. The second couple involves a boy who everyone is afraid of due to looking like a thug but that is actually a very dutiful young man, and a woman who I don’t really remember much about other than that she’s kind. The third involves a shota trying to act like a man and his tomboyish PE teacher childhood friend. All in all, I didn’t really feel much of anything at all towards any of these characters or their romance. Like obviously if things went badly I would be pretty pissed due to the type of anime it is, but overall I wasn’t all that emotionally invested. The last couple was different in that they were pretty great, especially the kuudere ditzy school nurse. The boy was overly emotional which made him basically the opposite of her, but that actually gave them great chemistry in an ‘opposites attract’ sort of way that worked well.But what really is the core of the anime is the ecchi aspects. The majority of the anime is simply the couples getting thrown into bizarre ecchi situations. They actually start out quite simple, the type that you’d probably be able to find in other ecchi media. However, they progressively get crazier and crazier to some of the most absurd situations I’ve seen in ecchi anime. And they’re completely hilarious. Especially how they can escalate so quickly. The ecchi itself is pretty good too. It’s not really borderline H, but it still does go farther than most ecchi anime. The art and animation overall aren’t all that great, but they do a pretty good job with the ecchi portions. The character designs also have a good amount of variety for the setting and premise. The OP has some pretty solid ecchi too and a pretty good song, and the ED is decent in both regards. I also liked how both changed based on the couple being focused on. As for those that don’t like ecchi: This is a review of a fan service anime. No doubt about it this is a review of a fanservice anime. So why are you here? still do still see them in the background as it focuses on other couples which is kind of nice.

Not at all. Is it enjoyable, cute, and fun for mahjong fans? I'd say so. I recommend this anime, but that comes with a caveat - for those mahjong fans looking for a serious story, this isn't the right show for that. For those Slice of Life fans looking to just sit back and enjoy without thinking, this is a little better but still not quite there. It would be enjoyable without knowledge of mahjong, but it's filled with lots of references to...the game that enhance your enjoyment - you may find yourself getting lost trying to keep track of everything when the gameplay is happening (although the games aren't important individually; at least up through episode 9, the most I've needed to know in the middle of a game being played on screen is that the hands they're playing are rare).As a mahjong fan, I do find myself being a little frustrated with the subs I've been watching (though your experience may vary) - the sub group is translating various terms that usually do not get translated in gameplay such as Tenpai and Yakuman. It's a little jarring seeing that and having to catch myself jumping to make sure that the translation they've chosen is in fact a mahjong term and not something else. However, this is not an issue with the show, merely the subs I'm watching.

Being someone who doesn't normally watch this genre, I found myself wholeheartedly enjoying it more than some of the bigger titles this season.It's not everyone's cup of tea, or even close to it, but at the same time, it's lighthearted and enjoyable. There have been some reviews complaining about how most of the girls have similar personalities, but it's a 1 cour show (12 episodes), and that doesn't leave much time for background or much development. The characters are likable despite their lack of development (besides them all becoming friends),...and the designs are honestly, great.

This show's been my gateway into that genre, and now I'm thinking about watching other CGDCT shows. Once again, it's not everyone's thing, as the plot is well...slice of life worthy, and somewhat slow, though excellent if you want to zone out.

While the central conceit of the show is that the main character inherits a mahjong parlor and befriends a magical mahjong spirit, she ultimately doesn't seem to care so much about the game as she does about hanging out. Her friends are much the same. It's fun to see them goof off lightheartedly at the mahjong table in the earliest episodes but after that point they lose interest. When the 5th and final Cute Girl, the only one truly passionate about mahjong, is introduced under the pretense of a rivalry with another member...of the cast, they spend several episodes denying her in order to Do Cute Things (i.e. not mahjong) and stamp out the fire inside her, taming her into another genericized member of the cast.But what about CGDCT fans? The mahjong is just a distraction. If anything, most of the cute stuff they do vis a vis mahjong is just reenacting scenes from other famous (and better) mahjong stories. And beyond that, the time they spend hanging around feels contrived and unrealistic. Who has a defunct mahjong parlor just fall into their lap? Where are they getting all this time and money? To me, CGDCT works when it either leans into realism and shows Cute Girls Doing Cute Things in spite of it all, or leans into fantasy and invents whole-cloth dreamlike situations in which Cute Girls can do Things so Cute they'd be impossible for mere mortals like us. Ideally CGDCT is relatable and/or absurd and Pon no Michi is neither. It introduces promising ideas, issuing challenges to the characters which would help us better understand them, and then promptly forgets about them to go do something else.

Functionally, it's a long commercial for Onomichi tourism, and a slightly-less-long commercial for Mahjong Soul. But it's not even a very good commercial. When transparently sponsored, product placement anime like Super Cub exist and are actually able to tell a moderately compelling story, Pon no Michi has no excuse.Side notes:- The auto-tuning in the opening is atrocious.- Of the subs available, the bilibili subs are machine translated garbage, and the 4chan subs are meme trash.

By the way, the only reference to mahjong anime is Saki (which I highly recommend), which was more focused on mahjong. Going back to Pon no Michi, although it's initially presented as an anime centered around mahjong, it's clear from the first few episodes that mahjong is just a pastime for the girls. This approach might be disappointing for those who were expecting a more mahjong-focused plot.The disconnect with mahjong is evident. Despite the anime being about this game, they barely show the girls playing a match and it doesn't demonstrate how mahjong is an...integral part of their daily routines. The anime doesn't stand out in either of these areas; it neither focuses on mahjong nor explores the girls' daily lives.But you know what? I loved it. It's one of my favorites this season. It even made me want to be a cute high school girl and do cute high school girl things (stereotypical, I know, but I don't care). Even though they don't play much mahjong, the girls are always talking about it. They're a lively group. The anime starts with a trio of friends, Nashiko, Pai, and Izumi, who were always together and already had great chemistry. Then Richie, an ojou-sama, joins them and quickly becomes friends with the trio. They do teenage things together and sometimes play mahjong. Richie is good at the game, which catches the attention of Haneru, and the quintet is formed!

So much parody in it but it was enjoyable. Glad to watch the version subbed by ""MahjongSoulless"" because they explained the references (or else I won\'t get the majority of it) but their translation is pretty trash (I think they did it purposely for entertainment?)I watched this anime because I missed the OP mahjong series ""Saki"". I hope they continue to create more of Saki.

You can only have your cute girls sit around a table and make Kaiji and Yu-Gi-Oh references so many times until the joke becomes stale so the show mixes it up by having an episode dedicated to the girls making curry or mobile gaming which is just as thrilling as it sounds. I don’t dislike the girls. I like them a lot. They’re incredibly well-designed and they all have likeable personalities (Haneru with-standing as she’s only just been introduced by the end of episode four) but the script feels very safe and very mediocre.Speaking of designs, despite the overall art and hand-drawn animation being pretty good, the digital backgrounds and the use of CGI are not. Some of the digital backgrounds have a strange fish-eye lens effect to make the interior of the parlour seem more spacious, but it doesn’t blend well with the characters and art. The CGI hands used when the girls push all of the mahjong pieces into the centre to be shuffled or when they’re making places are distractingly uncanny like they're disembodied from the characters.

Hmm...It is often said that niche things are the hardest to teach to foreigners, and in the case of Japanese Mahjong, we\'ve had series that span back years trying to relay this information to people to various successes. Shows like Fall 2005\'s Akagi or even Spring-Summer 2009\'s Saki, these are the classics when it comes to the niche topic. And once again, even in 2024, we are presented with one more series: an original show that\'s part-Mahjong, part-promotion,...and a full-on CGDCT show, called Pon no Michi a.k.a The Way of Pon.The show...is really nothing special, though it\'s the usual gathering of girls through a rather eccentric girl named Nashiko Jippensha, who got chased out of her house because she\'s been fooling around with her obsession of idols, therefore making her a lazy and unproductive daughter. What she has got left is an old mahjong parlor that her father seemingly left her with, and that becomes her hangout place while learning all about Mahjong. She is soon joined with her friends of Pai Kawahigashi and Izumi Tokutomi, who are more adept at the sport being beginner and advanced players respectively. And also...a mahjong spirit in the form of a sparrow taken off the design of the 1 Bamboo (bird) tile? Ok...at least he\'s named Chonbo for a reason. The leftovers with Riche Hayashi, who hung out at Nashiko\'s parlor thanks to her parents in its past active days, as well as the competitive Haneru Emi who always tries to desperately win games over the girls with a very deep obsession for Mahjong, rounds up the ""5 girls plus a talking bird"" gang, having their time of fun in a once-used space that\'s left for their taking in the city of Onomichi, Hiroshima.Just about the only thing worth of note is how the girls all look like with their rather big bodies of boobs and thighs, and this is not a coincidence as the creator of Gotoubun no Hanayome a.k.a The Quintessential Quintuplets, mangaka Negi Haruba himself contributes as character designer of the series. So, if you\'re thinking that Nashiko\'s liveliness and Izumi\'s character design is a lot like Yotsuba, you have your answer.Both the production and music leave a lot to be desired in this original series. OLM, especially on Team Inoue that\'s targeted more towards the kids\' category, as mentioned at the beginning of the review, the producers must\'ve had an inkling to promote the city of which the series got its footing on, and promote the hell out of it, which is not the first series to do so (see other shows like Yuru Camp). But otherwise, it\'s just fairly decent with some occurrent 3DCG in the mahjong scenes, and that\'s it. The music, while also just all over the place, evokes the feeling of happy memories of hanging out with friends, and if that\'s the goal, the anime certainly has Riichi-ed it. I do like the OP song by Rika Nakada and the entire VA cast, which is actually quite catchy, while halca\'s ED, is the usual halca standard of decent to good.But then again, for Crunchyroll to not pick this up, leaving the doors open for Bilibili and French\'s ADN a.k.a Animation Digital Network to get the rights for the series, you\'re practically not missing much by watching a rather niche product that\'s catered to those who already knew how to play Japanese Mahjong, or simply for a lack of better words, a planned act of a promotional campaign to visit Onomichi, Hiroshima.If you\'re any interested at all, just try an episode to see if it\'s your thing. and a full-on CGDCT show, called Pon no Michi a.k.a The Way of Pon.The show...is really nothing special, though it\'s the usual gathering of girls through a rather eccentric girl named Nashiko Jippensha, who got chased out of her house because she\'s been fooling around with her obsession of idols, therefore making her a lazy and unproductive daughter.

The show itself is ummmm, obvious about mahjong, but not really.  While Mahjong is the main thing about this show, it's more of a refrence that appears one or twice within each episode.The beginning is a little slow, with introductions for the main cast, but once Haneru (black red hair girl/ qq nino clone) joins in, the show becomes much more enjoyable and fast...pace, with a lot of fun parts here and there.The refrences to Kaiji and One Piece was a nice nod, along with the Death Note style monolgues that happen within the last few episodes.  However, the Mahjong Soul ad was kind of, yet not expected.OP and ED is bop.Overall, this show is a slice of life, so a laid back experience is expected, but there are some hints of emotion that definitely made the show a better watch than expected.  Don't let my score fool you from not watching it, and don't let people say the show's horrible because it doesn't teach you how to play Mahjong.It's better known as a Slice a Life with Mahjong on the side, not the otherway around.SLICE OF LIFE WATCHERS REJOICE! pace, with a lot of fun parts here and there.The refrences to Kaiji and One Piece was a nice nod, along with the Death Note style monolgues that happen within the last few episodes.

Problem is, Pon no Michi is woefully plain for a slice-of-life/CGDCT anime that at points it is rather tedious to sit through.Pon no Michi advertises itself as a slice-of-life/CGDCT anime all about the strategy tabletop game Mahjong. If...you look at the genres/themes side for this anime you'll notice it says supernatural, but, trust me, don't get excited for anything grandiose on that front as I'll get into shortly. One of the huge cruxes that plagues this show is just how much mahjong really has nothing to do with the show. There's no competitions, nothing of high stakes is ever present and everything is just presented as good old harmless fun. Which, don't get me wrong, I have no issue with, but it just lacks substance and is made to feel like mahjong just takes a backseat to whatever the characters are doing.Let's talk about the characters now and the most critical aspect of having a CGDCT anime is having your characters be fun to watch. Well, sad to say, the characters are so one-note, 1-dimensional and mostly devoid of a personality that isn't a trope, cliche or sterotype. Nashiko's a typical ball of energy, good natured protag. Izumi's a textbook tomboy. Riche is your rich ojou-sama type. Haneru is a stoic yet serious character who at least has to the best design out of all the characters. As for Pai.... she has no real identifying traits to her personality and is the most forgettable. Then there's Chonbo, which leads me to the next point where this show fails at ultilizing its components.What even is the point of Chonbo in this show? From the first episode he is introduced as a spirit of mahjong and literally the only thing he ever does in the show is help motivate Nashiko to learn mahjong and by extension open up the parlor for her friends to play with her. AND THAT IS IT! His presence in the show is so minimal I have to question once again why he even exists in the first place. Only Nashiko hears him, he contributes nothing to the activities the girls undertake and nothing about why he's present and for what purpose does he have is nevered brought into question. If his role is to be a mascot character then that'd be fine, but he does nothing and is barely ever present in most episodes. It's just baffling and frustrating that you have this supernatural aspect to your show, but it contributes next to nothing about the show and half the time you just forget that Chonbo is even a part of it.The only somewhat enjoyment I had was the nods and references to other shows like Saki or Akagi/Kaigi, but after awhile it is tiring especially when the show already had an issue with it's own identity.Pon no Michi is quite the letdown, honestly. Speaking as someone who enjoys a lot of slice-of-life/CGDCT anime, this one did so little for me that it's just best being a forgotten addition to those genres. If you want a show about mahjong with cute girls in it, just watch Saki. you look at the genres/themes side for this anime you'll notice it says supernatural, but, trust me, don't get excited for anything grandiose on that front as I'll get into shortly.

While CGDCT genre has many bland animes, this one brought boringness to another level.The parts involving mahjong were quite challenging to watch. Even it provided some basic explanations, it’d be very hard to follow if one knows nothing about mahjong. Viewers would need to be quite familiar with mahjong/gambling-themed anime in order to understand the jokes in ep.1.The parts without mahjong were incredibly dull. The characters\' personalities weren’t distinct: Riche might be the most different one, while the other three girls all seemed to have similar casual, optimistic personality. The way anime...described the daily actions of characters were mundane and boring; it was hard to see the intention of the creator - what kind of experience did want to bring to the audience?The production appeared to be haphazard at every turn. The character designs, especially the apparels, looked so outdated. The background music often overwhelmed the scene, or even overwhelmed dialogues with a loud and distracting volume. The character movements were stiff - even the first few scenes in ep.1 were so poorly animated. And hey, what\'s going on with Chonbo the bird? It looked as if it was replicated from a kindergarten doodle!After watching three episodes, I felt it’s a total waste of time to continue watching. described the daily actions of characters were mundane and boring; it was hard to see the intention of the creator - what kind of experience did want to bring to the audience?The production appeared to be haphazard at every turn.

Ye i guess it paid off.Should always ask yourself why should i care for these people, why are they important, why should i continue watching this series, is the dissapoiting ending going to be worth it?Uninspiring, lame slop content. With fucking mahjong lol, i mean why would you ever think people watching stereotypic oversaturated anime girls playing mahjong would be entertaining? In basic terms, this is the example of what rich white kids do in new york, absolutely nothing.We got the hacker, slasher,...chopper, and the tsundere, the stuid baka, the groper, so on. Lets not forget the upcoming character whom the parents died in a car crash and has to play mahjong because she is only good in mahjong and has to remember that her parents left her and his little brother so she needs money so he can go to school.
