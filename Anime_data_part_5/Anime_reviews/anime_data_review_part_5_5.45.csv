Sakura Taisen: Katsudou Shashin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/608/Sakura_Taisen__Katsudou_Shashin,"[""Sakura Wars: The Movie is a very deceptive title. At first glance (and from what US trailers have been released) this movie is treated as a very open source for people to get interested in the Sakura Wars series. If you go in with intentions like that, I'm sorry to say Sakura Wars: The Movie will leave you dazed and confused.I'm not going to be touching upon too much of the plot for this movie as it's honestly coming off the chain of TV series, and OVA's released prior to this movie. However as a person watching this movie with only brief understanding of the...series (Between walkthroughs of the game translated) it leaves a lot to be determined. Set in between the events of Sakura Taisen 3 and 4 this movie focuses on the Flower Division surviving on their own after Ichiro Oogami (Main character in the games and Captain of the Division) was transferred to Paris. As we see the girls not only maintain their roles as theater actors,a new threat appears as a conspiracy from the New York division strikes Japan forcing the girls into their Kobu's one more time to fight against the evil Kouma.This plot is not winning any awards, as it's played by the numbers throughout the entire movie. The big part that did have me interested however was the final sequence in which Sakura and Lachette have a very dramatic performance with each other. That's honestly the only scene that comes to mind that really stood out for me because the performance in Japanese was very good imo.The art for this movie is great, characters pop out with their color schemes, backgrounds look gorgeous, and the animation over all was very nice except for one thing. The CGI in this movie is very bad. It's not King of Thorn level bad, but it's getting there. This wouldn't be so much an issue but the action scenes in this movie are done with this CGI which causes you to lose the impact of what's going on since the mechs just look ehhhhh.Sound is great, Sakura Taisen has always been known for having great music and this movie fits the bill. A big shoutout to rhe musical numbers thrown in the movie, especially for the opening.Characters are already established prior to this movie, so if this is your first experience you will be missing a lot of backstory. You can piece together who exactly is who as you go through it, but I'd def either watch the prior anime or play through the games as you'll be very lost.Enjoyment is pretty much hampered by the mix of not well developed characters, predictable story, and jarring CGI. Even the grand conclusion for the battle is not very impressive when considering the stakes and the fact that one of the characters only comes in for maybe like 2 minutes in the final showdown (who is important to prior Sakura Taisen games) is just a punch to the nads. If it wasn't for the good character art/backgrounds and great musical numbers/perfomances I'd have most likely stopped watching this movie by the half way mark.All in all if you're a Sakura Wars fan I'd give it a shot if you're interested. As to everyone else who's looking for a first exposure to the series, either watch the first anime and work your way up or just play the games. Otherwise this movie will leave a bitter experience in your mouth. series (Between walkthroughs of the game translated) it leaves a lot to be determined.

It's bugs me. There was also two characters that almost looked the same to me due to their hairstyle and the haircolor. But it was later clarified.* Sound (9) - I just love hearing the instruments during battle scene, it gives more the epic feel of slaying an enemy and such. (You will know which scene I mean). It had me confusing in the beginning but I noticed there weren't really an opening so that was automatically an opening song.* Character (8) - We see some serious character developments upon the arrival of the character named, Ratchete. And other two people that used to work for her on a team. Logically speaking, this movie is more about her than the Flower Division altogether. She was there to learn something out of it.The antagonist is not that special, I kind of miss the original ones because they have more deeper meaning why they exist, while the antagonist of this movie? He just randomly popped and say he will rid the world of Kobous and Eisenkleids. (Don't know I spell both correctly).* Enjoyment (8) - Well, even though I had those negative comments about the antagonist I still enjoyed the movie no matter, what. It just gave me the feeling that I do miss the original Sakura Taisen team. Bu it feels off for me, that's all. faces. It's bugs me.

Prism Ark,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1807/Prism_Ark,"[""This anime had all the right elements in order for it to become something great.  However, as many anime shows based of video games (like Prism Ark, Devil May Cry comes to mind as another one), as far as an anime goes, Prism Ark falls short of using its elements that it has and incorporating them into something that could have shined brightly above others of its kind.  However, its shortcomings do not take away from this series as being something really adorable, cute and flashy, and Prism Ark is definitely an enjoyable watch from start to finish, even though you may not...know what's going on half the time.I'd give an overall synopsis of the story, but everything in this show is so loosely connected to each other, there really isn't an overall plot besides the main focus of the budding romance between the two main characters, Precia and Hyaweh.  There seems to be some evil organization out there that wants power to become like a God and most probably, rule the galaxy or something of the sort.  But because all of the episodes focus mainly on the romance between the two characters instead of the plot mentioned briefly, it doesn't amount to much, besides in the last episode, really.I feel the saving grace of this show has to be the art and animation.  The overall design on the anime and characters is something new and will shine to you once you start watching.  Heavy detail is given to each of the characters and they are all colored well.  Speaking of which, the use of color is really portrayed nicely in this anime.  Animation is also pretty good, as many of the battle scene, even though rather quick, are nicely animated.  And just to throw it out there and something of totally my opinion, I absolutely loved the weapon design that this show presented.Overall sound was pretty good.  Music was upbeat and fit nicely with all of the scenes.  Some of the character voices I did not particularly like (i.e. Precia, one of them), but its doesn't take away too much from the show.Like I've mentioned above, the character design is amazing and the detail given to each is strikingly clear as you compare characters to one another.  Prism Ark, being an ero-game, more detail is obviously given to the women characters than the males.  As far as personality and such, you have your typical main protagonists, each with their own twist (stuck up, stubborn  princess and a shy, courageous lad, both of whom just so happen to have dark secrets).  What brings the show out of the dirt is the side characters, all of whom compliment the main ones quite nicely and have different personalities, leading to personal favorites.Though Prism Ark has some interesting battles and the anime revolves around students in a knight academy, training to become Royal Guards, a huge factor of how much you may enjoy this show can be based on the fact how much you can put up with the romance factor.  It also gets a bit frustrating too as the romance between Hyaweh and Precia, although so painfully obvious, doesn't really develop till the second half of the anime.In the end, I feel that if they stretched this out to be a 24 or 26 episode series, the potentially interesting plot that was introduced but not really brought out till the last few episodes, could have been developed much more.  Ultimately, I feel that the anime is more of a fan-service to the audience who have played and are familiar with the Prism Ark games. know what's going on half the time.I'd give an overall synopsis of the story, but everything in this show is so loosely connected to each other, there really isn't an overall plot besides the main focus of the budding romance between the two main characters, Precia and Hyaweh.

I've always been a sucker for the romances, but still, even outside the range of the romance, I loved this anime. There are a few things about it that I didn't like, but still, I really enjoyed it.One thing was that I felt that the storyline itself had a lot more potential than the producers or whoever gave it. I never played the game though; I only watched the anime, but still, they could have maybe went pass the storyline of the game and built more on to it. To me, the ending was a...really good ending compared to many other animes, but if you compared it to what it could have been, it wasn't all that great.The beginning was actually pretty good, in my opinion, seeing as how it started with a complex story, but that complex story kind of died out until the end since they focused a lot on the school lives and romances of the main characters. It left out a lot of the complex story. T_TThe art was beautiful. I really liked the designs of the characters seeing as how they get their own personal armors and weapons, and these things are very well designed. The animation was very good, too. The backgrounds really brought out the mien and setting. I can't say too much about the quality, though,  since the quality that I watched this anime in may be better or worse than yours, but still,  pretty much, there was a lot of beautiful color and detail used in animation and design.I actually really liked the sounds for this anime. The opening and ending weren't bad, and these theme songs matched the anime well. The background music was very fitting for the moments it was in, and the voices for the characters fit their personalities really well seeing how Precia's (main girl) voice fit her mature yet snobby attitude.Prism Ark's characters could be amazing or awful depending on how you portray them. All in all, the character development in the story was very good, except for the fact that the romance was a bit slow moving. As for their personalities, each one stood out very well, and it made it clear who was what type of person. The only way you can portray the characters as awful is by opinion,  such as hating Precia's personality for acting kind of selfish, spoiled, and stuck up, or disliking Hayaweh's (main male) for seeming so dense and overly kind. But still, those are just my opinions.It's amazing how the characters' personalities devolop and change through such a short anime.Enjoyment wise, I enjoyed it completely. ^_^ It got me hooked from the beginning since I like comedy, romance, and drama with a bit of fantasy and action. The romance was amazingly cute with the whole girl hates guy but falls in love later thing. And you can't help but love this whole school of fascinating characters in a fantasy setting.Overall, I can't find many words to express his anime but I loved it. I loved everything in this anime other than the develpment of the plot. If they could have made the anime longer or gave more information on the complex story behind it, it would become one of my all time favorites. Pretty much, I wish it had a sequel. Still, I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind an anime based off an ero-game. ^_~ really good ending compared to many other animes, but if you compared it to what it could have been, it wasn't all that great.The beginning was actually pretty good, in my opinion, seeing as how it started with a complex story, but that complex story kind of died out until the end since they focused a lot on the school lives and romances of the main characters.

I don't say this often, but this should have been a 24 to 26 episode anime. In terms of stylization, plot, characters and animation, all of it was top notch with the makings of something great, but the fact of the matter is that this anime got throw together in a hurry, didn't close up more than half of it's plot lines, leaving them wide open, and simply left the viewer stuck in drive. When I finished, I honestly thought there was a Season 2 somewhere. When I realized there wasn't and there wasn't...any news about a second season either (although it's still possible considering it only wrapped up 8 months ago) I became stunned, because that's how open the last episode is.The worst part about it is that the last episode had that &quot;feeling&quot; of being the last episode but the rational side of me said there was no possible way they could wrap it all up in 24 minutes. I was right, of course, but apparantly they still tried.What makes this sad is that this anime had amazing potential along the long-lasting lines of Shakugan no Shana or Zero no Tsukaima. It's a feel-good anime with tenderness, amazing art, and a story worthy of telling in more than two seasons and definitely more than 1. So why only 12 episodes? Who knows? is my answer. I shrug, too, because I'm not that invested in it. It was only 12 episodes, but I wish there were more, mainly because of the great romance between the two leads, which was done with great passion and taste.So, my final impression is &quot;Oh well.&quot; I wish there was more, but I'll get over it. It's just too bad, is all. any news about a second season either (although it's still possible considering it only wrapped up 8 months ago) I became stunned, because that's how open the last episode is.The worst part about it is that the last episode had that &quot;feeling&quot; of being the last episode but the rational side of me said there was no possible way they could wrap it all up in 24 minutes.

And if you dont agree with me then just keep it to yourself!!!! ', ""The anime was so awesome. I love how they confuse people at the start. I would really recommend this one for those who like the anime Zero no Tsukaima or something similar. This anime is just a Masterpiece. It's actually quite a real shame there's no season 2 since the anime is just so awesome. I wish someone will continue this work. The story is line is quite confusing at first as I mention, but fear not because the anime is actually explain it throughout the series. I also like the Romance Comedy of this anime.

Windland is currently losing a war with its neighboring country, the Sablum Empire. The Knight's Academy is where the young men and women of Windland are trained, and they offer a glimmer of hope to the beleaguered nation.There are rumors that a skilled warrior named Priecia, who may be the long lost princess of Windland, could turn the tide of the war. Priecia's exceptional swordsmanship seems to guarantee victory for her kingdom.Despite the rumors, Priecia stoically prepares to attend the...academy and prove herself. Her first encounter with Hyaweh, a laid back boy who seems indifferent to everything, complicates things.Priecia and Hyaweh have opposing personalities, which creates friction when they first meet. However, they both prove to be extremely talented in swordsmanship.

Despite initial concerns about its origins, the first few episodes are engaging, with excellent action, well developed characters, and a promising storyline.However, the show takes an unexpected turn by revealing its endpoint early on, which can sometimes remove the element of surprise. Nonetheless, it maintains interest by keeping us engaged in the journey towards the inevitable conclusion.The romantic relationship between Hyaweh and Priecia becomes a highlight.

Rokudou no Onna-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54259/Rokudou_no_Onna-tachi,"['A lot of the criticism that I am seeing this show gets is that; the show is a generic harem anime, that the show is wish fulfillment, or that the MC is annoying, weak, and spineless. However, I question how one could convincingly make these arguments, aside from maybe the last one, but even with that one I don\'t find a good argument as to why the show is not worth checking out.At first glance, I too thought it was going to be another generic harem with an MC I will hate. But the show manages to circumvent most if not all the things...I would immediately find annoying and fault the show for. In most generic harem animes the girls gravitate toward the MC for no explainable reason, other than usually he\'s incredibly strong from the get-go or he\'s a ""nice guy"". In this show, the main character, Rokudou, has the ability to make \'bad girls\' fall in love with him through a power passed on to him by his grandfather. I much prefer this explanation as the ability also serves as the main hook and directly impacts the plot.The show is not just wish fulfillment either. If this show was wish fulfillment Rokudou\'s ability would also make him super strong while making him get all the girls allowing him to beat up any of the delinquents or bullies he finds in his path, getting his revenge and making him end up at the top of the social ladder. But that\'s not what his ability does and he doesn\'t use his abilities to get revenge either. Instead, he does something surprising and admirable, he chooses to reform the bad girls and thus making them no longer in love with him. Instead of taking advantage of these girls to fill the show\'s runtime with ecchi hijinks or beat up his bullies. He chooses not to take the easy path and works to stand up for himself.Rokudou\'s main goal isn\'t to become popular with women or get revenge using the girls he practically mind-controls with his ability, instead, his goal is to make school life enjoyable for him and his friends. This is extremely refreshing to have an anime where the MC is actually a decent person. Whereas another anime would illustrate the MC is a ""nice guy"" by making him just a regular ass dude and just not an asshole. It makes Rokudou stand out from other MCs. Rokudou may be a wimp, cringe, and he does cry so you might find him annoying and still dislike him. But I believe that just lays the groundwork for his character to grow throughout the show. Whether they capitalize on that potential is yet to be seen.This anime may not blow your socks off but it definitely isn\'t horrible. And I believe it\'s at least worth giving a couple of episodes to see if you like it. I\'m looking forward to seeing how the rest of the show turns out.

Rokudou may be a wimp, cringe, and he does cry so you might find him annoying and still dislike him. But I believe that just lays the groundwork for his character to grow throughout the show. Whether they capitalize on that potential is yet to be seen.This anime may not blow your socks off but it definitely isn\'t horrible. And I believe it\'s at least worth giving a couple of episodes to see if you like it. I\'m looking forward to seeing how the rest of the show turns out.', 'So it seems that people are jumping to a lot of conclusions about Rokudo\'s Bad Girls without having properly watched the show. Because that rating is very low and several reviews are nitpicking at things which either aren\'t true, are subversions of classic harem tropes or things which simply aren\'t there. If those people would give the show a proper watch, they\'d see that Rokudo\'s Bad Girls has a lot of charm, a lot of heart, a fun story and some wonderful characters who make the show a fun watch.The show starts out looking like it\'s heading in some pretty cliched directions. You have Tosuke...Rokudo, the archetypical loser protagonist who hangs out with his fellow outcasts, Masaru ""Colonel"" Hinomoto and Kouta ""Chief"" Kijima, the three being bully bait, particularly for school delinquent Haruya Iinuma. Sick of being picked on, Rokudo and his friends find a charm of his grandfather\'s, which he uses, hoping to improve his fortunes. Unfortunately, rather than granting strength or finding some way to turn him into a cool kid, Rokudo\'s charm leaves him with a pentagram on his forehead which leads to any female delinquent or ""bad girl"" falling in love with him. The bad girls include notorious delinquent and brooding loner Ranna Himawari, Iinuma\'s girlfriend Tsubaki and loli ruler and most powerful delinquent in school Sayuri Osanada, all of who begin to see Rokudo as the perfect man.Now, you may think, as do some negative reviewers that this will lead into your standard ""dorky protag becomes a chick magnet by dubious means and ends up with his own harem of women out of his league who lust over him for no apparent reason"" harem anime, right? Well, you would be wrong. Because Rokudo instead uses his newfound power to try reforming the girls who fall in love with him and tries to use his new power to improve the people around him. As Rokudo falls into a world of being challenged by delinquents, he begins forging new friendships including with former tormentor Iinuma due to his association with these bad girls and begins to change them for the better.Rokudo himself is a change from the standard ""cowardly, easily bullied loser"" protagonist trope in that while he is occasionally scared by the delinquents around him, he never has screaming, crying meltdowns. He tries his utmost to be the leader his friends think he is. He begins to grow, improve and change (well, as much as you can in 7 episodes so far) and is never humiliated or treated as someone without dignity. He\'s not a perverted dork who abuses his power and uses it to seduce women he\'d never normally have contact with. The only girl he seems to be forging a romance with is Ranna herself. Rokudo is more or less Takemichi from Tokyo Revengers done right. And he\'s refreshing for it.On paper, Rokudo\'s Bad Girls shouldn\'t work. if it played all of the standard ""Loser who gets a harem somehow"" tropes straight, it wouldn\'t. it would be another dime a dozen, forgettable harem anime for the pile. In practice, it does, because it completely subverts the tropes in question, barely functions as a harem anime and gives us a cast of fun, interesting characters, a good story, an upbeat, optimistic tone and gives us a crew of protagonists we want to see happy. It\'s not the same old, same old. It\'s enjoyable, funny and entertaining, which is what a good action comedy anime should be.The anime may not be for everybody because of the animation style or they may not like the characters, but if you come in without pre-concieved notions that this is ""just another harem anime,"" you may just be surprised. I\'m enjoying the hell out of Rokudo\'s Bad Girls so far, and I\'m hoping it gets a second season.

It's also the type of series that blind watchers won't see what's wrong it. However, most people gave up on the premise alone and couldn't view more than 4 episodes. The series has a small online presence & this anime probably killed any interest. I feel the promotional art is also to blame as it gives little accuracy to what's being sold here. Calling the series a romcom is correct but that's not the complete package. The series is battle oriented but the average audience...will not care about that as the lead protagonist isn't a physically strong character. The advertisements such as key art visuals didn't initially portray the leading young man, Rokudo. Instead, they advertise all of the so called “bad girls” of the series. This is prevalent in the manga volumes as well. Despite having a 26 volume count, the main character is only featured in the last volume cover. Yep, Rokudo is not even on the cover of volume 1.Rokudo's Bad Girls has a lot of bad going for it. If you decide to stick with it then you're more mature than the average anime fan as you have patience to watch a vulnerable male lead, Rokudo Tosuke. The series is about coming of age as it's from the perspective of bullied charactersl Rokudo and his friends Colonel & Chief. I'm surprised how people view him as a wish fulfillment character when he's not enjoying the supposed fantasy. In an age where people are very concerned about their image be it through “cooking, chad, extra, mid, etc”, you would think this type of character would be more relatable. It's comparable to Shun of “Saint Seiya” where Rokudo doesn't physically have to change himself to properly represent masculinity. You won't see this fully realized in the anime but the deeper you get into the manga the more manly traits you'll find. Even within these 12 eps, you see a lot of growth from this bullied high schooler, but most people won't have the attention span for that.Rokudo's Bad Girls is basically the modern day “My Bride Is a Mermaid” with some elements of “Lean On Me 1989”. Rokudo has a pentagram on his forehead which he received from his departed grandpa. This pentagram causes a spell that'll make bad girls fall in love with him and that's the extent of it's power. Despite having this ability he doesn't abuse it and questions his own value as a man. Basically, Rokudo is like Shigeo from “Mob Psycho 100” where he doesn't want his power to become his personality trait. Rokudo wants to improve himself and live a peaceful life therefore he has to stand up to his delinquent bullies. It's because of this bravery that many delinquents and bad girls become his friends. And that's the nature of the series until Rokudo fully matures into the man he wants to be. But this anime is only 12 episodes long so you're not gonna see the end to his story. Especially not for a series that's 26 volumes long while the anime condenses 9 volumes.Without visual aid it's difficult to express how poor this adaptation is. While the manga wasn't a splatter film, it is violent enough for its themes. The series is supposed to be about reforming a bad school filled with delinquents and troublemakers. On occasion this series has gang fights with enough brutalities to hospitalize victims with murderous intentions. But the anime, for whatever reason, chose to nullify a lot of the violent content. Blood is practically absent and the animation is really subpar. Studio Satelight actually has a lot of good things under their brand but I guess this anime was performed by their B & C Teams. When compared to the upcoming Helck, there's a big difference in quality. While the character designs & colors are very manga accurate the mobility of action scenes are extremely stiff. There's also multiple shots that just lack detail thus appearing flat. Many iconic manga double page spreads are strangely animated, too. There's many little things that are different from the manga that changes the tone of the image entirely. There's even shots where the composition of characters are completely altered for no good reason. While there's fighting in this series, it was never a perfected craft in the manga. It was serviceable. But the anime makes things look unimpressive as attacks mainly consist of beams of light for fast punches & kicks. Hardly anything provides the necessary impact to sell the damage or strength of the attacks.The reduction of violence really hurt this anime as just about anything that is meant to introduce a bad girl is met with a subpar experience. The idea here is Rokudo is supposed to help reform the delinquent society but many dialogue and scenes that portray these changes are glanced over in the anime. If not rushed, then the scenes are removed entirely. For example when the anime introduces the bancho Sonada you don't see what makes her a bad girl or an interesting character. Because her flashbacks depict her doing violent things, so they're not in the anime. The same can be said for the abuse Rokudo's and his friends take as their injuries are greatly reduced to slight bruises and scratches instead of bleeding and swollen wounds. That's what  made Rokudo admirable for withstanding this abuse when facing people who are dangerously stronger than him. The same problems appear in character backstories as they summarized with montages. For whatever reason, the anime was really in a rush to squeeze in the first major arc of the anime within 12 episodes when it really needed more than that. It becomes a big letdown as it wants to show you the fighting section but the fights themselves are drawn cheaply and end very quickly.Just about anything worthy of substance or depth is abbreviated into very simple messages of friendship when there's a little more going on. I won't claim Rokudo's Bad Girls as a must read manga. It's not a super great story but it's a story that's told very well and has the right growth for the characters. The anime just cannot or purposely will not put effort into giving any life to this adaptation. It just comes off as a forgettable seasonal show when the manga has a lot more going for it. So if you've seen this anime and felt it was lacking in some areas it may be because the crucial components weren't drawn at all or they haven't happened yet because it's in later arcs of the manga. While the anime is watchable as it chose to cherry pick the most relevant scenes of the story it's far from being a well done anime adaptation. Certain scenes work while the majority of it just irritates me because I'm familiar with the source material.

So ofcourse a lot of you guys would dislike...the idea or call it trash but he also protects the girls in his own way as a crybaby hero.

For the typical Harem lovers ofcourse you can enjoy this anime as you progress each episode and I am talking about harem lovers not ""ecchi"". Some may find it boring at the beginning. If you don\'t want to get bored skip the first few episodes start from ep 4/5 but I suggest you rather not to.And let me tell you something, this anime stays a harem until the very end even in the manga (Technically Not a general spoiler).

The story shows us that our protagonist does not want a girl in his life, he...just wants to have a common high school life, with its festivals, with its friends, and so on.You will think that it will be a story of a good boy falling in love with a bad girl so that she is good and it is not like that, our protagonist helps the bad girls for good, he knows that because of his spell these girls will like him but instead of taking advantage of them helps to be better people, *spoiler* there was an episode where he helped one of the girls so that her first love, which was him, would not break her heart *spoiler din*, how the author was able to do is quite sweet this for the story making it more a series of fights or battles between gangs than a love series that would be the easy way out.His artistic style, although many will find it quite simple, I really liked it, is quite original and you can distinguish it from far away because it is original.In conclusion, I do recommend this series, it is an entertaining, simple series and I think you can have a great time watching it, I don't think it is or will be the best series you have ever seen but it is really good, it has its faults like any other series (a bit unreal at some point) but even so, knowing what it offers you seemed like something very good to me.Español.Al principio pensé que seria una serie para cumplir un fetiche del autor y aunque si puede llegar a ser así en verdad cambia esto para mostrarnos una historia bastante interesante, el concepto de la series es muy simple que pasaría si mediante un ritual le atrajeras a todas las chicas malas, si te pones a pensar esto es bastante raro un concepto que suena mas a un fetiche del autor que a una historia interesante y en verdad no es tanto así.

One I was very interested in. Rokudo\'s Bad girls is a bout a shy bullied kid who gets a harem, for want of a better term, of ""Bad girls"". Bad girls in this context referring to mostly delinquent girls. Whilst anticipating this series, I was hoping for a cast of main characters, particularly the titular girls, who were different from the typical waifu characters we normally get. Whilst the female cast are delightfully different, the plot ruins it by progressively removing each characters agency and removing the elements that made them interesting in...the first place.One of the main plot points for Rokudo\'s Bad Girls is that main character Rokudo has a magic ability that makes any Bad girl fall for him. Furthermore, Rokudo himself is keen on reforming each girl. Whilst in another, better handled story this could have been an intriguing plot point, but here it serves to remove most of the female casts agency. For example, the first ""Bad girl"" Rokudo wins over with his spell is Ranna. Ranna is physically very strong however after  being affected by Rokudo\'s magic she falls in love with him. After this point she loses most of her agency. She doesn\'t defend herself unless ordered. Even when physically threatened. She either says loving remarks to Rokudo or growls when she finally is allowed to fight and she never displays much independent thought or wishes until the very last episode.The other character fare slightly better and get some good moments.

Other characters, such as the vigilante biker girl also had promise but are dumbed down.One good point to the series is that the the story, whilst formulaic at first, picks up in the second half with the Onishima Union arc.

Every woman has been robbed of their agency once...they fall for Rokudo. While most of the characters are actually pretty interesting and have solid stories, it's hard to say for certain that if they've moved forward in life or if they're just under the spell.While the show seems like the setup for a harem, this too is undermined by the magic, as it is impossible to invest yourself in romance at any capacity when it's completely unwarranted. Thankfully the show drops any pretense of this immediately, and many characters stop displaying affection immediately. (Although it's possible this is out of fear of Ranna)I think the concept of the magic is completely unnecessary, as Rokudo IS a good person and capable of making impacts on everyone in the cast's life. I kept praying that the conclusion would involve some sort of reveal that the magic wasn't real (although this wouldn't make sense given the reactions of strangers to Rokudo), or that perhaps it would wear off and not matter, but alas.The female lead, Ranna, is also a baffling choice. She's by far the least developed, flattest character. While other characters have other things going on in their life (and some can even ultimately explain their interest in Rokudo beyond magic), Ranna is nothing more than a gag- an ultraviolent stoic tank who becomes incredibly girly and shy and dedicated to Rokudo at the flip of a switch. Even in the finale she seems to have no agency or character, so it's baffling she is framed as Rokudo's primary interest.At other times she's a macguffin or a deus ex machina, an unstoppable superweapon and the primary thing stopping Rokudo from turning into pavement paste when he involves himself in gang affairs.I think it would have been much more interesting I think to make Ranna's interest in Rokudo organic, and then have her get mixed up in gang affairs as normal, leading to Rokudo coming in contact with the cast he is dedicated to reforming. they fall for Rokudo.

That means the story was good enough to be published in spite of it."" However Rokudo is another show proving that wrong, with a story, characters, and animation quality as poor as its art.Fundamentally Rokudo begins with a problem. The premise is that our titular lead gains an ability to make delinquent or otherwise ""bad"" girls fall in love with him. It\'s explicitly shown early on that this is just hypnosis and the girls have no control in the matter. Rokudo hates violence, and the plot of the show...is how he leads these girls into healthy, normal school lives because they will listen to him as his love slaves. This renders all character arcs pointless, as who cares what he can convince a hypnotized servant to do. There\'s no resistance because they\'re instantly subservient, and the change isn\'t real or meaningful because they\'re hypnotized. How could character development be interesting when it\'s all fake, unless we rely on that betrayal for drama? And while the narrative does seem to plan to eventually cover that, it\'s annoyingly clear the final message will be ""he just found the good that was inside you all along"" which is BORING and BAD WRITING.Even if the character arcs were convincing, why would I want to watch outgoing, dynamic characters be sanded down into subservient innocents? It\'s just not a compelling narrative on any level, especially with the lack of nuance or creativity that this series comes with. I can only assume the creator has a love of either hypnosis or breaking women into waifus, but it seems like a mistake to assume that\'s a common desire. I\'d much rather watch bad girls be outgoing and large characters...though not these girls. From an emotionless, mostly silent sukeban, a strong loli, a gyaru in only the most basic and debatable ways, a do good cop boot licker, a cross dresser, and more, these girls aren\'t desirable in any form, good or bad. This is truly a harem of the weakest written girls obsessing over a lame guy even by self insert harem standards, and his equally uninteresting friends. I complained about making dynamic characters bad by hypnosis, but it\'s all theoretical because these were never particularly compelling characters to begin with. And then I cannot overstate how unattractive and cheap the art is, between about five times as much eyeliner as any girl needs, ugly attempts at spiked and styled hair, and just a general list of design archetypes in anime but done worse than average. Add that the art itself is ill-proportioned and incorrect, and I can\'t even space out by looking at the art. It\'s a poorly written show with bad concepts and ugly art, truly nothing helps redeem the weaknesses of Rokudo. Coupled with Gen Satou\'s screaming performance feeling particularly annoying because it accompanies bad character writing, and confusion why seiyuu legend Akira Ishida is playing the comedy fat sidekick friend, the audio does no favors either. Truly just one strike after another.Maybe it\'s mean to go after Rokudo. It was clearly going to be a weaker show from the initial premise and designs, I can\'t think of anything short of abandoning it\'s core pieces that would have saved it. But it still got greenlit by manga editorial staff and then picked up by an anime studio.

Our dork protagonist luckily realises that’s pretty fucked up so in order to break the love spell he tries his dorkiest to turn his growing harem of bad girls into respectable good girls.Whilst I like the premise the execution needs work. There always seems to be a large negative that outweighs the amine’s positive points. An example is the art...style. I think I would like the art style overall if the animation wasn’t holding it back. Simplistic art styles need good animation to sell but Rokudo's Bad Girls doesn’t deliver. Another example is our dork of a protagonist. I do not like the trope of a kid getting beaten black and blue so bad he should be dead from a brain bleeding but he won’t fight back because he's either too much of a wimp or he's too nice at the best of times, but it happens every episode and by episode four I had lost patience with him.However, it's not all bad. I don’t particularly like the main dork and his friends, but I like the supporting cast. Himawari’s switching between lovesick puppy and combat gorilla is very entertaining, Iinuma is fun to watch, and as much as I am not as fond of her Osanasa has a fairly good arc by the end of episode four. Also, the character designs themselves are great.The pacing is all over the place, the jokes don’t land particularly well, and the art and animation are questionable, but I enjoyed some elements of Rokudo's Bad Girls. However, there are reasons I dropped Tokyo Revengers out of frustration. Rokudo’s Bad Girls feels like a combination and amplification of Tokyo Revenger’s most annoying traits… minus the time travel because there is none.4/10 Disappointment style.

He is the type of character that makes me question if anyone that annoying exists. He is completely not relatable and incredibly dumb because all his actions make little to no sense. He is basically Takemichi from Tokyo Revengers if his intelligence dropped by 100 IQ and if he was actually a kid mentally. He just does whatever he believes and it all works out because he has an OP girl who likes him.What annoys me, even more, is how fast the characters just change...and conform to the MC's beliefs almost instantly. No real character depth or development that is well-written. So, this somewhat interesting story with potential is thrown completely in the gutter with terrible story-telling and progression and the worst type of MC.The animation style is also not my cup of tea, but that would be bearable if it was well-written and an actual good anime. It isn't terrible but it isn't good for a fighting style animation. It's like watching fighting scenes at 15 fps. So you can't even enjoy this terrible anime's fight scenes or anything.

If the anime adaptation had come just before the advent of the abundance of similar shows like it, this show would have stood a chance. But as it stands, mangaka Yuuji Nakamura\'s completed series of Rokudou no Onna-tachi a.k.a Rokudo\'s Bad Girls, coming in at 233 chapters in 26 volumes that was serialised between June 2016 and April 2021, Satelight\'s anime adaptation being a chunk of change for the experience of selling the manga to anime-onlies, in my opinion, it\'s honestly too late of a call that it feels...arbitrary and contrived to take an old work/property and suddenly poise it onto the podium, only for it to get booed off the stage. It\'s honestly not bad...but it isn\'t great either.Everyone wants to experience a school life that is fulfilling and meaningful, right? And truer than not, it is most certainly the case with the MC, Rokudo Tousuke, along with his close clique of Colonel Masaru Hinomoto and Chief Kouta Kijima. The wish-fulfilment dream of a life that anybody so desires can come true, and in no doubt at all, it applies to the trio of physically weak and cowardly boys in a reality that hits harder than most, for their school, Amori High, is a delinquent/gangster wasteland of a place that knows of no peace. With this peace that sounds easy on the ears being the hardest and most out of reach, the desperation of the trio got to the point of wanting to find a way out of this rut, and it landed squarely on a mysterious package from his long-deceased grandfather. Inside the package, are a priest\'s uniform and a mysterious scroll that has been passed down for generations since the Heian period and is said to hold a technique to ward off demons and evil spirits. Thinking that this will be the end to all of their troubles, Rokudo undergoes the ritual to activate the scroll\'s power, which, when implanted on him, showcases a pentagram on his forehead, and nothing else. The effect of the scroll is not apparent from the start since it doesn\'t give Rokudo any powers, but it soon becomes perceptible that the spell within the scroll, which was used to exorcise demons back in the day, now becomes a power that harem fans would\'ve loved...but in an obscene way, since it only attracts bad girls once eye contact is made. Sensing the potential of this power, the peace-loving Nakama friendship can finally be realised, though at the expense of bad girls chasing after Rokudo\'s butt as the latter vows to be strong in the process.Each girl that Rokudo meets, whether coincidentally or naturally, has an issue/problem to be resolved. Take the main girl, Ranna Himawari, for example. For one, Ranna holds the distinction of being a notorious Sukeban a.k.a delinquent girl leader wielding a sword, someone who is described as a ""monster"" because of her sheer strength and brutality, for her otherwise expressionless self who does not speak much. It\'s only because of Rokudo\'s power that her cold-blooded, stone-cold, and closed heart begins to break, showing off that Ranna is just like a typical girl, who wants to spend her life and time with others and protect them as she sees fit, if one gets to know her in depth. But as is the main story and plot, Rokudo\'s world is rocked by delinquents left and right, be it from gangs or even his closest classmates through Haruya Iinuma and his gal Tsubaki.Like Ranna, every girl down the line will face the same situation: once they make eye contact with Rokudo, they will see the lovable dork, chase after him, and fight to the death to be his one and only partner of choice. Aside from the fact that all of the girls that Rokudo chances upon have their names referenced to actual flowers (translated from Japanese), Rokudo is essentially a good dude in heart, and like any other good friend, he helps rehabilitate most of the girls both in school and society, with the causal effect being either genuinely falling in love with him or becoming a close ally. Initially, his refusal to fight in the beginning of the story has him labelled as a pipsqueak, but thereafter, the tenacity and dismissal to run away garner respect, even from his former bullies. It shows that there can be good within the bad, and I admire Rokudo\'s heart to turn situations of grievous hurt into communication and reconciliation. With the power of friendship with the Colonel and Chief, the trio are a bunch of people that put forth their troubles together to accomplish a common goal, and that move spurs them on as they get more support from progressing bad delinquent girls, like Amori High\'s shortie bancho Sayuri Osanada and the motorcycle girl of the police-like righteous belief of Azami Himeno. Regardless, this is still an ""unintentional"" harem work of sorts, and it\'s still pretty much plastered in your face, whether you like it or not, and that would be pretty much the manga\'s selling point of a weakling being roughed up by ""nurtured"" bad girls to the point of love, romance, and friendship. It\'s reinventing the harem genre at a time when the concept feels fresh, but nowadays, it\'s nothing more than a stigma of being the beta rather than the alpha.Satelight\'s adaptation of the manga...to be honest, feels very rough to the eyes. Just imagine if your staff team has these people: a character designer, a sub-character designer, a mechanical designer, and a prop designer. That\'s so many designers for a show that does not need this many to begin with. It feels a heft undercooked that there are so many people that are called onto the team, mostly for assistance, because it is very clear that debut director Keiya Saito and his staff team are the bunch of people that you\'ll only see in B or C-grade shows that deliver to the expectations of the top brass at the mercy of producers just wanting to go and get by life having another area of work to do, because humans need work to be sufficient. I already had low expectations of the manga, to be honest, because it was a matter of timing and preference to capitalise on the anime only now, for whatever reasons. For one, Rokudo\'s character design looks like a wank in comparison to his manga counterpart, which, at least thanks to the illustration, has some detail on it. With the anime, all that is lost in translation, being hammered by an overall B or C-grade team whose work is just enough to provide a bowl of rice for another day.The music is subpar as well. Even though this is EverdreaM\'s debut Anisong, which is the Seiyuu rock vocal unit of Misato Matsuoka and Hitomi Sekine, the song doesn\'t inspire much and just feels like a song that beckons you to immediately click the ""Skip Intro"" button. Furthermore, I am not a fan of EXILE TRIBE\'s songs, which have this urban, contemporary hip-hop rockability sound that\'s exclusive to Avex Pictures, and pretty much my feelings about The Rampage\'s ED are the same when it comes to the boy band.If Rokudo no Onna-tachi was found by some anime producer years back when the anime had just been serialising for a year or two at that point, the anime could\'ve been a moderate success at the time when we were all about Isekai Smartphone (the initial Season 1) and its ludicrious Nakama harem, so much so that it\'s a guilty pleasure that\'s good. But this is 2023, not 2017-2018, and whoever thought that it\'d be good to release the anime now, it\'s clearly an afterthought that bears no weight when all is said and done. In the current era where works like Kanojo, Okarimshimasu a.k.a Rent-A-Girlfriend exists to sour the audience more with salt, this show could\'ve leveraged being different in a unique way. However, it\'s lacklustre and stringed-out story (which is supposed to be for the good) backfired it from being a decent, if not average show, which I got bored fast.If you absolutely need the hijinks of a gang-laden ride, this is not the show for you, much less the ""harem\'s at stake"" plotline.

There are better harem shows out there, and this can easily be skipped and whizzed past into forgotten memory.', ""Rokudou's bad girls.....Funny how bad this anime is, so.....Story:Pros: The only pro around here was seeing the protagonist from getting his ass constantly getting kicked by first bully to becoming this ladies man who can get any bad girls fall for him, and have the same bad girls protect him, but......Cons: He just have to play this boring good guy card to which he could've rule the school and put an ends to bullying, using a talisman that his granddad gave him, Too bad that he has to be this guy who can but doesn't do it.Verdict: 3 over 10....Art:Pros: Nothing to mention, cuz....Cons: Everything were shit, the main girl Rana looks like a MILF, in fact there were too many MILF like female characters around here.Verdict: 3 over 10.Character:Pros: Nothing good to mentioned.Cons: First of all we have the protagonist who has inherited a charm from his granddad that allows him to make any bad girl fall for him, in fact the Badder they are the more they'll fall for the guy, we have his 2 other lackies whom were part of the wussy squad like Colonel who IMAO is supposed to be better off as a bully and Chief who should be doing adult roles.Verdict 3 over 10.Enjoyment:Pros: the only enjoyment here was letting the protagonist get his ass kicked even though he can summoned bad girls to do the dirty job for him.Cons: It was still lame.Verdict: 3 over 10.Overall:Verdict 3 over 10This was just bad.

It\'s basically a generic harem anime but with a twist, just a gentle twist. Other than that story is pretty much as you expect it, weak guy gets ""strong"" and he decides to use it for good of course while at the same time being mortally afraid of touching female body while having a harem. Why this fantasy exists in Japanese culture is beyond me but it lacks logic and is at this point boring and annoying because we can fully expect nothing to happen...by the end of the season.Characters on the other hand are just okay, with the exception of most annoying one: main character. If screaming and crying was a sport our main character would be a top level athlete in this world. Combine that trait with usual wimpiness of harem MC and you got yourself a winning combination in this show\'s eyes. If plot wasn\'t so predictable it would have been worth a watch but we all know this is not going to go anywhere past adding more females to his harem. by the end of the season.Characters on the other hand are just okay, with the exception of most annoying one: main character.

Yet another anime that drives itself through wish-fulfillment territory, playing on the idea that meek and wimpy nerd men who get bullied all the time can end up being at the top of the social ladder. Even worse than just that concept though, is the show\'s central plot hook about how every ""bad girl"" that the meek nerd protagonist is attracted to will not only fall immediately in total love with him (via some kind of spell that is completely arbitrary and dropped from conversation as soon as the first episode is over) but will also come to...his defense against the bullies.

Shi Xiong,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30412/Shi_Xiong,"['Although subject to debate, this anime was one of the main influential works in recent developments in Chinese young-adult animation. On the original airing platform of Tencent, the series quickly rose to prominence, which was quite rare to see around that time given the sheer number of well-developed Japanese animations that are on that site. So, I guess for Chinese viewers it has a bit of historical significance.Shi Xiong is, at heart, a humorous parody, meant to poke fun at certain qualities of modern Chinese society and the state of the world as a whole. The main character makes up for his lack of character...development with his witty internal monologue, which drips with sarcasm at the end of every second sentence. Given how his cell phone ring tone is ""your grandson is calling you"", it comes as no surprise that he has quite a definitive personality.The ""zombie"" construct is a pretty common one (though perhaps not ones that attend anime conventions and mutate from cannibalism), as is idea of the overpowering antagonist who never seems to die. The story follows the general zombie apocalypse archetype wherein the protagonist tries to survive and save as many people as possible. However, the author does put an interesting spin on everything that does happen - which is often very, very random - so overall the plot remains reasonably exciting. After all, it\'s not every day that you see a zombie with an obsession with paper currency.Overall, the quality of illustration is average (still better than most of these current horrendous modern Chinese kids cartoons though, so I guess it was expected given the historical background). The first episode is in a completely different style from the others, so maybe watch the second one if you want an idea of what the art is generally like. I do happen to really like the voice actors though, especially the male lead. He plays the part quite well and adds quite a bit of liveliness to the whole dreary backdrop.One thing I\'ve noticed about this recent wave of Chinese anime is that they tend to end seasons abruptly at weird places, and Shi Xiong is, unfortunately, no exception. There is a second season of this (which ends at an even weirder spot) that happens to have pretty awkward pacing and is overall a huge disappointment. The conclusion we can draw from this is that, if you\'re going to watch this series, don\'t get too invested in it.Overall, Shi Xiong is a fun series that makes you question the author\'s sense of moral decency sometimes (some jokes are inappropriate enough that they are now deleted from the online manga due to Chinese government censorship). It\'s definitely worth watching if you happen to like gore, cute kids dressed as giraffes, damsels in distress, internet language, and middle aged drag queens. development with his witty internal monologue, which drips with sarcasm at the end of every second sentence.

Xiaofei is the protagonist of a satire, parodical zombie donghua that picks at the western and eastern apocalyptic medium. His purpose is to make it out of H City safely to reunite with his concerned Mother; However, the government quarantines Xiaofei and other helpless people inside H City forcing them to fend for themselves, will Xiaofei manage to sneak out safely or will the ever-evolving intelligent zombies capture him.Story & Characters: 4/10The story starts off atypical of eastern apocalypic media...with pathogen-contaminated water consumed by humans. The events also follow suit of a main character finding his/her way out of the apocalypse's ground zero; However, Shi Xiong does it very differently. The story events have twists that reference franchises like Pokemon, Naruto, Bleach, Fairytail, The Walking Dead, Train to Busan etc. which was a nice touch in the beginning but gradually became the go-to method to pause the plot development. The characters are a bit interesting with personalities involving a homoerotic author, policewoman, abandoned child and many others. Shi Xiong makes some good effort in maintaining a character palette but it still feels like the characters are somewhat disposable and die for illogical reasons.Art & Sound: 3/10The first season art and animation was atrocious to watch even for a low budget donghua, it makes sense since it was released in 2015. However, it is the art that made it a very distracting experience; I assume this was intentional considering the satirical nature and budget related constraints the studio behind this show wanted to adhere. The character designs are very artificially like even more so as a 2D animation. Overall, not impressed with the visuals of this series first season as it discouraged suspense in a lot of scenery and angles/shots.I am not surprised with the sound either; Most of the time the sound doesn't suit the atmosphere. The sound quality itself is fairly decent for a small time 2015 donghua but there was a lot of background noise or reverberation that made it sound cheaply mixed. Especially Xiaofei's dialogue considering the series is filled with 90% of his monologue and char dialogue.Overall & Enjoyment: 4/10This season could have been better developed if it didn't use gag references to other franchises while it gets serious. A lot of characters could have remained in the story because of their out-of-touch and engaging personalities. The scenery could have also been created more porportionately as many different angles distorted the details of the scenery/background especially during the weeb crowd event.

Sengoku Collection,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12611/Sengoku_Collection,"[""Despite some decent sales and a large number of fan art in pixiv of Sengoku Collection, this little show has gone relatively unnoticed. Practically no advertisement,  unappealing art, and other shows taking the spotlight and it isn't too much of a surprise. That said I'd still like to make a decent review for people who might want to try it out.The show is overall mediocre. One of the main problems of Sengoku Collection is that it lacks any appealing or interesting plot. Sengoku warlords come to our world; they live their lives, some wish to stay while others want go back to the old...world, like Oda Nobunaga. A good concept lies here but it is not executed well. Each episode is centers around a Sengoku-period warlord and each episode deals with said character's problem and how they cope with their new life. The problem is that the episodes are very loosely related to each other nor do they serve much semblance to main story, leaving the viewer with a show that is practically just slice-of-life. And really, some people might be fine with that, but why even attempt a main plot when you choose to not properly work on it? There is a certain nagging feeling once you finish the show that tells you this show could have been much more.The episodes and characters themselves are problematic as well. Some of the episodes are fantastic, some are mediocre, and some are just plain awful and a chore to go through. The good thing is that you might find a jewel of an episode you love while going through the muck; but you have to go through that said muck. The same can be said of the characters, some of which are horribly written and have so little relevance to their Sengoku image that they might as well not have been a Sengoku expy at all, while others are created with good thought and creativity.You may notice a number of parodies throughout the show as this was the little gimmick the show tries to play out. Probably something a lot of people will recognize is the Bowling for Columbine parody, one of the fewer funny and good episodes of the series. A lot of the parodies however are Japanese-related media so the average English viewer most likely will not get references.It probably doesn't need to be said that the animation and art is pretty low-tier. Just look at Kanetsugu Naoe's face and tell me you can actually take that seriously. It's even noticeable that in some episodes the production values and art drastically drop. Expect harsh disappointment for those who need grand visuals to keep you entertained.The music is fair and good in most regards. Dependent on the episode and parodies the music will have different styles and ensemble, and diversity is always a good thing. If you bother with the character songs that are still being released, they are pretty standard J-pop.Overall, Sengoku Collection is just average. There are episodes you will love and episodes that will having you sleeping from boredom. With poor visuals it makes it hard for an average viewer to be interested in finishing the whole 26 episodes. It really isn't something I can recommend to someone that doesn't have free time to spend. world, like Oda Nobunaga. A good concept lies here but it is not executed well.

They do this not by fighting, but by being extremely eccentric.Each episode focuses on one character who is usually not seen again after that, but they are all complete stories, so this is not really an issue.There is an overarching plot, but it's sort of in the background for the most part.Sengoku collection is full of yuri, so steer clear if you don't like that.

Sengoku Collection goes through MANY genre changes depending on the Sengoku girl that it\'s focusing on the episode, whether it be shounen, mystery, ""horror"", shoujo ai, idol, sci-fi and even space adventure, however how they present and execute it is rather lackluster and is only means to give the Sengoku girl at hand something to do.In terms of characters, considering the HUGE cast, almost 3/4\'s of the cast get at best one episode...tops for thier episode focus, the only characters that matter in terms of a narrative focus for LA at least were Oda Nobunaga voiced by Rumi Ookubo (Oda Nobunaga coming into other character\'s end scenes to collect their secret treasure so occasionally appears here and there), Masamune Date voiced by Ayumi Tsunematsu and Mitsuhide Akechi voiced by Yoko Hisaka and all three get three episodes at best for thier story ""arc"". In terms of character development, the episodic nature of the anime can either give most of the charcacters stock cliches tropes or genre-fueled tropes for the Sengoku girls at hand and because of that, their character development especially the characters given one or two episodes worth of ""development"" is miniscule at best thus making those Sengoku girls\' prescences feel rather worthless and filler.LA\'s favourite episodes of this anime were Episode 18, 19, 20 and 22 by the way and LA has some guilty pleasure towards Episode 23 for it\'s creative take on a documentary narrative through a kindergarten\'s sandbox takeover. On the side of the spectrum LA got quickly bored of epsiodes 2, 7, 12 and 21. The only 2 episodes LA thought was in middle of all this was Episode 13 and 16.In terms of animation by Brain\'s Base, the animation has inconstistency concerning the character designs clashing with the background, as the background animation is very detailed using bright pastel and watercolored background work (special note goes to Episode 18 making it look like a depressing children\'s book style) that clashes heavily with the traditional yet equally bright character designs (with facial and character animation derps abound), LA would praise Brain\'s Base doing something unique using the background animation but equally fault them for having inconsistent character designs, animation errors (Exception goes to Masamune Date\'s character design as it fits with her with no animation errors either) and to be frank when there are battles between the Sengoku girls or battle scenes in general feel janky and stiff, the animation overall is inconsistent at best, lazy at worst.In terms of voice acting, considering the vast cast list, LA will give it that there are some level of ""squeak"" in the voice cast. But aside from that major props for voice acting goes to Rumi Ookubo as Oda Nobunaga (playing up the abrasive and slight tsundere type), Ayumi Tsunemastu as Masamune Date  and Yoko Hisaka as Mitsuhide Akechi especially (as thier episodes were where LA gave any investment to characters in the series).The ending had the common decency to bring us something of what LA was expecting from this anime, ""Sengoku girls fighting it out with the slice of life tones to it"" and at least they gave something of a epilogue to the huge cast of characters EXCEPT Oda Nobunaga\'s main narrative plotline, essentially saying it\'s never gonna get resolved, at least giving us how the other Sengoku girls are is a slight bonus???...-sigh-.Sengoku Collection, well LA will say it again, a jack of all genres but master of none and LA WILL give anime some grace as it IS a slice of life anime with Sengoku girls as it\'s focus but outside of it\'s ""slice of life"" genre to be perfectly honest LA got bored of this series quickly as it had no narrative hook to keep LA interested with the ""one episode Sengoku girls"" being essentially worthless to the overall narrative of Oda Nobunaga or Masamune\'s.

There is very little real violence going on, the selling point of the show is the...comedy, which is nothing impressive but at least I giggled pretty frequently through the whole season.The art is all over the place with some characters looking like those horrid 2005 anime characters appearing to have downs syndrome but there are also opposite extremes with very stylish adult looks with high realism factor, I have no idea what in a bucket of soapy rubber ducks is going on with that but it sort of annoyed me a little. The sound is quite a lot better, in fact so good I can't find anything to complain about in the slightest!I spent a good while deciding between a 6 and a 7 for this show, it ultimately ended up with only a 6 but if you're just looking for something to make noise and pictures on your TV while you knit a scarf it's a good choice until you suddenly laugh and accidentally stab yourself. comedy, which is nothing impressive but at least I giggled pretty frequently through the whole season.The art is all over the place with some characters looking like those horrid 2005 anime characters appearing to have downs syndrome but there are also opposite extremes with very stylish adult looks with high realism factor, I have no idea what in a bucket of soapy rubber ducks is going on with that but it sort of annoyed me a little.

Kanokon Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4760/Kanokon_Specials,"[""What they couldn't show you on TV, they show here. Not that they didn't try to show that on TV anyway.The Kanokon DVD specials are essentially soft-core porn. They don't even try to disguise that point. The odd numbered specials are just various images of the female characters from the series set to music. And yes, you get to see them naked. The even numbered specials are little two minute scenes, mainly of Chizuru seducing and/or molesting Kouta, sometimes with Nozomu's assistance. They contain the typical bawdy humor found in the series, and are good for a laugh, so long as your not put off...by the explicit animated nudity.If there's one thing Kanokon does right, besides pushing the borders of what's allowable to air and sexually-loaded comedy, it's the artwork. The characters are drawn absolutely gorgeously, and the animation is incredibly smooth. Take special 4, for example: the scene is depicted as though shot by a camcorder, and the motion and intentional blur are done quite impressively.While there isn't much dialogue, all of it is done well, and the background music for the odd numbered specials is cheery without being overbearing.These specials know what they are, and they don't try to be anything else. It's good for a laugh or *ahem* visual stimulation from girls with a variety of body types (read: a full range of bust sizes, from flat as a board to excessively large), but for anything else, don't bother.Note: The place where I found the specials doesn't have them anymore. I don't know where to find them now. I'm sorry, but please stop asking me. by the explicit animated nudity.If there's one thing Kanokon does right, besides pushing the borders of what's allowable to air and sexually-loaded comedy, it's the artwork.

So the Specials gave me what I wanted to see. And I'm thankful for that.The story is almost totally absent. Kanokon Specials, basically, consists of 12 minisodes, with the average length of two minutes, and they contain short segments filled with eroticism. One of them, for instance, has Chizuru picking a Valentine Day's gift for Kouta, the other features mostly static images, and some other minisodes feature other characters, such...as Asahina or the twins, in provocative poses and situations.Yout get the gist: this is just pure fanservice, made for those who were unsatisfied by the amount of boobs in Kanokon. Being one of them, I liked this, even more than the show itself. On the other hand, if you didn't like Kanokon and don't care about ecchi scenes and nudity in it, you won't miss anything by avoiding this. as Asahina or the twins, in provocative poses and situations.Yout get the gist: this is just pure fanservice, made for those who were unsatisfied by the amount of boobs in Kanokon.

Kodai Ouja Kyouryuu King,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3576/Kodai_Ouja_Kyouryuu_King,"['I love this anime, I first watched this as a kid back in \'10 and I fell in love.This anime is kind of long but the ending is very satisfying.I however do recommend to only watch this if you like Dinosaurs or ""creature battle"" type anime because well... this is a Dinosaur anime.Personally I love Dinosaurs which is why I adore this anime. I even have some DK trading cards and I am expanding my collection of DK stuff.Overall in my opinion: Great anime, animations are great for \'08. Many different Dinosaurs and... it is just so fun to watch. ', ""This anime is underrated, it's a rare gem actually. This is the anime i loved since childhood, it is a mixture of fun, comedy, adventure, friendship, teamwork, knowledge and of course DINOSAURS!! All characters are fun and graphics of dinosaurs for such animation is amazing and unique. The concept of story are amazing  that includes time travel, future, past, aliens, robots, card based battles. elements and much more. I also liked the fact that despite being an anime for kids it gives knowledge about various places of world, dinosaurs and historical events to some extent. I really recommend to watch both seasons of this...masterpiece! masterpiece!"", 'Welcome to Digimon… I mean Dinosaur King. For real though, We have three protagonists… two guys and one girl, who find special cards one day and when they rub the card on a stone, it activates. Does this not sound like the D-readers and cards in Digimon Tamers, especially the two guys and a girl concept? And then we have the bad guys, the Alpha Gang who seem to be a rip off of Team Rocket from Pokemon. During the time that this came out, it feels like most shows were trying to mimic Pokemon and Digimon though I think this might have been the...first to put both into the mix.The characters are pretty annoying, and seem only like spitting images of three main types of Digimon Tamers… the children. We have your standard goggle wearing (or in this case, horn visor that seems to light up for some unknown reason?) leader who is over active and doesn’t know when to stop, Max. The more level headed boy who seems to actually think, Rex. And then we have the whiny little girl, Zoe.Let’s start with Max… well… He’s stupid. For a guy who is really into Dinosaurs, when he first meets Chomp the Triceratops, he doesn’t seem to have any clue what it eats. If you have ever watched Land Before Time, a Triceratops is also known as a three horn and is pretty much what Sarah is. For those playing the home game, they eat plants. I guess it makes sense that the guy who wears horns on his head all the time and is probably the laughing stock wherever he goes to school because of it would be the owner of a Dinosaur with horns. Still, he treats Chomp like a dog most of the time. He also came up with ‘Dino Slash’ which feels like a rip off of ‘Go Poke ball!’ On the other hand, like all main characters, he cares deeply for the dinosaurs that keep getting abused by the Alpha Gang and wants to help them.Rex is pretty smart, at least as smart as a character can be in here (That isn’t much by the way…). I’m surprised that he is so grown up since his father is exactly like Doc Taylor, the father of Max. I know characters are not all the same, but if you grow up in the same type of situation, you would at least be similar to the other person. Anyway, his Dino is Ace the Carnotaurus. Ace is kind of a speedy little guy who just does not want to stay put. In fact, basically all through the first part of the series, that was all Rex was dealing with. The problem I have with this is that when they finally figure out why, it’s not Rex finding out, it’s the whinny Zoe who does. It would have been a better way to bring Rex and Ace closer together if he found out himself.Rex and Max also have the same complex of who is the leader that any Digimon show has. They bicker about what the right way and the wrong way of doing things is, sometimes getting themselves into more problems. There really isn’t a reason for this fighting, it just happens. The show doesn’t even make me want to root for any of them to be the leader to be fair so the whole fight just seems pointless.Zoe seems to be a bit thrown to the side. She has a Parasaurolophus named Paris and how she got that name feels the same as someone calling a Panda Pan or a Tiger Tig… It’s just the first few letters of the Dino’s species. She normally only uses healing cards and has a rather gentle Dino instead of a fighting dino like the other two. In shows like this, they seem to always throw the women into that area… in Pokemon, Misty was a water Pokemon expert, and only water Pokemon it seems… in Digimon, the women were always getting pushed around or not seen very much (or they are given attitudes like they are always PMS-ing like the girl in Digimon Tamers). She may be considered a main character, but she just feels like support.Max’s father is a little odd. Somehow, he knows a lot about the stones the kids have right away, thinking that the thoughts of the dinosaurs are trapped within them. He seems to explain the stones like he knows exactly what they are used for and what can be done with them in the second half of the first episode. I see him somewhat like a clumsy Indiana Jones in a child’s cartoon, or maybe Professor Oak. His assistant, Dr. Reese Drake, is very monotoned and never really shows much emotion even when she is angry or embarrassed. Once in a great while at the end, she does seem to lighten up but other then that, no emotion. We could just have a computer instead of her and we wouldn’t be missing much. There doesn’t even seem to be much reaction between Zoe and Dr. Drake even though they are sisters which is rather sad. I would love to see more about their relationship instead of the whole ‘hey, she is my sister and you can probably forget about that because we are never going to show any emotion like normal sisters do.’Let’s talk about the villains now. Pretty much, Doctor Z would really be the father of Eggman with the outbursts and trying to take over the world lines. He wants to be king of the dinosaurs, and yet he can’t even take care of his own minions. His minion (and stepson), Ed, is so stupid, he doesn’t even know how to spell Z’s name for crying out loud! I most of the time want to call him Meoth and have him meow like him. Ursula always acts like the queen, commenting on her looks and acting as though she should be taken care off (Much like Jessie from Team Rocket). She also gets bitten a lot by dinos. Her stepbrother Zander seems to be like James in that he tries very much to make her feel good (And that isn’t in the perverted way).So, we can now talk about what a really stupid idea it was to make a Dinosaur Card Game for children who probably couldn’t pronounce the damn names of the Dinos! I mean, what child would know exactly how to pronounce Carnotaurus and Cryolophosaurus? I mean I can’t even pronounce them and I’m 26 (when I first reviewed this, I was 23)! Another thing that is rather strange is the fact that they brought in battle fields into the show about 9 episodes in. It is rather confusing since they were at first trying to make this show sound as though the dino’s were actually living breathing beings instead of just cards. Actually, again I am feeling like I have seen this before… in Yugioh.The 3D animation stuff they have in the opening is really bad. The models look very broken and dinosaurs were never meant to actually dance. They seem to flop around without any reason. It’s also the same in the actual show. Models brake pretty badly and feel as though they would be better animated then CG. The only thing they did right was showing the breathing of the dinos but that’s only a small bit for them to look ‘alive’ I guess. The textures on these modals are colorful but definitely not nice. It’s like they made the textures overly pixel-ated and choppy. The transformations make me want to yell out ‘DIGI EVOLUSION!’ because it acts pretty much the same. The 2D animation actually looks pretty good and the dinos in that form look cute too. So much that I might have wanted one as a partner too. They just really messed up by adding the 3D animation.Warning, it was 4kids dubbed and when people say that they messed up a lot of shows, they probably included this one in that. The voices of the main characters are really bad. Zander and Ursula sound so much like Team Rockets Jessie and James that I normally feel like I’m watching Pokémon instead. The stupid little puns they forced into the show feel like there are way too much. We can’t go five seconds without a pun it seems because everyone does them. The music is supposed to be upbeat and fun but it sounds like they were forcing it, it doesn’t fit this at all. I can’t really stand the opening song and the background music feels like it’s ripped from Sonic X.Overall, the whole show just seems rather pointless. If you’re a big fan of Dinosaurs, there might be something for you but I don’t see what you can get from it. The Dinos’s don’t look real at all, the coloring just feels like its overly bright and childish. I think the only thing you will get from it is the names of the dinos. first to put both into the mix.The characters are pretty annoying, and seem only like spitting images of three main types of Digimon Tamers… the children.

Usually this happens between six and seven years old and that\'s definitely who this anime was made for. I don\'t hate this anime, but unless you\'re a little kid I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to anyone. The reason I wanted to watch this anime was because I loved it as a kid, but I never finished it so I wanted to see how it ended.All of the action in this anime is watching dinosaurs fight, which I...know sounds great, but  the animation for these dinosaurs is so bad that they look like they\'re made of plastic and aren\'t even hurting each other. Furthermore, a lot of the dinosaurs in the show look alike i.e. some I can only tell apart because one\'s a different color than the other, I know all of the dinosaurs in the anime are based on actual dinosaurs but that shouldn\'t be an excuse. However, one thing that does give the anime a little variety is how there are different moves the dinosaurs can use i.e. some can shoot lighting and others can breathe fire.As for the story; the anime, at least season 1, is extremely episodical and every episode follows the same formula. The D-Team gets an alert that a new dinosaur card has appeared, they go to where the card is which can be anywhere on Earth, they fight the Alpha Gang who also want the card, the D-Team wins and walks away with the new card. However, the episodes do have some connection to each other. The grand question that kind of drags through the anime is ""where did the cards come from"" and of course it\'s one of those plot devices where you don\'t get an answer until the end of the anime.Season 2 is divided into about 5-episode long story arcs. I actually like Season 1 better than 2 because in Season 2 I feel like the story arcs just drag on way too much while at least in Season 1 every episode is self-contained. However, in Season 2 the plot gets a lot more complex which is good.As for the characters; the main characters, Max, Rex, and Zoey, have nothing unique about them! They\'re everything you\'re expecting; they\'re kind hearted, brave, selfless, and all they want to do is protect the dinosaurs. What I hate about them most is how the plot for a lot of episodes revolves around these little-kid problems they have i.e. in one episode Zoey didn\'t like the guy her older sister was dating and in another Rex\'s dinosaur partner Ace is afraid of water. My favorite characters are definitely the Alpha Gang. They remind me so much of Team Rocket from Pokemon; the Alpha Gang are some of the most incompetent villains ever! In every episode they always either get electrocuted, blown up, set on fire, or are victims of some kind of horrible accident and they never get the dinosaur card! I just love watching them fail over and over again! Also, I love how eccentric Max, Rex, and Zoey\'s parents are, ironically they don\'t get much screen time.Overall: Only watch this anime if you\'re a little kid and you love dinosaurs because this isn\'t a short anime that you can knock out in a few hours, it takes a while to go through every episode. Honestly, I\'m glad I\'m finally done with this anime, but I\'m happy I pushed through to the end because the ending was very satisfying.

However during watching the first episode I realized it would feel like a task instead of something I'd watch for enjoyment.The plot is just a Pokémon rip off. Some kids who find ''real dinosaurs'' and need to defeat the bad guys. There's no real depth or opportunity to further develop the plot.The idea of it is promising but it has been done so much better before.Leaving that aside the dinosaurs...are very poorly animated, the battles are boring and leave almost no room for variation.If anyone reading this knows a good anime about dinosaurs please let me know because i need to fill the void this show couldn't do are very poorly animated, the battles are boring and leave almost no room for variation.If anyone reading this knows a good anime about dinosaurs please let me know because i need to fill the void this show couldn't do"", ""Absolute banger status anime. It has it all: the intricate plotline, deep and memorable characters, sad moments, funny moments, badass dinosaur fight scenes. The story follows Max, a troubled young man trying to fit in with society, just like we all are. On a fateful day he meets his steed, a triceratops named Chomp. Along with his 2 friends: Zoe and Rex, and their respective partners: Paris and Ace (A pararaurolophus and a carnotaurus), they set out on a journey to capture all of the dinosaurs that have been misplaced in modern time. This journey would not be an easy one, as they would be...intercepted by the meandering evildoers known as the Alpha Gang. However, with the power of friendship anything is possible.The story delves deeply into the internal struggles that each character faces, and our understanding of them only increases as the story unfolds. The dichotomy between the Alpha Gang and our protagonists, is one that calls into question our understanding of morality. What does it mean to be evil? What does it mean to be good?

However, with the power of friendship anything is possible.The story delves deeply into the internal struggles that each character faces, and our understanding of them only increases as the story unfolds.

Being dubbed by 4kids would send people away usually, but actually sitting down and watching this really helped me to see that 4kids wasn't a BAD thing since it did bring a lot of anime to places where it isn't regularly around at that time and making good memories to look back on.This series is one of the good ones to look back on because the dialogue...is pretty good, you get to learn about dinosaurs that aren't brought up by other famous things, you get a reminder that this was a card game as well that fell under (like Chaotic), both uses of animation in it is good, and it has two seasons for you to sit through and when it's funny I hope you'll see it too. The ending is pretty typical for this kind of anime though and there are recurring jokes, one in particular that I fucking hate. Watch it or don't, this show is on Netflix and ready for anyone to view at other places available and I'm done. is pretty good, you get to learn about dinosaurs that aren't brought up by other famous things, you get a reminder that this was a card game as well that fell under (like Chaotic), both uses of animation in it is good, and it has two seasons for you to sit through and when it's funny I hope you'll see it too.

Each episode has its plot. Each episode follows the same blueprint; new dinosaur appears, go battle bad guys, defeat bad guys. The show gets repetitive very fast.

I would've enjoyed the show more if they had some sort of battle system.Characters: 6The characters are Max, Rex, and Zoe, they're pretty generic and nothing special.

Seikoku no Dragonar,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21033/Seikoku_no_Dragonar,"[""Over the last couple of years we've seen a steady stream of light novels being adapted to anime series and now we get yet another with this series, produced by C-Station a former offshoot of Bee Train Production Inc. and the overall result is a marginal failure.Anime is full of time honored clichés that never seem to die and Dragonar Academy is so packed full of them it shows just how void this show is of any creativity or imagination. Giant bouncing breasts on all women characters, naked magic girls showing up from nowhere and mood swinging tsundere characters are ripe and abound in this...series; it feels less like this is less of a story of it's own and more of a copy paste job from a few dozen other series of it's kind.Taking from probably equally lazy source material, the scripts written by Noboru Kimura are shoddy and thrown together with no thought or effort behind them.  The large cast of cookie cutter characters will bore you with just how uninspired they are.This kind of tripe is barely forgivable from a group of first time creators but the fact this comes from several long time animators who had once made excellent shows in the past with their old studio, before breaking away to form this new company, adds more insult to injury.Topping off the cliche storm is a number of soft-core moments between a nude dragon lady giving oral to a pseudo tentacle rape scene, you would think they'd rather be making a hentai series.Animation and art is just as awful with ugly looking dragons to top off the grossly exaggerated character designs. One would think with a show centered all around dragons it would be the one thing you could get right but the dragons look like a mix of generic fantasy dragons painted in pastels that makes them look like they're covered in hard water spots or they're wearing the projection clothes from the Count of Monte Cristo anime.Interestingly, half the time you won't see any dragons and it will be mostly focused on whatever lame slice-of-life scenarios ripped from every other show of it's kind.  Echo while being presented as a dragon is little more than a magical loli with some horns glued onto her head.The musical score was somewhat interesting and entertaining and might be the one redeemable factor but it's tie to this awful show doesn't make me enthusiastic to  to listen to it.  The theme songs are typical for a show like this, shoehorning in as many voice actors, who may or may not have any musical talent, as you can to sing an ear shrieking J-pop song to sell some more CDs,Dragonar Academy is uninspired, lazy and contrived. Beating down dead clichés that have saturated the market of the last couple years alone this would barely make the grade for a crappy one episode OVA, forget a 12 episode season.  I get the feeling even if you are looking for a silly fanservice show there are likely far more entertaining options out there that are less copy-and-paste than this show. series; it feels less like this is less of a story of it's own and more of a copy paste job from a few dozen other series of it's kind.Taking from probably equally lazy source material, the scripts written by Noboru Kimura are shoddy and thrown together with no thought or effort behind them.

I actually do enjoy harems to a degree but when you have an actual story first and then abandon it...1/3 of the way through, it can make you feel disapointed because of its wasted potential.That being said, the pacing felt fine and didn't feel slow or rushed barely at all.Art:I did enjoy the art, it had some interesting designs and the girl characters were cute. Although, the actual dragons in the show could have had something more in their designs but they're not at all completely bad.Sound:In my opinion, one of the best things in the entire show was the opening and ending themes. The opening was really good and showed some really cool scenes. The ending was cute and had a fun song which was a nice reward after going through each episode. The voice actors/actresses did a good job throught the show ( you know they wanted the villian to be mysterious and cool when they cast Dio Brando's voice actor )Character:Now this is where everything goes wrong. I thought most of the characters were paper-thin with nothing really going on with them. Some of the characters got character development while most just had no layers even if you thought they did. I also thought the villian was just bad and i wish we had gotten more depth to the character but unfortuantly we didn't.Enjoyment:Here's the weird part; i actually really enjoyed it. I got the same enjoyment as I would watching any harem. Even though I had so much problems with it, i actually looked foward to watching more. If you enjoy harem/ecchi shows i think you would actually enjoy this even though it has many flaws.Overall:With the potential I thought it had at the beginning being destroyed as time went on, after watching the whole thing I feel disappointed. However like I said, if you enjoy harems and ecchi anime then by all means watch this one. But I don't think that this will be a very rememberable one with its very plain characters and interesting story it mostly abandoned.

I liked the story and its concept, though halfway through the show, it became a bit too predictable. Though I really enjoyed certain parts, I also found myself wanting to fast forward others.Art & Sound: 7I grouped these two together because I felt like they complimented each other in this anime. The art was pretty good and consistent throughout the show, which is important. No particular sound stood out for me, but I did feel...like the bgm (background music) in the battle scenes intensified the character\'s moves and passion.Character: 7The characters were good. Nothing more, nothing less. There weren\'t any exceptional or very outstanding and original traits between them, but they were good. The show had the usual harem girls, for example: a busty one, a rich one, a loli, a tsundere, and an erotic teacher etc. There were a few more, but that was the gist of it.Enjoyment & Overall: 7I did enjoy the show quite a bit, but it didn\'t really strike me as exceptional, partly because I have watched hundreds of similar anime and so I\'ve kind of gotten used to all the recurring things in harem anime. The characters were alright, but neither them nor the story were able to pique my interest past the point of amusement. like the bgm (background music) in the battle scenes intensified the character\'s moves and passion.Character: 7The characters were good.

If there\'s something like a huge basketball ring in front of you, larger than the usual and there\'s a normal basketball ball in your front. You can\'t definitely miss from close range, can you? That\'s how I can picture a perfect analogy to the premise of Seikoku no Dragonar. But in this case, we are left wondering how Seikoku no Dragonar missed a blatant open chance for winning its potential.***************************************************************************Story...I gave it a 6, honestly. Sometimes, even the most generic story can achieve better heights if given a thoroughly direction. But yet again, ruing their chances is this particular series. The story...itself is solid. With a fantasy setting, the variable factors that can be used were supposed to be almost unlimited. But why? Why did Seikoku no Dragonar limited themselves to such product?Blaming the storyboards and the director must be a vain thing to do. Why? Because from what I saw, the director had very good series to his helm, so the last definite thing that could\'ve dragged Dragonar to the bottom must be, yeah, the reference material.***************************************************************************Art...A beautiful realm was presented, with fictional beauty that is out of this world. I can easily point this out as a standout in terms of the drawings. Whether it be character designs or the setting world, it was consistently beautiful. There\'s nothing to doubt that the art department definitely wins a deserving 10, isn\'t it?***************************************************************************Sound...6, I guess... Something inside me just made me skipped the OP and ED successively whilst watching in marathon since I didn\'t enjoyed the theme songs. The BGM(s) were also quite bland in my opinion. So a 6 makes perfect sense...***************************************************************************Character(s)...This is where they got nastily messy. I am no reader of the reference, but if the anime makers had been thoroughly confused on the characters, then I can find the salvation to pardon them.Most of the characters were so... plainly bland boring... No one is even interesting at the slightest. Eco, the generic loli and Silvia, the voluptuous princess as tsunderes failed to materialize the true charm of their characters. Neither the supporting casts, including the smexy maids or the student extras in the background had even made a scene worth praising. All is played by the point of ""seduce the men"" and ""show your booty and tits for fanservice\'s sake"".Now, focal character, Ash Blake. Is he decent? Maybe, to some, I guess. I suppose I\'ve outgrown his types, but frankly, he did a fair job as MC. Started out simply as an outcast then gaining new powers, he played the MC well. But in the end, he is not interesting. That\'s the point in appreciating the MC, right? Whether he/she is interesting, it all comes down to this focal issue. And this is where Dragonar failed miserably. The ability to make the MC interesting, is the least they should\'ve done keenly.We go to their adversaries faction. Do anybody stroke as interesting? The answer yet again, is a big ""no."" There\'s really little point in delving too much on the characters since Dragonar had utterly failed on this aspect.***************************************************************************Enjoyment and Overall...Nothing except for a 3. Was it too harsh? No, I guess not. Enjoyment was scarce but I\'ll tell you, even most of the fanservice scenes didn\'t inject a life to my watching interest. I guess all my laughs whilst watching is part where I am in absolute confusion as to why I even thought of watching a series that I already foresaw would be bland and boring. My thoughts were in jumble whether to drop it by episode 06, but I won\'t lie. I am a die-hard fanatic of Koyasu Takehito and even his most utter craps is something I\'ve watched.So concluding. Dragonar might be a winner in terms of sales. But in terms of worthiness(money and time watching), it\'s not. It\'s like paying a gold bar in exchange for a single bad-tasting moldy bread, leaving you feeling ripped afterwards the entire running time.But like I said, Dragonar is directly oriented to booty-and-tits- lovers.

I even feel I was too generous with my rating.I would only recommend this anime if you are very bored and want a lot of random fanservice (tentacles included), because I doubt you will watch it for either the characters or story, but that is up...to you to decide. to you to decide.', 'In an amazing world filled with magic, we are introduced to the world of the great Dragons. Dragons as far as the eye can see, and tsundre lollis, wait i thought this was Seikoku no Dragonar and not Toradora?Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is a brief review of what to expect from another mediocre anime that doesn\'t know what it wants to be.Let\'s start with an overview:We are following our main male protagonist, a young sixteen year old boy Ash Blake. Ash Blake is your typical young male with a problem, he is the only one in his school who has yet...to acquire a dragon of any form. While his comrades all have majestically grown dragons. This proves to be quite a problem as he gets teased and bullied over his yet-to-exist dragonkin, and hence he get\'s the name of ""Problem Child"", because who wouldn\'t get mad and beat up people for not having a dragon? Yet as not having his own dragon, he has an ability; to ride any dragon he wants, and be perfect at it.(OVERPOWERED MAIN CHARACTER INCOMING?).A new year has started and the first class lessons is dragon fight, Ash has to borrow a friends Dragon and accidentally pushes into a female and her dragon, the beautiful female princess Silvia Lautreamont. In a heated discussion with ""shots being fired"" at each other, they agree to settle their difference in an upcoming festival\'s race. Some time in the race the dragon of Ash\'s friend gets exhausted in a forest, Ash suddenly feels a uncomfortable feeling and decides to check it out. After a short walk he finds a mysterious man with a phantom of the opera mask on his face. The man is our main villain and is nothing out of the ordinary. The man tells his underling to fight the young boy after analyzing his potential as a dragon-master. The battle is short and the underling get\'s thrown off a cliff. Ash\'s hero senses start to tingle and he knows he have to save her, by the time he manages somehow to grab her arm, the sides have changed. The young girl switches sides with our young protagonist and Ash is falling to his doom. But not for long!! A mysterious glow on his arm appears, and Ash knows, this is his dragon appearing before him. And who would have thought, that his dragon is a super overpowered machine of lollies thrown to the story for no reason, except to imitate Toradoras - Asaika Taiga. Yes, i said it.Characters:Huff, where to begin? This anime has major problems with where it wants to go. Fantasy, ecchi, tsundre? WHERE? Let me spit it right out, the anime\'s characters are bland and bring nor nothing new, nor anything worthwhile watching. Main Characters are basically copies of the main characters of Toradora.....Ash Blake is a normal guy, with surreal powers that he gets for no good reason really, except for meeting a overpowered dragon empress inside a forest when he was small(what animes has this happened in before? oh like 10 of em). He is your ""I am a badass"" and ""I Try to be cool and kind hearted"" type of character which brings no flavor to the anime, and get\'s boring to watch. The Tsundre, is tsundre, just like any ""original anime"" we get introduced to a little girl who falls in love with his master, but can\'t really tell him that, so she pushes him around calling herself his master. The other characters have no story or at least one good enough to enjoy the series, as the most of them are just big boobed bimboes with dragons.Animations and Sound:This is where we the anime exceeds imo, the art is fantastic. The dragons, armors and the characters themselves are well designed, but still have something missing to them, which i to date can\'t really put my finger on. And the great arts spring is even better looking with the awesome classical type soundtrack which you normally would find in any good fantasy series. I could easily download the tracks and enjoy them for many hours, so on that front there are really no problems!Overall:This anime leaves much to be desired.  it has a good animation design and soundtrack that has little flaws, countered by a failed attempt on genre\'s that in my opinion does not go well. It starts of as a pretty typical and not that bad of a fantasy anime, but it develops into this monstrous tentacle hentai wannabee.(Yes there are a lot of tentacles action that fondle them triple D\'sized cups that all girls in this anime have).I guess i was thrown of the chair, not that I don\'t enjoy some fan service, I just found it unappealing in what could have been a not so bad anime. The characters are straight bland, and the series tries to much to be like Toradora and Zero no Tsukaima(which are FANTASTIC), and pretty much leaves you hanging and loathing for more. Maybe a rich backstory and less fan service, could have been the justice this fantasy anime needed.All in all, I give this anime a 4/10. With a disappointing and almost non existent plot, the art and sound was top notch, but not enough to carry a whole bunch of pathetic characters to a form for any glory.This is my first review, and hope you guys enjoyed it. All form for criticism is welcomed with a good embrace. to acquire a dragon of any form. While his comrades all have majestically grown dragons.

Maybe a rich backstory and less fan service, could have been the justice this fantasy anime needed.All in all, I give this anime a 4/10. With a disappointing and almost non existent plot, the art and sound was top notch, but not enough to carry a whole bunch of pathetic characters to a form for any glory.This is my first review, and hope you guys enjoyed it. All form for criticism is welcomed with a good embrace.', 'All I have to say is... wow. Simply, wow.The show had much potential, but halfway through the series, the directors realized that not everything from the LN could fit within a 12 episode series.Too bad.Initially, the story was great. A male lead with a hidden power, a cute heroine, a equally as cute ""main chick"" for the lead... and all set within the school setting. It had great potential. Unfortunately, with the introduction of flat characters and a story filled with plot holes, the quintessential (to me at least) anime quickly fell apart.I swear man, the ending did not leave me...satisfied. Did Sylvia actually find out it was.... hmm. I seem to have forgotten the MC\'s name. That\'s funny, since I just finished watching the series 30 mins ago.Or the other really infuriating plot hole of Anya\'s sister not recognizing her. Seriously? She\'s the only other dark female in the entire world! She was right in front of you! Dammit!The only thing OK with the series was the art, and even then, the quality of the breasts were of lesser quality than even some of the worst hentais!!Geez... satisfied.

However this story seems better told in words than animation, given its almost cliche cut-and-paste nature. It\'s the standard ""magic knight saves princess"" story with an ecchi direction. Possibly enjoyable for those looking for this kind of genre  but unimpressive.Art: The art style was somewhat simple with the shading almost exclusively reserved for blushes and cleavage. It was easy on the eyes but lackluster.Sound: 12 episode harem fantasy  doesn\'t have dramatic soundtrack, so the main focus is OP/ED. I found Sakakibara Yui\'s OP...catchy but her distinctive style of singing isn\'t for everyone. The ED was cute but it seemed more appropriate for a purely slice-of-life show. Looking at the soundtrack as a whole, it delivered for the type of magic harem shenanigans the show was aiming for. It wasn\'t superb but appropriate.Character: Standard tropes. The characters were not creative, even regarding character design. It\'s sometimes enjoyable seeing a cliche like a loli tsundere but there were too many cliches  in this show. There\'s a static nature to the characters I didn\'t find enjoyable.Enjoyment: If loli tentacle harem was the show you were expecting, it hit the mark. For everyone else, the ecchi was excessive and the show weak. It was somewhat fun seeing cliche after cliche but it got old quick.Overall: A show I wouldn\'t personally recommend to many. The amount of effort put into the adaptation is mediocre but acceptable. Not the worst but almost niche due to its multiple cringe tentacle molestation scenes. catchy but her distinctive style of singing isn\'t for everyone.

It is an awful series and I would not recommend it to anyone. Despite having potential the creators disappointed me gravely. I watched the entire series thinking at the end of each episode that it cannot get any worse. I was mistaken.Story : 3As I said before the series had potential primarily due to the general story idea. Regrettably the end result was horrible. The story, in several cases, made absolutely no sense. Dozens of plot holes and the poorly written backgrounds for the main and supporting characters made a bad...story line into something utterly pathetic.Art :4Art may well have been the only decent thing about this series and when I say decent I do not mean that it was neither innovating or unique. It is more like what you would expect from this type of anime. The art in several cases seemed rushed and uncreative since no effort seemed to have been made to give that extra spark or glamour. Plus I did not enjoy the strong influence from hentais.Sound : 2Everything in relation to sound was completely subpar. The soundtrack was at best mediocre. Nothing really stuck with you except an annoying ending theme. The opening was not much better. As for voice acting I have to admit that once again they made no effort to create something unique. All characters were poorly voiced to the degree that almost all characters reminded you characters from other anime. It seems to me that no attempt was made to make them 'unique'.Character : 1As I said before the characters were poorly written, portrayed and voiced. Nothing good can be said about them. No information was provided during the series about them, none that made any sense at least. Even when an attempt was made to introduce some piece of information about the characters background it was swiftly demolished by some random event that had no place being there or irrelevant interruption from another character thus creating the illusion of a cliffhanger.Enjoyment & Overall: 3In essence this a horrible series that I would not recommend. Nothing in it can be viewed as good or average. The creators failed miserably and this failure could only be explained if this was their first attempt in anime creation. Furthermore I blame the stations that decided this was a good anime to air and further pollute the anime world. In my humble opinion nobody should have to suffer viewing this series unless you feel you need to punish yourselves. story line into something utterly pathetic.Art :4Art may well have been the only decent thing about this series and when I say decent I do not mean that it was neither innovating or unique.

I don't mind ecchi shows in general but the premise was interesting so I was hoping that this one would maintain a better balance between having a plot and finding excuses to show everyone's boobs.Positives- The OST is quite nice.- The opening is quite nice.- Eco is cute.- Character interactions are quite funny most of the time.Negatives- As the show went on the art choice for how characters hair and eyes interact really got on my nerves.- 100% needless inclusion of tentacle enemies and dedicating lots of...time to scenes with tentacles whenever they show up. (bleh)- It was like half way through the show before they realised they didn't have enough time to wrap it up so they rushed it.- Absolutely pointless side characters.- That damn tease ending.Overall not something you should go out of your way to watch but I don't regret giving it a go. time to scenes with tentacles whenever they show up.

With a ton of fanservice.Seikoku no Dragonar is definitely your typical harem. The entire series based around the hero, who has multiple girls fall in love with him. The difference is, this series throws dragons into the mix.Brief summary: Learning to ride and tame dragons comes easy to most students at Ansarivan Dragonar Academy  except for first-year student Ash Blake. Ash is the laughing stock at school because, despite his unfashionably large star-shaped brand that marks him as a future dragon master, he has nothing to show for it. His dragon has never appeared. One fateful day, Ash's dragon awakes...in full glory, but appears different than any dragon ever seen before,  in the form of a beautiful girl, Eco! What's worse, Ash soon discovers that this new dragon has attitude to spare, as she promptly informs him that she is the master, and he, the servant. Ash's problems with dragon riding have only just begun. But as the series progresses, Eco begins to develop feelings for Ash, and their relationship soon begins to take on a new shape.The story is definitely not the most unique plot that I have ever watched and is highly predictable.The MC helps girl, the girl falls in love, and the cycle is repeated as is true with most harems. It has a ton of action, and does transition very smoothly. It was not confusing in the slightest bit. The best aspect of the story however are the dragons. It's very interesting and intriguing to see the relationship the dragons and humans have, and to see them work together to accomplish goals. The story is indeed a fun ride though if you don't nitpick at every little detail.The art and sound of the series are good. I enjoyed all the music used and thought it fit the mood of each episode and series as a whole. The characters are unique from one another. You don't have the cookie cutter anime girl used for all the females. Plus, they are all animated very well.Other than that, you have the fan service. The fan service definitely plays a huge role in this series, and is present in almost every episode.

Yes there are dragons are very cool and one of the best aspects of the show but if what you want is a serious story your not going to find but it is a fun ride though and is not boring.Art: 6The art is fairly normal its not crap but its...not good its okay; but the dragons I found to be well done and were the only things that really stood out me from the rest of the art.Sound: 7The opening and endings of the show where nothing to interesting with a fairly mild piece as the opening that was skipped every time but the ending was more interesting and fitted the show well.Character: 7The characters of show were ok but were to flat as most followed there classic harem archetypes like the Tsundere e.g Eco and Silivia and the heroic male Ash who without the help of the girls and his one awesome super power would be a pile of charcoal by the 2nd episode also he is really nice. But aside from some of them do get some character development which does give the characters more depth and creates a bigger interest.Enjoyment: 7Now then I did enjoy the show as it was a break from all the serious anime of spring 2014 and was a fun ride all the way through but was a bit too predictable. not good its okay; but the dragons I found to be well done and were the only things that really stood out me from the rest of the art.Sound: 7The opening and endings of the show where nothing to interesting with a fairly mild piece as the opening that was skipped every time but the ending was more interesting and fitted the show well.Character: 7The characters of show were ok but were to flat as most followed there classic harem archetypes like the Tsundere e.g Eco and Silivia and the heroic male Ash who without the help of the girls and his one awesome super power would be a pile of charcoal by the 2nd episode also he is really nice.

Its genres are ecchi and harem, and so you can't really expect much from it. While people may complain about its overuse of large breasts just to use as fan service and eye candy for the audience, this is expected for typical harem and so is easily understandable in this review.Story: 6As mentioned before, this is a stereotypical harem laced with lots of ecchi scenes. It's got everything in it to qualify it as a harem and so most scenes placed...throughout the entire anime are easy to undermine and could, in most cases, be classified as cliche. While this may be true, the anime still presents to us an interesting story line filled with unexpected twists that would make you watch more, despite its overuse of ecchi scenes you would see in just about any harem anime. Adding to this fact, its pacing is slightly too fast, yet is a bit understandable at times.Art: 8The first thing you would think of when watching this anime is that ITS ART IS SO HIGH QUALITY. Actions done by the characters are done very fluidly with its backgrounds also drawn with the same amount of detail. Despite this said, there are not really any scenes where the art would take your breath away. They all seem to be there just because they need to be there and in that quality to match. Its purpose is to basically present its surroundings simply for you to forget about it a few seconds later.Sound: 7Not that much to say about sound. The OP and ED are catchy and the voices really match their characters. The stereotypical tsundere gets an abnormally high, yet cute voice and the somewhat arrogant princess gets a low proud voice that still never fails to actually say certain inappropriate lines that, in the end, may sound much more befitting to her character. That said, its sound affects are things that we've already heard before, nothing special, but still very appropriate to whatever is played out to us.Character: 5We have a tsundere dragon that has some kind of connection with the queen of Avalon, a stubborn princess that refuses to say what she really feels, and a dense male protagonist, who for some inexplicable reason, gets himself a special dragon that comes in a form of a human girl. If you ask me, thats just about all you need to make up a harem anime. Though we are given quite a bit of development behind them, the very fundamentals of each of their characters are still very much missing. I, personally, is very keen to know who exactly Ash's parents and how exactly did he meet the princess so easily. Moving away from that, some characters also just come and go very quickly. Most appear out of nowhere just to give some random fan service. With this, this part of the review gives a five to its characters.Enjoyment: 9Despite all of these setbacks, the enjoyment factor of this anime is very high, though that may just be for me. Of course, people who don't like the harem and ecchi genres would think otherwise, but there is a reason to why this anime was categorised under these titles. Why would someone who can't take horror watch a horror anime? Even if one did, their review would be bias by saying 'its too scary' when that is the whole point of the anime. Getting back on topic, this anime is so far very enjoyable. Though the stereotypical harem jokes may seem like nothing, some are still nonetheless rather funny. Action scenes are also well capable of stealing your attention away and putting you back on its semi serious plot.Overall: 7Not too high and not too low. This is an anime to be watched and forget about, though it does show some potential to move away from that. It is recommended that you watch it when you are bored and just want to kill time. throughout the entire anime are easy to undermine and could, in most cases, be classified as cliche.

But the Fanservice in this anime was poor, not poor as in ""just from time to time"" but poor as in it was badly made. I wish for more kisses and romance when it comes to fanservice, this was pure tentacle fanservice that I found gross.Besides from 90% of the anime\'s main characters being female and the protagonist who at first sight seemed to be interesting is in truth nothing but a wimp uncapable of thinking for himself. A weak wimp that is that can only rely on the females around him, I also don\'t like how the story progresses.It sort of feels like that the protagonist makes irrational decisions purely to favour the \'bad guys\' in the anime so their plot can continue to then when he face them which he wouldn\'t even have needed to in the first place if he would just have considered his options, he can\'t do anything but rely on the females in the harem once again.This are just my thoughts, thanks for reading.

As most people would suspect, the comedy ecchi harem action genre isn't exactly new, and this anime makes no exceptions in that. It doesn't deviate too much to typical cliche and it doesn't do anything super special either. The story is what you expect from this type of genre, and the character development is about average. I feel the story is probably where it falls a little short as it isn't spectacular or even anything that you would find surprising.In saying that though I personally loved...this anime, it was enjoyable as the main character actually attempted to fight, and the few female characters also added the needed substance for this anime. I found myself laughing a few times, and even caring about the characters which is a really good sign. The action unfortunately feels quite short, considering a 12 episode anime, its understandable but it loses its impact if the character either wins or loses within a few minutes.I thought the art was done nicely enough, and I was able to happily marathon the whole show in one sitting. In the end though this seems like the sort of anime which will appeal to a certain group of people but not all. While the fan service was quite comedic, certain choices such as tentacle monsters really detract from the overall story, at first it felt like a bad boss to fight, and the next second you are having a hard time taking it seriously since tentacles come out, and then you wonder whether the main character is even fighting it at all or if its just some sort of fan service monster. Ultimately that feels like the biggest fault for me, I would have a better feel of the characters if they fought monsters doing more then just adding fan service.Still though there was enough typical action, the male lead wasn't a complete wuss like some anime, and I felt like I enjoyed the ending.My last thoughts are, if you are the type of person who enjoys action harems, can tolerate the fan service, and enjoyed anime such as machine doll and familiar of zero. You will likely enjoy this anime.If you prefer anime with a more in depth plot, something you have to seriously think about or something that will be completely amazing, then this probably won't be the first choice on your list. this anime, it was enjoyable as the main character actually attempted to fight, and the few female characters also added the needed substance for this anime.

And as the show progresses more and more girls seem to fall in love with him, pretty standart.The art for...quite pleasant but again nothing crazy good, same goes for the music.All in all a quite predicatable show with matching characters.Still, I enjoyed this show.If you just wan\'t to watch a harem with some ""hot"" girls and a bit of action then go for it, if you are looking for more than that, it\'s probably not for you. quite pleasant but again nothing crazy good, same goes for the music.All in all a quite predicatable show with matching characters.Still, I enjoyed this show.If you just wan\'t to watch a harem with some ""hot"" girls and a bit of action then go for it, if you are looking for more than that, it\'s probably not for you.', 'In Lautreamont Knight Country which famous name is ""Dragon-Rearing Land"", well-known for largest dragon population, there is Ansullivan Dragonar Academy with purpose and its capability to train the Breeders (dragon master). The main hero, named Ash Blake, is one of the students there who unluckily haven\'t got any dragon to ride for himself. He is in a harem situation with few girls that take liking at him and get closer to him. It seems as the story goes, the school is in danger due to threats from others, and soon, the main hero who\'s currently a member of student council face the enemy as the...front-liner. Regardless of his no-dragon-to-ride, Ash Blake has his own gift, that is he is the one who can ride any dragon (when nobody could do that, a dragon just belongs to its owner).[somewhat SPOILER] Unpredictably, Ash Blake\'s dragon awakened and in a form as human. Ash gives his dragon a name, she is Eco. A pink-haired sharp mouth loli there to accompany Ash in his dragon world. As the story goes, Eco\'s true identity reveals, even Eco herself doesn\'t know about it. She is the Avalon\'s Holy Dragon, let\'s make it simple, it means that Eco\'s ancestor is from royal family of dragon itself. . .The story isn\'t special at all, I can\'t say I was fascinated by its plot nor animation when the poster appeared. Both the story and the animation are decent, stuffs that you can get in almost every anime series like the battling scenes, average detail for visualization, and so-so characters. It\'s apologetical since the character development is not approaching the characters deeply. It does, but only to the extent its needed, the rest is how to tame the dragon nor fighting the enemies with their pets—dragon.Like when the first appearance of duo the-man-in-mask and his subordinate, mountain guerrilla terrorist known as Avdocha (She Who Condemns), who purposely visits the town to kill the strongest Dragonar or Princess Veronica during her observation in the town while the true purpose of Avdocha is actually... (well why don\'t you try to watch the show anyway? lol). The main hero and main heroine developments aren\'t too much, as long as the battle and new facts revealed they are there and connected, sadly wasn\'t the reason to be discussed.The graphics itself wasn\'t give us any detailed view, like a rough peek and simple blended colouring. Mostly the show uses dense colours, it has its own disadvantages and advantages, like the clearer view but not too satisfying.The music is good (unfortunately just good), OP theme is sung by Yui Sakakibara titled ""Seiken nante Iranai (聖剣なんていらない)"" and ED theme is ""MOST Ijou no ""MOSTEST"" (MOST以上の“MOSTEST”)"". For the ED theme, the song is the same but sung by various and different seiyuus for few episodes.My time is spoiled by this show, eventho\' the whole show wasn\'t leave any remarkable impression. I gave 6 for the rate.Cons:The character development is not foundThe plot is not interesting enoughAverage animation, and not too satisfying colouring front-liner.

The setting feels a bit like louise and saito with their roles switched around BUT if louise weren\'t as much of a bitch and saito weren\'t as much of a wimp.Can\'t say I like how pretty much every japanese mc in a setting like this is giant pushovers who cares too much about people around them though. Get some balls and learn how to stop getting pushed around, also, learn how to be merciless and kill people when necessary, at least in a fantasy world where the rule...is kill or be killed. This isn\'t our modern day society, crap like that is not admirable, it\'s just pure stupidity.Then there\'s annoying characters everywhere, seems like almost every character comes across as extremely annoying at the start only to become kinda annoying later on or just boring altogether. All of them have their own overly strong sense of justice and seems to believe that everyone who doesn\'t agree with them are foolish and completely wrong. I especially hate people like the researcher from the second episode who became the mc\'s teacher, she did something horrible enough that ought to warrant execution, but got away with no lessons learned whatsoever, not even any insults or physical harm when she was ""defeated"".The author is barely half-decent, average might be overpraising him. Really, the setting itself feels quite weird. It seems to me the author couldn\'t decide on what he wanted, a modern day school setting or a medieval fantasy setting, so he went for both and combined them into some weird world where we have a lot of modern day elements such as food, buildings, schools etc yet we have a medieval world with no real technology and medieval buildings. It feels chaotic and half-assed. Honestly, after two episodes, I started to lose interest already. The characters are kinda plain, some are just plain boring and some are just annoying altogether. The story is similarly uninteresting. It doesn\'t grab your attention.The only saving grace is that I really like dragons and fantasy, but this author not only managed to turn the fantasy into something that feels like ""fake"" fantasy, he also managed to turn the dragons into seriously boring creatures that are both ugly, lacks any personality whatsoever and seems to be pretty weak, they might as well be dinosaurs instead of dragons. Giving them more human-like personalities and perhaps the ability to speak would\'ve made things much more interesting. Meanwhile, eco doesn\'t feel like a dragon at all since she doesn\'t even seem to have a dragon form, at least nothing has been revealed about it yet, she\'s also not that powerful and is pretty damn weak, maybe that has to do with her still being a ""newborn"" though. The astral flow thing and other settings are cringeworthy, especially the use of the random words that hardly make any sense, I also can\'t even count the amount of times I cringed at the numerous clichés that has been seen a million times before but was executed badly here. Urgh.Well, whatever. I like how eco is so protective of the mc, that\'s something good, not that it\'s presented in a good way because she has to mention how he is her pet dog or something all the time, super tsunderes like this are really overrated and I think all of us are dead tired of them by now and just find them obnoxious instead of interesting or funny. The romance feels really half-assed, what is even going on? This is actually the type of story where I feel a harem would be in the way, the mc and his dragon are better as the only pair, yet we have unnecessary additional settings such as the ultra cliché where there\'s this girl the mc helped as a child and she doesn\'t realize he\'s currently by her side etc...Now, one of the biggest flaws is that the ecchi is excessive and ruins serious scenes by being too random, it might also be me not being a teenager anymore and unable to appreciate the mindless erotic scenes that are there for absolutely no reason whatsoever except to give the viewers a boner. Things such as tentacles being used to attack from a creature that reasonably shouldn\'t have any, scenes that are just there to be erotic or armor/battle clothes that leaves breasts and thighs exposed for absolute no reason, looking more like an erotic bathing suit than actual clothes, much less armor/battle clothes(and this is a kinda haughty and strict battle-freak princess we\'re talking about), looking more like she\'s about to go to an orgy than a battlefield, or even events where clothes are destroyed for completely illogical reasons that makes you think ""what\'s up with this retarded garbage? did the author become temporarily brain damaged when writing shit like this?"", are ever present, which begs to suspend disbelief, but since it\'s so utterly idiotic, even I, as a master of suspending disbelief, can\'t possibly lower my standards to the point where I find this to be acceptable.I tried my very best to watch this, but after watching 6 full episodes over around two hours of time, I finally gave up and couldn\'t take it anymore since it got worse and worse the longer I watched. The setting is bad(even cringeworthy), the dragons are boring, the people are uninteresting and plain, might even call them extremely shallow and superficial, the scenery is subpar and fails to immerse me, the story is dreadfully lacking and most of the characters are irritating. I bet this story would do way better as a revenge-type story instead of this garbage, the mc would just have to man up and the loli dragon would have to lose about 70% of her tsun.

Once the anime began the real part of the story, it become really bad.Characters lost all their logic ( the tsundere ( which represent half of the female characters ) became docile in lot of scene without any reason), and the worst caracter ( the elf ) become a principal one during a long arc. The story is full of random stereotype scene, badly done without any surprise except that boobs grow more and more.To be honest, I had to...do something else during the second part of the anime as it was really boring. Even the plot twists are badly done, not even suprising, and they have noone real impact on the story, making them totally useless and free.When the anime try something new, that is really confuse for something supposed to be simply to explain ( All ""kidnapping"" and hostage episodes ). It could be a better anime if it had passed the useless scene fast instead of focus on them ( All bathpassages ).Noone feeling come from the anime. It is just bland.To finish, the fight aren\'t dynamic, and the contract with dragon is really a bad thing, making the fight, again, really confuse ( ""invocation-crafting"" scene duration is most important that the real time of the fight, during the time the opponent could destroy 3 cities ) do something else during the second part of the anime as it was really boring.

Blood, gore. Occasionally I'll watch some cutsie stuff to break things up. Heck, I photograph cosplay for a couple of Anime cons, so I'll watch some Anime just to become familiar with the characters.This anime, while mildly entertaining, left a lot to be desired. All the anime budget was blown on overly-bounce-able boobs and bizarre Hentai tentacle inspired scenes that were 100% out of place here. When there were battle scenes or gigantic dragons, it looked like someone drew a single cell then moved it around the screen.I really am getting tired of...these cookie cutter characters. Every Anime now seems to have a generic German chick, Russian babe, English Aristocrat and so on. Variations of that are here. Of course there's the ditz that has to run around in her bra and panties for no discernible reason except to make the generic clueless boy hero uncomfortable.  Don't get me wrong - humorous sexual tension can be laugh-out-loud funny (I loved Shimonetta) - here they were just idiotic.Yea, I watched all 12 episodes.

Who doesn\'t like dragons?  Who wouldn\'t love a dragon to call their own?  As a male, who wouldn\'t give their left arm to be bonded to a dragon who was a cute girl especially when you had a pretty good idea how she would grow up?  I was surprised this was a ecchi/pseudo-harem, but then I seem to be drawn to them.  Meh, it\'s a living.  Everything but one major plot point was resolved by the last episode, but it seemed like they rushed to just throw in the resolution....That was rather disappointing.  That being said; by the numbers.Story:  The first episode made me want to watch, and I was willing to forgive the rather  elementary school presentation in the hopes that it would pick up the gauntlet that it threw down with the premise, and kick some butt.  That didn\'t happen, but I\'m a fan of the service, and there was plenty of that.  I was surprised by just how ecchi this was, and if there had been a few more pixels revealed it could have been hentai easily.  Maybe that would have made the story-lite presentation better, but I was left wanting more in the way of development.  6Art:  It\'s anime, so I\'m a fan of the art, and the vistas were beautiful, the cities fantastic and detailed, as were the outfits, and the girls were sexy.  Somebody does need to get the potential warrior males in anime to grab a protein shake, and hit the gym once in a while though.  Honestly, The ladies are drawn so I can see each muscle group, and the pleasant hint and jiggle of avoirdupois in all the right places, but I can count the number of male biceps I\'ve seen in almost all anime on one hand.  Of course, I\'m not counting the super saiyans and monster men out there; just the average warriors in training.  Help me artiste; you\'re our only hope.  8Sound:  I usually like the OP and ED songs in anime, and have downloaded many that I listen to while driving, but these two were pretty forgettable if not nearly unlistenable.  I love bubblegum pop, but these songs even embarrassed me.  As for the ambience music throughout; there was nothing remarkable, or notable.  4Character:  Yes.  Next!  Okay, to elucidate; the characters had just enough to prove they were indeed written as human beings except for the dragons; they were written as dragons.  At least the dragons had some depth of character.  The humans could\'ve been replaced by poster boards with smiley faces on them.  In my never to be humble opinion, this is where the genre falls flattest.  You can\'t make a real character truly ""real"" to the viewer with 23 minutes times 12 episodes even if there were an OVA, or at least it appears fairly rare.  4Enjoyment:  I wanted to, and tried to enjoy this.  If it was just for the fan service, I would give this  a 9 or 10.   All I could say was ""what potential"".  Too formulaic.  I would\'ve dropped this, but I loved Eco (the MC\'s dragon).  Cute as a button, and feisty as a fighter pilot just before lighting the afterburner.  Just the way I like my tsunderes.  She reminds me of my daughter who I love dearly.  Not that way; you perv!  Which both Eco and my daughter are fond of saying.  I\'m also a sucker for a poorly written love story.  5Overall:  I could have lowered each rating by one or two points, but there was just so much potential for a good series that I didn\'t have the heart, and the hope of it improving kept me clicking to the next episode.

Mas acho que deveria ter mais animes nesse estilo.Ash Blake, um menino que ""sacrificou"" sua vida para salvar uma menina e foi salvo pela mãe dos dragões (se não me engano, foi ela), que gostou da atitude do menino ao salvar a menina. A menina que foi salva mais é revelada mais para frente no anime, porém Ash não se lembra de...nada da queles dias pelo visto.E agora ele vive na Academia Ansarivan Dragonar, que todos os estudantes são mestres de dragões, e Ash Blake ainda não conseguiu despertar seu dragão. O então chamado ""garoto problema"" pois se envolve em muitos problemas quando falam de seu ""parr"" que é o nome dado ao dragão. Ash tem um talento, que é montar em qualquer dragão, até dragões divinos. Outras pessoas ao tentarem montar em outros dragões que não são seus, podem acabar feridos, pois o dragão não deixa.Quando Ash ""desperta"" o seu dragão, ele vêm com outra forma, sim a forma de um Humano. Sortudo, seu dragão vem em forma humana uma bela jovem com cabelos cor de rosa e Lolicon.O legal do anime é que tem muitas cenas ecchi, em alguns casos parecendo até um verdadeiro Hentai, com muitos tentaculos.Ao meu ver o anime poderia ter uma segunda temporada tranquilo pois deixou muitas coisas em aberto. Pena não ser tão simples assimObservando minhas preferencias ao assistir um anime, eu não deveria gostar desse anime por ter muito clichê, como a personalidade do protagonista, e as antagonistas.Mas a história ficou muito boa e me atraiu muito.Recomendo muito, assistam![English-EUA]My favorite anime style, where the protagonist studies in a school of magic or almost this with enough fights and scenes ""exciting"".What I liked the most about anime was its history itself, because I found it very similar to some other anime. But I think I should have more animes in that style.Ash Blake, a boy who ""sacrificed"" his life to save a girl and was saved by the mother of the dragons (if I\'m not mistaken, it was her), who liked the boy\'s attitude in saving the girl. The girl who was saved more is revealed later in the anime, however Ash does not remember anything of those days apparently.And now he lives at Ansarivan Dragonar Academy, that all students are masters of dragons, and Ash Blake still can not wake his dragon. The so-called ""problem boy"" because he gets involved in many problems when they talk about his ""parr"" which is the name given to the dragon. Ash has a talent, which is riding on any dragon, up to divine dragons. Other people in trying to ride on other dragons that are not theirs may end up injured, as the dragon will not let it.When Ash ""awakens"" his dragon, he comes in another form, rather the form of a Human. Lucky, his dragon comes in human form a beautiful young woman with pink hair and Lolicon.The cool thing about the anime is that it has a lot of ecchi scenes, in some cases looking like a real Hentai with lots of tentacles.In my view the anime could have a quiet second season because it left many things open. Too bad it\'s not as simple as that.Observing my preferences when watching an anime, I should not like this anime because it has a lot of cliché, like the personality of the protagonist, and the antagonists.But the story was very good and attracted me a lot.Highly recommend, watch! nada da queles dias pelo visto.E agora ele vive na Academia Ansarivan Dragonar, que todos os estudantes são mestres de dragões, e Ash Blake ainda não conseguiu despertar seu dragão.

But I think I should have more animes in that style.Ash Blake, a boy who ""sacrificed"" his life to save a girl and was saved by the mother of the dragons (if I\'m not mistaken, it was her), who liked the boy\'s attitude in saving the girl. The girl who was saved more is revealed later in the anime, however Ash does not remember anything of those days apparently.And now he lives at Ansarivan Dragonar Academy, that all students are masters of dragons, and Ash Blake still can not wake his dragon. The so-called ""problem boy"" because he gets involved in many problems when they talk about his ""parr"" which is the name given to the dragon. Ash has a talent, which is riding on any dragon, up to divine dragons. Other people in trying to ride on other dragons that are not theirs may end up injured, as the dragon will not let it.When Ash ""awakens"" his dragon, he comes in another form, rather the form of a Human. Lucky, his dragon comes in human form a beautiful young woman with pink hair and Lolicon.The cool thing about the anime is that it has a lot of ecchi scenes, in some cases looking like a real Hentai with lots of tentacles.In my view the anime could have a quiet second season because it left many things open. Too bad it\'s not as simple as that.Observing my preferences when watching an anime, I should not like this anime because it has a lot of cliché, like the personality of the protagonist, and the antagonists.But the story was very good and attracted me a lot.Highly recommend, watch!', ""There was *some* potential for this series, but I think it's been overstated in other reviews. The main characters start off being interesting, and the setting is somewhat generic but passable.However, after watching the show it quickly becomes obvious that any potential is buried deep underneath a pile of fan service, generic anime tropes, and overall terrible writing. Idk about the source material, but the show managed to annoy me every few minutes; there is basically no explanation or self-consistency for the magic, things just get resolved randomly, and the plot drags on aimlessly at times.Story: 4The characters are forgettable. After re-watching the first few...episodes, all I could think about is how predictable and one-dimensional they are (not to mention dumb at times). It's like everything I hate about bad shounen characters and harem characters rolled into one.Character: 2But this is an ecchi/comedy, so what about that? Well, while ecchi is heavily emphasized, I don't think it's an excuse for the plot and characters being so insufferable. As for comedy, most of it came from the main character being embarrassed that naked girls keep on throwing themselves at him. The art is average, and doesn't make up for the show's failure in other respects.Art & Sound: 5In the end, I think this show only succeeds as an ecchi, and an OK one at that. When the story and characters only detract from the titillation, there's obviously something wrong.Enjoyment & Overall: 3 episodes, all I could think about is how predictable and one-dimensional they are (not to mention dumb at times).

Like, it tries to be good trash but thinks all it needs is titties and all will be forgiven, but that is not the case. The plot is incredibly predictable and the romances are weird. The animation is below average and the english voice acting is whack, especially for the MC's loli dragon, echo, who sounds like nail on a chalkboard. I mean, for god's sake, the anime starts with Generic Anime MC being SA'd by a dragon-god-anime tiddy woman. Not completely horrible, I was able to stomach much of it and turn my...brain off to get through it, but I did not enjoy it. The only thing I will say is a plus is that you do get to know the characters as the show progresses. Whether you like the characters or not is up to you.Skip this. There is better fantasy trash out there, this is not it. brain off to get through it, but I did not enjoy it.

Katsute Kami Datta Kemono-tachi e,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39199/Katsute_Kami_Datta_Kemono-tachi_e,"[""Something always bothered me about shows that mixes fantasy, drama, and tragedy. Most of them always seems to follow the path of a dark past or event that changes a protagonist’s view of the world forever. It’s some of the most cliché writing that easily gets milked into a storyline and the authors would expand on it seemingly forever. When watching this show called Katsute Kami Data Kemono-tachi e (To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts), I had a similarly eerie feeling. If you thought this Spring 2019's Fairy Gone was garbage, this isn't much better.The practice of using a background story episode as its opener isn’t...too uncommon these days. It’s what we get from the very first episode as we meet the Incarnates, soldiers with the ability to transform into supernatural beasts. They are essentially living weapons of war. It didn’t long for the show to unravel the war drama that adapts the overall story tone into an unsettling conflict. To be frank though, I find the opening episode to be a clever way of hooking the audience. It managed to captivate me into the premise. After all, the idea of humans becoming Incarnates sparks curiosity on how much they can change. Soldiers who became these monsters also have to deal with the aftermath of this war and the way humanity judges them. This story follows the plot of a young girl named Nancy Schaal Bancroft who becomes a Incarnate hunter after a certain tragedy.Before coming to understand the full concept of the show, you should realize the brainchild behind this franchise. Mangaka Maybe has been known to mix a variety of genres into their work. However, most often, he tends to add elements of fantasy or drama as in the case of Dusk Maiden of Amnesia and Tales of the Wedding Rings. This show takes the tone into a more serious direction as you see the consequences of war and how it affects humanity. Everything so far seems like the anime has a degree of storytelling potential until you understand the main cast. Can we just talk about how unbalanced the characters are?First, we got Hank, the Beast-Human hunter. Being a gloomy man with a vengeance, he has no time for foolishness and is hard to approach. The first episode establishes his hate for Cain, the main antagonist of the series. In fact, Cain is the catalyst of Hank’s character change and he seeks revenge as an avenger. The idea of revenge is a major source of motivation for at least two main characters. Schaal also holds a similar goal in her mind although the story makes her into a much weaker character compared to Hank. I can’t fandom how annoying she gets as the story progresses with each episode. The more I watch Schaal, the more I see her as a damsel in distress. She even has hard time making important choices in life and often seems to need someone to lend her a hand. The relationship dynamics between her and Hank is a strange one as even when they understand each other more, the two feels very distant between each other. With how their relationship develops, let’s just say that it’s hardly emotional. The ‘monster of the week’ format puts the duo into compromising positions but it’s usually Hank doing the dirty work. Even with an elephant gun in her hands, she seems very useless on the battlefield. For instance, she gets captured by an Incarnate and almost ends up being dead if it wasn’t for Hank. In later episodes, the show seeks to make us feel sympathetic for her because of the circumstances about her father. But honestly, I don’t buy it. In a time of despair and tragedy, she’s not the only one suffering inside. Unfortunately, you’ll hardly need a tissue when watching this anime because the storytelling’s emotional elements lacks impact. And at the end of the day, it's easy to point fingers at how weak Schaal is as a character.That brings to another question, what about the rest of the cast? To be honest, most of them feels like filler characters with little to zero development. One of the more noticeable cast is Liza who serves as a sort of mentor and big sister to Schaal. The other noticeable character is Elaine Bluelake, who ends up being dead before the main story timeline begins. It’s what sets the main conflict between Hank and Cain. So if you’re actually expecting some sort of meaningful character study, prepare for disappointment. The reality is that a majority of Incarnates in the show suffer from psychological problems. They struggle between the balance of their humanity and monstrous side. Unfortunately, most of these Incarnates are used as plot devices and amplifying the themes of the show. It also tries to evoke a form of emotion but hardly succeed. Ask yourself how many of these Incarnates you can remember by heart when the show is over. For me, that’s almost zero. Oh for God's sake, why does Cain make me want to turn the TV off every time I see his face?Studio MAPPA managed to animate the show to fit the time era of the mid-19th century. It’s actually refreshing to see an anime in this timeline for its aesthetics. Even character uniforms in the show is distinctive while the Incarnates are crafted with grotesque elements. It evokes a sense of fear once you realize the threat they pose to humanity. On the other hand, the character emotive performances is a letdown. Some character expressions often looks forced such as Schaal during her emotional outbursts. Hank always has a stoic face that borderlines on emotionless. It’s what drags down their character chemistry and ultimately makes the pair unremarkable. But if you’re in this show for its graphic violence, fan service, and dark fantasy action, that may leave some more favorable impressions. Maybe's cheeky humor writing is also noticable sometimes in the right and wrong ways.With just 12 episodes, it won’t take long to get through the journey. However, this journey is not built on a masterful storytelling plot or creative cast. Instead, it ends up being a madhouse of generic clichés. I hate using that word but it’s how this anime played its cards. Should you watch this anime anyway? That’s up for you to decide in the end. I’m not your dad. But with everything this series showed us, this isn’t one to brag about to your friends. too uncommon these days.

They are super soldiers who lost nearly everything on the battlefields and are now attempting to find a way to live in society. This is the indicator that this show is mainly character-driven, the plot is based on the characters of the stories and it also sees the characters develop. You will get a sneak peek at the mental state of these soldiers and I...will say, it's quite entertaining. Not only does Hank's life and situation make you feel genuinely bad for the guy, but the Incarnates' troubles invoke some emotional feelings that get to you as well. Their lives are sad, which makes you sad too. I think that's the most enjoyable part of this show, the morally challenging existence of the Incarnates. The fact that they're also human, but because they succumbed to the issue they experienced during the war now they all must be eliminated. The only way I can describe it is sad, very goddamn sad. It seems unfair, but then fair at the same time. Nancy sort of takes on the audience's position, as we're both trying to understand why the Incarnates are as awful as society sees them and why they have to be treated so harshly. Obviously, we have the background knowledge, but Nancy follows Hank around just as us watchers follow him around too.Art:I actually find the art very clean and crisp, I like that the characters are vibrant, especially their eyes. Though, many scenes are coloured dark and grey for the more heavy scenes.Sound:The opening and ending are good, I have no real complaints. The sound doesn't exactly stand out, but it's not so bad that I would exactly recognize that it's bad.Characters:I like the characters, I don't think they're exactly bland. Though I do feel a bit of a disconnection between myself and the characters (mainly because we don't know much about them) I'm still able to feel sympathy for them. Especially for someone like Hank, I feel nothing but sadness for him. I can see and understand his pain and struggles, and I do find myself wishing it didn't have to be that way for him. He's a strong main character who feels many negative things, yet somehow finds a way to keep going. He chose to burden himself by relieving his fellow soldiers of their war days, feeling responsible as their old captain. The side characters are interesting as well, they have their own views on the Incarnate situation and their own goals towards it. The villain is diabolical as ever and challenges Hank to his core, who doesn't love a truly screwed up villain?All in all, it's a pretty good show and I've been enjoying the action and story a lot. I wouldn't say the concept is unique, but I like the way it's being portrayed and used in this series. I would recommend giving it a watch if you enjoy this genre. will say, it's quite entertaining.

As a fan of the genre, I’m always interested when I see a show set in the medieval age, hence To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts instantly caught my attention after I saw the PV. From the studio that had produced Zankyou no Terror, Zombieland Saga and Yuri!!! On Ice in recent years, there was cause for excitement, even though the PV had made it clear that this was a low-budget anime as compared to the other hits the studio has had.From the beginning, To...the Abandoned Sacred beasts throws us into a war between the North and the South, with the South dominating the war for the most part until the North delved their hands into something they should never have: transforming humans into all-powerful beasts of destruction and war. The humans who’d been the victims of this were made to believe that they were special, revered by their army but on the inside, the entire populace was terrified of them. However, such beasts were only going to be useful until the end of the war. As soon as that ended, the army always wanted to get rid of these creatures who, in their view, threatened their existence. That’s pretty much the premise of the story. Not bad. Unoriginal, but the execution was fairly well handled at the start.Now, that’s where the problems begin. There comes a time when you get bored of the same script every episode over and over again. Find an Incarnate, hear about how they’ve been ravaging stuff around the area, talk to them, and then at the end of the episode, eliminate them. That’s the formula that was followed throughout the season. The repetitive nature of the plot had me rolling my eyes from boredom at times.We’ve got two main protagonists: Hank Henriette and Schaal Bancroft.Hank Henriette, the charismatic leader of these Sacred beasts or incarnates, as they’ve been called, is a pretty straight-forward character to understand. Being betrayed by your best friend, who also kills your lover is an easy way to make yourself hate someone, isn’t it? He’s about the only incarnate who’s neither lost his humanity completely nor wants to eradicate humanity for what they’ve put all of the Incarnates through. The threat posed by these mindless beasts who were once his comrades in arms is understood by Hank, hence he takes the mantle of eliminating them before they cause any further damage to society upon himself. And we follow his encounters with his fellow incarnates. Hank rarely showed emotions, keeping himself focused on his goal for the most part.The second protagonist is the daughter of one of the Incarnates. Loved by her adopted siblings, her father as well as the village, Schaal is an exuberant spirit full of positivity until he sees what’s happened to her father, who’s body had changed into a dragon permanently. Even so, she never hesitates to treat him as the same father she once knew. When one day Hank arrives and kills his father, she goes into rage and vows to track down his killer. As she meets and gets to know Hank though, she decides to accompany him and see for herself the reason for which her father had to be killed. As time passes, she begins to sympathize with Hank. Watching their interactions and relationship develop is one of the better points in the show.Talking about the animation, I was extremely disappointed. I was expecting a lot better from MAPPA, who’d done such amazing work in the past. Far too many of the battle scenes, which are supposed to be the best animated panels, are crappily done for the most part. The character designs are better but nothing to write home about. The soundtrack is meh, the voice acting okay. I guess they really had a low budget because there was one soundtrack they kept repeating over and over again in tense situations.The animation or the sound aren’t the factors that brought down the show for me though. The culmination of what Hank and Schaal did throughout the season didn’t have much of a payoff. The first few episodes were interesting, then the loop begins, ending on the same note. This may work for comedy, but doesn’t for action fantasy. The story had potential to develop into an intriguing story that shows the grey side of human nature.

This student also suffers from the faults of poor time management and a shoddy work ethic, treading through obstacles that hinder the reach of his or her full potential. Sacred Beasts can be thought of as a big project of said student with such great ideas presented, but a far cry from a professional effort, and one that mainly exists as a...stepping stone for something greater in the future. If we put aside such a liberating outlook, this show is really an unfortunate result of what should have been much more. Enticing concepts are held within a product that lacks confidence in itself, with none of its concepts being properly fleshed out.With its first episode, Sacred Beasts starts off with a bang, kicking off with the beloved Incarnates unleashing their might on their helpless adversaries, with a majestic and opulent soundtrack to applaud and accentuate their heroic endeavors. In terms of presentation, the first episode is a success in many ways. So much so, in fact, that you’ll likely manage to look past the numerous writing issues. Consistent storytelling is something that Sacred Beasts struggles with constantly, but it’s Mappa themselves who managed to compile so many of these problems into their own anime-exclusive introduction. The writing in this episode is so shot full of holes that it’s a shining example of why you should proofread your own draft well before your deadline.It begins with a horde of soldiers, equipped with nothing more than a rifle, charging towards a gigantic stone wall that is the enemy base. Behind them is a squad of cannoneers firing at the wall seconds after. In real life, no squad in their right mind would even think of doing this, as it’s a fast ticket to a mass suicide of your pawns. If this episode cared at all about logical consistency, the least it would do is have the cannons fire first, and have the soldiers charge once a breach is made. Even then, breaching a major fortification in the Civil War would realistically take days with siege artillery and engineers, none of which are seen here. This scene was obviously a gateway to introducing the Incarnates, presenting the enemy base as a powerful force with normal soldiers being wiped away in its territory, contrast to the Incarnates who come to annihilate it like nothing. But there’s not much comparison to make with soldiers stupidly throwing their life away with no apparent plan.The arrival of the Incarnates itself also begs the question of why they were never shot at despite being well into the territory of the base. This scene veers into the level of B-movie writing where any and all logic is disregarded to make something look cool. Plot armor this horribly blatant only degrades the weight that this sequence holds, and is not worth the epic arrival of these heroes trekking along the battlefield like it’s become a stage auditorium.As if this isn’t enough, a third major issue presents itself in a scene where Abi, the Hydra Incarnate, talks to Elaine about his apprehension that he might be losing control of himself; foreshadowing his own role as the first apparent case of an Incarnate going berserk. So what lets this incident follow through? Abi says “just kidding” to Elaine, and thus this suspicion is left unattended. No researcher in her right mind would ignore a potential disaster like this, especially not the one and only researcher on these lethal experiments.And this is within the first eight minutes, showing little or no concern with a logical setup and throwing us headfirst into the second act. This first episode excels in generating hype and selling the experience, but with the demand of a robust suspension of disbelief. These issues would be egregious in any story, and perhaps wouldn’t matter so much in a series with such an emphasis on spectacle. Yet it’s beyond this point where Sacred Beasts’ true ambitions are made clear.Ostensibly, the story of Sacred Beasts mainly exists as a scaffolding for epic battles between the Incarnates. But Sacred Beasts wants to hold the honor of being more than this by posing as a character drama, enacting the monumental tragedy of bestial war heroes meeting their end at the hands of those who fear they have lost their humanity. This story-driven approach is something Sacred Beasts is confident in pushing mindless spectacle aside for, and to its credit, its narrative concepts could have really elevated the series to its aspired heights. For this reason it’s a shame to see these manifested in what’s ultimately a safe product; one that’s too simplistic and short-sighted with its storytelling to really leave an effect.As we follow Hank Henriette and Nancy Schaal, their difference in characterization is clear: Schaal connects easily with others and surmises the supposedly soulless Incarnates to have some humanity. Hank on the other hand passively endures Schaal’s protests as he carries out what he believes to be the only solution with the Incarnates: death. This is the basis of their interplay, and Sacred Beasts sadly doesn’t make the most out of their chemistry. Most of their interactions are interchangeable from the outset to the turning point in episode 6. Hank and Liza locate their target, Schaal protests through conjecture, Liza intervenes in Hank’s defense, Hank reaches his destination, and the Incarnate is inevitably slain. A repetitive structure can work so long as the main leads are engaging enough to uphold it, and these characters sadly aren’t, as the story is far more focused on delivering that one emotional gut-punch with its Incarnate-of-the-week setup.That said, these characters aren’t completely static, as there’s a significant point where Hank and Schaal get somewhat more comfortable with each other. It’s comforting to see Schaal act kinder to Hank than before by sewing his clothes and making good company with him, and Hank being friendlier with her and opening his nearly impenetrable shell. After two episodes of working together, this is the kind of development they needed, and it’s a valuable moment for this reason. However, valuable as it is, it’s a shame that the dialogue is just as flat as ever, written more like a description of these characters and their histories than a genuine human exchange.Bland dialogue is something that Sacred Beasts is plagued with. A majority of exchanges between characters are woefully lacking in personality and wit, divulging information in such an inorganic manner that makes the events all the more distant. With how much time is spent on military negotiations, plans of action, and other things in place of spectacle, the least they could do is provide some engaging dialogue to spice up the experience. Instead it’s just a case of enduring our way through tedium to the next predetermined outcome, hoping that something meaningful will come of it in the end.That ‘something’ is obviously the emotional or cathartic finality of an Incarnate. We insert into this story as Hank, who already has a strong attachment to the comrades he dispatches, but as viewers we have little reason to care. While Hank’s company with these people during the war comes to a tragic close, we don’t experience that company ourselves outside of a brief flashback. This is a major factor in why Hank’s turmoil feels so distant, and is also perhaps the biggest missed opportunity in Mappa’s anime-exclusive introduction.It’s made all the worse when Sacred Beasts tries to compensate by dramatizing the Incarnates’ plight to a groan-inducing level. For a show that wears moral ambiguity on its sleeve, it’s quite hellbent on telling us how to feel, with the worst offender being the death of Daniel Price. If this scene only relied on the Robin Hood-esque motive and the mourning of his loved ones, that would be enough to sell the ordeal as morally ambiguous and heartbreaking, especially to an outsider like Schaal. The melodrama and shoehorned flashback intended to tug harder at the viewers’ heartstrings is doomed to backfire with a character having less than 3 minutes of screentime before death.However, I’d be lying if I said I felt no connection to these Incarnates, although it’s hardly an emotional one; it’s more of a fascination. For instance, Theodore’s fear of death had manifested into the making of an entire fortress, and what’s interesting is that this is what he was taught by Hank. There’s also the revelation where Theo’s incoming death happens to wash away his fear at last, something that’s true to the character and separates him from other Incarnates. Additionally, the Behemoth’s want to see the ocean with Hank trying to lead him there is a pretty great end twist, with a merciful lack of hamfisted drama. And thirdly, Trice’s belief that she’ll never be human again is one many of us can connect with. Sacred Beasts is at its best when it draws on this aspect rather than nearly drowning itself in its liking for melodramatic sob-story deaths. It’s fortunate that every once in a while it comes up for a breath, notably with Topher the Gargoyle in episode 5. Sacred Beasts is determined to make each major Incarnate engaging, and to an extent, it was successful. It’s just a shame that formulaic plots and flat dialogue weigh their respective episodes down. These resolutions certainly shine on their own, with Behemoth’s arc being my personal favorite, but that hardly salvages the episodes that hinge so much on those conclusions to be worthwhile.Distant characters is hardly the only major problem with the story, however. There’s a frustrating pattern with the writing in which it neglects to found a logical setup for the events that follow, which makes it harder to take the the events seriously. Much of this is apparent in the first episode alone, but the problems only begin there. The Incarnates perhaps wouldn’t be running amok to begin with if the military thought for a minute about how lethal they are. A competent authority would have these living weapons confined or at least under strict supervision to ensure that what could go wrong doesn't go wrong. Additionally, it’s quite uncharacteristic of Hank to let someone as defenseless as Schaal to come with him into Theodore’s trap-filled fortress. Considering his goals and his position, you’d think the last thing Hank would be fine with is to put an innocent life at risk. Sure, he asks Schaal if she’s sure about coming with him, to which Schaal promises that she won’t cause him trouble. But that shouldn’t be enough to sway anyone with a sense of responsibility, let alone someone as sentimental as Hank.To be fair, there are moments where Sacred Beasts avoids these drawbacks. Episode 2 for example handles the villagers’ suspicions of William Bancroft rather competently. William is suspected to have killed livestock, yet the villagers acknowledge that they don’t have tangible evidence. Because of this, they take the safe measures of putting a cowbell on William and taking the children to a distant location. On one hand I applaud this scene for having characters behave realistically in this situation, yet on the other I lament that villagers are sadly more sensible than those in the military.In fact, plenty of these other moments show how just a simple fix could make all the difference. Certain plot points disregard how stringent the military should be with their assets, and once you bring those moments to light, it can bring forth many ideas that probably seem obvious in retrospect. In episode 4, for example, Schaal makes her way to a confined Behemoth to converse with him, but we never see her actually getting permission to do so, when logically those in charge would be selective in who is allowed to get in close proximity to a large untamed beast. We don’t see the military having any issue whatsoever with letting Schaal, a civilian, walk up to a monster that the people were fearful of to the point of strapping down in place. For all we know she could’ve gotten permission off-camera, but it’s not a good practice of any writer to have viewers assume something improbable to fill plot holes themselves.This particular oversight would have an easy fix. Just show a scene of Schaal getting permission to come close to the beast with a solid reason for them to let her in, and suspension of disbelief would largely remain in tact. A good step further would be having someone assist Schaal during her visit and perhaps even a prolonged exchange of the guards being convinced by Schaal or each other to let her pass.Better yet, instead of seeing her get permission, we could have a scene where Schaal sneaks out at night, stealthily making her way past guards to get to her business with Behemoth. This would not only be a simple fix, but also one that could provide a tense and engaging situation where Schaal steps out from the back seat and acts without the help of Hank or Liza. It’s the perfect scenario where someone as inexperienced as Schaal could take action. There are plenty of ways to iron out these kinds of issues in your draft. You just have to get a little creative.For some people, this sort of creativity would have really uplifted the 7th episode with the zombified William Bancroft, or Nidhogg. It’s a common opinion that simply bringing him back to life is an incredibly cheap way to develop Schaal. To an extent I agree with this, but it’s not something I’m personally bothered with. An “asspull” it might be, but we’re given an explanation on why this particular Incarnate has revived. Honestly, in a world where myths are made real through science, I’m willing to accept much of anything related to it, however outlandish as it may be. There are very few rules shared by each and every Incarnate, as they’re all unique in some way. So learning that William has some sort of regenerative ability isn’t going to weigh down the experience for me. Perhaps from a writing standpoint, it can be seen as lazy, and there are likely much better ways to enact Schaal’s change of heart in a similar manner, but it serves its purpose well enough to where I can let it slide.However, in that same episode is something much, much harder for me to let slide, and that is Liza casually handing to Schaal the Godkiller bullets, ammunition that is very rare and isn’t supplied to the regular soldiers battling Nidhogg. This is something that myths-made-real cannot excuse. It’s clearly done by the writer to give Schaal the chance to face her father, yet Liza has no reason to value Schaal’s growth over her own duties as a lieutenant, and the preservation of these bullets. It’s yet another case of the writer’s hand being all too visible, taking contrived or illogical routes to construct a scaffolding of plot points rather than a fully realized narrative.The resolution of this episode leads into one of the smallest yet significant changes I would make to Sacred Beasts that takes place right after Schaal kills her resurrected father for good. We’re to believe that this event will go on to affect Schaal’s character in the future, but as it is, she acts too similarly to her previous self to truly signify a change. She behaves as merrily as ever and shows practically no signs of distress after seeing her father die by her own hands. There’s more to character development than just the events they go through; a change in personality should be there to show that Schaal is not the same person she was two episodes ago. She can act perpetually glum over past events while still upholding her proactive attitude. This emotional state could be temporarily alleviated with her meeting Trice, making this anime-exclusive subplot all the more impactful, where she befriends the type of monster she had pledged to exterminate. These are elements that go a long way to improve viewer investment; depicting these characters as living, evolving people rather than vessels made to spout themes and exposition. It’s sad to see such potential in characters who, while not dimensionless, don’t have much more humanity to them than the brainless beasts the Incarnates are feared to have become.Some might think these complaints to be petty, but Sacred Beasts’ emphasis on story is what makes these flaws so damaging. If Sacred Beasts was primarily about spectacle like that of Attack on Titan, Pacific Rim, or John Wick, I’d be more lenient on these sorts of drawbacks. But considering what Sacred Beasts chose to uphold itself as, it should be held at a higher standard in regards to its plot, and especially its characters.It’s all the more unfortunate when even the spectacle loses its value as the animation quality drops considerably with each episode, to a level that’s pathetic even for what’s expected of a usual 12-episode anime at its midway point. In-between frames are seemingly forgotten about and inconsistent models are shockingly abundant. After the glamorous first episode, this is a huge slap in the face, and hardly excusable with 11 animation directors.Apart from the awe-inspiring presentation from the first episode, the cinematography of Sacred Beasts is also quite lacking overall. There’s nothing truly unappealing or jarring, but nothing that really shows a passion beyond just pasting the content onto the big screen and calling it a day.Liza herself is a sore spot on the tone with her character design alone, made worse with frequent jokes about her sex appeal, even in mildly tense situations. When a negotiation occurs between characters focused on warfare, tactics, or emotional hangovers, chances are that Liza will be there to shatter the tone with her massive knockers, doing things like teasing Schaal or flirting with Claude. It’s moments like these where the hand of Sacred Beasts’ male illustrator really shows, and invites wonder of how the Sacred Beasts’ female writer could ever be content with scenes like these muddling the tone.Thankfully the visual quality gains better footing right around Hank’s confrontation with Roy, taking place at an arc that I consider one of the more fulfilling parts of the narrative. The showcase of Hank becoming softer and more sentimental while Schaal has grown tougher is a satisfying progression, bringing them on closer terms. This is certainly a highlight, but it’s a shame yet again that the show hasn’t done much to bring us close to their struggles.Throughout all its attempts to make me weep for the fallen Incarnates, To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts made me feel most sorrowful for its wasted opportunities. With every chance to do something great, it instead takes the easy way out. As the novelty wears off, the numerous flaws make themselves more and more clear. With all this considered, it certainly serves as a passable viewing experience, but it's a tragedy all the same. stepping stone for something greater in the future. If we put aside such a liberating outlook, this show is really an unfortunate result of what should have been much more. Enticing concepts are held within a product that lacks confidence in itself, with none of its concepts being properly fleshed out.With its first episode, Sacred Beasts starts off with a bang, kicking off with the beloved Incarnates unleashing their might on their helpless adversaries, with a majestic and opulent soundtrack to applaud and accentuate their heroic endeavors.

With all this considered, it certainly serves as a passable viewing experience, but it's a tragedy all the same."", ""To the abandoned sacred beasts is a very niche show that has come out this season. Many believe this is just a boring action show with no good characters or story. However, even if the story is lacking in areas, I still find this anime to be entertaining.The story focuses on the mental state of the Incarnates, beastly super soldiers, after a war. Our MC, Hank, has to kill the Incarnates because they've gone insane. However, the one fatal flaw of the series is its pacing. There wasn't enough time for the watcher to relate to these characters because they started being killed...in the 2nd episode. That makes the show feel like a typical monster of the week show. Mappa has done a fine job with the animation but the directing is nothing to be excited about. The characters are kind of interesting but overall they are bland. Although, in later episodes the story starts to pick up dramatically and has become quite fun.If you are someone who likes monster of the week shows, then you will definitely like this. There is something interesting about it that makes me watch it every week. Especially the last two episodes have been really fun. in the 2nd episode. That makes the show feel like a typical monster of the week show. Mappa has done a fine job with the animation but the directing is nothing to be excited about. The characters are kind of interesting but overall they are bland. Although, in later episodes the story starts to pick up dramatically and has become quite fun.If you are someone who likes monster of the week shows, then you will definitely like this.

Especially the last two episodes have been really fun."", 'So in the spring season this year, Fairy Gone was a thing and it kind of sucked. So much so that I decided to drop it halfway through. Its story was not gripping enough and its characters were so bland and stuck in mud in terms of their growth. It was not really a good show. So I bring Fairy Gone up because this show this season is rather similar in terms of its setting and certain plot elements (kind of) on paper. But MAAPA has been on a good roll in terms of quality anime they are animating lately so how does this entry...in their catalogue hold up?Sit back, relax and make sure that the inner beast inside you screams out as I present to you the anime review for To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts. Lets begin.Story: 6.5/10“WAR...is hell” - Ace Ventura, Ace Ventura: Pet DetectiveI will just leave that quote there. So the story begins with a civil war between the North and the South (they never say the country’s name so lets leave it at that). But the war swiftly favours the Northerners as they unleash a special unit of super soldiers called incarnates to fight on the battlefield. But there problems being developed as the incarnates start to lose their minds and become the savage beasts they are transforming in to. With the war over. Hank, the leader of the incarnates, must now hunt the other members of the incarnate squad and put them down before they cause any more harm. But when the daughter of one of the incarnates, Schaal Nancy Bancroft tags along with Hank, it may not be as clear cut as it seems.I will say that the first episode of the show feels rather rushed. I think if the first episode was expanded to two episodes, or the episode was twice the length, then the narratives developed here would make me more emotionally invested into the story and our characters. But the way they did it, it made me struggle to get really invested into this show. Thankfully, the show’s story structure and pacing does get better as the show goes on as it follows a monster of the week type setup that helps establish that not everything is clearly black and white and there is some grey area in the middle of it all as some incarnates still have some humanity left in them. But the problem is that the majority of the members of the incarnates don’t get much development (except for a couple scattered here and there). We get one or two flashbacks as to what they were like but that is about it. Which is a shame because the ones that do get more development, especially the incarnate in episode eight, are well done and made me invested. So it is inconsistent in that regard.Another thing this show likes to portray is that...well…war is hell. Not only for the citizens, but also for the incarnates themselves as they were tools for war and now have no purpose since the war is now over. It is shown here and there and expanded upon by the main antagonist of the series, Cain and gives context as to why he is doing the things he is doing. It is a subject that we have seen plenty of times and here, it is no different. It does though strike a balance between showing us and telling us which I think it did well so that it doesn’t bore the viewer. It is where the story is at its best as it explains to us why these incarnates should be put down to make sure that remnants from the war are removed and we can start moving forward. Because if these incarnates are still running around and are killing people, innocent or not, then is the war truly over?Characters: 6/10The main protagonist role is split between Hank and Schaal. We will start with Hank first. Being the former squad leader of the incarnates, it would make sense that he is not happy of putting down his former squad members. We see this in his expressions and tone of voice that he is not comfortable doing this and helps remind the viewer that, while he is an incarnate, he still has plenty of humanity left in him. His motivations though are not well developed. He fights because he swore an oath and as squad leader, he feels that this is his responsibility. That’s fine, but is other reason is that he wants to get revenge on Cain for betraying him and shooting someone Hank cared about. The main problem is here is that we don’t really see much of their relationship bloom enough to act as a good motivator. A told, not shown kind of situation that is rather lacklustre when you think about it.Schaal acts as the reminder that killing the incarnates is not all black and white. Being the daughter of one of the incarnates. We see her full of rage and spite towards Hank for killing her father but eventually starts to understand why they need to be put down. Her growth and understanding of Hank’s circumstances is one of the best things about this show. She acts as the voice of reason at times but is not always stupid enough to get in the way; only doing it when needed. She is plenty capable with her rifle but also knows her limits as to what she can do. She is easily my favourite character in this show and adds complexity to the situation since it can easily be just him Hank going around the country, killing the incarnates and moving on to the next.Cain though, the main antagonist in this series, could have been a lot better in my opinion. I understand his reasoning as he something more than human and doesn’t want to be cast aside now that the war is over. But the way he sees it is rather comical. He sees himself as a god and wants to rule the country because of his power. I think him rebelling because he doesn’t want to be a tool for war along with the rest of the incarnates. He does see that, don’t get me wrong, but the way he goes about doing it is rather stereotypically evil. I feel like he could have been a moral check and that would make him a more interesting antagonist. But he is just simply evil and that’s just it really.The rest of the cast are pretty much just there to act as supporting characters and not much else. Whether it is just to fight alongside Hank and Schaal or provide them with information. Claude Withers, the brother to Cain, felt like he had his own arc but he is rather uninteresting and his arc as well is rather uninteresting. So when the second half of the show comes and more spotlight is on him, he just comes of as a rather boring character.Animation: 5.5/10The animation is fine but could have been better in my opinion. The fights are serviceable and the art style and character designs are alright, but I feel like they could have been better. Which is a shame. MAPPA have been on a great roll lately with producing quality animation. Starting from Banana Fish from the summer season of 2018, they have produced Zombieland Saga, Dororo, Kakegurui xx and Sarazanmai. So following on after those shows, Sacred Beasts’ animation quality is rather lacklustre. It’s not bad and the fact the show doesn’t resort to CGI is impressive. But I feel like it could have been better at displaying these monster on monster fight scenes and if more effort was put into it, it would have been rather cool.Sound: 8/10The soundtrack does its job of help setting an atmosphere or matching the tone of the scene. Whether it would be a more somber scene or a fight scene, there always seems to be a ost that matches it. My favourite is played when Hank transforms into his incarnate form for the first time. The use of the orchestral and the increased paced of the music did feel like s**t was going to go down. It was definitely my favourite from this show.The opening “Sacrifice” by Mafumafu is paced good due to how it portrays both Hank and Schaal’s emotions through rather aggressive vocals and instruments, especially for Hank and his hatred towards Cain. It is also very well choreographed as well and the visuals manage to keep up with the pace of the song well. So I would say that this is a good opening when all things considered.The ending sequence “HHOOWWLL” by Gere x ARAKI shows off the incarnates displayed tapestry kind of way to let us see these powerful soldiers. They are also displayed in order of appearance in the show so we get to see what incarnates Hank is going have to hunt down. It’s a nice sequence to get you to relaxed after you finished an episode.ConclusionWell its certainly better than Fairy Gone which isn’t saying much. But there are problems in this show that does prevent this anime down from being a really great show. What’s annoying about that is that they are simple problems that I think, if addressed, could have turned this show into a great show. If it added more context, expanded on the first episode and improved its animation quality that MAAPA has shown from their previous shows, then this would be a great show. There are still some parts of this show that I like and kept me watching like the main leads and how it portrays that “WAR...is hell.” But it is also a show that could have easily been better and that’s what stings me the most about it.My Personal enjoyment: 6/10Overall score: 6.4/10 Recommendation: Consider it in their catalogue hold up?Sit back, relax and make sure that the inner beast inside you screams out as I present to you the anime review for To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts.

You have been warned.Based on a popular manga of the same name To the Abandoned sacred beasts is a fantasy, action and drama genre anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you introduce the concept of genetically created monsters whose sheer strength, cunning and intimidation serve to allow them to act as potent force multipliers and pair them with a faction that’s not only...outgunned but outnumbered by their opponents in a war that’s reminiscent of the American Civil war. On the surface To the Abandoned sacred beasts on first impression can be seen to be one that looks to focus on the usage of the series prominent cast who in this case are aptly named as the incarnates as they help the outnumbered North fight in the grueling civil war which serves as not just the series’ first main conflict but also unknowingly serve as the trigger point that would serve to as the fuel that would trigger the series main overall crisis but this can be said to be half right. While the incarnates introduction into the bloody and grueling battles that define the wars in which the cast fight in do well to showcase the potent power that the incarnates possess this at the same time also shows a myriad of feelings, hopes and desires that are hidden beneath the many soldiers that lay their lives on the line. While the incarnates that serve as the elite shock troops of the North are powerful beyond measure and have the support and admiration of the troops that they have fought alongside with it can be said that this is merely a surface impression for beneath their fake smiles the incarnates are merely seen as tools and are nothing more than weapons that are to be used to achieve victory and discarded when it is attained. However, this sense of hidden feelings, desires and hopes can also be seen within the incarnates themselves who despite understanding that they will never be treated as equals by their allies still wish to fight for their country and fight to create a world of peace like their compatriots. But alas things are not to be for the brave incarnates.While the series premise of having super soldiers whose ability to assume many forms of mythical creatures fight in a war that’s reminiscent of the worst wars of the 18th century can be said to be one of the main points that drew me to this series it is far from the only one. For while seeing the incarnates wreak havoc on the frontlines to aid the north in the war was entertaining what served as the main element that drew me to the series was the kind of feelings, desires and hopes that I feel lay beneath their fierce beast forms. Even as they are sent to fight in battle after battle to help the war effort just what kind of hopes, desires and wishes did they have for the world in which they are fighting so hard to create. Even if peace comes just what kind of world would they find. And more importantly, would humanity accept them as equals and treat them as such. The first episode for the series I felt was an interesting one in that while it did well in establishing not just the brutal war that was being waged on the continent that warranted the creation and deployment of the incarnates but  also show the kind of contrasting feelings that exist within both the hearts of the incarnates and the senior commanders who deploy them on dangerous missions. Perhaps more importantly the first ep also through the use of a well thought out twist force the lone sane member of the team to embark on a hard and brutal mission in which he must not only seek out his former comrades who have gone insane but also face them in a deadly battle that will only have one outcome. Duty, friendships and bonds have never been so hard to divide for a soldier but in order to give his former comrades the one last mercy that their former commander owes them Hank will fight with all his might and cunning to save his former charges. It is this combination of dark fantasy and a desire to understand the kind of hidden feelings that lay beneath the heart of each incarnate as they fight one last battle to bring resolution that can be said to draw me to this series and ensure that this series is one of the ones that I kept my eyes on.The overall story for the series takes place on the continent of Patria within the realms of the Nation of Patria. For 100 years the country of Patria has prospered thanks to the hard work of its people and the vigilance of its military but alas this soon changed when a mysterious energy source was discovered that soon caused the nation to split into two opposing sides which were the Northern Union that had the might of industry on their side and the Southern confederation which had the mass numbers that are needed to keep their vast lands secure. Despite the bravery of its soldiers the North was forced to make use of new and experimental tech that can be used to turn the tide with the most well known being the incarnates genetically engineered super soldiers whose ability to make use of abilities tied to their beast forms made them potent shock troops. Leading them was their charismatic and popular commander Captain Hank Henriette. But despite leading his men successfully through many brutal battles with honor and valor as the war neared its final stages and peace was visible on the horizon what was supposed to be a call for a celebration at the end of the war soon become the beginning of a nightmare thanks to a sudden betrayal. 2 years after the war and after awakening from a long coma Hank finds that even though the peace that he and his comrades have been fighting so hard for has now been attained his former friends and once the nations elite forces are now enemies of the state and who openly see their former homeland as their enemies. Faced with this harsh reality and desperate to deal with his former allies and give them the mercy that he feels that they deserve Hank is forced to embark on a brutal and grim mission in which he must locate and hunt down his former teammates and give them the one mercy that they all deserve which is to be vanquished in a clean death as all humans deserve.Schaal NancyNancy Schaal Bancroft portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk wars and Clockwork Planet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A teenage girl and the daughter of one of Hank’s fellow incarnates that served with him in the war Nancy who prefers to be called Schaal within the series on initial impressions was seen to be a kind, caring, gentle and innocent person by nature that lived a seemingly sheltered life with her father in a remote village far removed from the crisis that envelops other parts of the kingdom. As a result of this type of life Schaal was seen to be a polite person that always advocated for peaceful means to solve problems rather than use violence as others would have. However, while a kind and caring person Schaal was also someone that had a somewhat stubborn side to her which when combined with her determination made her a trusted ally to both her friends, charges and her father. Indeed, the relationship that Schaal had with her father can be said to be one that served as the very foundation of her life one that unfortunately came to a tragic end in front of her eyes one day.In the aftermath of her fathers tragic demise and the beginning of her journey to find out the truth of the matter Schaal’s personality began to gradually change as a result of both her journey with Hank and the reality of not just how the incarnates have fallen but also as a result of seeing the pain and suffering that they were causing to innocents across the land. While still remaining kind and polite to all she meets Schaal as the series progresses gradually becomes braver and more assertive willing to stand and fight for what she believes in even if it meant facing the ire of powerful men/beasts. This is shown well in the ever-evolving roles that she has in the fights that she and Hank engage in on their travels. While gradually becoming stronger both mentally and in terms of fighting abilities Schaal was also shown to have developed her perception skills which when used in combination with her innate sense of kindness and understanding allowed her to peer into the hearts of others and see the truth that they want to keep away from others. This within the series is demonstrated well in her relationships with Hank, Claude, Liza, and the incarnate Beatrice the latter of which can be said to affected Schaal strongly. Due largely to the manner of how they met within the series Schaal’s relationship with Hank, in the beginning, was a tense one however as the series went on and Schaal got to see first hand the kind of brutality that surrounded the incarnates as well as the cold, brutal and tragic path that Hank has to follow this opinion of hers gradually began to change. While at first disagreeing with the fact that violence was the only method to be used against the incarnates and seemingly put off by the fact that Hank viewed his former comrades as targets this opinion of hers gradually began to shift as she came to realize just how much sadness lay within Hanks's heart as he prosecuted his mission while at the same time seeing the kind of efforts that Hank was putting in to ensure that his former comrades died a clean death as human beings.As a result of seeing such a large sacrifice by Hank in his duties as well as seeing the kind of pain that exists in the world whether inside the incarnates, Hank and the soldiers and civilians that were caught up in the struggle Schaal gradually begins to realise that if she is unwilling to step forward and try to change the world with her actions that the darkness that had enveloped the world in the past would once again return a fact that is demonstrated well in her vow to Hank to serve as his foundation that would support him until the end a vow that shows well Schaal’s determination to support her partner while at the same time her desire to fight and create a world where humans and incarnates can stand on equal terms. The character of Schaal I felt was an interesting character that I felt was well designed and developed over the course of the series with her gradual evolution from a kind, innocent and caring person whose only worries was keeping the children that she manages safe to a girl who is not only brave and independent but also able to stand firm and fight against mythical monsters being especially well done.While Schaal’s initial views and attitude towards the grim mission in which Hank Prosecutes may seem to indicate that she will be a poor fit for an ally it can be said that rather the opposite is true. While Schaal’s kind, caring and friendly personality may be seen as a weakness by some this instead within the series can be said to be one of her greatest strengths for this allows her to not only understand and perceive the kind of feelings that people are reluctant to reveal but also allow her to make use of these revelations to help them resolve the core problems that serve to worry them and in the process allowing her to gather useful intel that can aid both Hank and herself in their missions. Though the pairing of Schaal and Hank may have seemed like a mismatch at first I believe that Schaal’s core temperament as well as the endless amounts of hard-fought knowledge that she gained in her travels with Hank served to not only make her a better person that’s more aware of just how dark the world is and how much it needs to change qualities that served to allow her to be an effective emotional support for Hank.HankHank Henriette portrayed by veteran voice actor Katsuyuki Konishi of Kakuriyo fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A member of the once renowned incarnates unit where he served as their leader and captain Hank on initial impression was seen to be a calm, composed and confident person by nature that fitted well the professional image of what a soldier should look like. Despite holding the senior rank of captain Hank was shown to be someone that had few signs of ego and indeed he was someone that was friendly, considerate and understanding of the men that served under him and was shown to be perceptive to their fears and needs. This is perhaps best shown in the speeches that he gives to his soldiers in that rather than try and rouse his men with the standard propaganda BS that will be the standard for the military Hank instead makes use of his own heartfelt words and his desire to see them all work together to make it through the battles and step into the future that they created to motivate them. While showing well the desire by Hank to ensure that every one of his men makes it through the war unharmed this also shows Hank’s innate sense of being an honest and fair person that prefers to state the truth in all things. Despite this noble attempt however a tragic act of betrayal soon ensured that not only did Hank end up losing two years of his life but also make his life a nightmare as his valued friends and comrades are now nothing more than dangerous enemies of the state that were harming the very innocents that they were supposed to be protecting.In the aftermath of such dark revelations that shook Hank to the core, Hank was forced to embark on a new cruel and brutal mission that would later serve as both his primary quest and his core purpose in life in this new dark world that the sacrifices of his men had created. In his new role as the hunter of incarnates Hank while retaining his calm and composed manner largely loses much of his positive nature instead replacing it with a sense of grim determination and a desire to perform his solemn duty by taking on and extinguishing his former friends. Despite his duty and the reality of the situation that’s facing him Hank was someone that can be said to still have hope that despite the madness that was affecting them that some part of their human self-remain inside his targets which is shown well in the initial fights that he has but unfortunately this was a fools hope. However despite this it can be seen that to Hank even if his former charges had become nothing more than mindless monsters who were harming the very people that they were supposed to be protecting that he still sees them as his comrades and as such feels that he owes them one last fight that should be fought with all their might. While one might argue that doing this will entail putting himself at too much risk it can be said that this desire to fight his former comrades at full strength one last time is an indication of Hank’s core desire to not only defeat them but also give them the one mercy that he as the hunter can give them which is to die as a human being and not a mindless monster.Due largely to both his duty as a hunter and the grim mission that Hank has been assigned too Hank in his new role was seen to be someone that preferred to keep a low profile and avoid forming any emotional bonds with others preferring to seemingly harden his heart and set about his grim task alone. However despite this loner like attitude of his Hank was shown to retain his innate sense of kindness and care towards others that he is willing to show to those people that have proven both their worth and trust in him which is shown in the developing relationship that he establishes with Schaal and Liza a bond that would eventually bloom into the very thing that Hank needed the most in his grim and brutal mission that he’s embarked on which was someone that both understands the kind of pain that he’s going through but at the same time willing to fight alongside with and shoulder that pain alongside him as his foundation and emotional support. The character of Hank I felt was an interesting character that was well designed and developed over the course of the series with his gradual evolution from a calm, confident and professional soldier who while fighting hard on the front did his very best to lead and protect his friends and charges on the field to someone who thanks to a harsh twist of fate was forced to hunt down his former comrades being especially well done.While seeing Hank transform from a confident and charismatic leader into a lone hunter was interesting what served to make Hank’s development as a character stand out was his developing relations with his allies as though his new duty and mission was a tragic one just like in his previous war Hank was not fighting alone and in a way the ever-developing relationship that he forges with both Schaal and Liza is one that’s reminiscent of how he fought in the previous war where he’s fighting hard to once more protect the country and its people from harm.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the series made excellent use of both the setting and the premise in creating the many fights that take place within the series. These fights while being well designed and developed also featured an interesting variety of scenarios and locations that resonated well with the former specialities of Hank’s former allies. Character designs wise I felt that both the human element and the incarnates were both well designed with the latter featuring a great variety of forms that serve to show not just how powerful the incarnates had been when they were allies as well as the kind of temperament in which they had that granted them that form. Combat animations wise I felt that the fights within the series while relatively simple ones too great advantage of both the incarnate’s beast forms as well as the skills and temperaments that they had in life to create many smooth but brutal fights that didn’t lack in variety in terms of tactics being used. Notable examples include the battle within the fortress and the fight against the gargoyle. Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme respectively which was sacrifice by Mafumafu and HhOOWWLL by GeroxARAKI. While both of these songs I felt were excellent ones as well as being haunting ones I felt that the former invoked within me a sense of both despair to an unjust situation and a determination to overcome it while the latter invoked a sense of childhood memories and a strong bond that had existed between them through war and thunder only to be broken. In terms of OST, I felt that it featured an excellent variety that allowed it to provide excellent situational music being able to provide both dramatic, calm and sombre tones when needed.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Katsuyuki Konishi, Ai Kakuma, Yoko Hikasa, and Yuuichi Nakamura all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Hank, Schaal, Liza, and Cain respectively. Additionally, while their characters were only featured in standalone episodes, I also felt that Mamiko Noto and Saori Hayami also did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters with Saori’s portrayal of the tragic Beatrice being especially impressive.Overall conclusionIn Overall To the Abandoned sacred beasts was an excellent anime that I really enjoyed seeing with its main strong points in my opinion being its unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters and its pairing of a standard war theme with some rather interesting themes that are as relevant to the soldiers fighting in the war as it is to the civilians that are caught up in it.Standard war based anime tends to focus on the soldiers and the civilians that fight within it and the consequences of the very actions that their deeds on the field cause to the overall war and while To the Abandoned sacred beasts does show this to a degree the great majority of the series takes a look at the many lingering questions that can result from any war. This within the series is shown in the guise of the incarnates and of the journey that Hank was forced to embark on. The incarnates within the series while formerly one of the north’s most elite military units on account of their unique strengths and abilities was as the war progressed were forced to realise that no matter how much they contributed to the overall war effort and no matter how much allies they save  they will never get a genuine word of approval from the brass who sadly see them as nothing more than weapons that once no longer useful is to be disposed off. Faced with the grim reality that for all the great sacrifices that they had made both as warriors and the sacrifices that they made in deciding to abandon their past civilian life and serve their country on the field is for naught its perhaps not surprising that such strong feelings would cause a poisoned dagger to form within their hearts. A dagger that would later explode with vengeance when their country seemingly turns on them.This tragic turn of events I felt made great use of the themes of war and peace as the incarnates while suffering as much pain as their fellow countrymen also had the misfortune of never being able to return to the life that they once had in their past lives thanks to their new forms and the scars that they gained from the war scars that will make them vulnerable to agitators like Cain whose innate cunning and past knowledge allowed him to easily see the turmoil that lay beneath the incarnates. This insight into the incarnates as people via the chance to look into their past civilian identities, the role that they played in the war and the fate that had befallen them at its end as well as the kind of scars that they gained from the war I felt was used to great effect to expand upon each of the incarnates that were featured within the series and preventing them from being simply one dimensional villains and instead  show that they are as much victims as their opponents were. When combined with the grim mission that Hank and Schaal are forced to embark on I felt that the incarnates desire to be recognised and remembered for the sacrifices that they made in the war by siding with Cain and Hank and Schaal’s desire to stop them served to make the story that much more compelling as to both sides both have an equally valid reason for fighting.As a final score, I would say that To the Abandoned sacred beasts deserves a final score of 8/10 on account of its unique premise, compelling story that skilfully weaved several difficult themes together, an excellent cast of characters that were voiced by excellent seiyuu’s and interesting battle scenarios that took great advantage of both the different terrain types that can exist in the setting as well as the nature of the beast types that the incarnates made use off. outgunned but outnumbered by their opponents in a war that’s reminiscent of the American Civil war. On the surface To the Abandoned sacred beasts on first impression can be seen to be one that looks to focus on the usage of the series prominent cast who in this case are aptly named as the incarnates as they help the outnumbered North fight in the grueling civil war which serves as not just the series’ first main conflict but also unknowingly serve as the trigger point that would serve to as the fuel that would trigger the series main overall crisis but this can be said to be half right. While the incarnates introduction into the bloody and grueling battles that define the wars in which the cast fight in do well to showcase the potent power that the incarnates possess this at the same time also shows a myriad of feelings, hopes and desires that are hidden beneath the many soldiers that lay their lives on the line. While the incarnates that serve as the elite shock troops of the North are powerful beyond measure and have the support and admiration of the troops that they have fought alongside with it can be said that this is merely a surface impression for beneath their fake smiles the incarnates are merely seen as tools and are nothing more than weapons that are to be used to achieve victory and discarded when it is attained. However, this sense of hidden feelings, desires and hopes can also be seen within the incarnates themselves who despite understanding that they will never be treated as equals by their allies still wish to fight for their country and fight to create a world of peace like their compatriots. But alas things are not to be for the brave incarnates.While the series premise of having super soldiers whose ability to assume many forms of mythical creatures fight in a war that’s reminiscent of the worst wars of the 18th century can be said to be one of the main points that drew me to this series it is far from the only one. For while seeing the incarnates wreak havoc on the frontlines to aid the north in the war was entertaining what served as the main element that drew me to the series was the kind of feelings, desires and hopes that I feel lay beneath their fierce beast forms. Even as they are sent to fight in battle after battle to help the war effort just what kind of hopes, desires and wishes did they have for the world in which they are fighting so hard to create. Even if peace comes just what kind of world would they find. And more importantly, would humanity accept them as equals and treat them as such. The first episode for the series I felt was an interesting one in that while it did well in establishing not just the brutal war that was being waged on the continent that warranted the creation and deployment of the incarnates but  also show the kind of contrasting feelings that exist within both the hearts of the incarnates and the senior commanders who deploy them on dangerous missions. Perhaps more importantly the first ep also through the use of a well thought out twist force the lone sane member of the team to embark on a hard and brutal mission in which he must not only seek out his former comrades who have gone insane but also face them in a deadly battle that will only have one outcome. Duty, friendships and bonds have never been so hard to divide for a soldier but in order to give his former comrades the one last mercy that their former commander owes them Hank will fight with all his might and cunning to save his former charges. It is this combination of dark fantasy and a desire to understand the kind of hidden feelings that lay beneath the heart of each incarnate as they fight one last battle to bring resolution that can be said to draw me to this series and ensure that this series is one of the ones that I kept my eyes on.The overall story for the series takes place on the continent of Patria within the realms of the Nation of Patria. For 100 years the country of Patria has prospered thanks to the hard work of its people and the vigilance of its military but alas this soon changed when a mysterious energy source was discovered that soon caused the nation to split into two opposing sides which were the Northern Union that had the might of industry on their side and the Southern confederation which had the mass numbers that are needed to keep their vast lands secure. Despite the bravery of its soldiers the North was forced to make use of new and experimental tech that can be used to turn the tide with the most well known being the incarnates genetically engineered super soldiers whose ability to make use of abilities tied to their beast forms made them potent shock troops. Leading them was their charismatic and popular commander Captain Hank Henriette. But despite leading his men successfully through many brutal battles with honor and valor as the war neared its final stages and peace was visible on the horizon what was supposed to be a call for a celebration at the end of the war soon become the beginning of a nightmare thanks to a sudden betrayal. 2 years after the war and after awakening from a long coma Hank finds that even though the peace that he and his comrades have been fighting so hard for has now been attained his former friends and once the nations elite forces are now enemies of the state and who openly see their former homeland as their enemies. Faced with this harsh reality and desperate to deal with his former allies and give them the mercy that he feels that they deserve Hank is forced to embark on a brutal and grim mission in which he must locate and hunt down his former teammates and give them the one mercy that they all deserve which is to be vanquished in a clean death as all humans deserve.Schaal NancyNancy Schaal Bancroft portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk wars and Clockwork Planet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A teenage girl and the daughter of one of Hank’s fellow incarnates that served with him in the war Nancy who prefers to be called Schaal within the series on initial impressions was seen to be a kind, caring, gentle and innocent person by nature that lived a seemingly sheltered life with her father in a remote village far removed from the crisis that envelops other parts of the kingdom. As a result of this type of life Schaal was seen to be a polite person that always advocated for peaceful means to solve problems rather than use violence as others would have. However, while a kind and caring person Schaal was also someone that had a somewhat stubborn side to her which when combined with her determination made her a trusted ally to both her friends, charges and her father. Indeed, the relationship that Schaal had with her father can be said to be one that served as the very foundation of her life one that unfortunately came to a tragic end in front of her eyes one day.In the aftermath of her fathers tragic demise and the beginning of her journey to find out the truth of the matter Schaal’s personality began to gradually change as a result of both her journey with Hank and the reality of not just how the incarnates have fallen but also as a result of seeing the pain and suffering that they were causing to innocents across the land. While still remaining kind and polite to all she meets Schaal as the series progresses gradually becomes braver and more assertive willing to stand and fight for what she believes in even if it meant facing the ire of powerful men/beasts. This is shown well in the ever-evolving roles that she has in the fights that she and Hank engage in on their travels. While gradually becoming stronger both mentally and in terms of fighting abilities Schaal was also shown to have developed her perception skills which when used in combination with her innate sense of kindness and understanding allowed her to peer into the hearts of others and see the truth that they want to keep away from others. This within the series is demonstrated well in her relationships with Hank, Claude, Liza, and the incarnate Beatrice the latter of which can be said to affected Schaal strongly. Due largely to the manner of how they met within the series Schaal’s relationship with Hank, in the beginning, was a tense one however as the series went on and Schaal got to see first hand the kind of brutality that surrounded the incarnates as well as the cold, brutal and tragic path that Hank has to follow this opinion of hers gradually began to change. While at first disagreeing with the fact that violence was the only method to be used against the incarnates and seemingly put off by the fact that Hank viewed his former comrades as targets this opinion of hers gradually began to shift as she came to realize just how much sadness lay within Hanks's heart as he prosecuted his mission while at the same time seeing the kind of efforts that Hank was putting in to ensure that his former comrades died a clean death as human beings.As a result of seeing such a large sacrifice by Hank in his duties as well as seeing the kind of pain that exists in the world whether inside the incarnates, Hank and the soldiers and civilians that were caught up in the struggle Schaal gradually begins to realise that if she is unwilling to step forward and try to change the world with her actions that the darkness that had enveloped the world in the past would once again return a fact that is demonstrated well in her vow to Hank to serve as his foundation that would support him until the end a vow that shows well Schaal’s determination to support her partner while at the same time her desire to fight and create a world where humans and incarnates can stand on equal terms. The character of Schaal I felt was an interesting character that I felt was well designed and developed over the course of the series with her gradual evolution from a kind, innocent and caring person whose only worries was keeping the children that she manages safe to a girl who is not only brave and independent but also able to stand firm and fight against mythical monsters being especially well done.While Schaal’s initial views and attitude towards the grim mission in which Hank Prosecutes may seem to indicate that she will be a poor fit for an ally it can be said that rather the opposite is true. While Schaal’s kind, caring and friendly personality may be seen as a weakness by some this instead within the series can be said to be one of her greatest strengths for this allows her to not only understand and perceive the kind of feelings that people are reluctant to reveal but also allow her to make use of these revelations to help them resolve the core problems that serve to worry them and in the process allowing her to gather useful intel that can aid both Hank and herself in their missions. Though the pairing of Schaal and Hank may have seemed like a mismatch at first I believe that Schaal’s core temperament as well as the endless amounts of hard-fought knowledge that she gained in her travels with Hank served to not only make her a better person that’s more aware of just how dark the world is and how much it needs to change qualities that served to allow her to be an effective emotional support for Hank.HankHank Henriette portrayed by veteran voice actor Katsuyuki Konishi of Kakuriyo fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A member of the once renowned incarnates unit where he served as their leader and captain Hank on initial impression was seen to be a calm, composed and confident person by nature that fitted well the professional image of what a soldier should look like. Despite holding the senior rank of captain Hank was shown to be someone that had few signs of ego and indeed he was someone that was friendly, considerate and understanding of the men that served under him and was shown to be perceptive to their fears and needs. This is perhaps best shown in the speeches that he gives to his soldiers in that rather than try and rouse his men with the standard propaganda BS that will be the standard for the military Hank instead makes use of his own heartfelt words and his desire to see them all work together to make it through the battles and step into the future that they created to motivate them. While showing well the desire by Hank to ensure that every one of his men makes it through the war unharmed this also shows Hank’s innate sense of being an honest and fair person that prefers to state the truth in all things. Despite this noble attempt however a tragic act of betrayal soon ensured that not only did Hank end up losing two years of his life but also make his life a nightmare as his valued friends and comrades are now nothing more than dangerous enemies of the state that were harming the very innocents that they were supposed to be protecting.In the aftermath of such dark revelations that shook Hank to the core, Hank was forced to embark on a new cruel and brutal mission that would later serve as both his primary quest and his core purpose in life in this new dark world that the sacrifices of his men had created. In his new role as the hunter of incarnates Hank while retaining his calm and composed manner largely loses much of his positive nature instead replacing it with a sense of grim determination and a desire to perform his solemn duty by taking on and extinguishing his former friends. Despite his duty and the reality of the situation that’s facing him Hank was someone that can be said to still have hope that despite the madness that was affecting them that some part of their human self-remain inside his targets which is shown well in the initial fights that he has but unfortunately this was a fools hope. However despite this it can be seen that to Hank even if his former charges had become nothing more than mindless monsters who were harming the very people that they were supposed to be protecting that he still sees them as his comrades and as such feels that he owes them one last fight that should be fought with all their might. While one might argue that doing this will entail putting himself at too much risk it can be said that this desire to fight his former comrades at full strength one last time is an indication of Hank’s core desire to not only defeat them but also give them the one mercy that he as the hunter can give them which is to die as a human being and not a mindless monster.Due largely to both his duty as a hunter and the grim mission that Hank has been assigned too Hank in his new role was seen to be someone that preferred to keep a low profile and avoid forming any emotional bonds with others preferring to seemingly harden his heart and set about his grim task alone. However despite this loner like attitude of his Hank was shown to retain his innate sense of kindness and care towards others that he is willing to show to those people that have proven both their worth and trust in him which is shown in the developing relationship that he establishes with Schaal and Liza a bond that would eventually bloom into the very thing that Hank needed the most in his grim and brutal mission that he’s embarked on which was someone that both understands the kind of pain that he’s going through but at the same time willing to fight alongside with and shoulder that pain alongside him as his foundation and emotional support. The character of Hank I felt was an interesting character that was well designed and developed over the course of the series with his gradual evolution from a calm, confident and professional soldier who while fighting hard on the front did his very best to lead and protect his friends and charges on the field to someone who thanks to a harsh twist of fate was forced to hunt down his former comrades being especially well done.While seeing Hank transform from a confident and charismatic leader into a lone hunter was interesting what served to make Hank’s development as a character stand out was his developing relations with his allies as though his new duty and mission was a tragic one just like in his previous war Hank was not fighting alone and in a way the ever-developing relationship that he forges with both Schaal and Liza is one that’s reminiscent of how he fought in the previous war where he’s fighting hard to once more protect the country and its people from harm.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the series made excellent use of both the setting and the premise in creating the many fights that take place within the series. These fights while being well designed and developed also featured an interesting variety of scenarios and locations that resonated well with the former specialities of Hank’s former allies. Character designs wise I felt that both the human element and the incarnates were both well designed with the latter featuring a great variety of forms that serve to show not just how powerful the incarnates had been when they were allies as well as the kind of temperament in which they had that granted them that form. Combat animations wise I felt that the fights within the series while relatively simple ones too great advantage of both the incarnate’s beast forms as well as the skills and temperaments that they had in life to create many smooth but brutal fights that didn’t lack in variety in terms of tactics being used. Notable examples include the battle within the fortress and the fight against the gargoyle. Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme respectively which was sacrifice by Mafumafu and HhOOWWLL by GeroxARAKI. While both of these songs I felt were excellent ones as well as being haunting ones I felt that the former invoked within me a sense of both despair to an unjust situation and a determination to overcome it while the latter invoked a sense of childhood memories and a strong bond that had existed between them through war and thunder only to be broken. In terms of OST, I felt that it featured an excellent variety that allowed it to provide excellent situational music being able to provide both dramatic, calm and sombre tones when needed.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Katsuyuki Konishi, Ai Kakuma, Yoko Hikasa, and Yuuichi Nakamura all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Hank, Schaal, Liza, and Cain respectively. Additionally, while their characters were only featured in standalone episodes, I also felt that Mamiko Noto and Saori Hayami also did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters with Saori’s portrayal of the tragic Beatrice being especially impressive.Overall conclusionIn Overall To the Abandoned sacred beasts was an excellent anime that I really enjoyed seeing with its main strong points in my opinion being its unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters and its pairing of a standard war theme with some rather interesting themes that are as relevant to the soldiers fighting in the war as it is to the civilians that are caught up in it.Standard war based anime tends to focus on the soldiers and the civilians that fight within it and the consequences of the very actions that their deeds on the field cause to the overall war and while To the Abandoned sacred beasts does show this to a degree the great majority of the series takes a look at the many lingering questions that can result from any war.

I don\'t think this show brings anything new to the table, and every aspect of this show has been done better elsewhere. This show is episodic, with the main characters hunting down a different incarnate each episode. This concept by itself is what made me want to watch it, because of how different it sounded from conventional series, with fights cool fights between these awesome monsters, but I don\'t think they could have botched this idea any worse than they did. Keep in mind, I haven\'t read the manga, nor do I...intend to, so many of these issues could stem from the source material for all I know. The first problem I have with the show is how they to pound the same message into your head every episode about how tragic the story is, and try to make you feel bad for the incarnates they have to kill. There was not a single time I felt bad for the incarnates, or truly felt their mission was justified, or made sense, especially for Schaal. The incarnates all have different powers, which, on paper, are very diverse and compelling, but they somehow failed to make a single incarnate feel interesting. The fights with these incarnates were all incredibly predictable. they all played out the same way. Each fight starts with Hank telling the incarnate what their doing is wrong, then the incarnate says some half-baked philosophical bullshit that is supposed to make the audience question if maybe the incarnate is right, they fight, Hank is about to lose, Schaal shows up, Hank thinks, ""Oh shit, I can\'t look like a bitch in front of my girl,"" pops off and wins, then they brood and say edgy bullshit about what they had to do and their ""mission"" for the rest of the episode. Every fight plays out this way. None of the fights have any weight. In the fights, injuries appear, disappear, and heal left right and center, making none of the damage Hank or the incarnates take feel meaningful. There is also the issue of how rushed the fights are, but I think this  this is mostly due to the  constrictions of the episodic format they were forced to use. As you can probably tell from all the edge I\'m talking about, the script is atrocious. If you hit pause at almost any time on any episode of the show, then think of the most ""anime"" line they could say next, 9 times out of 10 thats the next line. It is ridiculously predictable, to the point where it felt like they googled ""cliche overused lines in anime"" and were just copy pasting them in to pad for time. I see many people say that a redeeming factor of this show is the characters, but, personally, I hated every character in this show. Hank was your generic, hardened by tragedy hero who just wants to complete his mission. The thing with Hank was, despite being an incarnate, he didn\'t want to use his powers, or at least it was until he had to use them once then just forgot about it, using his power from the start of every fight from there on out. Schaal exists just to give Hank something to protect and show he is something past his gritty exterior, which is so cliche and overused it hurts the show more than helps it, and makes Schaal feel at times like shes just a damsel in distress Hank takes around with him for their enemies to use. There are a few times when Schall does something helpful, but most of the time she feels like a useless character. Speaking of their enemies, the main antagonist, Cain, was the only reason I got through this show. Every time he showed up on screen it turned the show from bad to laughably bad. He weirdly felt a bit like Dio from Jojo\'s, with lots of just yelling his name and the like. During the course of the show the dude somehow creates an entire fucking country out of nowhere to the west that is significantly larger then the one in which the main characters are in. He feels like a Bond villain in that he just gets a bunch of his guys killed by the good guys for no reason and has multiple opportunities where he could have just killed Hank but just decides not to because plot. The most hilarious of these instances is when Hank is badly injured and unable to fight, With Cain standing over his disheveled body. It felt like Hank might actually be dead, but instead of finishing him off he kidnaps Schaal, gives Hank an invitation to a Banquet where he is holding her hostage, just so Cain could try to kill him again at the banquet. Another problem the show has is that it at times just forgets the tone their trying to achieve and has weird attempts at humor through dumb jokes or visual gags via unrealistic character model changes which you might see in something like the comedic parts of Bungou Stray Dogs, mainly during conversations between Schaal and anyone who\'s not Hank, despite the main audience and appeal for this show bring how dark and edgy its supposed to be. In conclusion, its a jumbled, formulaic, super predictable mess that tries way to hard to be edgy. The concept of this show is genuinely interesting and I think if done correctly this show could have been great, but unfortunately, this is in my opinion the worst show to come out this season. intend to, so many of these issues could stem from the source material for all I know.

As I stated this is a steampunk vibe with a magic twist. The two main characters of Hank and Nancy are pretty interesting and as someone who enjoys weapon/firearm technology I find the revolving rifle that Nancy carries to be very interesting. I was not a fan of the supporting character of LT Liza, she clearly is meant to be a bit of comedic relief and fan service through her sexualization which kinda brought me out of the more serious tones...of the main characters and the overall show.Unfortunately there is only one 12 episode season to this show and it ends well before the story or even the arch is resolved.

Go watch it."", '[This contains no spoilers]I started this anime, expecting the usual hot mess you get from combining an industrial age war setting with a fantasy concept. Usually, anime like this get convoluted, lose focus and resort to blindly padding the plot with action sequences and tropes. They also end up allowing their sub-genres (like comedy and romance) to dominate the plot, and in turn, stagnate progression. The first episode forecasted that prediction, and I was certain that I didn\'t need to give it my usually 3 episode trail to determine if I liked it, so I forgot about it for a while. However, this week I...thought that I might stick to my original principal of giving shows a fair 3 episode trail and just use my train ride home from work to give it a fair try (since I had almost let Youjo Senki slip out of my redar for the same reason - only to realise that I had missed out on a great show). Surprisingly the second episode of this was quiet enjoyable and I realised I had misjudged it a little. Nevertheless, it didn\'t turn out to be a masterpiece or an anime that changed the formula that is commonly applied to the genre it belongs to, but it didn\'t it turn out to be a complete waste of my time either.Upon finishing this anime, I was curious to see the general consensus of it, and was surprised to see it had a bellow 7/10 average on MAL weeks after it fished airing, which is a score you\'d usually see on something that was so generic to it\'s core that it didn\'t even managed not to capture it\'s own target audience well enough to score a few free 10/10s. Perhaps it\'s because I score base on comparison to other series I\'ve seen (with consideration of my personal enjoyment included). It baffles me that this anime was in that score range when anime of it\'s same calibre would still on the top end of the 7/10 rating with worse art and music.To summaries my thoughts on the plot, the premise was not original in the slightest and reminded me of Berserk, minus the build up that made the betrayal in Berserk all the more dramatic. Nonetheless, the show did not divert the focus like I previously predicted and kept a good pace for it\'s progression, while changing up the formula each episode to not make it feel less like an episodic series where the reset switch was constantly pressed to extend the plot further. By this I mean, despite having the opportunity to include some comedy and romance (to potentially mask the fact that the story may not have substance), it went straight to the point and gave you the explanations you needed then jumped into to action sequences - which didn\'t last for more than a third of the episode and had dialogue that added to the plot instead of reiterations of it. Surprisingly, it didn\'t keep you with the same set of main characters and didn\'t always follow the format of ""discovery, investigation, interactions and fight sequence"" which it had for a few episodes - instead you had some episodes dedicated to looking into the backgrounds of characters who had been established as the villains of this anime (who were anomalies in a few cases and no villains) and you had some episode revisiting previous aspects of the plot to further reflect on them.On the other hand, the plot didn\'t avoid the many tropes you\'d find within these kind of story. It had randomly included a female solider character with oversized boobs to constantly act as the ice breaker and to be the token strong woman character (which I see inserted into plots like this sometimes) - despite some of the other main characters being able to easily assume that role more tastefully. Her presence was mostly unnecessary, and her lines could have been given to a less flamboyant character that didn\'t need time invested in them to have some boob physics for an unrealistically massive pair of breasts - which are boldly displayed (while mostly uncovered) during serious dialogue.... It honestly ruined the vibe of the anime.In addition, sometimes it felt like the plot didn\'t dig deep enough into the backgrounds of certain characters and missed opportunities to more comprehensively look into the mindset of villains. At times, there wasn\'t enough time spent in showing characters transition between different emotional states, so you would get stubborn and angry characters become submissive and calm in the next scene, which would break immersion. Also a lot of the lore of the setting wasn\'t explained at all or in depth, you were left to assume the setting was some 19th century industrial American cowboy setting, since that\'s all you could gather from the visuals. Though I do appreciate that unlike my experience with many anime of this genre, I wasn\'t subjected to a complicated explanation of the politics and factions and then expected to remember it, it spread out some of the explanations of politics and kept it simple - albeit too simple sometimes.In terms of the voice acting and music, it was decent and was good enough to set the mood. The voices fit each characters and the music usually fit the scene. I can\'t say it did anything amazing, but it didn\'t have any flaws either in my opinion, so ""good enough"" is the best way to describe it. However the art was indeed above average, with MAPPA not resorting to using CGI for some of the action every scenes with a lot of movements, body transformations and lib distortion. The designs for uniforms, hair styles and the look of guns were well thought out and considered the setting well. The backgrounds were the usual mediocre stuff, so I can\'t give it much praise, but overall there was a decent amount of effort displayed through the character design, animation and presentation style - and it was definitely was not an anime filled with lazy and loose animation and character designs like some of it\'s counterparts.So in conclusions, I think this anime isn\'t something to write home about, but it seems to also not be deserving of it\'s poor reception, when at best it was lacking certain element, rather than being completely void of them (like character development). I feel like the above average art and animation, as well as it\'s consistent focus on a premise (that is decent enough to enjoy) and the fact that the execution was not too shallow, boring or filled with repetition - makes this a 7/10 at the very least to me. I say that as someone who was probably not the target audience for this anime - since I\'m not being a huge fan of action fantasies and value dialogue heavy plot with character development over fight sequences. I managed to enjoy this series despite my preferences, and I think that\'s great. thought that I might stick to my original principal of giving shows a fair 3 episode trail and just use my train ride home from work to give it a fair try (since I had almost let Youjo Senki slip out of my redar for the same reason - only to realise that I had missed out on a great show).

Mainly due to it dealing with a civil war between between a Northern and Southern faction. Easily it was entirely reminiscent of the american civil war, even to the point that I thought it would actually be about that time period with a bit of magic sprinkled in. However that wouldn't be the case as it would instead take place in a fictional country of Patria that is inspired by 18th century America, although their civil war was more about magical resources rather...than about slaves and what not. Even then the show isn't about war itself but about the post-war reconstruction-esk era that followed after, with the war and time period serving as the narrative and aesthetic backdrop for the show. A show more focused on soldiers after the war who have become monsters both physically and mentally, and of a man who is yet to become one of them and is out for revenge.The story can be separated into two different parts with one focusing on the soldier/monster hunting and the other on the main character, Hank seeking revenge against a friend who betrayed him. They aren’t clearly divided, but more so they are interwoven. The soldier hunting is rather episodic as it mostly has Hank try to track down his former comrades. Comrades who were once under his command due to their ability to turn into monstrous beings known as incarnates. Yet it is because of this ability that problems arise, because not only do they physically change into monsters but their mentality starts to change, as they end up being a danger to those around them. However before anything could be done about them, they all went their separate ways after the war, which in turn lead to their former commander going after them.These were the more interesting parts of the show, mostly on it’s themes and ideas rather than the writing. Because even though the soldiers have become monster, to some capacity they still retain some human aspect of their former selves, for better or for worse. Since those human aspects become the core of the soldiers action when they are incarnates. Such as the cowardly soldier who made a super fortress to ward of enemies that would never come, or the righteous soldier who came back home and became an executioner against those who even made the most trivial of sin. It showcases how despite how similar they were to their previous selves their main ideas and beliefs have been monstrously skewed that they aren’t presented as mindless beasts, but victims trapped in their own demented minds. This in turn shines a light Hank’s motivation to hunt them down, not only to stop them from hurting others but to also give them some dignity to what bit of humanity they have left before he kills them.In a sense the incarnates are like an analogue to war trauma. Of men who go into battle and become literal monsters and then become human outside of battle. Yet the more they fight, the more their monstrous form sticks with them outside of battle. And after the war is over and they all go back to their homes literally changed by the war and try to relive a normal life, but in the end they cannot as they inevitably start to mentally change as well and end up becoming a danger. It’s certainly stretching it in terms of meaning in this show but it’s there even if it’s not handled all that well. Especially considering how the only way to help them is via mercy killing even when taking into consideration its 18th century-esk time period.However that is only one part of what the show is about as Hank is also hunting down a specific friend/comrade, Cain who betrayed him and what led to the events of the show as they are. Cain serves as the main antagonists so the show can have a more central focus and narrative pay out as the show continued on, instead of being episodic vignettes until there is no one left. The real shame is that despite wanting a more structured story, the end result is predictable, boring, and a disappointment from what had been presented before. Cain is the most basic foil there is as he is pretty much everything that hank isn’t even down to their monster forms being so predictable that it’s eye rolling. Even then as a foil there’s not much to write home about Cain because there’s not much to write about Hank. since so much of the episodes before were more focused on the characterization of the former soldiers that Hank didn’t have enough room to be properly fleshed out beyond the first couple of episodes. What is even more egregious is with Cain becoming the main focus, the other incarnates become less focused on and a good number of them become shafted as generic grunts.The only other character worth mentioning is Schaal who serves as a sort of mediator between the audience and the story. She follows around Hank trying to see if his actions towards the other incarnates, such as her father, are justified.  It all does come to a head by the second half as she develops more as a character but it really comes off as expected since that was what her character was about.Everything else about the show can be passed of as serviceable. But the one thing worth noting is the fact that the story takes place in a pseudo-america setting. Because despite the fact that the maps look similar and that they sort of have similar events, there isn’t anything about the setting that captures the essence of the country. It has no identity and doesn’t bother even copying the identity of americana. Instead all there is left are non-descript villages and towns that are only slightly different from the non-descript villages and castle towns in a psudeo-European settings. The only interesting parallel it had was with Cain mustering the equivalent of southern redeemers against the equivalent of scalawags and carpetbaggers. but in the end that gets quickly shafted aside.Sacred beast certainly wasn’t a show I expected much out of during it’s reveal. It came off looking more like derivative schlock, and while it did have that, it also had something more that made it interesting. It had somber stories of soldiers terribly affected by war meeting their end. Even Hanks journey for revenge against Cain had its moments. However there really wasn’t enough in terms of storytelling and characterization that made the show engaging or satisfying. Just enough that it can be a serviceable adaptation, that will only be forgotten a few seasons from now. than about slaves and what not.

I can at least state that this was better then Fairy Gone. That's not really a good bar to surpass but it is a bar. To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts is one of those shows that has a lot of things going for it. A good animation studio, a solid premise and from the PVs, a way better version of what Fairy Gone was going for, but this looks a little less boring. Emphasis on 'little'.The biggest problem for this show is apparent in the first episode in the series. It starts off mid-war where we see these 'sacred beasts' tackle an army fortress...and win it with ease. Our main character Hank Henriette (don't worry, the names got even stupider) is the commander of this squad and as we find out these humans can transform into the beasts and we get to know some of them in the first episode. In that same episode, we find out that the beasts can take over the humans minds and make them go rampant. After this, a whole bunch of stuff happens and the episode ends off with the war ending and Hank planning to kill his comrades after he is betrayed by a certain one.This whole beginning episode is fine setup, but it runs into the same problems Fairy Gone has with it's initial premise. You have this cool idea with a cool world and you have this war with these awesome beasts creatures and you decide... to focus on what happens after it? This show is worse with it, because when we see Hank (or as I like to call him Hank-Hank the killing man) go on killing spree, they have to force flashbacks in because they didn't develop any of these soldiers until their premiere episode. It's a real detriment to the show and it's an important thing to get right.The sad part is that the animation is actually solid for the majority of it. Yeah, it fairly standard, but MAPPA aren't being lazy with some of the shots either. The music is also fantastic since it's so easy to get hyped with it. It's not the best composition, but it does it's job of getting the viewer hyped (and the ED is really solid too).Another big problem with the show is it's characters. Hank as a character is fine, but everyone else either lacks in interest. Schaal, who's supposed to be our secondary protagonist feels more like a minor character if anything else. She has 2 of the 12 episodes that's just her and yet she's overshadowed by a dumb twist and a way more interesting best, separately. They just do nothing to make her do anything interesting. You can tell the writing isn't the best when the penultimate episode has to remind you how close the main two characters are. Lisa and the dude that reminded me of the main character form Galactic Heroes barely add anything to the whole that is this show.  However, the villains in this are something special man. Cain Fucking Madhouse (Yeah, his real last name is Withers, but he changed so his name is Madhouse to me) is a gem. He's an unorthodox dictator who is so quantifiably dumb that I can't comprehend. His companions include a demon loli and a dominatrix I believe (she does nothing, so who cares).While the show can be fun when it goes stupid, especially towards the end, but it's overall just kinda boring. None of the episodes aren't very interesting and for the majority, I would just watch with usual sighs and blank staring. I could see people enjoying this, but not for me fully. I could watch a season two, but if it's more of the same then ill probably drop it.Did this show need this long of a review? No, but I decided to do that anyway.Story: 4/10Art:6/10Sound:6/10Character:3/10Enjoyment: 5/10Overall:5/10 and win it with ease.

Overall, it left a bad first impression on whoever watched it and word of mouth of its dreadful story spread through the community like wildfire. By this point you are probably wondering what does Fairy Gone have to do with To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts? Anime has existed long enough to the point where some begin to feel like copy cats or they have similar features. Almost like a sense of deja vu. MyAnimeList has a recommendations feature for...this very purpose. More often then not you will see these trends through the seasons. Because of this people will often love whatever came first and then write off whatever came after it as a cheap imitation. Or if the first one sucked then the person could just ignore the second one all together. By that way of thought, To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts is Fairy Gone’s copycat ripoff... or is it? (Warning: this review contains bad puns)Story wise To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts has Fairy Gone best in that it is short, sweet, and to the point. It’s a simple story of revenge. The main character was wronged by the antagonist and then has to hunt him down along with his former comrades who are suffering from a terrible case of PTSD where they lose their minds and feel the need to go on murderous killing sprees. Rather than see his friends become monsters he decides to put an end to them while they are still human. To do this he basically has an exploding spear gun though most of the time he just hulks out into his beastly form. For as many times as he uses that form you would think it would take its toll and he would end up in the same state as his comrades but, he has this special power called being the main character.As for the other characters there’s Cain Madhouse (yes that’s his real name) who I’m pretty sure is evil just for the sake of being evil who is being hunted down by the hero Hank White Fox (not his real name but he’s a white wolf so I think it should be and it would keep the studio trend going). Together they form the revenge crux of the story. A young woman tags along by the name of Ms Trigger (get it because she carries around a gun... I’m sorry I’ll stop now) who happens to look exactly like Hank’s former lover. And of course every anime needs a completely useless character for the audience to ogle at which ain’t a bad thing mind you. Oh and there’s this loli vampire because why not.While it looks like I’m being harsh on this anime, I’m really not. It’s a straightforward actiony monster of the week type of show. It does nothing to offend nor does it do anything to wow. Art and animation is decent. I will give it some bonus points though for not making the beasts CGI. Both the OP and ED were a good listen and do not recommend skipping either if you do decide to check this out.So, what’s the verdict then? Is this a Fairy Gone rip-off? Honestly, no. While Fairy Gone and To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts share a lot of similarities, fundamentally they differ in one key area. One knows what it is, and the other doesn’t. I know what it is. It’s an ok watch. this very purpose. More often then not you will see these trends through the seasons. Because of this people will often love whatever came first and then write off whatever came after it as a cheap imitation.

It’s an ok watch.', 'Out of all the complaints I could make about To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts, the most galling and unforgivable one is that there’s not technically anything wrong with it. It has a strong, memorable premise that lends itself to a lot of different possibilities. From that premise, it uses its fantastical elements to explore mature, interesting themes that all play into its larger point. The characters all have recognizable emotional arcs that take them from point A to point B through a series of logical beats. The story makes decent sense, without ever asking you to stretch your suspension of disbelief beyond the point of...no return. The animation is unremarkable, but generally solid and gets the job done. In all honestly, Sacred Beasts is probably the most outright “functional” anime series I watched in the summer of 2019. There’s nothing really you can point at and say, “This is bad filmmaking” or “This is indefensible storytelling.” And yet, every piece of it is also just uninspired enough, just pedestrian enough, that the overall impact is one of sinking into a thick, mealy porridge of mediocrity that just grows harder and harder to stomach as time goes on. I can’t remember the last time a basically “okay” show left me this angry and frustrated, this unmotivated to click the next episode button whenever Monday rolled around. That’s gotta be some sort of achievement, though even mentioning “achievement” in the same vicinity as this show feels like an insult to achievement.The story, for what it’s worth, centers around the fictional nation of Patria, which is just recovering from a North vs South Civil War and trying to heal the broken bonds of its people (any references to the American Civil War are strictly aesthetic). For the most part, everyone seems to be doing a decent enough job picking up their lives and returning to some semblance of normalcy. But then there’s Hank Henriette, leader of the special “Incarnate” squad that helped win the war for the North. You see, in order to win the war, Hank and his teammates agreed to be the subject of scientific experiments that turned them into being called Incarnates, capable of transforming between their human forms and some manner of monster. Hank was a werewolf, one of his teammates was a siren, another was a gargoyle, yet another could become a giant rhinoceros dinosaur thing called a Behemoth, another could just turn into a straight-up dragon, you get the idea. They were incredibly powerful, and that power helped them turn the tide of war when it was needed most. But while the Incarnates certainly did their job well as half-man-half-monster Super Soldiers, their new forms stared weighing on their mental state, threatening to drive them mad as they lost themselves to their animalistic natures. So as the war drew to a close, they all made a vow to each other; should any one of them start losing their humanity, their companions would strike them down while they still had some semblance of dignity left.Well, as you can imagine, things went belly up, one of the Incarnates turned traitor (though in all honesty, the fact that his name was literally Cain Madhouse should have rung all the alarm bells), and Hank was knocked out of commission for a good few months. When he recovered, the war was finally over, but all of his former companions were in the throes of beast madness, wandering the reformed country they once fought to save and tearing it apart in their wake. So in keeping with his oath, Hank sets out to bring his friends down, while pursuing the trail of the traitorous Cain in hopes of stopping him fro causing any more damage. Along the way, he enlists the aid of Schall Bancroft, the daughter of one of the Incarnates, who wishes to understand why her father and his companions need to be killed without hope of saving them. The stage is set for a series of episodic adventures focusing on Hank, Schall, and the occasional military assistance tracking down the incarnates, facing them in brutal beastman-on-beastman battles, and bringing closer to these war heroes who have become lost in a world without war, all while growing ever closer to Cain and his schemes.See, if you knew nothing about this show but that premise, you’d probably be really excited to check it out. Because that sounds fucking awesome, right? A tragic, macho tale of veterans struggling with PTSD and trying to find their place in the world now that their combat prowess is nothing but a liability, punctuated by big, nasty action scenes with blood and fur flying everywhere? You’d be stupid to not at least give it three episodes. And like I said, there’s not really anything wrong with it on a foundational level. Each episode focuses on Hank and his crew chasing down a different Incarnate, and they all regularly have just enough of their humanity remaining to explore a different aspect of how war effects those who fight in it. One incarnate is so traumatized that he builds himself an increasingly impenetrable fortress to keep him safe from any potential harm. Another’s gone full gun nut xenophobe. Another used to be a doctor trying to save lives, but embraced slaughter when he realized that he was praised whether he saved people or killed people. And their inevitable deaths are all suitably poignant as they pass away with one last scrap of humanity intact, trying to make sense of where they went wrong and why the world they fought to protect no longer seems to have a place for them. There’s no real reason why Sacred Beasts shouldn’t have been good.And yet, the more I watched, the more I came to hate it.The problem is, while everything is basically functional and all that, nothing has any soul. Everything technically “works”, but nothing actually connects, because every piece is the least interesting version of itself possible while still not technically being “bad”. The animation isn’t really janky or awkward, but it’s blocky and stiff and ugly to look at, and most of the battles don’t have the cathartic oomph they need as a result. The one-off Incarnates all have understandable traumas, but with maybe a couples of exceptions they’re all laid on too thick and treacly to respect. The characters all make enough basic sense, but they’re all written so trite and paper-thin that they warm right back around to being annoying. Hank is a brooding bore, Cain is a one-dimensional cackling psychopath, there’s an arrogant military general who gets exactly the kind of story you’d expect him to get, and Schall is maybe the worst example of the generic “tough girl damsel” I’ve ever seen. Her only role is to whine and complain about how unforgiving Hank is to the Incarnates, preaching in a wobbly voice constantly on the verge of tears about how there must be some humanity left in them worth saving, and it’s all laid on so painfully, agonizingly thick that almost every time she was on screen I could feel my teeth grinding in aggravation. At least she gets more interesting and palatable once she undergoes her requisite “My innocence is lost and now I’m a stoic-ish badass too” arc in the back half of the series, but the damage is already done.“Trite” really feels like the right word to sum up this show, now that I think about it. Sacred Beasts treats its story at a bare surface level, but it lays on the operatic melodrama so thick that the dissonance just ends up grating on you. The characters all emote explosively, the dialogue is designed for big, dramatic confrontations, the music is bombastic and tragic, but all the while the actual story they’re propping up hasn’t done nearly enough to justify even 10% of the sturm and drang. Everything is basic, everything is obvious, everything is lazy, and as a result, everything is dull, dull, dull. It does pick up a bit in the second half, with some battles and story turns that feel marginally more meaningful, but it’s not enough to wash off the frustration and exhaustion Sacred Beasts leaves you with. It also doesn’t help that this show’s got some of the most inopportune fanservice I’ve seen in a while (at least outside of Fire Force, but that’s a rant for another day). There’s an officer in the military whose entire purpose seems to be walking around with her massive tonhonkerabongos all but popping out of her half-unbuttoned jacket like someone out of Prison School, and the show always makes a gag out her at the worst possible time, killing whatever serious tone it was trying to build up. Here’s a thought: if you’re trying to write a grim, serious story about metaphorical PTSD and the tragedy of war, maybe save the “lol tig ol bitties” gags for another day.To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts isn’t the worst show ever, but it makes me angry in a way that most basically okay shows don’t. From such a great premise, from such solid storytelling, this show manages nothing but pasteboard mediocrity that unsuccessfully tries to pretend it’s anything better. It’s a limp piece of wet cardboard steadfastly refusing to be lit while proclaiming itself a raging fire regardless, and that dissonance only gets harder and harder to stomach the more I think about it. Themes with this much potential deserved more in-depth exploration, battles this conceptually cool deserved bigger impacts, and a title this kickass deserved a much better story to do it justice. no return.

I would say, I was a bit disappointed with this one, based on the expectations I had for it before the season started. None the less, I don't think it was a horrible anime, just, for my money, got a bit repetitive? For a majority of the anime, it felt like things always played out roughly the same way in every episode, and because of this, I found there to be a lack of variety or eagerness in waiting for the next episode.Story: I thought the story was okay. I think they started things off strong with...episode one, and had enough of a twist at the end of it, to make me excited for the next episode and beyond. However, after the first episode, the way things played out just seemed very stale after a while. Things got fairly predictable after a little while. Not to say I disliked it, I just didn't find myself yearning for the next episode every week.Art: Honestly, I think the art was solid. Nothing insane, but, it got the job done. I think the character designs, and their incarnate forms, were all at least mildly interesting.Sound: I absolutely loved the OP for this anime. I thought the voice acting was decent, and with the wide variety of incarnates, humans, weather elements, I thought they did an okay job with the sounds. From traversing a snow covered field, to walking through a stone dungeon, I didn't notice anything egregious as far as sounds went.Character: I thought the character work was the most solid point of the show. I found myself enjoying the dynamic of Hank and Schaal. I found myself hating a certain character after the first episode. I also thought they did a good job of depicting the emotions that ran through Hank on his journey, as well as his fellow incarnates along the way. On several occasions I noticed myself feeling bad for the incarnates, I think this was because they did a decent job of portraying that they weren't necessarily evil, at least not on their own accord.Enjoyment: Like I said in the story portion, I found myself losing enjoyment with this, because of the lack of variety between episodes. They always seemed to follow the same course, with the exception of some of the later episodes, for obvious reasons.Overall, I give it a 7/10. Far from perfect, but was enjoyable to me none the less (for the most part). I will watch the second season of this, when/if they get around to it. episode one, and had enough of a twist at the end of it, to make me excited for the next episode and beyond.

I will watch the second season of this, when/if they get around to it."", 'Katsute Kami Datta Kemono-tachi e is yet another disappointment of the season. Or perhaps it\'s not, since I never had any expectations to begin with.The basic premise of the show is as follows: A war over territory and power is waged on a newly-found continent of Patria. The sides in this war are the North and The south. The North is losing, so they create a squad of mutant supersoldiers to turn the tides in their favor. And they do. But now the mutants, or as the show calls them ""Incarnates"" are losing their minds and are going berserk, so their former leader Hank...Henriette steps up to kill his former comrades.Sounds interesting? Well, I got some bad news for you. The execution of this idea leaves a lot to be desired.Story.I\'ll start with the story, since it\'s already outlined previously. The show follows the Monster of The Week premise for the majority of the episodes. In each of them the MC finds, fights and kills one of the Incarnates, while Schaal, his frienemy, stands around and does nothing. Episodes lack substance, both visually and narratively. If you\'ve seen one of them, you\'ve seen them all. I can\'t stress enough how few surprises they actually pack. Will Hank kill that guy? Yes, he will. Will any other character do anything? No, they won\'t. It\'s like that for about 10 of the show\'s 12 episodes. The finale is underwhelming ever compared to the rest of the ordeal, cleary suggesting that there will be a sequel. Because of that it lacks any sense of resolution.Characters.The protagonist Hank Henriette, who looks like someone\'s furry OC (don\'t steal) is the only one of them who actually does things. He kills all of the Incarnates, save for one (and even that is up to debate), he makes moral choices, he moves the story forward. He does so much, that this show could literally only have one character and nothing would\'ve changed. That is not to say he\'s a good character. He\'s honestly decent. Compared to the rest of them, at least. Design-wise, his human form looks like your typical mid 2000s edgelord. You know the one. The coat-wearing, haircolor-changing, revolver-wielding sadboy, burdened with the loss of a loved one. I couldn\'t help but thinking that the authors were a decade late with this design.The other protagonist is Schaal Bancroft. She\'s the worst character in this anime season, let alone this show. Throughout the show she does NOTHING. She is a daughter of one of Hank\'s pals he had killed earlier, so it\'s understandable that she despises him. Or should despise him. Upon meeting the MC she almost instantly forgets she\'s supposed to hate him, and follows him religeously instead, while sometimes saying that like ""killing the incarnates is totally bad, maybe let\'s not do that?"". And yet she does nothing to stop it. And when you think she\'s finally about to do something useful, syke, think again! Well, at least her design is nice, I\'m really into it.The others. I\'m just gonna put the rest of the cast here, since they\'re equally useless, but not actively bad on their own. There\'s a big tiddy lieutenant and I think I have a pretty good idea of how she even got the rank in the first place. Outside of being a butt of most jokes, she does nothing. We never see her fight, and never even see her command the troops on the battlefield. Why does she even exist? Beats me.Claude Withers, who is the main villian\'s younger brother, is yet another character only pretending to do something. And to be fair, a couple of times his actions led to some consequences. Not bad, concidering what show he\'s a part of. But most of the times he\'s led by the plot, and saved countless times by the one and only Main Character.There are also two old dudes with mustaches, I can\'t differentiate between the two, so there\'s that.Cain Mudhouse. Or maybe Madhouse, the sub isn\'t sure about that one. The antagonist of the story. He believes that the Incarnates have been had by the govt and in reality should be the ones who rule over the country. It\'s pretty standard stuff, but it makes sense. As a character, he\'s a mustache-twirling bad guy, with no redeeming qualities. If there\'s a puppy to kick, you can be sure he\'ll kick it. His abilities are (do not steal) teleporting behing you, exloding peoples\'s heads, mind control(?), turning into some kind of red mist, making copies of himself, being invincible, (except for when the MC hits him like really hard). He is utterly OP and yet we have no way of knowing the extent of it, making the fights lack any sort of weight, as the audience has no idea what is even capable of hurting him.Sound. It\'s alright.Animation. This is one of the ugliest shows of this season. The characters are often misshapen, they look like stickfigures when more than 5 feet away from the camera, sakuga is almost non-existent. The perspectives are often warped to the point that at certain times everything looks like it was drawn by a school kid. Not often, but it does happen. Oh, and the incarnates themselves look like they came out of a saturday morning cartoon, both design-wise and animation-wise.So, is it worth watching? Hell no.Is it worth watching ironically? Well, there\'s this one moment, when Schaal\'s father comes back from the war as a FUCKING DRAGON. She stares at him for maybe 5 seconds, he extends his claw to her, she touches it. And then she\'s instantly cool with the idea. Hell, she seems to be loving it. It was surreal. But outside of that one thing, this show\'s not even ""so bad it\'s good"". If anything, it\'s so bad it\'s bad. Henriette steps up to kill his former comrades.Sounds interesting? Well, I got some bad news for you.

I\'m just gonna put the rest of the cast here, since they\'re equally useless, but not actively bad on their own. There\'s a big tiddy lieutenant and I think I have a pretty good idea of how she even got the rank in the first place. Outside of being a butt of most jokes, she does nothing. We never see her fight, and never even see her command the troops on the battlefield. Why does she even exist? Beats me.Claude Withers, who is the main villian\'s younger brother, is yet another character only pretending to do something. And to be fair, a couple of times his actions led to some consequences. Not bad, concidering what show he\'s a part of. But most of the times he\'s led by the plot, and saved countless times by the one and only Main Character.There are also two old dudes with mustaches, I can\'t differentiate between the two, so there\'s that.Cain Mudhouse. Or maybe Madhouse, the sub isn\'t sure about that one. The antagonist of the story. He believes that the Incarnates have been had by the govt and in reality should be the ones who rule over the country. It\'s pretty standard stuff, but it makes sense. As a character, he\'s a mustache-twirling bad guy, with no redeeming qualities. If there\'s a puppy to kick, you can be sure he\'ll kick it. His abilities are (do not steal) teleporting behing you, exloding peoples\'s heads, mind control(?), turning into some kind of red mist, making copies of himself, being invincible, (except for when the MC hits him like really hard). He is utterly OP and yet we have no way of knowing the extent of it, making the fights lack any sort of weight, as the audience has no idea what is even capable of hurting him.Sound. It\'s alright.Animation. This is one of the ugliest shows of this season. The characters are often misshapen, they look like stickfigures when more than 5 feet away from the camera, sakuga is almost non-existent. The perspectives are often warped to the point that at certain times everything looks like it was drawn by a school kid. Not often, but it does happen. Oh, and the incarnates themselves look like they came out of a saturday morning cartoon, both design-wise and animation-wise.So, is it worth watching? Hell no.Is it worth watching ironically? Well, there\'s this one moment, when Schaal\'s father comes back from the war as a FUCKING DRAGON. She stares at him for maybe 5 seconds, he extends his claw to her, she touches it. And then she\'s instantly cool with the idea. Hell, she seems to be loving it. It was surreal. But outside of that one thing, this show\'s not even ""so bad it\'s good"". If anything, it\'s so bad it\'s bad.', ""Katsute Kami Datta Kemono-tachi e (2019)A show of high potential that failed and doesn't need to come back. A classic 12-episode intro to manga/novel. The show has a pretty good first couple of episodes but then it falls hard. I like the storyline of hunting the monsters and not all is as it seems and so on. I enjoy the usual story of weapons that everyone needed and when they win are discarded. Much like the fate of heroes in some fantasy settings. This is the US Civil War with monsters.The art honestly looks good if it was made in like 2012 but for 2019...it looks dated, grainy and just plain old. If that is what they wanted to do then great. What it does is make it something I don't think will be rewatched and in 5 years will drop off anyone's list if they haven't got around to it.The music is fairly fitting but overly dramatic at times. Shouting is not the best and the show lacks any emphasis behind any action it does, sounds very flat.The characters want to be deeper than they are. They try to set them up but then they fall apart too quickly. One minute they have absolute dedication and the next just like meh I am done.The show had potential and in the end, it was rushed at the end with a plot that didn't provide enough interest. The fights are good, it is mostly enjoyable but at the same time, it does very little for me in progress or development. 4/10. it looks dated, grainy and just plain old.

The north created fearsome beast like super soldiers known as Incarnates in order to win the war. However, after that the Incarnates returned to their homes still possessing their tremendous powers. Furthermore, they all seemed to be ticking time bombs destined to lose their humanity and go on rampages. As such, the government decided to eliminate all Incarnates.Hank, the former captain of the Incarnates and one of the most powerful,...plays a key part in that as he travels the nation hunting down problematic Incarnates. This quest ultimately brings him to kill the father of Schaal, who swears revenge upon him. However, she quickly discovers that the situation is more complex than she thought and that Hank is facing his own inner conflicts while carrying out his mission. She begins following him on his journey hoping to come to a better understanding of what is going on and why it must be the way it is. However, the vice captain of the Incarnates, Cain, is organizing the Incarnates to resist their impending demise with plans to reignite the flames of war.The first episode and the second somewhat are a prologue that helps set this premise up, but after that it focuses on Hank and Schaal going to confront various Incarnates. I felt that this was when the anime was at it’s best. The insanity of each Incarnate is based on their own trauma’s and complexes and the writing does a pretty good job of conveying the nuances to how those result in them taking the extreme actions they do. In a way this is like an extremely exaggerated look at PTSD and other issues that soldiers often face when they return from battlefields. I wouldn’t say it’s easy to sympathize with them, but the core message that the anime is trying to convey of them being human being trying their best to live and not just mindless monsters is conveyed very clearly. Alongside that, it does a pretty good job of fleshing out Hank and Schaal’s characters and showing slow but steady character growth in Schaal.As the story progresses the anime begins focusing more and more on an overarching plot regarding Cain and his Incarnate rebellion. I felt the story surrounding him was very weak, and thus the anime gets much weaker towards the end. The first issue is that it’s written incredibly bizarrely. Cain actually does seem to have a point that could be thought of as reasonable: that it was completely unfair that the government had turned them into Incarnates and used them to win the war, but now that them becoming Incarnates was making them hard to deal with the government was simply trying to get rid of them all. So there actually was a lot of potential to write a good villain with depth.However, for some reason the writing completely glosses over that and instead just tries to make him and everyone on his side cartoon villains. This results in a story completely lacking in any complexity. I also felt that pretty much all the parts focused on him had a noticeable drop in writing quality. The pacing felt slower than it should have been. Despite that, characters changing motivations and emotional states weren’t properly developed. The ending is also at a point that’s pretty in the middle of things plot wise so it’s not a very satisfying point to end on, though the final battle was pretty great.The art and animation are pretty good. The action isn’t especially amazing, but it’s pretty solid. I also really liked the aesthetic of the series overall. It draws heavily from Civil War era America, though with some steampunk elements. And the Incarnates are based on monsters and such from all sorts of western mythologies and literature. But even beyond that I really liked the character designs in general and the general design principles in regards to how it handled things like faces which gave it a pretty unique look. The soundtrack also worked really well and was quite epic at times. The OP is also pretty great in terms of the song and visuals. The ED is decent in both regards. plays a key part in that as he travels the nation hunting down problematic Incarnates.

I have not read the manga.I felt this anime had a ton of potential that it never lived up to, but let me preface with two confessions:1. I watched this in the background while doing other things. It had about 65% of my attention. I did go back and rewatch parts if I was suddenly confused or lost. It didn't help. I don't know if this was a manga first (most are) and there was an assumption that we'd read it ... or what, but it was easy to get lost where it concerned character actions and...motivations.2. I didn't read the blurb about it before I started watching it. I don't know if I would have watched it if I had. I felt that it started off fantastic. It was intense and unexpected and awesome. But because I hadn't read the synopsis, I felt it was misleading and was quickly disappointed when it changed direction.***This review contains mild spoilers, nothing that you wouldn't figure out on your own after the third episode.***Again, back to my first statement, this had a lot of potential that was never developed. The characters were static, each being more of an archetype than a full-blooded character. Yes, they gave snippets into the pasts of each incarnate, but not enough to make them sympathetic. The episodic nature made it difficult to get attached to anyone. That and [semi-spoiler], it quickly became apparent that the incarnate was going to die anyway so there wasn't any reason to get invested.The archetypal natural of the incarnates and their motivations, including even the hero and the villain, ended up feeling petty and trite. It seemed this anime was trying to pose a philosophical question (I'll let you decide what that was), but it fell short. Or I'm just over this particular philosophical question because it's been done a lot. There's no answer for it and probably better ways to pose it.Some character motivations were never explained at all and that was confusing and frustrating as well. In short, this was disappointing. It was episodic with not enough oomph to make me care about the characters and without that, I can't truly enjoy a story. It became just one battle of supernaturals after another. It was repetitive and predictable. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really enjoyable either. motivations.2. I didn't read the blurb about it before I started watching it.

It could have had a main character that grew as the story progressed. It could have had a supporting cast that made me care. Could have, could have, could have. This show is filled with a ton of those. There is very little this show gets right in terms of being a good show, but at the same time, it doesn\'t get many things wrong either, an odd paradox of mediocrity if you will.Starting off with its basis, in order to win a civil war, one side modifies a squad of soldiers...with mythical creatures\' DNA and that gives them powers at the cost of them slowly turning more and more into their ""beast forms"", as I\'ll call them, as both time goes on and as they use the power more and more. The story takes place after the war, where, after having his love interest and the scientist of the squad killed by another squadmate, the MC must hunt down the traitor while at the same time hunting down his other former squadmates. The reason given for him needing to kill his other squadmates is because they\'ve begun degenerating, some have transformed fully into monsters, and others have taken up wanton murder in their crazed state. This would make for a decent dark revenge story, an allegory on how he needs to bury the past in the past in order to bring the traitor to justice. If only it wasn\'t for the addition of our second main character, Nancy Bancroft, who is the daughter of one of Hank\'s squadmates who he kills in the beginning of the series.My main gripe with this series actually comes from her inclusion as a foil to Hank. Where he has accepted that he needs to kill his former friends in order to both bring them closure and end their suffering, while also getting close to the traitor, Nancy is under the impression that some of his squadmates can be saved, as some do not actually pose a threat to anyone as they are docile or lucid enough to know right from wrong. They banter back and forth for what seems like hours as we revolve through a sort of Monster of the Week series, only ever getting small bits of backstory for the target of the week. This continues until, just like the others, around 3/4ths of the way through the series, Hank loses control of himself and turns into his monster form and flees, leaving us witnessing the story through Nancy\'s eyes alone.Cool, great, maybe now we actually get to see cases of people being saved since Nancy has been advocating for that all series, right?...Nope.The first ""Monster of the Week"" that we come across after Nancy takes the reins, is the case of the Siren, Beatrice Serrault. She is one of the few former squadmates that we have seen that has been completely lucid at their introduction, all the others have either lost their humanity entirely or have become deranged. She lives in her old hometown, hidden away in an abandoned shack on the beach with her former lover, and all she wants is to live a life with him. But with the arrival of Nancy and a squad from the army who was sent to support her, things quickly hit the fan. There is a building conflict in the town, and like a powderkeg, only one single spark is what it takes to destroy everything. Somehow, someone ends up firing their gun and the Siren\'s lover is shot. He manages to make it back to their home on the beach before dying in her arms. And finally, in her grief, she begins to sing, putting the entire town to sleep. Nancy and a major side character manage to fight the Siren\'s powers and for the sake of the town\'s residents, who would die in their sleep as Beatrice didn\'t plan on stopping until they dies, must kill her.

Mahou no Tenshi Creamy Mami: Long Goodbye,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2046/Mahou_no_Tenshi_Creamy_Mami__Long_Goodbye,"['As this OVA didn\'t have any reviews, I felt compelled to add mine since I loved every second of it.Creamy Mami\'s ultimate OVA, ""Long Goodbye,"" is a fantastic finale to an endearing show. The production values of this OVA were undoubtedly top-tier, featuring vibrant colors, exquisitely retro animation with clever camera work, some unexpected but welcome action scenes, and brilliant voice acting from our titular heroine and her friends.I can understand why some people may have been mildly impressed or even displeased at Mami\'s sudden comeback, which felt like an asspull to get the show going and please the fans, but I\'m perfectly fine with...that. Studio Pierrot delivered a beautifully crafted piece of traditional Japanese animation, befitting of the genre and the bygone era it depicts, that I will certainly remember for a long time.One of the most noticeable aspects of this OVA are the mature themes: from Yuu\'s subtle request to her mom to purchase her some ""girly"" undies now that she\'s in junior high school, to the serene atmosphere exuded by some scenes, to the ins and outs of filmmaking giving us an unexpectedly educational peek into the tools and techniques that were in use back then, to Kidokoro and Megumi enjoying sake together at some izakaya located under the rail tracks, a typical sight in Tokyo even today, part of the megalopolis\' culture and charm. A very pleasant scene starring an unlikely pair not often seen in the TV series, that fleshed out Megumi\'s character going beyond the usual ""gets angry and slaps her beloved Shingo before storming out of the room"" we\'ve been shown throughout the series. Here she was painted as a maiden in love, feeling insecure about her fiancé\'s feelings. And my heart goes out to you, Kidokoro, you were a true gentleman. A moment of silence to our fallen brother....Speaking of Megumi, she was given a golden opportunity to shine in this OVA, in comparison to her underwhelming supporting role in the TV series. In fact we could even say she was the actual heroine, both literally (as the movie lead) and figuratively. Graceful and ladylike, she is certainly the antithesis of our purple-haired heroine, but that\'s okay: they are meant to complement each other, and we can sympathize with Kidokoro eventually falling for her adult charm. Her song ""Last Kiss de Good Luck"" is among my favorites in the series and fits her like a glove. Perfect choice of background music for the bar scene.Moreover, rival characters from 80s and 90s anime had the annoying tendency to be insufferable jerks whose unique purpose was to trouble the protagonist and grate on our nerves with their shenanigans—looking at you, Sayaka Honami (Yawara!)\xa0and\xa0Hikaru Hiyama (Kimagure Orange Road)—sometimes up to the (pen)ultimate episode. Megumi was none of that. While obviously jealous of Mami\'s popularity, she still knew her place and worked to the best of her abilities to grab her own share of the spotlight and compete with Mami fair and square, sparing everyone from any cheap attempts to undermine her rival. In fact she supported Mami much like a big sister on a number of occasions, and Yuu reciprocated those feelings in the bedroom scene. If only she had a more prominent role in the series.All the endearing cast members also got their chance to shine, and it was largely thanks to them that I could sit through the entire 52 episodes of the main series without growing too bored, despite 40+ episodes of filler content. Even Midori, who was without doubt ranking as “most annoying character” for many of us, quite redeemed himself and even managed to snatch a girlf—a good ending. In contrast, rival series ""Magical Princess Minky Momo"" had me drop the show after a couple of episodes as I failed to relate to any of the characters, but perhaps my expectations were set a bit too high. I\'ll try giving it another chance sometime.Some of my favorite scenes:- Kidokoro and Megumi enjoying drinks together at the bar. Yes, characters getting drunk in a kids\' anime.- Mami sliding off the structure at the playground, hinted at by her shadow from the sunset light, which slowly morphs back into Yuu’s silhouette if you look closer. We learn later that Yuu only transforms into Mami while the sun is out, which made this scene a pretty clever foreshadowing.- Yuu and Ai in the bedroom asking Megumi is she’s happy right now.- Everyone in the bus singing “BIN-KAN\xa0Rouge”, and Megumi’s reaction when requested to sing one of Mami’s songs.- Toshio watching how the special effects were added to the movie reel.- The overhead camera scene with everyone having lunch together at the film studio.- Yuu reuniting with Posi and Nega in her dream, with my favorite BGM from the show playing behind.- The climactic battle scene. The joys of good ol\' cel animation.- The final scene with Toshio and Yuu looking at the stars. Cliché, yes, but you can\'t help but grin at their blissful innocence.There’s still more I could go on about this OVA, but let’s keep this short. In conclusion, this OVA is highly recommended for Creamy Mami fans or even fans of retro animation in general. It\'s a visual and auditory treat from the mid-80s, that brings a satisfying conclusion to one of the most iconic magical girl shows of all time. Bar the lazy plot device that brought Mami back, I wish the main series had benefited from similar production values, screenplay, and character development. Only the first episode did come close.- ""Do I need to watch the entire TV series to enjoy this OVA?""Preferably if you have a lot of time, or just want to sit back and enjoy the ""retro"" feel of the show as I did, but episodes with actual continuity and meaning to the plot can be counted on your fingers. You could just as well watch the previous OVA, ""Eien no Once More"", which first 45 minutes recap the main events of the series. Still, I would consider watching the entire series a prerequisite to be able to enjoy this OVA to the fullest.This is my very first review on MAL, after fifteen years. Thanks for reading! that.

We learn later that Yuu only transforms into Mami while the sun is out, which made this scene a pretty clever foreshadowing.- Yuu and Ai in the bedroom asking Megumi is she’s happy right now.- Everyone in the bus singing “BIN-KAN\xa0Rouge”, and Megumi’s reaction when requested to sing one of Mami’s songs.- Toshio watching how the special effects were added to the movie reel.- The overhead camera scene with everyone having lunch together at the film studio.- Yuu reuniting with Posi and Nega in her dream, with my favorite BGM from the show playing behind.- The climactic battle scene. The joys of good ol\' cel animation.- The final scene with Toshio and Yuu looking at the stars. Cliché, yes, but you can\'t help but grin at their blissful innocence.There’s still more I could go on about this OVA, but let’s keep this short. In conclusion, this OVA is highly recommended for Creamy Mami fans or even fans of retro animation in general. It\'s a visual and auditory treat from the mid-80s, that brings a satisfying conclusion to one of the most iconic magical girl shows of all time. Bar the lazy plot device that brought Mami back, I wish the main series had benefited from similar production values, screenplay, and character development. Only the first episode did come close.- ""Do I need to watch the entire TV series to enjoy this OVA?""Preferably if you have a lot of time, or just want to sit back and enjoy the ""retro"" feel of the show as I did, but episodes with actual continuity and meaning to the plot can be counted on your fingers. You could just as well watch the previous OVA, ""Eien no Once More"", which first 45 minutes recap the main events of the series. Still, I would consider watching the entire series a prerequisite to be able to enjoy this OVA to the fullest.This is my very first review on MAL, after fifteen years. Thanks for reading!']"

One Off,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13283/One_Off,"[""One Off was subbed yesterday and I already watched it 3 times. You may think that this anime must be pure awesome because I watched it 3 times in a day, but not exactly that. I just enjoyed it a lot.That said, One Off is still pretty amazing anime for such a short series. The story is about these 5 girls, which names I don't know doing slice of life stuff, and they like motorbikes. The blue-haired girl is funny as hell. She has cutelittlefangs and she is master of the trope, google it if you don't know. Surpasses Tsuru-chan from Suzumiya Haruhi series,...meaning blue-haired is hyperactive and propably has adhd, but I like her because she is funny and cute, and has blue hairs.Girl with big tits is pretty much like blue-haired girl. She is damn funny, but has big tits instead of adhd. She would be pretty memorable character even if she had only small tits. I mean she is like Kaeda from Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Kaeda always says part of her dialog in English which is also well-placed and makes it pretty hilarious. Big titted girl does the same as Kaeda and they have same voice actor so no wonder, and she can pronounce English well, so no awkward engrish here. Kaeda also has nice tits, btw, if you were wondering.Rest of the characters aren't really all that memorable nor notable, I would still hug them all though. Someone but effort on their design as well. I mean e.g. one of them wears glasses so it's easy tell them apart and all. Pretty sure most of them are at least bi-curious so shoujo ai fans should enjoy them as well. They are also friends till the end of world and even further so it's pretty interesting to follow them doing their stuff and to see what kinda persons they are.One Off also surpasses Code Geass in terms of advertising. Pretty sure everyone knows about Pizza Hut and C.C's pizza obsession and stuff like that. As I mentioned before, these girls like motorbikes. We have CBR and Monkey here and maybe some others I didn't notice. So you guessed it propably, this is worshipping Honda like no other anime. We even have guy who wears a cap with Honda text on it and things like that. Brilliant, really.There is also story in this anime but I don't really know what it is about. One of these character want to go see the world or something and she is shy and likes big titted girl's CBR, and they ride together near the end. One other of the character have some special spot where she likes to be alone, but big titted girl comes there with her CBR and finds her special spot. The character get little development just like that I guess.One Off is nowhere near the best anime ever made, but it doesn't try be like that either. It's pure slice of life comedy which you may or may not enjoy. I watched this somewhere around 3-4am and laughed around half of the 30 minutes long double-episode. For me this was really fun and entertaining watch and made me happy. I found pretty much everything in this to be hilarious. I don't know will you find this enjoyable but I advice to give it a try. meaning blue-haired is hyperactive and propably has adhd, but I like her because she is funny and cute, and has blue hairs.Girl with big tits is pretty much like blue-haired girl.

However, I could have really done without the bashing of bicycles and their riders as being childish and immature; yet that\'s how this Anime opened. It was really hard for me to get through the rest of the story after the opening scene as it left me in such a dreadful state.Much later, I made myself watch through the rest of the anime. I discovered that it was merely an advert for Honda\'s motorcycles and scooters.To compare this anime to ""art"" you\'ll see that this only comes off as an ad.As an advertisement,...this anime is merely watchable yet not quite entertaining or engaging.The characters are as shallow as their dilemmas. The ""moral of the story"" is as weak as it is obvious.I can\'t blame Honda for this; the entire motor industry is having a hard time right now. Car ownership rates decreasing. Today\'s kids are not as interested in getting their driver\'s licence as the kids of 10 or 20 years ago were. Sales of automobiles are on the decrease in Europe, North America and in Japan. Today\'s young people would like to live close to their work, would rather play on their smart phones while someone else drives (ie take public transit) than to be trapped driving in an hour, or longer, commute while strapped down in chair and listening to inane traffic reports on the radio. So this ad (anime) tries to sell the ""excitement of adventure"" for Honda\'s motorized two products, while bashing pedal bicycles in an attempt to make their own product look more appealing than a bicycle as the vehicle of choice for doing the exact same thing.And you can feel the desperation of the industry in having to make this tripe. And you\'d have to be equally desperate to watch it.If you have too much time to kill, if you hate bicycles, or if you really love motorcycles and scooters; if you want to see what a desperate industry does to try to save itself from forces beyond its control, or if you\'re plainly in need of something to watch and this happens to be within reach then you may enjoy this. However, if you don\'t need more propaganda in your life then you are better off avoiding this. this anime is merely watchable yet not quite entertaining or engaging.The characters are as shallow as their dilemmas.

It\'s all about overcoming the obstacle of negative thinking, things that you may think are impossible can actually be more easily attainable when you are working towards that goal and thinking positively. If anything, you will feel better.Nothing good comes from negative thinking except for just that, more negative thinking.This is your basic slice of life story with mopeds, motorcycles, the eagerness to travel, and Honda (yes, the vehicle company) as the main subjects. With one of the best directors when it comes to slice of life works, Junichi Sato.It\'s not original, but does anyone really expect...that when it comes to slice of life stories? I like it, it\'s executed well, has a great atmosphere, and is fun to watch if you like slice of life stories.The art is excellent, very much up to standards here.The music is very well done, the opening by RoundTable is always a nice touch in an anime, and the ending and insert songs are pretty catchy as well.The seiyuu act their characters with great enthusiasm.There\'s not much character here, but the little that there is, serves well enough for the story and execution.For a slice of life series, there\'s actually a small bit of ecchi in this show, and that is the role of Cynthia (You\'ll see when you watch it).---I enjoyed this short series more than I expected.One Off serves as a feel good slice of life story that is as short as a motorcycle or moped ride to a convenience store.It\'s very well done, and if there was more, I would watch it. that when it comes to slice of life stories?

I really do, despite the fact that I've only been exposed to a few of his works, and Tamayura happens to be my favorite. However...I can't believe I watched this piece of trash! It's a good thing it's only four fifteen-minute long episodes like the original Tamayura OVAs were, and whaddaya know! This is supposed to be a car advertisement, like how Hokago no Pleiades is! Ugh, I can't believe I wasted my time on this dumb OVA. It's such a shame, as this could have been a lot better, and the issues it tackled could have been handled more appropriately....This anime is sponsored by Honda Motors...but how do they start off? By bashing bicycles and introducing characters who are such blatant stereotypes that you can tell just from looking at them for a few seconds that you've seen this type of character before somewhere! A lot of people give Tamayura a lot of flak for supposedly being a K-On rip off, which I don't think is true. Heck, if there's a show haters should be calling a K-On rip-off, it's One Off!The story's nothing special. Basically it's about a girl named Haruno who envies her friends for having dreams and ambitions they want to pursue and thinks she'll never be able to leave the rural town she lives in. Her jobs mostly consist of helping her parents at their restaurant and collecting eggs from chickens. All of a sudden, out appears this random, badly voiced Australian named Cynthia (who I swear to God is a rip-off of Cynthia from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. Look at their character designs! I'm not even kidding!) who does nothing but shout bad English and shove her cleavage into people's faces. You may think me saying that Haruno's life changes after that might be great, but...trust me, it's not.Is it just me, or is the animation for this anime really blurry? The backgrounds look a lot more faded than crisp, like it was done by someone who couldn't afford money to buy glasses. Not only that, the movement that's there isn't very fluid. But ugh, I need to get this out, I HATE the character designs! Cynthia because she looks like a rip-off of Cynthia from Pokemon, which should be fairly obvious, but the girls' designs I don't like because....one: they look too much like rip-offs of other characters (I swear, Sayo looks almost EXACTLY like Tsuruko from AnoHana, right down to her seiyuu, who does the voice of Tsuruko as well!), two: I hate how anime over exaggerates and glorifies female legs! They always make it look like the top part of the leg, above the knee, is longer than the lower part of the leg, below the knee. You can tell just from looking at the promotional pictures alone that their legs are too odd-looking, which is especially exacerbated by the fact that they all wear skirts so short that if done in real life, you'd be able to see their undies no problem, and...that's NOT a compliment. I mean, look at the way the pig tailed girl is positioned in the promo art! Her legs are obviously too long, and she could be showing off her undies as we speak considering she's wearing a really short skirt and she's in a rather promiscuous position if you take it out of context. I'm not a thin person, and I never wear skirts, but I've looked in the mirror and pictured myself in short uniforms like this while taking human anatomy into account and quite honestly, if people actually wore uniforms like that in real life, then they'd be showing their undies off 24/7 considering the length of the skirt and how ungracefully exaggerated the legs are. And look at the way the blue haired girl is lying on the ground! Her rear end is right in view! See my point? And even her legs don't look right! Then again, none of them do! I wish anime would stop over exaggerating female body parts and making girls wear short skirts and actually respect realistic human anatomy already! It's driving me up the wall!The only remotely good thing about this show is the music. I definitely liked the opening theme, as it's nice and soothing, and the ending themes are nice too, even though they're both a little dull. The rest of the soundtrack...eh, dull. Nothing ground-breaking or bad. Just...dull. I honestly don't remember. The soundtrack in itself is pretty bland and forgettable. I honestly don't remember one spec of it.Ugh, the characters. I won't lie, these have to be the most blatant and most shallow stereotypes I've ever seen. None of the characters are properly or appropriately developed, they follow their assigned gimmick way too much, the very little pieces of personality they do have are obviously ripped off from characters from other anime I've seen before, and they're overall shallow and uninteresting. This is made worse by the absolutely abysmal voice acting! Haruno's seiyuu is trying way too hard, and that blue haired girl just refused to shut her freaking mouth! I wanted to mute the audio every time that stupid, annoying as heck blueberry head opened her mouth! All she did as scream and moan about not having a motorbike and squealing over how hot Cynthia is! Someone cut this character out of the show already! She's too much of a rip-off of Ritsu from K-On! The other characters are just bland and uninteresting. Cynthia has to be the worst Australian portrayal I've ever seen. I've never met an Australian before, but none I know talk in such bad English as she did, and none I know go around showing off their boobs (AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN WEAR A FREAKING BRA!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL FREAKSHOW?!?)! What especially appalled me is that despite her flaws, everyone suddenly likes her! WHAT THE FREAK DID SHE DO TO GET THEM TO LIKE HER?!? Show her boobs, of course! Oh God, even the characters' reactions to Cynthia are inappropriate and unrealistic! If I saw a woman like her showing off her boobs, I'd call the police and get her arrested for public nudity! It appalls me how anime characters love downplaying the flaws of a clearly problematic character and make them into a straight up object of desire for everyone! That must be why the trope Draco In Leather Pants exists. Heck, if anything, I consider Cynthia to be the very in-show embodiment of this trope!...AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY!The rest of the show is just bad, bland, and downright boring. Even the supposed moral of the story is shallow and dumb, even cheesy because of the way it's executed. Everything else is just bad. The way the characters react to certain events: bad and unrealistic. All the coincidences: totally contrived and convoluted. The characters' voices: UGH MAKE THEM STOP TALKING! The whole girls riding motorbikes in the future. I can't see that. But from what I'm hearing, car sales are decreasing in parts of the world, so I guess it was to be expected that advertising companies would go to drastic measures to sell a product. But can we do it in a way that doesn't involve churning out stereotypes and beating dead horses PLEASE? I'm taking a class called Effects of Media on Children and one of my assignments involves analyzing how advertisements rely on gender stereotypes to sell a product and how they affect people of all ages.

Shippuu! Iron Leaguer: Silver no Hata no Moto ni,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13449/Shippuu_Iron_Leaguer__Silver_no_Hata_no_Moto_ni,"['If you\'re here right now chances are you just finished the TV anime Shippu! Iron Leaguer and you\'re wondering if these OVAs are worth a watch (and if you haven\'t finished the anime already, what are you doing here? Go finish it already! I\'ll still be around when you come back, don\'t worry). And the answer to that question? Are these OVAs worth checking out? Well, let\'s give it a look and see.The Shippu! Iron Leaguer ""Under the Banner of Silver"" OVAs serve as an epilogue or further end piece for its preceding anime, exploring new topics, adding new characters, putting existing characters in unique...situations, and attempting to tie up some of the loose ends the anime may have left hanging.While the anime leaned heavily into the themes of teamwork, kindness, and fair play, these OVAs see us swinging more in the opposite direction to the darker, grim, and bleaker side of this series’ story. Friendship is, of course, still present, but the more dour style of this narrative may put some people off of it.This manifests most in how Silver Castle are treated and dealt with. We find our characters struggling and being challenged here in ways we’ve never quite seen before (including but not limited to internal drama and strife). Some of it senseless, some of it with purpose, and each way can make for some interesting content sure but it might not be for everyone, especially if you hold these characters very dearly and felt satisfied by the happy and uplifting Friendship Ending the TV series gave us (which the OVA begins by turning on its head).But leaning into a sadder narrative isn\'t all bad, especially if it’s done well. Right? Well, about that...There is a strong story and strong narrative behind these OVAs but not nearly enough time to give it the room it needs to breathe or reach its full potential, and it shows. The first three episodes are fine enough with most of its problems being bumps in the road or things that you can overlook if you want to, but by the last two episodes it all catches up with them with piles of ideas and concepts crammed into the endgame. Which means most of them aren’t explored or elaborated on nearly as much as they need to be to be effective.All five episodes have problems such as scenes that are set up and developed only to then be suddenly cut short and never expanded upon or properly concluded. Characters that seem to jump all over the map, appearing out of nowhere to where they are most conveniently needed at the time. Important plot points that are rushed through and barely touched on. And when our favorite characters are put through the wringer on top of all that, it leaves a bad taste in the viewer’s mouth if the story isn’t concluded in a satisfying enough way to justify all that hardship.In a word it is messy, and what would otherwise be a strong and compelling narrative becomes flimsy and weak. Not every moment is a flop and they are able to do some things decently despite how much they are juggling. But most of what is here are cool concepts and ideas that you can only really get a good grasp on by reading between the lines. I don’t blame this on any incompetence of the show runners but five episodes weren’t enough for all they were trying to tell us. Whether they wanted more episodes and five were all they could get, or they really did over-estimate themselves and think five was enough, we may never know. But what we do know is that this doesn’t work. Mostly...Normally this would mean we\'ve got a bad set of OVAs on our hands that we’re better off ignoring. But... that\'s not quite true.As with the TV anime, it is the characters of Shippu! Iron Leaguer that are the shining stars of its story, and if nothing else can deliver, they sure can. And they do.This OVA series brings more focus to some characters who might not have got it before. Mach Windy is cool as always and he takes on more of a protagonist role in this story, and Ryuuken, Bull Armor, Juurota, and GZ especially get some of their best moments in the entire series right here in these OVAs, hands down. Some may be one-and-done in a single episode (or even a single scene. But it was a cool scene, Juurota) but their impact is felt, and left me with a big, dumb, happy smile on my face just as much as the anime did at its best.And the main members of Silver Castle aren\'t the only ones who get the love. The Gold Brothers (well, they\'re always awesome), Silky and company, and some of the Stray Leaguers such as Watt, Amp, and Thirteen get a little time to shine here too.Most of the new robot characters however simply serve their purpose in the narrative and don’t do much else. Aside from Garret who I\'ve got to give these OVAs honest credit for getting me emotionally invested in the guy and actually pretty decently executing character development with him all in the span of a single episode. (But while his arc surprisingly works, it also leaves you wanting more of him.)You may notice I failed to mention our friends Topjoy and Magnum Ace up there. Unfortunately Topjoy doesn\'t really do much of note here and Magnum... well, his character arc is about as messy and unfocused as the narrative is, with a lot of interesting ideas and potential communicated poorly, frustratingly, and not quite brought together in a satisfying way. It doesn’t ruin the character by any means but he’s certainly not at his best.The human characters end up taking a major back seat to the robots, which in retrospect was probably for the best, but they only really exist to pop in from time to time to show us they’re there, nudge the plot forward artificially, or drop lore/exposition unceremoniously. Character development is attempted with the new human character Sheena but, sing it with me now, it’s rushed.All this said, the best way I can find to describe these OVAs are a series of strong character moments strung together by a far too busy and under-explored narrative. Not everything fails, but not enough succeeds either.So, back to the real question here. Are these OVAs worth a watch? If you\'re a big fan of some of the characters I mentioned above, I\'d say sure! Give it a shot! If you felt completely content and satisfied with the TV anime\'s ending and don\'t want that to be ruined for you even a little, it might be better to give this one a pass. In general though I would recommend fans of the series watch these OVAs at least once, but go in fully aware that they are heavily flawed pieces of media and shouldn’t to be taken too seriously. If you can shut your brain off and enjoy the drama and action, you might catch yourself having a good time. Personally I can’t be mad with how they turned out, just disappointed that they didn’t quite come together and shine as brightly as they could have.Iron Leaguer came out a long time ago and its not likely to get a reboot or revival series any time soon—or ever for that matter—which leaves these OVAs as the last send off for this series that we’ll ever have. And if nothing else, they do bring a sense of finality that ends our game fair and square. situations, and attempting to tie up some of the loose ends the anime may have left hanging.While the anime leaned heavily into the themes of teamwork, kindness, and fair play, these OVAs see us swinging more in the opposite direction to the darker, grim, and bleaker side of this series’ story.

Tactical Roar,https://myanimelist.net/anime/817/Tactical_Roar,"[""Story 5/10The story takes place around an all female company that work for a civilian company called &quot;Haru-Nico,&quot; consisting of ex-navy and civilians. They are hired by other companies to provide an escort/protection servrice. Being an all female group they are the black sheep of the civilian and military navy's, often dubbed as Alice Group. From the first battle you can easily tell theat the girls try too hard to show that they're not pushovers, by disobeying orders and fighting to the end. This type of recklessness creates tensions with the comany and the Federal Navy. So not only do they have to stop pirates...they have to watch their back as well.Art 5/10   Sound 7/10When the fighing happens, action sure gets pretty intence. Its very flashy and smooth considering most of the fighting is done with CG. They even go far as name their war technology based on real life history references like vasser, olvier, etc. With the detail in commands and &quot;war speak&quot; it reminded me like watching a star trek episode (good or bad thing is your decision). The detail in the fight language futher enhances the 'realism' to their wareffort. My only gripe with the fighting is that they glorify the homing missle a little too much (if you watch the show you'll know what i mean). But as futuristic warfare goes, its pretty damn good IMO.Character 6/10The characters are pretty much your run of the mill kawaii anime girls all from the big busty horny chick (Clio or Mitori), to the small timd and shy loli (Miharu), and even a pair of excentric yet innocent twins (Mashu and Manashu). Time off from fighting is nothing but pure fanservice all the way through to the next battle. Doing things like haing out on the beach, setting up parties, performing at trade shows, they're all fanservice (theres even a side joke about this in EP7). they even spend 3-5 seconds of &quot;closeup pan&amp;scan&quot; action ALOT. Theres also afew taboo moments as well. On top of that, shoujo-ai runs rampant throughout the show. Mostly shown by the show's antagonists.The two girls (the names escape me ATM) are sisters. Trying to make a name for themselves in the pirate community, they are the best at what they do. The only catch for these girls is that they prform all their attacs in a room together...while pleasuring each other at the same time. It doesnt go hardcore but it leaves little to the imagination. But they should be given an award for best multi-taskers in a wartime enviroment. Anyways theres may or maynot also be a 'thing' with the main characters. This show manages to put anything and everything ecchi into this show (you've been warned).Enjoyment 5/10If youre into all those fanservice/ecchi/taboo situations, by all means pick this show up. But if your into the very technical style warfare (like Star Trek or any other similar show) this will keep you interested in the hows and whys of the battles. They even make things like hacking into mainframes interesting. Anythign that can do that gets a good rating from me. But the downside is the off action story and drama. Not really interesting but then again how can you do that when you try to cover all the points of ecchiness?Overall 6/10 they have to watch their back as well.Art 5/10   Sound 7/10When the fighing happens, action sure gets pretty intence.

Spirit of Wonder: China-san no Yuuutsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2419/Spirit_of_Wonder__China-san_no_Yuuutsu,"[""_Miss China's Ring_ is a curious little OVA. The animation is actually pretty good for the period: it strikes a sort of realistic Ghibli style that holds up well 20 years later. Sound is decent enough. The plot is... think very gentle romantic comedy, a bit like Oh My Goddess! with some soft SF. (I say soft because any hard SF author would immediately point out that destroying the moon would eliminate most tides and causing global mass destruction of ecologies, the deaths of millions of creatures, environmental & humanitarian catastrophes, and resultant social & geopolitical upheaval.) It doesn't really go anywhere after that, so...it's kind of an oversized episode of a regular show - which presumably was Tsuruta's overall _Spirit of Wonder_ manga. So I don't regret watching it, but I couldn't recommend it either. it's kind of an oversized episode of a regular show - which presumably was Tsuruta's overall _Spirit of Wonder_ manga.

Is there any word more thrilling to the human soul? Hi I\'m Lancehot. You might remember me from reviewing such made up spin-offs as Kiniro Mandem & The AniManiactrix. I\'m here today with the actual spinoff to Teekyu, Takamiya Nasuno Desu! (TND), a show that can join the esteemed ranks of Joey, Christmas Vacation 2 & Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure as a spin-off that didn\'t need to exist & doesn\'t need to be watched.Quite why it flops as a spin-off, however, is perhaps more difficult to explain, because it doesn\'t really do much different from it\'s parent show. The comedy is still...abstract, random & delivered at a million miles a minute. Takamiya is still Takamiya, only now she has centre stage like every rich girl wants. The art & animation hasn\'t changed, indeed almost nothing has changed. So what\'s up?Well that\'s part of the problem.  TND to all intents & purposes is Teekyu with three of the four main characters missing. It doesn\'t try anything different or do anything new with what one might consider this new found freedom, which begs the question: what was the point? Spin-offs that work: Frasier (Cheers), Daria (Beavis & Butthead), The Cleveland Show (Family Guy), often take an ensemble character & give them the starring role in a show that is noticeably different from the one they started in. TND instead just goes through the same motions as Teekyu with less characters to contribute to the wackiness, resulting in an experience that is too similar not to be compared to its parent show & found lacking.That\'s the thing with spin-offs. Done right, they can take a relatively minor & one dimensional character who worked as part of an ensemble & flesh them out in ways that the original show couldn\'t allow for, as well as explore themes & adopt a tone that would otherwise feel out of place. The only ""new"" thing TND brings with it is giving Youta, Yuri from Teekyu\'s younger brother, the role of foil to Takamiya\'s foolishness. He fits in about as well as a square peg in a round hole, a more conventional & boring anime foil than his sister who suffers for being shoehorned into the show to begin with (he\'s her butler for :reasons:), only to be pushed out of the way of Takamiya\'s shenanigans in a way that Yuri isn\'t in Teekyu.The absence of the other characters in Teekyu\'s ensemble is notable from the outset. Instead of having different shades of absurdity coming from three different nutjobs, each episode consists almost entirely of rich girl stupidity from one character. As can be the case in spin-offs, taking a character whose quirks worked as part of an ensemble & giving them centre stage in what is otherwise the same show just gets wearing. Ten minutes of Joey in an episode of Friends was fine. Forty minutes of Joey on his own was not. The same is true here. Takimiya works as part of Teekyu\'s ensemble but on her own her shtick is dulled by repetition. Indeed, it\'s only when the other Teekyu characters show up in the last couple of episodes that it gets some of that spark back, which just further shows how redundant this spinoff is. abstract, random & delivered at a million miles a minute.

Takimiya works as part of Teekyu\'s ensemble but on her own her shtick is dulled by repetition. Indeed, it\'s only when the other Teekyu characters show up in the last couple of episodes that it gets some of that spark back, which just further shows how redundant this spinoff is.', ""I was surprised how short the episodes were, only 2 minutes long and most of it is the OP. After every episode, my reaction was mostly¨WTF did I just watch? What happened?¨And I still wonder from where did the main characters know each other.But overall the story was good, even tho I started pitying Youta more after every episode.The art was funny and playful. There were some weird things in the anime too which I couldn't identify but that makes it more interesting....The voice actors did a good job with expressing this anime. The actors' voices were so fitting for the characters, I was surprised (in a good way). And because the episodes were so short, they had to make the voices more powerful and the sentences short but meaningful. I actually enjoyed watching this very much because of the voices of the actors.The characters were different, in a fun way. The Takamiya family was reeeally rich but none of them were snobs or anything. But they did buy some useless things tho along the way. They said some unexpected things all the time but those things just brought more enjoyment to this anime ><.I really enjoyed this anime for the fun story, good voice actors, awesome characters and the overall feels. And I really don't get why this got an average of 6.something, I personally really enjoyed this \\(^~^)/ The voice actors did a good job with expressing this anime.

Each of the characters in Teekyuu is funny when they’re all together. When they’re apart like this, the show isn’t very entertaining. Their personalities are funny when they're all clashing together. When they're singled out, they come across as annoying and boring.The bit where they were together was fun enough, but after that, it kinda just fell apart for me. It was average, but it honestly bored me. I might have liked it better if there was some kind of resolution to the stuff going on, but it was all random and just didn't feel...right without the other girls. Even though Nasuno was my favorite characters (and I was super excited for this show) it really didn't pan out how I thought it would.If you liked Teekyuu, I would still recommend you watch it because it retains some qualities that others might still like, but it personally just didn't cater to me.Have a great day everyone! right without the other girls.
