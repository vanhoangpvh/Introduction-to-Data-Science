Wan Jie Zhizun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53618/Wan_Jie_Zhizun,"[""Painfully watched up to 25 episodes, it's a revenge and adventure-style cultivation drama; the story is not unique; it's the same old revenge plot. I think the main drawbacks are the poor art style and graphics quality plus the bad dialogues, especially the costume and color combination, which are just pathetic. The MC wears the same piece of clothing from childhood to adulthood. It's very funny, and the hairstyle looks like it's not mainstream; the fighting scene and the powers of each character don't look special, just plain and boring.I don't think anyone will enjoy this donghua, although if you have plenty of free time...and nothing else to watch you might give it a try just for the story. and nothing else to watch you might give it a try just for the story.""]"
To Heart: Remember My Memories,https://myanimelist.net/anime/685/To_Heart__Remember_My_Memories,"[""WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S HOLY HAPPENED TO THIS SERIES!!!The original To Heart is rather enjoyable. It's a nice slice of life show that gets misnomered as a harem romance. This extension on the other hand, should never have been made.The story in Remember My Memories is set around a year after the end of To Heart. Multi has left, Hiroyuki, Akari, and the rest of the cast are still pretty much the same. Hiroyuki is pining for Multi though when she suddenly comes back to school, only for everyone to be told she has the robot form of amnesia!?!?Okay, I'm not going...to harp on about the rest of the story, which in itself is pretty much standard fare. The creators decided to turn what was an enjoyabl slice of life show into a true harem romance/drama. The only problem is they failed abysmally.The art and animation are sorely lacking in Remember My Memories. Gone is the naturalistic character design and the nice watercolour stillframes. In their place the animators saw fit to make the faces more angular (pointy chins abound in this show). The animation is decidely jerky, and the colour palette has been changed to make the show more &quot;cheery&quot; (failing miserably at this as well).The sound is another area where a lot of corners have been cut. There's no mellow BGMs in this show, and the effects are sometimes random. The voice acting in this show has also dropped in quality (even though the same actors were used - how the hell did they manage that?). Ichijou Kazuya (the voice of Fujita Hiroyuki), must have been up all night smoking and drinking before recording this series. In the original To Heart his was quite smooth and well defined. In Remember My Memories he sounds like he's desperate and screaming all the time. The other voice actors are no better, which makes me think that these changes were intentionally added to &quot;heighten&quot; the drama (when all it did was make me want to kill the characters or kill myself).The characters are the main reason why the show is a huge let down. As I pointed out, the voice acting was a major disaster, but the character flaws don't just end there. The creators have tried to make Remember My Memories more &quot;dramatic&quot;, and with this in mind they have turned the characters into an abomination of what they originally were. In the original To Heart Hiroyuki was a kind, sensitive (if somewhat absent-minded) guy. In Remember My Memories his character comes across as annoying, whiny, selfish, angry (in other words, he's a brat). Akari was originally a gentle, caring girl, and although they tried to keep those traits for her character, they spoiled it by making the show &quot;dramatic&quot;. Akari's character flaws are highlighted in many of the &quot;dramatic&quot; moments of the show, especially towards the end of the series. The supporting characters also suffer from this &quot;drama&quot;, as many of their characteristics and personalities are just plain annoying now.I'm not going to recommend this show to anyone except a complete masochist.If you're a fan of the original To Heart, or even To Heart 2 (which, even though I didn't enjoy it as much as To Heart, is still miles better than Remember My Memories), then do not watch this show- ever! If you like a good story, romance, drama, great characters, great animation and sound, etc, then avoid this at all costs, and go watch Kanon or Clannad, or even Da Capo.I'm not going to say anything good about this show (so those of you who liked it, don't hold your breath). It's bad - end of story. This series is to To Heart what The Phantom Menace is to Star Wars.I'm not going to insult anyone who liked Remember My Memories, but I will say this - compare it to any other show of it's type and Remember My Memories loses in every department.If I could sue the creators for making this pile of ...., then I would happily do so.Oh, and for those of you who wonder why I didn't drop the show, I should point out that the show has to rate as a 1 or 0 for me to drop it. Remember My Memories may be bad, but it's not the worst I've seen (which is it's only saving grace). to harp on about the rest of the story, which in itself is pretty much standard fare.

Where the first season was shallow, episodic harem nonsense, this season expands in every dimension and is actually really good.AnimationNothing spectacular when it comes to graphics, but decent character design. Boy, am I getting repetitive or what?Actually, it\'s too bad they didn\'t stick with the original art style. The graphics were far better in the first season.SoundGood voice acting (except for the obviously fake Amewrican Remmy/Lemmy....The intro tune is likeable, but background music and ending theme are pretty bland.StoryRMM is a direct continuation of the first season, and considering that was just an introduction of all the characters, the actual story begins here. And it\'s a good one. Both backstory and depth is developing, and it turns out to be something as unusual as a plausible and catching drama.Remember my memories might not be very original (reminding of stuff like Chobits, Kimi ga nozomou Eien etc), but it fuses clichés together in a brilliant way.CharacterSince all of the characters got introduced in the first season, RMM can focus on developing them instead. And it is an impressive amount of character development going on. None of that boring episodic ""girl of the week"" nonsense, instead everyone get screen time when it fits the story.Most of the characters are very likeable (Remmy\'s irritatingly bad english and the witchcraft girl are notable exceptions) and act pretty much like real people.ValueThe Anime keep translation was good, no complaints there.I love it when a second season makes the first one make sense.l Makes me want to watch them both again some time.

Space Cobra Pilot,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5742/Space_Cobra_Pilot,"['Note: I\'ve only seen the English version of this pilot that came as a bonus feature in Region 1 Nozomi Entertainment release of Space Adventure Cobra Part 1.If a Japanese version to this pilot exists, I\'d like to see it as I\'m curious if this pilot was meant for U.S. audiences only or for its Japanese market. The reason I say this, is that the plot is very different from the Cobra we know & the American market could\'ve have received an edited version of Space Cobra if it was ever licensed.The story starts off similar to the 1st episode where Johnson has no recollection...of his past life until his boss calls him to do an investigation of some sort where he then discovers his past identity as the space pirate Cobra. The key difference in the story is Cobra being portrayed as a hero, more specifically a rebel leader to defeat the Guild. It got to the point where Cobra apparently had a group of followers waiting for his return to lead them in battle. Oddly enough, this pilot comes off very ""Star Wars"" in terms of story structure which is somewhat understandable as the universe in Space Cobra does seem to be inspired by the Star Wars franchise. (The 2nd half of the pilot also features a small cameo of R2D2, although its from the waist down.)Most of the animation are from episodes 1 & 13, yet there are some animation only found in this episode pilot. The last scene has the best piece of original animation as it presents a more ""enchanting"" way of Lady to make her debut out of destroyed rubble. This pilot\'s story may have been changed due to its English dub or perhaps the Japanese version kept the same storyline without the whole rebel leader thing.Regardless, there\'s not much to see aside from a few bits of animation not found anywhere else. I\'m just glad North America didn\'t get a series what should\'ve been Space Pirate Cobra into an edited version on what I speculate may have been titled Space Hero Cobra. of his past life until his boss calls him to do an investigation of some sort where he then discovers his past identity as the space pirate Cobra.

Sister Princess,https://myanimelist.net/anime/836/Sister_Princess,"[""I've come to the realization that pretty much everything in life is subjective ( TV, movies, food, books, music, etc.). Just because one or two people say something is crap, doesn't really mean it is crap. .Same can be applied to anime, one person will say an anime they have seen sucks, but there might be more people who actually think it's good regardless of it's flaws and such.A good example of this would be, of course, Sister Princess.Plot: Wataru Minakami is a smart guy who, due to a computer glitch, failed his high school entrance exam. He soon finds out he was accepted to...another school called Stargazer Hill Academy, which is located on an island called Promise Island. He then goes there ( by force ), and quickly meets 12 cute and charming girls who are his sisters!The show is entirely episodic and follows Wataru and his relationship with all sisters as well as doing all sorts of things like going to school, celebrating holidays, shopping and what not.Like most slice of life animes, it has no plot and the show is very episodic, like i said. This might turn some people off, but one can forgive the show for the lack of plot and just watch the show for what is: sweet and simple fun.Now, the fact that the show was directed by the same man that did Eiken is something I can easily look past. Of course, this was made before Eiken and is better than it in terms of directing, but it does have it flaws. The directing can be a bit off most of the time and also make the show seem rather bland when first viewed. Fortunately, the show does still does have it's good points. For one the Serious/dramatic scenes are decently well-written, plus it does get a bit better in the second half of the show.Art/animation: The show might not of had a big budget, but nonetheless, the art and animation is still good and passable; It's very colorful, vibrant, cute-looking, and well designed most of the time. Sadly though, the animation is flawed as well; there are some goofs throughout the series and can be easy to point out. Still, the budget was average so it doesn't matter.Music: the opening theme song, personally, wasn't my cup of tea, but the ending theme was better and catchy too. The rest is jazzy, laid-back kind of music that's really nice to listen to.Voice-acting: both japanese and english dubs were good. The english dub is, however, a bit of a mix bag, some of the voices were really good while some others sounded really cheesy. Other than that though, they still suit the characters no matter how they sound.Characters: let's start off with the sisters. Though lacking any development, the girls are very cute and likable, you'll probably by the end of the day, might have a favorite or two out of them.Then there's Wataru. Sadly in the beginning, he starts off rather selfish, stupid, bland, and really annoying. I said earlier that the show gets better in the second half, but that's mostly because he changes later on. He actually gets the most development out of everyone; he soon learns what it's like to be an older brother and starts to care for his sistersEnjoyment/overall: while definitely flawed in some aspects, Sister Princess is truly one of the best animes have seen recent years. Though flawed and far from being a masterpiece, it's still an enjoyable show that is fun, touching, cute, silly, and worth watch; a gem might i say.Don't let the ratings on both MAL and animenewsnetwork throw you off, as mentioned, it's an enjoyable show worth your viewing.If you like comment me, if not tell melater another school called Stargazer Hill Academy, which is located on an island called Promise Island.

The series itself suffers from a big lack of story structure and development, as well as a defined purpose for a majority of the events. Still, it is quite certain that a fair group of people will find enjoyment in it\'s episodic layout.The story of Sister Princess is pretty shallow despite the large cast. Guy fails a school entrance exam, gets sent to a different school on an island, and meets twelve little sisters. All in all, that\'s about it. There\'s no real romance that develops...with any of them nor are there any developments seen at school. Viewers will get to see the main character bond differently with each sister but, as a whole, the series is very episodic with little foundation and even less storyline. The closest thing viewers will get to a story is the suspicion of one of the sisters spying on the main character. Even that is left to serve little more purpose than comic relief.The artwork is very traditional in terms of the cute harem anime genre is concerned. The backgrounds are simple, yet bright and well defined. The characters themselves are all lively and brightly colored so that they blend well enough with their surrounding environment. It\'s very passable in terms of viewer enjoyment, but does not really stand out in any fashion.The soundwork is another field that is average in almost every category. The opening and ending themes are enjoyable, but nothing worthy of high mention. The intro is upbeat and energetic as is the ending theme. The character voices are charming and the background sounds fit well in terms of setting an atmosphere. Still, it fails to really deliver anything new to would-be fans.The characters are probably the highest notable point for the series. With a dozen sisters to make unique, this was surely the focal point of design. Every sister has unique characteristics, hobbies, interests, and attitudes that make them enjoyable in their own fashion. Their voices are all very distint in their deliverance which also adds to their appeal. Perhaps the biggest mention for the sisters is how they each have a distint way of addressing their brother. Whether it be onii-san, onii-chan, aniki, onii-chama, or Nii-ya, every sister has a special way of addressing their adored brother. Characters aside from the sisters also get a fair amount of design. The best friend character is seem rather often to give him a true feeling of development while the main character is constantly growing and learning.Overall, Sister Princess comes off with a very narrow appeal. Fans of ""imouto"" styled characters will find a cute paradise in at least one of the characters, while other viewers will find it as mediocre. Had the story contained a bit more development plot-wise instead of simple character construction, then it may have faired a bit better. Still, considering the diversity of characters and their unique appeal, the series can come off to be quite enjoyable for those that are seeking some simple entertainment. with any of them nor are there any developments seen at school.

It\'s the show that really kick-started the bishoujo trend that\'s so popular now.  It\'s unpopular in the states, but in Japan it has developed a rather sizable cult following.To many, it\'s very hard to see why.  Sister Princess is not the world\'s greatest anime.  The production quality is pretty low, as evidenced by the numerous animation mistakes and oddities that pop up nearly every episode.  You\'ll definitely see them.  There are times when an oddly drawn face will be on screen for upwards of five whole seconds without changing, so it\'s...not really something you can ignore when watching.  The artistic strengths of the show, however, lie in the colors and the world that they paint.  It\'s a very bright show (especially on DVD) and the near-permanent sunny weather on Promised Island is exactly what this sort of show needs to create the atmosphere it wants.  The backgrounds are rather sparse and you get the feeling that, outside of the named characters, no one else actually lives on the island, but it\'s all very effective in establishing the ""feel"" of the series.The soundtrack also does a very good job of pulling the viewer in.  It\'s perfect; so perfect that I actually listen to it in my spare time. Every piece of background music suits the show so perfectly that when I listen to it I am mentally transported straight back to the anime.  The opening song, Love Destiny, is a FABULOUS piece of violin-heavy pop that I feel Yui Horie has yet to top.  The ending is considerably less memorable, but Love Destiny has ""instant classic"" written all over it.Though the story is rather thin, I feel the characters do a good job of holding it up.  Each sister has a ""gimmick"", but you never really feel they\'re completely one-note personalities.  It always seems like there\'s plenty more to them, even if the series doesn\'t explore much beyond their unique attributes.  They\'re very entertaining, and when I watched it the first time I found myself growing to like and dislike the sisters as if I was the one living with them (even going so far as to periodically scream ""UGH, SHUT UP, HINAKO"", much to my family\'s confusion).  Wataru is a relatively likable protagonist, and takes the sudden onset of having 12 unusual siblings in stride...which is, admittedly, surprising, but sudden popularity will likely do that to a guy of his type.  The interaction between Wataru and the sisters is well done.Overall, I still can\'t explain what I love so much about Sister Princess.  It\'s paced slower than molasses, but I still often find myself longingly eying my box set, wishing for the ""magic"" that the show made me feel when I first watched it.  It\'s greatest strength is pulling you into its world, and that\'s a world I\'ve come to enjoy very much.  It\'s safe, clean, and beautiful, and the worst things that ever happen are inclement weather and personal inadequacy.  Sister Princess is, without a doubt, the anime I would most like to live in.  I\'m still not sure EXACTLY why, but a good deal of this feeling can be chalked up to the series\' effectiveness in drawing me in.  Give it a chance, it might grow on you.

All I have the ability to say is unless you REALLY love your brother (or want to be REALLY loved by a dozen stereotypical sisters), you will most likely hate this show. My debate to watch the show was piqued further when I found people saying the show was INCREDIBLE AND MUST BE WATCHED (I've dubbed this process Bokufication) or there were questions with no responses as to how they felt or even from others who watched it. After a joke about whether this show would be a hidden gem or make...me vomit a kidney, I dove in. the words onii-chan (and 11 various ways of saying onii-chan) were probably used about 150 times per episode from episode 2 on. After a kidney AND liver transplant from a local hospital, I decided to ward off the intense pain and suffering this show caused me. It's 26 episodes of plotless hum drum and the MC complaining.Don't watch it. Never watch this show. It's worst than the last two episodes of evangelion when they ran out of budget. 24 extra episodes worse. me vomit a kidney, I dove in. the words onii-chan (and 11 various ways of saying onii-chan) were probably used about 150 times per episode from episode 2 on.

I was enthralled from the very start which doesn't happen often but this anime aims to deliver fantastic entertainment and deliver it does!I was a bit sceptical at first when I picked this series up thinking it would be just another medicore harem but I warmed up to it after the first 3 episodes. It's clear to me that a lot of thought went into this series, nothing was rushed apart from one thing but I'll leave that for later.First the characters and the story. The characters are extremely diverse and have a lot of depth,...which is rare for harem-style animes. The main protagonist is a teenage boy named Wataru who lives in the urban jungle known as Tokyo. We don't really get that much information on his daily life in Tokyo or even the place where he lives because moments into the anime we find out that he fails some important exams and is forced to make a decision which will change his life. That decision is to move to a different school on a suspiciously circular near-by island. Once he gets there however a series of strange events leads him to the discovery of his... 13 sisters. This is where we meet the rest of the main cast that will accompany and support the male lead throughout the series.All of his sisters have a story to tell and also have plenty of personal traits. We have a powerful and mature mage, Chikage. We have an engineer/inventor Rinrin, a slow but kind Aria, the sickly and poetic Marie, then we have the traditional/warrior Haruka who's always fantasising about her brother, a detective wannabe Yotsuba, a clumsy but cheerful Kaho. We have a young and energetic Hinako, a wise and loving Karen, the strong and athletic Mamoru and the master chef Shirayuki.The remaining two girls are a little bit weird and mysterious. We have the fashion-trendy Sakuya,who's keen on crossing the brother/sister line with Wataru, then we have Mamimi who seems to be hiding some sort of a secret from the protagonist but to avoid spoilers I won't say what it is. After the shocking discovery of his 13 siblings, our hero faces a lot of rather difficult challenges in his new life.Every episode is interesting and the makers did their best to surprise and entertain us. I suppose at this point it would be worthy to mention that there are plenty of sexual jokes in this anime. Yes, you read it right. But they're rather subtle, however considering that all of those jokes are about... uhm, questionable situations between Wataru and his sisters, some people will certainly be surprised. There's one particular part that keeps coming up in my mind in which the view keeps panning around the room, showing us plants, walls and drawings while Wataru and one of his sisters moan and gasp for air. Wataru asks her how much longer and she tells him to be patient and that “it's almost there”. It's only later that the view changes to them and we see that in fact she was just planting some scented candles on his back to help him relax after an accident. Still, some strong sexual innuendo there. There are plenty of more of these type of scenes in the series. In fact, the relationship between Wataru and his sisters is special. They don't treat him like their brother, more like a lover who's destined to live with them forever. At the same time, this series makes it look perfectly fine, not once did it feel creepy or odd. That in itself, is odd. But then again this series has to be watched to be fully understood. There's a weird atmosphere in this anime that makes all the sexual jokes and questionable situations seem perfectly acceptable.One thing I didn't like about the story however is the fact that it leaves some things unanswered and personally I don't like when a series ends and you're still having doubts as to what has actually happened in it. For instance, this series describes what the characters are like, but not where they're from. We never see Wataru's parents and we have no idea why he only found out about his sisters as a teenager. Was he separated from them at birth? Was there an accident? Also suspicious is the fact that they all look completely different. There's no family resemblance. Did they have different mothers but share the same father? We simply don't know and this series won't tell us. Then again, I   don't think that's what this series is about. It's about the relationships between people and the ups and downs of life.The music is just as good as the scriptwriting. It's appropriate for this kind of anime. A good chunk of this series features classical music. CLASSICAL music. There's nothing better, in my opinion, than a good anime series with a classical theme. You'll rarely find classical pieces in modern animes, if at all.All in all, this series is a must watch, regardless of what genre it is that you enjoy watching. It's entertaining for virtually all ages and the re-watch factor is definitively strong here. As I mentioned the only weak point is that there are some unanswered and unexplained things in the plot but other than that, this series makes a great job of covering each character's personality and the plot itself, even though it has some unexplained patches here and there is still very good. Sister Princess is a vastly underrated series for reasons that I cannot fathom. I for one enjoyed it and I will be definitively coming back to it in the future.That concludes my review, Sister Princess gets 9 out of 10 points from me. which is rare for harem-style animes.

(But even then, it has major problems that have to be addressed.) It reminded me a lot of Angel Tales in how the characters act around him. The only problem is that it’s his sisters and not guardian angels but even then, I can’t take these characters as sisters. None of them really look like him at all and there seems to be a little girl that he keeps seeing in a yellow outfit that keeps talking to him in his strange dream world. They never explain who it is, they just show her.The...story line pretty much goes back and forward and most end up with Wataru and his sister of the week doing something on the island. It doesn’t even explain much about how he got his sisters, what the charm that keeps being shown is, or even why the hell we should even care. Every once in a while, it seemed to go into a rather fantasy look and then back to a slice of life. Once in a while, it hinted that it was going to be a romance with him having to pick one of the sisters as a love interest but then snaps back away from it. I actually had a feeling it might turn yaoi because Wataru was always writing to Akio the whole entire time and he sounded like he was gay when he read the letter out loud.Now to talk about the characters, and oh god… how do I do this? Maybe I should group them into age categories. Aria, Hinako, and Shirayuki are the younger sisters. Let’s see, I can pick out what there one personality trait is. Aria is a Victorian gentle women, Hinako is the carefree child, and Shirayuki is the wanna be chef. Again, it’s really really sad that I can pick out one trait that explains them. Kaho, Mamoru, Rinrin, and Yotsuba are the middle sisters. Yotsuba is the detective, Mamoru is the tomboy, Kaho is the gardener and clumsy, and Rinrin is the inventor. Karen is the girl Wataru’s age, and the only one that seems to be seen more often. She acts like a mother to the others. Sakuya, Marie, Haruka, and Chikage are the older sisters. Sakuya is the flirty one, Haruka is a traditional Japanese girl, Marie is the slickly sister, and Chikage is the fortune teller. Again, that’s all we understand from them because we don’t see enough of them to tell us anything else.The animation is pretty much the same as every other show, nothing special and the onlything that shows is the crazy hair the sisters have. The girls all have different colored hair with no reason as to why, only some having brown hair which is close to Wataru’s. I’m glad that Wataru lost the stupid glasses that he wore in the first episode because he looked like a geek. He even says they are just glass so why the hell wear them in the first place?The voices are the bad part mostly (I’m talking English Dub here…. Haven’t seen Sub yet). Most of the girls have high pitched whines and even Wataru sounds whiny and a push over. Braden Hunt does his voice and I really think this guy really doesn’t have a good voice for a lead role like this. He sounded way more out of character and off. I am not going to get into all the voices because really now, its way to many to and the fact that they all have to high of a voice bugs me, plus how Mami has the voice of a smoker too. story line pretty much goes back and forward and most end up with Wataru and his sister of the week doing something on the island.

Excellent opening and ending songs.Despite its overall story it\'s a 2001 anime that kickstarted a handful of prominent voice actresses. Never underestimate the power of this anime that once contributed Japan\'s voice actor fandom.The story flows slower than one can ever imagine, but I don\'t mind it. I definitely can relate to the slow-paced lifestyle. And yes, it\'s suppose to be a slice of life anime. The main theme of this anime could be ""kindness among family members"" and not romance per se. Obviously it\'s not really your typical harem genre of anime.But just directly from...the synopsis:  a dozen of cute and charming girls start to flock him and claim to be his younger sisters...... Dozens? Obviously I see the funny indirect reference Jesus and his twelve disciples.

They were interesting and kind hearted...girls. Waturu, too, is a nice guy who grew to love them all.I just loved Aria, she dressed like a doll, and was such a lovable airhead, her speech was very simple, and she was adorable.This wasn't meant to be a sophisticated, adult anime.

That is letting things go. The MC is definitely not the star of the show. But really and seriously. Who is the star of this anime series? My conclusion is that it is not a character in Sister Princess, but more like love, specifically about light-hearted love for others very close to you.I personally believe it\'s...accurate to say that the anime\'s plot, compare to the game\'s plot, emphasized the elements of criticizing the dog-eat-dog social attitudes in mid-late 1990s Japan much more than I expected.

It began as a serialized light novel series and spun into manga and a bishōjo videogame. The show is categorized as a harem (with moe elements) anime but it’s not like one guy + lots of girls = HOT SEX TIME!!!! ; considering the fact that all the girls on this show happens to be the guy’s sisters. That’s right, the main character of this show, Wataru Minakami, has 12 younger sisters (or in the anime case, 13 sisters). Imagine yourself in that position (brothers or...sisters, your pick) and wonder about that.Anyway, the synopsis of this show is when Wataru fails an entrance exam and left behind by his old friends, he is suddenly enrolled him in a school in Promised Island and upon his arrival, he happens to find out that he has 12 sisters who actually is very ecstatic and looking forward to meeting and spending time with him. That is mostly the synopsis so far in the series. Most of the episodes consist of him doing the aforementioned spending time with every one of his sisters doing various things. At first to me, it just seem kind of repetitive and mildly tedious but later on, I actually started to enjoy some of the episodes quick.The 12 (or 13) sisters consist of (in alphabetical order): Aria, the soft-spoken and sleepy-voiced French sister who has a tendency to cry whenever there’s trouble; Chikage, the mysterious and gothic sister who is an accomplished practitioner of dark magic; Haruka, the German sister who aspires to become a perfect Japanese lady; Hinako, the youngest of the sisters and shows her affection accordingly; Kaho, the clumsy sister despite that she’s on her school’s cheerleading team and loves to cheer for her brother and loves to grow flowers with and for her brother; Karen, the skilled pianist and whose personality seems suited for an older sister; Mamoru, the athlete of the group and always trying to get her brother to play sports with her; Marie, the one who has an weak constitution and spend time in the hospital various times; Rinrin, the gifted one in the fields of science and technology and always building things; Sakuya, the one who behaves like a modern teenager and would like for her brother to see her as a woman and not just a sister; Shirayuki, the cook of the dozen and always tries out new recipe and Yotsuba, the English-hailed sister who fancies herself as a detective. Plus, there is Mami, who poses as Wataru’s sister after he mistakes her as that and as she tries to break him away from his sisters, her stay there has given her a second opinion about them overall, learning why the sisters love him very much and I could reveal more but like I always said, this is something you have to see for yourself.The sisters themselves are actually very likable. At some points, they can get overly too cute and saccharine and sometimes you can go “AAWWWW!!!” but still they could be characters that you can stand being with. Although, one of the sisters did claim in their previous lives, they could be lovers and the other one expresses her desire that she might marry him. On a positive note, it doesn’t go too far with that and she agrees that it would be impossible when in his presence, so don’t worry, no incest sex (I’m looking at you, Koi Kaze) in this one. However, with every decent character, there is one annoying character and it is Yamada. I really hate Yamada. He’s that kind of character who is hyper and annoying as hell and constantly sniffing around and is jealous of Wataru and the affection his sisters are giving him. Mostly, he’s like the friend that only hangs with you to score with your sister and fuck all. Also, what’s also the word to describe him?He's a HAM!!! That is all.The animation by Production Company ZEXCS (weird name, by the way) is very colorful and has that paint backdrop look to it and it doesn’t feel that it aged to me. Maybe by a year, it will, but that’s just me. The music is decent for the show as I didn’t mind the beginning and ending songs but I do skip those once I gotten into the show and the background jazzy-like music is one of its musical highlights, even though it sounds almost like music from The Weather Channel.FINAL VERDICT: At first, I thought this was going to be a borefest with too many girly elements but it was an alright show. I enjoyed most of the episodes, characters, themes, elements and I think this show is actually one of the harem titles that don’t apply the element of lolicon and other Hentai-related things.

Let's start with why i was supposed to not enjoy it that much in the first place, The pace is very slow and it have 26 episode so you would think watching it will feel like a drag. But no, every episode felt relaxing and it put you at ease. The pace definitely compliments the plot of the show. So, what is sister princess about anyway?, It's about a guy named Wataru Minakami leaving the busy city life to a more peaceful and quiet island. Then he met his sister...and they try to get closer to him, Thats basically it, Its a slice of life what do you expect anyway?. But thats the charm of it. It take it's time to focus more on The Main character and his sister, Try to develop their relationship even more, Since most of the main cast is likeable it felt more like an enjoyable experience. How about the animation and artsyle?, Sometimes it looks like a painting, Sometimes it looks like a kids drawing, Thats probably the only complaint that i got about the show. Sister princess was an experience, There is no other anime that i have watch that felt like something pinched my heart, It truly felt melancholic. And if you decided to watch it i hope you have the same experience that i have.

Wo Qi Ku Le Baiwan Xiulian Zhe,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49952/Wo_Qi_Ku_Le_Baiwan_Xiulian_Zhe,"['This show is actually dreadful. The fact that this got made is frankly absurd.So let\'s break it down. The MC get\'s sent back to some weird psuedo-ancient china after getting blood on his smart phone. He takes over the body of a useless noble and get\'s a system (who is later personified as a ""Cruel Loli"" and I am quoting the characters directly). The system lets the MC get more powerful when he upsets someone else. This allows him to just become the most powerful person on the planet (except his dad, but we\'ll get to that). The MC himself is just obnoxious, but...not in a funny way. Instead, we get a ""This is an asshole who is just coasting through life for the sole reason that the script needed him to do so"" kind of of way.The MC\'s father is a much more interesting character, and I would maybe watch a show about him, but not MC.Furthermore, the art is just horrific. Assets are constantly recycled. Background characters ALL MOVE IN SYNC enough times to not be a suprise.The writing is just so totally uninteresting that it got to the point it wasn\'t even funny to make fun of it anymore.The story itself is just nonsense. Nothing really happens other than the MC and his brother seeing something and doing 1 of 2 things.Option 1: Be oddly cruel to some random character for no reason. Like, he just tortures people and forces them essentially into slavery, and the show is just like ""look at how cool and funny MC is"". And it\'s not just for Anger Points either, sometimes he just makes fun of disabled people who don\'t even give him AP. He\'s just cruel.Option 2: A painfully drawn out and boring fight. The animation is slow, terrible, the effects are essentially just JPEGS smashing into each other as they fly around.I will give you a visual summary of every single fight. Some characters square up, MC says something obnoxious that the show alone thinks is funny (except when he admits he ""no longer lusts after toads"" after meeting someone, that was funny). Then MC and whoever is one his side throws hand, moon, and Yin-Yang JPEGS at the enemy, as the enemy summons the same fucking gate model to summon some other bullshit JPEG back. Eventually the MC and Co will have their JPEG smash into the opponent and they will win. That\'s it. You can now go and watch something else, I\'ve given you the whole show.A brief note on the sound of this show. It adds random annoying sound effects that sound like it\'s from one of those shitty youtube videos that targets children, but to everyone who isn\'t a child it\'s just annoying. And the voiceactors just randomly walk outside of the recording studio or some shit because out of nowhere the audio for the voiceactors just drops hard. Add to that pretty much all the sound effects are stock sound effects I bet you could find on a royalty-free soundboard, I can safely say that it is certainly not worth much (if any) praise.If you are looking for something good to watch in the Cultivation genre that\'s similar to this but done well, watch Soul Land. It\'s pretty, the fights are good, and the MC isn\'t just the worst person to watch exist.If you are looking for something more serious, Record of a Mortal\'s Journey has been really good. I\'m not done with it yet, but what I\'ve seen is just great.If you are looking for something bad to watch to make fun of or just marvel in it\'s terrible glory, watch My Cultivator Girlfriend. It is so bad it is hillarious. I really can\'t recomend that one enough.TLDR: Don\'t bother with this one, it\'s funny to make fun of for 30 episodes if you stretch, then it becomes so redundent that\'s not even fun anymore.

I have watched 35 episodes till now as only till here is aired now. I don't know about anyone but I found it very satisfying and entertaining. It's hilarious as well as interesting.I think it obviously deserves above 7 rating on mal. So just watch it you won't regret it.The story of this anime is very unique...as well as entertaining.

What follows with him in this new world is a virtual assistant user interface that tracks all Jiangbei's properties (physical health, psychological health) including his combat skills and anger points. Jiangbei is reborn into a useless son of one of 3 powerful families in his City. The person he reincarnated to most likely died because he overworked in cultivation and couldn't progress. However, this new cultivation system is governed by anger points - which increases every time Jiangbei pisses someone off and the more powerful the...person the more points he receives (example: family patriarchs/cultivation masters). He uses this to the best of his ability by spending his reincarnated life at a leisurely pace by disrupting the order in his City which pisses his family and the other noble families off.

Examples are when the Princess' guards fight Jiangbei and his brother steps in to protect him (his older brother is several stages higher than everyone or when Jiangbei fights one of the noble family patriarchs and his father and Martial Master secretly protect him) At this rate, I doubt we'll get any interesting content out of this series despite it first showing great potential being a cultivation series with a unique twist.Art & Sound: 6/10The art quality is pretty good, the character rigging and scenes aren't the flashy.Sound is ok.Character: 5/10There isn't much character progression.

The story begins with Jiangbei being isekai'd from a modern world into a traditional cultivation one like Great Doctor Miss Nine but with a unique cultivation system that's exclusive to the protagonist. Jiangbei is rewarded with experience points that can be used to level up, learn new abilities, and forge powerful weapons by simply pissing people off so in the first 30 episodes or so we see him purposely getting under everyone's...skin so he can rack up points to become OP which leads him to become one of the strongest cultivators in his country (he eventually leaves and is no longer as OP but he still wins every confrontation).The uniqueness of this show is great but for whatever reason it takes a turn for the worst when the showrunners start leaning towards a more serious style in which the worldbuilding and overall lore becomes more fleshed out. Normally, this would be seen by many as a good thing but this ridiculous-to-serious transition creates a jarring contrast in tones that doesn't seem to be reconciled very well. The overall plot of the show is confusing to follow and seems to be arbitrarily made up episode-by-episode. The characters also maintain the same shallowness you would see in a slapstick comedy. Again, normally this would be fine if the tone remained the same as the first 30 episodes but now that it doesn't, the series really doesn't have any selling points worth mentioning as its now is clashing with itself.I'm giving it a 4/10 as of episode 57.

Xiao Qian,https://myanimelist.net/anime/315/Xiao_Qian,"['Before watching this movie, I made some research on it and ""don\'t expect to understand this one"" seemed to be the key phrase. Still, the synopsis was interesting enough and so I watched it anyway (I\'m a sucker for Chinese folklore), although just expecting eye candy. In the end, I liked it! Though I warn you in advance: if you are not familiar with Chinese folklore (specially the tale of Xiao Qian and the tax collector Ning), you will find some of the concepts awkward, at best. Like, for example, the idea of ghost busting: if you are not familiar with the myths of supernatural...powers possessed by Taoist masters, you will most likely laugh at it while recalling a certain American movie that has absolutely nothing to do with it.Story/World:Although it\'s not mandatory to know Chinese folklore in order to watch (and enjoy) the movie, you will miss out on a great deal if you don\'t keep up with all the Chinese mythological references (which the movie expects you to know, since it doesn\'t explain any of them). That said, the story is very singular, although odd and many times incomprehensible.We follow Ning, a debt collector, and his dog Solid Gold. They\'re wandering around (seemingly aimlessly) and end up in a ghost town. It\'s a story of a human falling in love with an enchanting ghost, followed by bizarre giant monsters, with some generic warriors helping along the way. And don\'t forget all the Chinese mythology references too (eye candy).Basically, don\'t watch this for the story if you have a short attention span. Although the creative storyline isn\'t necessarily directed to adults, it demands the comprehension of those at least 10 and up.Art/Animation:The art is nice. The character designs are Disney-ish in an unique way.Animation-wise, watching it now, don\'t expect something grand. The animation is quite good for its time (for the characters and its motions, I mean) but it\'s outdated (this movie is over 10 years old). That being said, lets also not forget that this is Chinese animation so, obviously, the style is also different. Animation excels in character motions, specially in action scenes, which are greatly done, using very creative camera angles and charming colors. Down side would be the the CG used, which is on the very low quality side. In fact, the use of both 2D and 3D don\'t go very well together: the 2D is great, the 3D fails.Character:Character designs are unique to the individuals. A lot of the personality can be deduced from how the characters look like. Of course, most of them are pretty linear, like the ""I trust everyone"" Ning (you wouldn\'t expect that kind of personality on a debt collector xD), the ""worship me"" Evil Mountain, the ""I\'m awesome"" Ten Miles, the ""I\'m god"" White Cloud or the ""too good for you"" Shine. However, although there is nothing utterly wrong, nothing really stands out in this department.Sound:Sound, sadly, is its biggest failing. The film was originally designed specifically around doing both Cantonese and Mandarin so you\'d expect some failure there but, oddly enough, that\'s not where the failures appear. Actually, both audio languages are quite nice: the Cantonese brings less harsh character voices, since the dialogue sounds more like singing than talking, while the Mandarin is far more serious, with the extra work gone into drama. No, the problem is not the audio language.We then have a few Disney-ish musical moments throughout the movie, although they sound lovely in both audio tracks. No, the problem is also not in the songs.Unfortunately, it\'s the effects that fail the whole sound experience. They are mediocre and banal, at best. I even recognized sounds from a game, as well as numerous other films.Although the dramatic aspects are well held, very often the sound intrudes on a well animated tense moment, ruining the whole experience.The English dub is another fail, although not as prominent, because I recognize that it\'s somewhat hard to translate Chinese into English without it reading rather strange (cultural relativism). Nevertheless, the dialog is incredibly cheesy and, on many occasions, fails to deliver the original meaning of the story. I don\'t recommend it. The Mandarin and Cantonese tracks are both quite good and, although you are probably used to the clearer Japanese language, Chinese is very melodic so give it a try.Enjoyment:I liked the story and there were a few hilarious moments and awesome action scenes, but that was it. You can tell the movie is very ambitious and wildly imaginative. The love story portrayed is universal enough to be understood by anyone. So, if you can overlook the pathetic CG and the miserable sound effects, this movie will be something worth your time, otherwise, you watch it for the myth references only.Overall:Sadly, it fails to stand out thanks to several factors already stated and though it is re-watchable once or twice (to hear both audio tracks), that is about all. powers possessed by Taoist masters, you will most likely laugh at it while recalling a certain American movie that has absolutely nothing to do with it.Story/World:Although it\'s not mandatory to know Chinese folklore in order to watch (and enjoy) the movie, you will miss out on a great deal if you don\'t keep up with all the Chinese mythological references (which the movie expects you to know, since it doesn\'t explain any of them).

There was even a scene where they stopped by a blossom tree in a little lagoon of lotus flowers in the middle of Green Plains. Also the pirate was more like sonic pirate or the ones...from icecream, he had no legs and the robot was a ship with legs. The karneval was abit different the houses were more like the stone ones like in animes as Magi but they were way taller one above other with tons of Karvenal/Festival stuff and also those guys with long legs walking around, it was wonderfull, there was also the train travelling the universe in its way to a giant clock with clock pieces floating and etc, I didn't remember the dragon as a train but a guardian of the train or something since people where trying to capture or kill them, the part of that Tree witch was more like underwater cave and that other girl was a mermaid or something, the bad witch was their mother and wanted his soul then her sister closed the shell to stop her. Then after passing the rebirth clock, he woke up in a room with no roof doors windows (only the holes of doors windows etc) and paper chinese lamps to illuminate the place, blossom threes, etc, he went looking for her in every house.. he couldn't only find babys, he was one.. then he look up to the sky seeing the stars up there while screaming and crying..ETC, didn't say all details but that was how I imagined.. a love story between a boy and a ghost girl( how come I forgot that lovely dog.. maybe because my first dog got kill at my young age..it was my first friend/male dog, till then didn't have any pet that was just mine nor any male dog, my pet had 3 dogs but only a female dog survived.. later we had to give her away..etc..)old animes always look better in our heads than when watching again years later..

That\'s right, one of the studios behind Uchuu Kaizoku Mito and the studio we have to thank for Serial Experiments Lain. It\'s based off of the short story Nie Xiaoqian. So, let\'s see how it holds up as a film.Story:We follow a young debt collector, Ning as he takes a journey to forget his former beloved Lan Siu who left him on account of his ignoring her in favour of earning money. Dude, we get it you need money but a successful relationship is built on communication. You can\'t just ignore your...partner. In any case, he encounters a pair of ghost busting monks who purify some evil spirits in front of him. While he runs and\xa0 waves his arms about like a right useless bastard. After the excitement, he continues on his journey only to find himself in\xa0 city filled with spirits and uncertain how to survive.Let\'s dig right into the primary issue that plagues this film. The pacing. And this isn\'t like yesterday\'s subject either where the pacing could have been better but wasn\'t that bad. In this it\'s an absolute mess. Once the film\'s gotten going we can\'t get a couple minutes between one long action sequence involving a lot of shouting and the next. Its like Ning\'s whole shtick is getting carried into absurd situations where he\'s completely useless. He\'s like Yamcha. There\'s also the big romance plot. Which is complete tripe. Our leads have no chemistry, seemingly nothing whatsoever in common and no apparent reason behind one being attracted to the other. He basically looks at her and thinks ""wow, she\'s pretty."" then she sees him and thinks ""I\'m going to steal his life force"" but then changes her mind and falls for him for no apparent reason. Which is a general problem with the film. A lot of the ""motivations"" are nonsense. The ending is pretty shit too.Characters:In addition to the motivation problem, one of the big character issues has to do with consistency. I touched on that with the romance, but it goes deeper than that. There are characters who will quite literally switch their positions in five minutes without any compelling reason to do so. But the worst element of the characters has to be Ning. Not only is he pretty damn annoying, but he\'s a completely useless character. This isn\'t like Spirited Away where an everyday protagonist goes to a world of spirits and does well for themselves. This dude is completely out of his depth the entire time. And that type of character only really works in a comedy and even then you don\'t want them as the lead.Art:The art is a bit more mixed than the other elements. On the positive side, some of the supernatural designs look pretty good and the film does do a good job with making the city of spirits look pretty vibrant and unique. On the negative side, the animation is very clumsy and the designs for the more ordinary parts of the world are crap. There\'s also the issue with the CG elements not meshing well with the more traditional animation.Sound:The acting is, at best, barely passable. Maybe it\'s just that the script involves a lot of frantic shouting and it\'s really grating. Maybe it\'s that the actors, as a whole, sound like they don\'t give a shit but the consequence is that the performances just aren\'t very good. The music is okay.Ho-yay:There is none. Which suits me fine because, judging by what they do with the romance they do have, it wouldn\'t have been good.Final Thoughts:Xiao Qian is pretty bad. It\'s riddled with story problems, characterisation is weak and inconsistent, it doesn\'t look or sound good. I\'m going to give it a 3/10. Tomorrow\xa0 I\'ll end the week with a look at Aki no Kanade. partner. In any case, he encounters a pair of ghost busting monks who purify some evil spirits in front of him.

The pacing. And this isn\'t like yesterday\'s subject either where the pacing could have been better but wasn\'t that bad. In this it\'s an absolute mess. Once the film\'s gotten going we can\'t get a couple minutes between one long action sequence involving a lot of shouting and the next. Its like Ning\'s whole shtick is getting carried into absurd situations where he\'s completely useless. He\'s like Yamcha. There\'s also the big romance plot. Which is complete tripe. Our leads have no chemistry, seemingly nothing whatsoever in common and no apparent reason behind one being attracted to the other. He basically looks at her and thinks ""wow, she\'s pretty."" then she sees him and thinks ""I\'m going to steal his life force"" but then changes her mind and falls for him for no apparent reason. Which is a general problem with the film. A lot of the ""motivations"" are nonsense. The ending is pretty shit too.Characters:In addition to the motivation problem, one of the big character issues has to do with consistency. I touched on that with the romance, but it goes deeper than that. There are characters who will quite literally switch their positions in five minutes without any compelling reason to do so. But the worst element of the characters has to be Ning. Not only is he pretty damn annoying, but he\'s a completely useless character. This isn\'t like Spirited Away where an everyday protagonist goes to a world of spirits and does well for themselves. This dude is completely out of his depth the entire time. And that type of character only really works in a comedy and even then you don\'t want them as the lead.Art:The art is a bit more mixed than the other elements. On the positive side, some of the supernatural designs look pretty good and the film does do a good job with making the city of spirits look pretty vibrant and unique. On the negative side, the animation is very clumsy and the designs for the more ordinary parts of the world are crap. There\'s also the issue with the CG elements not meshing well with the more traditional animation.Sound:The acting is, at best, barely passable. Maybe it\'s just that the script involves a lot of frantic shouting and it\'s really grating. Maybe it\'s that the actors, as a whole, sound like they don\'t give a shit but the consequence is that the performances just aren\'t very good. The music is okay.Ho-yay:There is none. Which suits me fine because, judging by what they do with the romance they do have, it wouldn\'t have been good.Final Thoughts:Xiao Qian is pretty bad. It\'s riddled with story problems, characterisation is weak and inconsistent, it doesn\'t look or sound good. I\'m going to give it a 3/10. Tomorrow\xa0 I\'ll end the week with a look at Aki no Kanade.']"
Yuusha Raideen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2128/Yuusha_Raideen,"[""Raideen is a awesome show for mecha and any oldschool anime fan.Cool and nostalgic, the series makes it best with a funny and great OST, facial mecha expressions and more. Half directed by Tomino (Episode 1-26) and Tadao Nagahama (Episode 27-50), you can find giant robots fighting in every episode, in the unique 70's art style. If you are a /m/ hardcore mecha fan, this is a must-watch. "", 'Raideen is a ""weird"" series, well, all old-school mecha animes are ""weird"" in our current standards. The first season is Tomino\'s work, so you can see his ero-humor in characters like Mari (panty shots) and Rei Asuka (Jaegar\'s episode).Sharkin was a greatful rival for Akira, and the Berserker Brothers were a refresh from Berostan\'s ritual beast formula. I blame that Rei Asuka character is just missing from the second season for no reason at all.The series had a bittersweet ending, I still can\'t believe that the ending was so depressive. So, watch Raideen if you are mecha-fan or just want to enjoy a good story. ', 'Another show directed by Tomino (MSG) but only the first 26 episodes, while Tadao Nagahama episodes 27-50. Nagahama also went on to direct two other super robot ""hits"" in the 70\'s. After the first disaster of a show in 1975, I had to give the year another chance.OK so obviously one can\'t watch anime in the 1970\'s without finally watching a Super-Robot show...right? Right! Go go let\'s go fighto fighto. Yeah!This is your a-typical super robot show where a giant robot must protect the land from invasion and total destruction. In Yuusha Raideen,  a boy named Akira is a descendent of some race ""senses""...a demon invasion and hears the calls of a robot to defeat said demons. The robot is called Reideen and get used it because this word is said constantly. Not to mention the ""interesting"" transformation sequence.... yeah interesting.Not really much else to the show other than it is a monster-of-the-week where each episode pretty much starts exactly the same (at least how much I watched): Demons make ""fossil-beast"", monster goes after Reideen, Reideen defeats monster with a slew of weapons and attacks that rinse and repeat the same animated sequence over and over again. But who cares, it\'s a super robot show and it knows it. What did you expect? A plot, story, character development? This has none of those things, but it does have robot fighting, a robot that morphs (first of its time), robot not made by science (also first), and sweet 70\'s Japanese music during those epic repetitive robot fights.On one last note, each monster looks like a re-hashed Godzilla monster with the same Godzilla monster roars. I guess all of the studios in Japan shared the same soundboard.Hey, if you like super robot shows, Go for it! I got through 12 episodes and got exactly what I expected. a demon invasion and hears the calls of a robot to defeat said demons. The robot is called Reideen and get used it because this word is said constantly.

1 Pound no Fukuin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1328/1_Pound_no_Fukuin,"['Well, I think this anime is ok. I felt that they did little with Angela and wasn&rsquo;t really used right and she&rsquo;s just a supporting character, and not really a main one who has to struggle with her own issues in relation to her lifestyle. Like her supporting cast is opposite from that in the manga such as Mother Abbess who is strongly opposed to Kousaku&rsquo;s advances. While in this one, of course it&rsquo;s natural to assume but it&rsquo;s not really emphasized that because she&rsquo;s a nun in training, she can&rsquo;t have romantic relations with Kousaku due to those reasons. Kousaku&rsquo;s portrayal shows he is...very serious about boxing but yet he can&rsquo;t give up food like he&rsquo;s that douche from the season 5 of Ultimate Fighter, Gabe Reudiger who wouldn&rsquo;t give up eating cake and chips. And Mukoda&rsquo;s portrayal is what you&rsquo;d expect but he is very realistic about approaching problems and solving some of them. Like if Kousaku was really going out to eat, that&rsquo;s his own fault when he should know this could be his last chance.Anyway, in comparison to the drama and manga, it is more boxing centric than romance and comedy centric which I find is good for those who like Hajime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe which transitions to what I want to say next about the fights.If you have watched Ashita no Joe, then I guarantee you&rsquo;re going to enjoy the fights. A majority of the angles and a fraction of the execution pays major homage to it. Kousaku like Joe is a hard punching brawler but in his fight with Jiro, he shows he does have basic technique against an Olympic gold medallist with his dodging and footwork. And the way he loses sometimes is similar to Joe&rsquo;s losing streak except under different circumstances of why they&rsquo;d puke in a middle of a fight. Joe not feeling comfortable fighting after killing Rikiishi, and with Kousaku, he pigs out. And of course we&rsquo;ll see the use of fouls to win fights. So either the staff of this anime, or Takahashi herself is a fan of Ashita no Joe. But the ending fight ends in an anti-climatic nature which has happened in some other action oriented Takahashi mangas such as Inuyasha vs Bankotsu in the manga version. And the fights in the live action One Pound Gospel have this problem as well.But for the character design, it&rsquo;s your typical Rumiko Takahashi art style and if you like Ranma and Inuyasha, you&rsquo;re going to instantly recognize it. But what&rsquo;s also fun is that there are no bizarre hair styles and hair colors.Moving on, I would like to make the notion that this anime never had a dub release. Whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or bad thing, I&rsquo;m leaving that up to you. But the Japanese cast does have some of the biggest name. Furuya Tooru, the voice of Tuxedo Mask and Amuro Rei and Saint Seiya plays Kousaku. He portrays the character as serious and has a fun side to him. He brings out the confession of his love in a very sincere way in comparison to the sugar rushed portrayal of KAT-TUN&rsquo;s Kamenashi Kazuya in the live action, which is another review for another time. And Tsuru Hiromi, the voice of Bulma in DBZ and Ukyo from Ranma and Reiko from Ghost Sweeper plays a very different role from this one where she is more calm and doesn&rsquo;t really have a fighting intensity, but has a certain anger for Kousaku&rsquo;s indiscipline and his advances.And I&rsquo;m guessing Nagai Ichiro&rsquo;s portrayal of Mukoda paved way for his role of Nekota Ginpachi in Hajime no Ippo, another boxing anime. If just doesn&rsquo;t feel the same if he doesn&rsquo;t end his sentences with &ldquo;da ni.&rdquo; OK, enough of the voice acting, time to talk about the music. It&rsquo;s very uplifting and intense. It goes very well to the mood, and brings a balance to the romantic tensions between Kousaku and Angela.If you&rsquo;re looking for your typical Rumiko Takahashi romance anime, this isn&rsquo;t for you. Then again, in most anime versions of Takahashi&rsquo;s anime, the main female and male characters that have romantic tensions never officially hook up as a couple except for Maison Ikkoku so expect no different. Surprisingly, after reading the manga and watching a majority of the live action version, I like how this is more boxing oriented than romance as I previously mentioned. So, I think it would be a disappointment if it was romance emphasized instead because you know in the end, Angela and Kousaku won&rsquo;t hook up in the oav like they do in the manga which ended not too long ago. Hopefully we may get a new anime version which can give a faithful manga adaptation which later introduced other interesting characters. very serious about boxing but yet he can&rsquo;t give up food like he&rsquo;s that douche from the season 5 of Ultimate Fighter, Gabe Reudiger who wouldn&rsquo;t give up eating cake and chips.

I also love the retro quality, and the silliness of the setup, with this young boxer and nun-in-training. A lot more could have been done with the story and characters though. So I guess I love it's style and potential more than the story itself.From my own scoring system:2/3 for characters and relationships2/3 for plot/storyline3/3 for formal elements0/1 for my special award "", ""One Pound Gospel is an anime about gluttony and why learning from mistakes is something important.The story begins with a guy named Kosaku, which is a regular boxer. He's a really great boxer with a KO punch that could end the match in one round. His only problem is that he thinks about food too much. Whether he's running, practicing in the gym, or just resting, all he thinks about is one thing...FOOD. Even his trainer gets too irritated that he wants to fire him on the spot, or just plain quit as his trainer. Kosaku gets a preaching from his coach every now and...then, but the guy just lets those words flow through one ear and out the other. One day, he saw a nun by the church while doing his daily run, then started to talk to her to get to know her. When they went inside her place at the monastery, he saw FOOD! He ate as much as he can not knowing that his next fight is about to happen sooner than he thought. By the time the fight came, it was total failure...well obviously. The remaining matches that were shown in this OVA was up to his decision to quit and sacrifice eating too much, with the help of the nun and his trainer.Aired in the late '80's, the art style is good knowing that it's an old anime. It's grainy and all, but that's what any typical old anime would deliver anyways. The story takes place most likely in Japan, with the neon lights and the side stores and all, along with the church area. The art is really simple and reminds me of Inuyasha and Ranma, which is made by the same creator that made this OVA. There's nothing really special with the place this anime took place, even the boxing ring. It's there, that's all you have to know.The sound is not as I wanted it to be. I guess the voice actors did a fair job, but it just doesn't add up to be a 'great' anime with great sound effects. As I recall, the ending music was of a popular American song that I don't know the name, but hear alot, or was it the opening? Either way, I just didn't think that the music fits it, so I'm not a big fan of the music and sounds involved on this one that much. I've heard better music, and this is just not one of them.The characters are also really straight-forward concerning their personalities. There are no characters that are really that ominous (except maybe for that one guy Kosaku accidentally punched in the ally way, which you would know the identity if you've watched it or going to watch it). The trainer had the personality of the typical one, all aggrevated and mad all the time. The nun was the usual none (except for the fact that she drinks alcohol o_O). Kosaku is just strange, on the other hand. For a pro-boxer, why would he not worry about being at top of his shape before each match? Might as well become some world-record hot dog eater or something (maybe surpass that dude that wins those kinds of contests like crazy haha), ya know what I'm sayin'?The fun level of watching this show wasn't all that great. It was more of like &quot;Hey...I watch Hajime no Ippo, why not this?&quot; kind of a feeling. I'd have to admit I watched this show since I was currently watching Hajime no Ippo at the time and accidentally stumbled on this page seeing a picture of a guy holding his boxing gloves. I was really pumped to watch One Pound Gospel, but unfortunately, it wasn't as great as I expected. But don't get me wrong, it was a good watch. I wouldn't say I wasted my time watching it. I learned a lesson that learning your lesson is a fantastic moral lesson (wa? three 'lesson' in one sentence? maybe a new tongue twister?).One Pound Gospel have something to say. It's that staying focused on something will make you finish the job easier and efficiently. Swerving for a detour that leads to a cliff isn't worth the short cut. That's basically the lesson of this anime. I say check it out if you want to pass some time when you're bored. then, but the guy just lets those words flow through one ear and out the other.

Zoids Fuzors,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1746/Zoids_Fuzors,"['Ok, I\'m a big Zoids fan, and as such, this review focuses on the differences between the styles of this and the preceding series, rather than an more general overview (I won\'t use Genesis as an example since that is of a vastly different style). Unfortunately, it is very negative.Firstly, let me start with the Story:Fuzors basically has no story whatsoever for the vast majority of the series. In the final few episodes, a backstory gets fleshed out and some continuity established, but as this only happens very late-on, it feels more like a justification for why the series occurred in the way it did,...rather than an actual plot that naturally developed. Furthermore, the story it does eventually manage to establish is rushed, this, along with the generally poor translations, makes it difficult to draw any praise from the story.Now, this brings me to draw parallels with Zoids Zero, which also had a very skimpy plot at best. However, the biggest difference with the two series is that Zero is built around battles and comedy, and as such tries to give the viewer fluid fights and funny lines rather than a deep plot. Fuzors does not, and as such has no excuse for the lack of story.To continue with the story theme, I\'ll next discuss the Characters:While Zoids shows are not renowned for their characters, the development of the cast is not handled well in Fuzors at all. For instance, in the first episode, the character ""Amy"" walks in to Mach Storm\'s headquarters and appears to anger some of the main characters. What the show doesn\'t tell you is that Amy is actually a member of Mach Storm herself. This fact makes it very confusing (to say the least) when she shows up unannounced in later episodes. This is probably the best way of describing the problem with the characters in Fuzors, it simply assumes you know who/what everyone/thing is -rather than actually take the time introduce them.This is especially true for the Zoids themselves. Many of the Zoids, such as Arosaurers and Gorhecks are totally new Zoids that fans of the previous series would not know anything about -and yet they appear on screen without any kind of introduction at all. To make matters worse, old Zoids that fans would be familiar with from other series are changed abruptly and without reason. For example, the Blade Liger is depicted in the other series as a very rare (if not unique) Zoid. In the first episode of Fuzors, three of them are shown. Another prominent example is the Fuzors variant of Gunsniper, which are all customised to be the same as Leena\'s heavily modified (and thus unique) Zoid featured in Zero. No explanation for either of these is ever given.This kind of ""thrust the viewer into the show"" serves to confuse new watchers and disenfranchise fans, and is a great detriment to the series. Toward the end of the series, some of the cast\'s backstory is explained, however this is done in a very rushed manner and fails to justify the terrible job done in the first three-quarters of the series.Next up is the artwork.Well, the most important aspect of a Zoids show is the Zoids themselves, so I\'ll start with them. The models are all done in 3D, but the style is different to the previous series. The models themselves are very detailed, and try to stick closely to the real toy range, with small things like feathers and antennae being included. While such attention to detail may sound good, this is actually a detriment, as it severs to clutter the screen with needless ""wriggly bits"" that only serve to distract the viewer. Furthermore, the models are all done in a very bland color scheme, with everything appearing ""cloudy""  and dull when compared to the crisp, bright, colors of the previous series.Compounding this is the fact that most of these included features are simply never used. For example, the Liger Zero Phoenix never fires the bomb or guns that it has on it\'s back, instead RD usually uses his claws to attack from a distance, which is a big departure from the realism the highly detailed models try to emulate.While this might be excusable if everything in the series were done in the same style of graphics, this is simply not the case. Bullets and explosions are done in conventional anime style and as such stick out like a sore thumb. They just do not blend at all with the Zoids they are fired from or hit.But the most noticeable feature of the animation is the movement of the Zoids. The Zoids move in a very awkward and robotic fashion. All of the Zoids featured are extremely rigid and inflexible, thus their movements seem entirely unnatural and unrealistic. This is especially prevalent when the Zoids ""fall over"", wherein they appear to do a backflip on the spot rather than actually collapse or stagger. This is easily the biggest complaint I have with the series, especially when comparing with the extraordinarily fluid animations of Zero.The backgrounds are bland and uninteresting, with very little stand-out features, and as such, the only positive thing I have to say about Fuzor\'s artwork is the character\'s design. However, considering that the characters are very unimportant (as they are usually obscured from view inside Zoids) this is largely a moot point.Finally, is the sound.Almost all weapons have high-pitched sounds, regardless of what they are actually shooting. As any mech fan could well appreciate, it sounds a bit ridiculous when super-heavy artillery makes a ""pew"" sound. Furthermore, RD\'s voice actor has a very high-pitched voice, as do most of the supporting cast (such as Sigma and Sweet). As the viewer\'s ears are bombarded constantly by all these high-pitched sounds, it honestly gets annoying.Other:Well, there is no section for this, but the quality of translation is very poor. The names of Zoids are often mispronounced or downright wrong.Overall:Quite simply Fuzors is a very poorly made anime when taken from the viewpoint of a Zoids fan. The animation is awkward, robotic and dull, the sound effects are annoying and inappropriate, the translations are poor and the story only picks up toward the end of the series, but this simply come along far too late to salvage the series. rather than an actual plot that naturally developed. Furthermore, the story it does eventually manage to establish is rushed, this, along with the generally poor translations, makes it difficult to draw any praise from the story.Now, this brings me to draw parallels with Zoids Zero, which also had a very skimpy plot at best.

This is easily the biggest complaint I have with the series, especially when comparing with the extraordinarily fluid animations of Zero.The backgrounds are bland and uninteresting, with very little stand-out features, and as such, the only positive thing I have to say about Fuzor\'s artwork is the character\'s design. However, considering that the characters are very unimportant (as they are usually obscured from view inside Zoids) this is largely a moot point.Finally, is the sound.Almost all weapons have high-pitched sounds, regardless of what they are actually shooting. As any mech fan could well appreciate, it sounds a bit ridiculous when super-heavy artillery makes a ""pew"" sound. Furthermore, RD\'s voice actor has a very high-pitched voice, as do most of the supporting cast (such as Sigma and Sweet). As the viewer\'s ears are bombarded constantly by all these high-pitched sounds, it honestly gets annoying.Other:Well, there is no section for this, but the quality of translation is very poor. The names of Zoids are often mispronounced or downright wrong.Overall:Quite simply Fuzors is a very poorly made anime when taken from the viewpoint of a Zoids fan. The animation is awkward, robotic and dull, the sound effects are annoying and inappropriate, the translations are poor and the story only picks up toward the end of the series, but this simply come along far too late to salvage the series.', ""This might sound like a harsh thing to say, but this is one of the worst series I've ever seen. The plot is terrible, and the voice actors are outstandingly bad. The fights are poorly strung together and are terrible to look at. This series was cancelled from US airways for good reason. Although it does get better in the latter half, it's not enough to recover from the terrible first half. "", 'Zoids fuzors, just like Zoids new century, have teams who uses Zoids to battle each other for entertainment purposes in my opinion. It has been a good series especially when their Zoids combine with each other.Unfortunately, the story is a bit cliche. Teams battling each other for no explained reason(I might have missed it in the series though). I have only watched the English dub so far and the voice actors are good. Animation is a bit different from previous Zoids series but then impressive when they combine. All in all, it was a good series. ']"

It says mild nuidity but the best or worst you'll see are breasts with either no nipples or with them covered up...and fondled a little.But all in all if you like big breast, big asses and some ecchi action then this is an anime for you.

Really, you either watch it because you can, watch it because you actually enjoy this series, or watch it because you are a hormone filled male and are in the need of some pointless fanservice. If the title hadn’t tipped you off already, then that is what this OVA is.

Sound enticing?The thing I found pretty amazing is when they started going into these short little profiles of every girl who tries to jump on Junichi as he is frantically trying not to get excited. They go into their “measurements” and show them in suggestive positions and have them doing random things like splashing ocean water.Sound is the same, basically…Same opening, different ending as usual. Not all that interesting. The animation is no better or worse really than the series.If you were in hopes of a continuation after a few months from the end of the series (which frankly wasn’t all that good anyway, so who cares?), I’m afraid this may be a bit of a letdown. However, if you’re looking for something to distract you from the fact you’re not getting any, than go ahead and watch this. Just kidding.

In the preliminary phase, contestants need to earn enough points to remain in the top 100 places; points are a currency in the game where contestants collect from killing monsters or players - they can also be used to purchase items from the AOTU store.The story follows King, an optimistic generic shounen type main character and his friends Grey, Shidou and Kalie as they battle it out in the preliminary phase of AOTU...tournament.Story: 7/10The story is surprisingly well grounded and logical. By sticking within this game world, the story is limited in development and doesn't need to add unnecessary details to make it flashy. The basic grasp of AOTU World can be interpreted early on in the series which allows a natural flow of character establishment and development. Since AOTU World is about a life or death game, there is naturally a lot of surface tension that is reflected in which characters we choose to trust. There seems to be constant foreshadowing of King and Shidou's decision to join the Ghost Haven / Spectre Union (AOTU's largest contestant party ruled by Fox.G) Initially, I found it bland and almost dropped it from the beginning but nearing the end of the first season I realized this series has a bit of potential based on the story.Art & Sound: 6/10The art is hard to follow sometimes but it is much higher quality and bearable compared to the recycled and poorly rigged characters of some smaller budget donghuas. The animation is pretty smooth in fight scenes.I didn't notice much about VAs or background music, everything was typical.Character: 5/10King is a naïve, easily manipulated generic shounen main character who is tricked several times in the series because of his overoptimistic outlook in the AOTU tournament. His choices tick me off a lot in the series but all is well since he has plot armor that negates his bad choices. Aside from that, the characters in this series actually have varying personality traits and abilities like Shidou's monster taming, Kalie's overpowered Old Bones companion, and Grey's overwhelming strength. This is probably the way I'd imagine the power of friendship to be used especially in a game where everyone is fighting for themselves these characters who fight for themselves are compassionate to fight together because of our naïve main character King. Apart from that, the enemy characters (Ray's pirate crew, Ghost Haven, Godrose) are pretty decently developed and are cunning enough to be season 1's main antagonist force.Enjoyment / Overall: 6/10This series was enjoyable most of the time, I am always dumbfounded when King's bad decisions always lead to him being saved in the long run. Like his decision to sit on the fence with Ghost Haven's operations until the end where he decides to stop them from attacking Grey and getting saved by Kalie.

Having a simple story that cool to live as full of meaning. Unlike Inaka Isha (2007) who may be visually confusing, it looks more simple and will make us realize how important it is to appreciate the environment. Is this a form of call/invitation or criticism, which obviously this anime has the unique delivery and good intentions.. Altough it only has a simple meaning but this anime will make you nods.. ', 'Yamamura Kōji has a way of making his work feel more like I am listening to a variation of Japanesetheatre with surrealistic images in the background rather than watching an anime, which is a large part of what makes watching it so interesting! This verve for stage direction comes mostly from his choice of story adaptation, seiyuu and musical directors as much as from his execution or art style, which often leave its viewer wondering what really happened there. And while his art style is unique, where Yamamura Kōji really shines is how he tells a story.In my review for Inaka...Isha I mentioned the feel of Noh theatre in the work; for this adaptation of traditional Japanese rakugo* story Atama Yama, director Yamamura Kōji tells the story using another kind of traditional Japanese fare - rōkyoku (also known as naniwa-bushi), which is a genre of traditional Japanese narrative singing generally accompanied by a shamisen.To help execute his vision, Yamamura selected  rōkyoku singer and bluegrass shamisen artist, Kunimoto Takeharu, to play the narrator and various members of the cast. Kunimoto, who has a real vocal flare for the dramatic, transports us to contemporary Tokyo, Yamamura\'s choice of setting for his stage, where we are shown a man too stingy to let go and too greedy to leave behind. Is this another surrealistic perspective of man\'s eternal dilemma of Eternity and Death or simply a moralistic play about the dangers of greed? While it doesn\'t answer any of the fundamental existential dilemmas or make us grow in our interpersonal relationships, it is still interesting to watch, if only because of the insights we gain into Japanese culture and tradition.One of the best parts about Yamamura\'s directing style is that he realizes how talented the people he hires are and basically lets them do their thing. This usually means that the seiyuu\'s skills at storytelling shine through with the first breath, and so it came as no surprise to me when the musical quality of Kunimoto Takeharu\'s voice took mine away. There were times watching this that I found myself unable to pay attention to the story because I was too busy listening to his narrative and the way he would change his voice or even how he paused to breathe. This alone would have been enough to capture my attentions, but when accompanied by the music of his shamisen, and at times a haunting violin as well, I went away chilled and thought to myself  ""I almost prefer to see this as a play rather than in it\'s animated form.""But see this once anyway, if only to hear the talented Kunimoto Takeharu tell you a story and listen to him play his shamisen.*Rakugo (落語) is a type of Japanese verbal entertainment, originally known as karukuchi (軽口).

Introduction was fairly simple hinting at what was to come and shortly after providing the pretext behind it. As the story progressed you seemed to know what was going on but it doesn't really pan out that way. In fact it bends into something else entirely. Somewhere in the bending out phase i was lost as a viewer with the plot. At first i thought i was seeing something similar to the making of a gardener only to have it morph into a visit from a therapist? I suppose i get it...but clearer wording for description is needed like for example psychological. For it is not just the plot that tells a story but the art as well. Conclusion, makes sense to what the show was leading up to but i feel a nicer end would have been more appreciative. Not that this ending chosen was terrible but more of a  preference choice.At least the moral in my eyes was kind and thought provoking. People no matter how you are always feel the need to expand. Much like a tree and its branches. Not like a rock that stands the same in not just its size and position.  It is like we have an inner black hole that needs substance to maintain it. And the more we fret only seems to expand it further. In short it explains why letting things go is a good thing as opposed to bottling them up.ArtWas a major player to my confusion. If it wasn't mainly for the shoe deception i would find this anime easy to understand. For those that can't what i mean i will explain to a vague degree for not to ruin anything. If i give you a coin it is like a pebble. For you to come back to me and tell me its a boulder but at the same time still a coin you are crazy. Granted i could see what some of you are thinking about and no i am not talking about the invested growth viewpoint. Had i been it would ruin my example. The point being is things generally have limitations but to be hypocritical about that is confusing for it makes it harder if not impossible to fully understand anything that comes afterword. but clearer wording for description is needed like for example psychological. For it is not just the plot that tells a story but the art as well. Conclusion, makes sense to what the show was leading up to but i feel a nicer end would have been more appreciative.

Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4744/Akaneiro_ni_Somaru_Saka,"['Seriously, is  it that bad to find this show entertaining? One can argue this is a typical slice of life, school, harem anime with typical character types and predictable story and you would not be far off. But, if you don\'t LIKE watching things like this, why are you watching it in the first place? Akane-iro is geared to the \'veteran\' otaku who love specific voice actors or character types, or enjoy when different flags get triggered (like hot springs, school festivals, or costume changes) aka: fanservice. You can only watch so many different slice of life harem comedy titles to realize if you...like this particular genre or not. This genre lends itself to a lot of off the wall stories and anyone expecting something ""realistic"" will realize a true ""anime"" (aka normal anime) is not realistic at all. Which is why certain things feel obvious after you watch title after title. Why do you think there are 1000\'s of anime titles, but only about a few dozen genres. As for me I am a fan (not a raging fan mind you) of these types of anime. I am pretty sure I am not the only one in the world that found this entertaining for what its worth.Just like in life, if you expect one thing and get something else, you\'re bound to be disappointed. Watching this with an open mind, you will realize that Akane-Iro ni Somaru Saka is actually a very entertaining and funny anime. Like most slice of life school comedy harems, a premise is presented at the beginning of the show, which is usually far fetched but bound for some form of entertainment. If you read the anime summary you\'ll get the gist, but it does generate enough laughs and surprises to keep you entertained for 12 episodes. An amazing feat that many fail to miss is that 8 of the 10 characters get relatively large amounts of airtime for every episode. With that, the story seems to progress relatively quick and seamless. Sometimes you won\'t realize the episode is over before you know it.A big reason you get sucked into this anime are the character-types and voice actors lined up for this show. Alot of A-list seiyuu like Rie Kugimiya, Aya Hirano, and Wataru Hatano, headline the cast of characters. Big fan\'s of seiyuu like these, will be surprised at how well they lend their voices to these characters. Its inevitable that one will grow attached to one or some (all?) of these characters. Yeah yeah, you\'ve seen these character types everywhere else, who the hell cares? The whole point of having these character types is to have a great chemistry between all the characters and this exceeded my expectations with flying colors (whatever that means). Fang-tan, ahoge-san, and company are all there, the comedy is pretty good and and the drama is just as good as well. The drama doesn\'t show itself too much to get in the way of the comedy aspect of this series but it is a warm welcome from the \'incomplete\' dramas like the ones that never come to fruition (Honey and Clover, 5cm/s, etc). Characters progress perfectly fine in this story. You\'ll feel happy for some and sad for others, that is the nature of drama. In other titles that may get annoying but its perfectly fine in this series. One other thing that I highly enjoyed about this series is that the main character in the center of the harem, Junichi Nagase, was actually not a bad guy. Sure he might have his moments, but overall he was very outgoing and more ""realistic"" compared to most other male harem leads. Even the scenes when he\'s battling his conscience were especially funny.The production value is actually very high compared to your typical anime. The art design hardly ever faltered and never felt like a rushed product. Some people might be put off by the floating hairstyle of some of the girls, but I didn\'t mind it one bit. The details they put in to all the characters including the background characters is something to be commended. Every scene is filled with either characters or static objects. What does that even mean? That means when there isn\'t a close up of characters talking to each other, theres usually a large amount of detail to panning or zoomed out shots. Passed out cooks in a kitchen, well placed furniture in Minato\'s room, or Nagomi\'\'s computer setup are good examples that show enough detail to keep every scene busy and with some depth. The art is far form being perfect but for what its worth, it more than does the job. On top of the great voice acting and art direction, they even have character music cd\'s available for each character and even give previews of their songs in the form of a new ending song for each episode. Sure it may be a gimmick, but you can\'t deny how great they can sing and how they managed to conjure up a few dozen songs just for this show. There are also a few drama cd\'s to supplement your fix of akane-iro after you\'re done with the series. It seems like the producers thought of everything short of a video game for this show.I never felt this was a waste of my time or got annoyed by the characters. Actually this is one of the more complete cast of characters that I have seen (out of 400 titles). I don\'t think I need to mention Code Geass, Hayate, TTGL, and Death Note but I will anyway since most of those characters made me rage at how many of them left many cliffhangers or a feeling of ""needing something"". Despite being a typical harem comedy anime, it\'s the small things that kept me wanting to watch more. The segments of Junichi\'s conscience and the analogy between Junichi\'s parents and the gang\'s current situation were pretty funny imo.As far as slice of life/harem/comedies go this is easily one of the better ones. Its compete in almost every way. Great character chemistry and seiyuu Amazing amount of detail (down to the nipple, har). All crammed in a 12 episode package. What is not to like? If you don\'t like harem comedy this will obviously become fodder for low scoring. Especially for the fools who try to find seriousness in comedy... THEY WILL LOSE THE GAME.Hell, hearing Rie Kugimiya say ""Stop licking already and eat me"" is well worth the price of admission.One of the best lines is uttered in this anime too: ""If you want to dream, go dream while you\'re sleeping"" Priceless. like this particular genre or not.

It goes out of its way to repeatedly build from mediocrity only to plunge itself back down to the point where you wonder why you even gave it much of a chance. It's someone jumping out of a 3 story building and landing on concrete, only to climb back up and jump over and over again. Until the person's bones are mush and the series limps to its god-awful ending.As a series in general, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka (from here on, Akasaka) is passable, I...would go as far to say it's decent and occasionally enjoyable. Its gaping flaws are grossly magnified, rightly, by its constant, flagrant disappointment of its viewers. Basically Akasaka is not pure bad (far from it) but the parts that are actually good makes the parts that are bad look really bad.Akasaka is based off Feng's visual novel released back in 2007. The plot revolves around a boy by the name of Jun'ichi Nagase, who attends a prestigious high school and seems to bear some kind of tough reputation from middle school. Think typical harem school comedy male protagonist. There, I just developed the character to the same degree 12 episodes of Akasaka did. Anyhow, a naive aloof rich girl, Katagiri Yuuhi (CV: Kugimiya Rie), transfers to Jun'ichi's school and Jun'ichi, out of some act of divine inspiration kisses her, causing unspeakable chaos. Then, to close out a rather promising first episode and establish a quite original premise, it turns out that Yuuhi is Junichi's fiancee due to an arranged marriage.Akasaka's female cast is chock full eye-catching and potentially interesting characters. Expectations: high. The series proceeds to do nothing with all but two of the girls. Expectations: failed.Like many similar anime, Akasaka's plot (the plot is essentially just the premise) takes a back seat episodes 3-10 for some good unrelated episodes of fun. That's fine! It's a structure that has worked countless times. And by all means it can work here. But instead, Akasaka is filled extremely cliche situations solved in extremely cliche ways. For example, Jun'ichi's sister Minato (CV: Hirano Aya) takes Yuuhi shopping in a supermarket to make dinner. Six minutes of pointless dialogue about how amazed Yuuhi is of instant curry follows. We get it after the first few lines! Yuuhi talks about how she eats at home as Kugimiya Rie butchers French Japanese transliteration. She's rich, naive, aloof, we get that. Is it supposed to be funny that Yuuhi doesn't know about instant curry and thinks that her cooks and servants don't either? How overblown does the reaction and enlightenment need to be? There are lots of girls in this anime, some who look pretty interesting. Are we going to get episodes about them? With curry? That actually would be pretty awesome...Watching anime should never be physically painful, but that's what I felt as this series slowly killed itself. It's the pain you feel a promising show wastes all the good things it had going for it and falls into mediocrity. Akasaka occasionally strikes silver (no gold in this show, sorry) with a few lines of interesting dialogue and good animation, but after every good or decent episode or plot development the series feels as if it has some obligation to make up for it by spewing crap at our face. It's like you're at an amusement park and every time you have some fun, a burly security guard has to give you a swift punch in the gut. The ending begins suddenly in the last 3 episodes and was likewise promising. Too bad the conclusion of the series was so predictable that I might as well have drawn the storyboards myself and the things that you didn't predict either have no relevance to the plot or are so cheesy and/or wrong you're better off not predicting it.I'm a little harsh on this series because it really is a shame. Akasaka goes to show you how bad writing can absolutely destroy a series with everything else going for it. The art is good, the characters and landscapes are well drawn and fun to look at. Akasaka has a voice acting cast that would remind you of the New York Yankees, with the resulting mediocrity to match. When we have Kugimiya Rie (Shana, Louise, Taiga), Inoue Marina (Chiri from Zetsubou Sensei, Yoko from TTGL), Aya Hirano (Haruhi, Konata, Misa from Death Note) and Tanaka Rie (Chi from Chobits, Sugintou) in the same anime, we're going to be excited. I had my eye on this series ever since voice actors were announced and some art was available.In the end, the voice acting was pretty good but by itself it cannot save a series. The music (besides the terrible OP) is good. It better be good when you have five voice actors with best selling seiyuu albums on your staff. Should there be an OVA about the supporting characters I would most likely flock to it with expectations held high. I've heard that the game this is based off was really cool. Too bad I can't say the same for the anime adaptation. would go as far to say it's decent and occasionally enjoyable.

Too bad I can't say the same for the anime adaptation."", 'There are some shows that really have no business being bad.  Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka is one of those.  When you look at the talent gathered for this series it practically reads as a who’s who of seiyuu talent.  Unfortunately it is that talent that is one of the few bright spots in what is otherwise a pretty dismal series.The story unfolds as your standard harem anime.  I always find some of the ridiculous situations these writers come up with quite hilarious.  A spoiled rich girl ends up living with a pair of siblings (not related by blood of course,...more on that later) who just happen to not have any parents around because they are busy being John Steed and Emma Peel.  Of course our rich girl, Yuuhi Katagiri hates our hero Junichi but announces anyway that they are now fiancées.  I wonder if this kind of stuff really happens in Japan, because it happens an awful damn lot in anime and manga.  So despite me really wanting to like this at the beginning, this show has managed to get itself off to a bad start with me.However I did start to become pleasantly surprised as the story unfolded.  Slowly we are treated to a pretty sweet little romance as Yuuhi and Junichi develop feelings for one another, confess and start down a path I felt was leading to a lovely romantic ending.  That’s when they screwed it all up to hell.  It’s going to be damn hard for me to express my disappointment with the turn this show made about halfway through without giving away too many spoilers.  But it involves the ultra moe sister Minato and Japan\'s obsession with incestuous relationships involving close family members.  Yes the anime does take great pains to point out that Minato and Junichi are not biological siblings.  That’s not the point; your blood isn’t the only thing that makes you family.  If you’re raised as brother/sister you\'re brother/sister, regardless of what your birth certificate says.  In no way should siblings who know they are siblings be romantic interests.  Even though this is a harem romance with many possible choices for the lead to make it very clearly becomes a choice between Minato and Yuuhi.  It’s creepy, disturbing, and completely disgusting.As characters, there is nothing particularly interesting about the three leads.  If you have one harem you’ve seen this one.  I only found the mains compelling for about the first half of the series before Minato became a love interest.  I did find most of them likable in the beginning just not original or inspiring.  The supporting cast has little to recommend either and is largely just background scenery.  Probably the silliest characters of all are Minato and Junichi\'s parents as their various spy stories are told throughout the series.  These have nothing to do with the main plot and feel totally out of place and stupid.  I think it was supposed to be clever and witty.  Fail.As I mentioned, Akane-iro does a great job with its voice cast and music.  We are treated to quite a bit of songs, as there are a lot of ending themes sung by almost all of the seiyuu who do singing work.  It’s a shame that the story and dialogue were not on par with their talent.  I am not a huge fan of the art though.  It reminds me a lot of CLAMP, tall way to thin characters that are just too ""beautiful"".  Big eyes, cutesy hair accessories, and gravity defying bosoms and boys who could easily double as girls if you have those boobs and skirts dominate.In the end this series was a prime example of how to waste great acting talent with a clichéd story, lackluster production values, and creepy plot elements.  Giving it a 6 is probably generous to how disappointing I found this series as a whole, but I really did enjoy the first half of this anime a lot.  If you simply must see every harem romance out there and are not bothered by incest then by all means watch this.

The next anime we're going to produce is Akane-iro ni somaru saka. Now, before we start production, I want everyone to play the visual novel and list out every event and trope that you believe should be included into the anime version. You have one week to complete this game.[One Week Later]Director [looking around the room]: Alright. I want everyone to hand in their lists. [Everyone begins to pass their list to the director.] Okay, thank you. Now, here’s what will happen. A few assistants and I will now tally up the tropes that...should be included into the anime version. The tropes with the most tallies will be included into the series. Only the top 20 tropes will be included. Thank you, we will see you in a few hours.[Several Hours Later]Director [clearing his throat]: After, tallying the results, we have found 20 tropes that everyone in this room can agree with. Here are the tropes:– Bland and Boring Protagonist.– Your Soon-to-Become-Fiance Living at the Protagonist’s House.– Younger Sister in Love with Protagonist.– Childhood Friend in Love with Protagonist.– Rich Ojou-Sama in love with Protagonist.– Best Friend Helping the Protagonist.– The Student Council Involved with Protagonist.– Violent Tsundere Character abusing the Protagonist.– Dinner Involving Curry and Rice.– Supernatural Events.– Typical ‘Test of Courage’ Event.– 'Resisting the Urge to Look at Naked Girls’ Event– Random Mechs and Action Scenes.– Lots of Fanservice (i.e. swimsuits, boobs, underwear).– Home Sick Event.– Hidden Porn Magazines.– Cultural Festivals.– Maid Cafe.– Mountain Resort with Hot Spring.– Incest Ending.Director: I want all these events and tropes into this anime series. Next, I want the tsundere character, Yuuhi Katagiri, to be voiced by Rie Rugimiya. Also known as the ‘Queen of Tsundere’.[The Head Producer looks at him with an unsurprised face.]Director: Don't look at me like that. I mean, come on, Yuuhi Katagiri is rude, abusive, and not very honest with her feelings. The only seiyuu that performs tsundere characters perfectly is Rie Rugimiya. Then, I want Aya Hirano to be on board, as she's a famous seiyuu with high credibility and does excellent voice overs for both soft-spoken and loud-spoken characters. In this case, she will play as the soft-spoken character Minato Nagase with special hidden abilities and talents.Head Producer [raising his hand]: What about animation and story?Director [thinking]: Have little background details as possible, mainly focus on the school, Nagase's home, and lots of random scenes with snow. Next, have minimal facial details for each character, make them almost similar to each other. Keep it simple. Then, I want each of the girls to have a different hair-style with bright hair colors, mostly brown, pink, yellow, gray, etc. But, lastly, I want every character to produce an exaggerated expression for every action.Director [taking a deep breath]: Now, for the story, I want it to be simple. Nothing too complex or deep, make it sightly predictable, except towards the end. I wants lots of random filler episodes in the middle and then, add many main story points towards the end. Keep the dialogue and interactions simple, mainly discussing about food, love, and reasons for why all the girls love the protagonist. Finally, add some stupid comedy that might or might not make the viewers laugh and then, add many random supernatural events to which there is have no reasonable explanation.Head Producer [looking shocked]: If that is what you want, then I’ll do it.[He stands up and heads towards the door with everyone else. Suddenly, the director stops him.]Director: I forgot to say. Keep it to only one season, no sequels.  And have one OVA, which is mainly filled with fanservice material, so we can pander to the fans.Head Producer [looking relief]: Now, that is what I want to hear. I’ll get to work, right away. should be included into the anime version. The tropes with the most tallies will be included into the series. Only the top 20 tropes will be included. Thank you, we will see you in a few hours.[Several Hours Later]Director [clearing his throat]: After, tallying the results, we have found 20 tropes that everyone in this room can agree with. Here are the tropes:– Bland and Boring Protagonist.– Your Soon-to-Become-Fiance Living at the Protagonist’s House.– Younger Sister in Love with Protagonist.– Childhood Friend in Love with Protagonist.– Rich Ojou-Sama in love with Protagonist.– Best Friend Helping the Protagonist.– The Student Council Involved with Protagonist.– Violent Tsundere Character abusing the Protagonist.– Dinner Involving Curry and Rice.– Supernatural Events.– Typical ‘Test of Courage’ Event.– 'Resisting the Urge to Look at Naked Girls’ Event– Random Mechs and Action Scenes.– Lots of Fanservice (i.e. swimsuits, boobs, underwear).– Home Sick Event.– Hidden Porn Magazines.– Cultural Festivals.– Maid Cafe.– Mountain Resort with Hot Spring.– Incest Ending.Director: I want all these events and tropes into this anime series. Next, I want the tsundere character, Yuuhi Katagiri, to be voiced by Rie Rugimiya. Also known as the ‘Queen of Tsundere’.[The Head Producer looks at him with an unsurprised face.]Director: Don't look at me like that. I mean, come on, Yuuhi Katagiri is rude, abusive, and not very honest with her feelings. The only seiyuu that performs tsundere characters perfectly is Rie Rugimiya. Then, I want Aya Hirano to be on board, as she's a famous seiyuu with high credibility and does excellent voice overs for both soft-spoken and loud-spoken characters. In this case, she will play as the soft-spoken character Minato Nagase with special hidden abilities and talents.Head Producer [raising his hand]: What about animation and story?Director [thinking]: Have little background details as possible, mainly focus on the school, Nagase's home, and lots of random scenes with snow. Next, have minimal facial details for each character, make them almost similar to each other. Keep it simple. Then, I want each of the girls to have a different hair-style with bright hair colors, mostly brown, pink, yellow, gray, etc. But, lastly, I want every character to produce an exaggerated expression for every action.Director [taking a deep breath]: Now, for the story, I want it to be simple.

But you think&quot;Hey, the voice actors and animations are good, and such stories, no matter...how cliched, can be fun.&quot;Too bad that after a few dates (episodes), the shallowness of series reigns supreme. Spas, School Festivals, Guy and girl landing in awkward positions... they're all here. While any anime featuring an over abundance of such scenes will not be a masterpiece, some can execute them well enough to at be pretty good.Unfortunately, Akane-iro fails more than it succeeds, each filler episode is a cliches of cliches, with as much unexpected events and funny moments as watching your cat drink a bowl of milk.

That’s pretty much all there is to describe this mediocre anime series and if that doesn’t satisfy your information needs then by all means continue with this review.“Seen it, been there, done that…” Those are the thoughts that came to mind whilst I watched the first episode. It starts of ordinary enough when some posh girl (Yuuhi) is helped out by some guy (Junichi), who’s pretty well-known for some stupid rumour. Well at the beginning of the new school semester it comes to no surprise that said girl transfers to Junichi’s school and thus...begins their rocky relationship. Now I’ve got to say the end of the 1st episode was pretty funny because it was rather unexpected but after that brief moment this anime soon reminds us that sticking with the norm isn’t always the best choice. Here we have a barrage of anime tropes & clichés however I think this anime goes out of its way to contain every single romantic comedy cliché imaginable, including the arranged engagement between Yuuhi & Junichi and the two living together.For the most part it is a series of random misadventures ranging from stuff like the old abandon school expeditions and even these mundane moments could have been more interesting if the characters weren’t so ordinary. There are a whole bunch of characters here, like the typical nurturing sister whose name I forget but the only ones worth mentioning are the main pair Junichi & Yuuhi. Like a lot of people I absolutely hate the loser type protagonist that appear in the romance genre, which is why I should like Junichi for not falling into the category but sadly apart from some amusing moments I just can’t seem to get used to this guy who always seems to have a chip on is shoulder. It doesn’t help when there’s a heroine like Yuuhi, where you just have to think of her as an older version of Nagi (Hayate no Gotoku!).Well it’s no surprise that Nagi comes to mind as they both share the same voice actor and there are also other similar voices to be found here, seeing how this anime has a lot of well-known VAs and sadly that’s what stands out and not the music or the cheesy SFX. The animation on the other hand just doesn’t stand out at all. With a very similar look to anime such as; H20 & School Days, the only feature that seems to stand out are the girl’s exaggerated hair that no one could find appealing.Overall Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka actually had a decent romance going on at some points but the random misadventure only proved to be a great annoyance to the story & the romance’s progression. Stuff that’s supposed to be funny just wasn’t but at least there are a few random things to chuckle at.

I didn't take it seriously, though, for it was impossible to take it seriously. While I was watching it I was really just making fun of it most of the time. Why, you might ask? Well&hellip; it was just so darn stupid. Clich&eacute;d. Annoying. You get the picture.The story centers around a seemingly normal guy named Junichi, who rescues a tempered girl named Yuuhi (what is up with that girl&rsquo;s hair?) from some guys who were trying to pick her up (oh wow, an example...of pure originality right there&hellip; not), and after misunderstandings arise and a first kiss ensues, it turns out that Yuuhi just happens to be Junichi&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e. So she lives with him in his house under conditions of her father to see if he is a suitable fianc&eacute;, along with Junichi&rsquo;s well-endowed sister Minato, etc, etc, etc. Now, this story has some potential&hellip; sort of. But the episodes were filled with so many clich&eacute;d moments it was just&hellip; bad. You know those moments, the romantic kind maybe where someone &ldquo;accidentally gropes the girl&rsquo;s breast&rdquo; or someone &ldquo;accidentally falls on top of the other person&rdquo;. The typical &ldquo;filler type episodes&rdquo; are there too, such as a trip to the onsen or the &ldquo;school festival episode&rdquo;. These type of things can actually be fun to watch, for though they&rsquo;re repeated, they&rsquo;re repeated for the reason that they can bring enjoyment to an audience. However, in Akane-iro, it wasn&rsquo;t funny or interesting or really&hellip;anything.Now for characters. I am sorry to say there is not one character in this cast that I actually like. I don&rsquo;t know why exactly, but none of the characters are likeable. None of them are original, though Junichi is a different protagonist than the general guy caught up in a harem of this sort. As the series progresses, you are supposed to either side with Yuuhi or side with Minato. This would make sense, typical love triangle. There is one tiny problem though&hellip; Minato is Junichi&rsquo;s younger sister. Meaning, incest themes abound! For a while I&rsquo;d thought that Minato was adopted, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was ever fully explained&hellip; so that was pretty stupid. I might have missed something though because sometimes I didn't pay attention. Go watch it yourself and see. Anyway, Yuuhi is the typical tsundere type, which I either really like or just am annoyed by completely. Unfortunately the latter won out the former on that one. Minato is more of a sweet, intelligent, and good at housekeeping type of girl, which also annoys me. Junichi&rsquo;s friends, the minor characters, were okay, like Fuyuhiko and Tsukasa. The student body president amazed me with her absolutely insane hair. Forget the comment about Yuuhi&rsquo;s hairstyle, just look at Mitsuki Siina! Seriously, how does she do it? Does she get up at 3 AM and just slap on the hairspray?Anyway. Moving onto sound, which is the reason I actually started watching this show. I came across it randomly from what I saw a friend was watching and I decided to watch it not only because it was on a whim but because of the popular voice actresses in this series, like Rie Kugimiya, Aya Hirano, Emiri Katou, and Inoue Marina. They all did a good job, all the voices fit their characters. But for some reason, I just could not stand Junichi&rsquo;s voice at all. I&rsquo;m not sure why&hellip; I guess I just didn&rsquo;t like it. The music didn&rsquo;t stand out much, and I don&rsquo;t really like the opening theme at all, though it could get in your head (regrettably so). I never much paid attention to the many ending themes. They were sung by the various voice actresses I believe.The animation&hellip;it&rsquo;s okay, but it&rsquo;s not that good. Movements are generally stiff, the anatomy often looks wrong with people out of proportion. It&rsquo;s not fluid and it has no flair. It&rsquo;s nice enough to look at, I suppose.I was going to give this a 5&hellip; but I suppose I shall give it a 6, for I did like watching it most of the time, even though I thought it was terrible.: D of pure originality right there&hellip; not), and after misunderstandings arise and a first kiss ensues, it turns out that Yuuhi just happens to be Junichi&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e.

Oh, another eroge made into an anime...inb4lameharemrite? Thats probably one of the first thoughts what will cross your mind when approaching this title, and to be honest you are not that wrong. If you cannot handle these times of anime, then you might as well give this a pass.Story: The story is nothing out of the ordinary for this anime, it follows a lot of cliches many animes have done in the past for this genre. The main heroine Katagiri Yuuhi, gets into trouble...with some strangers, and gets rescued by the main lead Nagase Junichi. After a series of misunderstandings we learn that Yuuhi is Junichi's fiancee as decided by their parents. And now they must learn to get along while Yuuhi lives with Junichi and his sister Minato.Art: In terms of art this showed a lot of promise. With interesting and beautiful character designs that look perfect as long as they are still shots, because unfortunately throughout the series there were times where the animators got sloppy and the characters looked distorted and sometimes plain ugly.Sound: In terms of sound, this is probably where most of the people will get drawn into the show. The voice cast of this anime is just something to make your jaw drop, we have top quality voicing from Kugimiya Rie, Hirano Aya, Hirohashi Ryou, Tanake Rie, Katou Emiri, Inoue Marina, and more playing major roles in this show. And they all portray their characters very well as expected by such good seiyuus. On voice cast alone the sound part would get 10/10 but VA is not all there is to an anime. The actual music used for the anime is rather simple and none really stand out much. So 8/10 is a fair score to give this show.Character: This is probably both the best and worst part of the anime. The characters are diverse and interesting, and you feel like you wanna learn more about all of them. However the anime only focus on the main heroine Yuuhi most of the time leaving the rest of the cast in the shadows. And then the anime proceeds to throwing away all effort they put in character development with a very disappointing ending. It feels like the anime wasted a great cast of characters.Enjoyment: I would be lying if I said I didnt enjoy the show somehow. It certainly wasnt that great of an anime, but it had its moments where I honestly had fun watching it. It depends on your tolerance with these types of animes.Overall: The show was nothing out of the ordinary. A lot of stereotypes and pretty terrible writting and producing turned this anime from something that had a lot of potential into something mediocre with not much to remember. It feels like this show could've been much more that it ended up being, and its a shame that wasnt the case.

This happens early on and you would expect the rest of the anime to have them slowly grow close to each other, but oddly enough it doesn&rsquo;t really do that, even though they are the main couple of the title. For most of the anime it seems to have Junichi and his friends...simply messing around having fun, from having parties on a boat, to school festivals and the like. Now I realize that with a title that has &quot;slice of life&quot; elements to it, this would be a standard formula for them to use. The only problem is they tended to stick so much to the gang just having fun, that I honestly forgot that Junichi and Yuuhi were even suppose to get together. There is even talk at the beginning that Junichi has some weird alternate personality to him, (which he does) and at that point I was expecting it to play some sort of key role in things, but again it doesn&rsquo;t really do that. In fact from what I remember counting, he only shows it about 3 times during the series. And even at the end of the anime I am not quite sure just what kind of &quot;major&quot; role it played in things, as it seems they could have removed it completely from the story and it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered. Now things do start to pick up &quot;romance wise&quot; in the title, but that doesn&rsquo;t happen until around the last three episodes. When I say that this is a harem title that is a bit of a stretch, because out of the nine girls only three actually like him, and one of them it doesn&rsquo;t really even go past words. Now I have to give credit to them on the ending, I certainly wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to end the way it did when I first started watching this, and it sure was a different kind than most viewers will be expecting too. Plus it actual does conclude and he ends up together with one of the girls, so that&rsquo;s a big plus. So you don&rsquo;t have to worry about investing your time in this only for it to end without any kind of resolve. Even though this title does have some echhi-ness factors, it doesn&rsquo;t really go too deep into it. You may see a casual panty shot about three times in it, but most of it comes in the form of cleavage shots, and even that isn&rsquo;t really shown off too much. There is one episode where they visit a hot spring (or take a bath in general), but the steam censors it, at least the version I watched did. So anyway, because it doesn&rsquo;t really focus on the romance for a good portion of the show, you kind of have to take the enjoyment on an &quot;episode by episode&quot; case. There is some decent humor in this, but I don't think it will be enough to keep you into it. There is a small plot going on about what Junichi actually is, it can get interesting at times as more hints are given out as the story progresses...even if its not really well explained at the end.The animation was good in this, while nobody ever really moved around enough to get a true judging on the whole &quot;fluidity&quot; aspects of it, the characters did come off with a certain charm to them. And I have to say that some of the hairstyles on the women were kind of bizarre--yet oddly charming. You get a lot of sunset scene here and it looks good enough to at least make you take notice of it. But the character design is probably the best thing regarding the art, while they weren&rsquo;t really drawn highly detailed, they did have appealing qualities such as (again) the hairstyles, expressions, and the clothing that they wear. The backgrounds never really stand out though, they are not drawn badly by any means, but not detailed enough to really take notice of them. Which in turn could be either a good or bad thing, because it makes you stay focused on the characters themselves.The opening and closing theme were pretty nice, they both contained a bit of a happy--yet sincerity style to them. For some reason the opening makes me kind of sad, not because its bad, but just the way the music is displayed. Now I have to talk about my favorite aspect of this anime, and that was the voice acting! I won&rsquo;t go as far to say that it was spectacular or anything, but I did feel that each characters voice matched beautifully with the characters. Especially with a female named Minato, she had that kind of &quot;nice girl&quot; personality to her, and her voice actress complimented that very well for her. Nothing really worth mentioning about the background tracks, nothing there is particularly memorable, in fact even now I can&rsquo;t really remember much of it.There are over twelve characters in this anime, but unfortunately you only get actual character development with three of them. Even to this day I am still unsure as to who some of the supporting cast members actually were, due to the fact that some would only show up every now and then as the story progressed. Nobody should ever really come off as annoying to the audience, though some people may be turned off with Junichi. Because despite his whole &quot;double personality&quot; ordeal, he doesn&rsquo;t really have much of an impacting persona, and seems to just kind of, well...be there.So in conclusion, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka isn&rsquo;t the worst of the harem titles out there, it really isn&rsquo;t even a bad anime in general, the story is what really brings this title down. Though I did end up finishing this, only because I don't like to drop something when I am well into it already. (again you can't anticipate any of the overall story since it doesn't really build much up, you just have to enjoy each episode as it happens if at all possible) If you&rsquo;re a hardcore harem fan and want something that is unique to the genera, then you probably should just look elsewhere, because this one is pretty standard fare. But if you&rsquo;re looking to maybe get into the genera, or are willing to go in with lower expectations, then I think you should be fine.&quot;Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka&quot; gets 5 censored bath scenes, out of 10! simply messing around having fun, from having parties on a boat, to school festivals and the like.

You may see a casual panty shot about three times in it, but most of it comes in the form of cleavage shots, and even that isn&rsquo;t really shown off too much. There is one episode where they visit a hot spring (or take a bath in general), but the steam censors it, at least the version I watched did. So anyway, because it doesn&rsquo;t really focus on the romance for a good portion of the show, you kind of have to take the enjoyment on an &quot;episode by episode&quot; case. There is some decent humor in this, but I don't think it will be enough to keep you into it. There is a small plot going on about what Junichi actually is, it can get interesting at times as more hints are given out as the story progresses...even if its not really well explained at the end.The animation was good in this, while nobody ever really moved around enough to get a true judging on the whole &quot;fluidity&quot; aspects of it, the characters did come off with a certain charm to them. And I have to say that some of the hairstyles on the women were kind of bizarre--yet oddly charming. You get a lot of sunset scene here and it looks good enough to at least make you take notice of it. But the character design is probably the best thing regarding the art, while they weren&rsquo;t really drawn highly detailed, they did have appealing qualities such as (again) the hairstyles, expressions, and the clothing that they wear. The backgrounds never really stand out though, they are not drawn badly by any means, but not detailed enough to really take notice of them. Which in turn could be either a good or bad thing, because it makes you stay focused on the characters themselves.The opening and closing theme were pretty nice, they both contained a bit of a happy--yet sincerity style to them. For some reason the opening makes me kind of sad, not because its bad, but just the way the music is displayed. Now I have to talk about my favorite aspect of this anime, and that was the voice acting! I won&rsquo;t go as far to say that it was spectacular or anything, but I did feel that each characters voice matched beautifully with the characters. Especially with a female named Minato, she had that kind of &quot;nice girl&quot; personality to her, and her voice actress complimented that very well for her. Nothing really worth mentioning about the background tracks, nothing there is particularly memorable, in fact even now I can&rsquo;t really remember much of it.There are over twelve characters in this anime, but unfortunately you only get actual character development with three of them. Even to this day I am still unsure as to who some of the supporting cast members actually were, due to the fact that some would only show up every now and then as the story progressed. Nobody should ever really come off as annoying to the audience, though some people may be turned off with Junichi. Because despite his whole &quot;double personality&quot; ordeal, he doesn&rsquo;t really have much of an impacting persona, and seems to just kind of, well...be there.So in conclusion, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka isn&rsquo;t the worst of the harem titles out there, it really isn&rsquo;t even a bad anime in general, the story is what really brings this title down. Though I did end up finishing this, only because I don't like to drop something when I am well into it already. (again you can't anticipate any of the overall story since it doesn't really build much up, you just have to enjoy each episode as it happens if at all possible) If you&rsquo;re a hardcore harem fan and want something that is unique to the genera, then you probably should just look elsewhere, because this one is pretty standard fare. But if you&rsquo;re looking to maybe get into the genera, or are willing to go in with lower expectations, then I think you should be fine.&quot;Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka&quot; gets 5 censored bath scenes, out of 10!"", ""I only write reviews which defend animes thats been UNDERATED like this one.I have no idea why people are mocking this anime, there is nothing wrong with this anime.The storyline follows the classic romance comedy, face it people, pretty much All romance comedies containing harems follow pretty much the same storyline, in fact this anime was actually more difficult to predict than standard romance comedies.

The first episode sets up the story, and it is certainly interesting. However, unfortunately from there, it goes downhill. From a great introduction, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka then becomes dully episodic, and most of episodes have little to do with with the actual story. The plot is really only addressed in the last 2 episodes, which, I have to admit, does do a decent job in wrapping everything up.The characters are unique, but their development throughout the anime is pretty bland.You can just expect how each character would act in any...given situation. Yuuhi is the obvious tsundere would would always deny her true feelings and make it obvious that she's doing it. She almost does this in every single situation... It's interesting to watch her in action the first few times, but afterward, something new is needed, but never comes around.Sound and art are decent. Nothing bad, but doesn't deliver anything amazing or new either.The comedy is decent, but good scenes that really makes you laugh out loud are rare and infrequent.Overall, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka had potential, but the anime in its entirety does not meet up to expectations it sets in the beginning.

And the worst ending I\'ve seen. From episode 1-9, it was decent. nothing really happened, and I was sure this anime wasn\'t going to be anything special. At episode 10 I changed my mind from: ""meh nothing special"" to: ""wow! this might actually be a good anime after all"". I thought that it might have a good ending after all, but turns out I was wrong. After watching episode 11, I was sure there was no way out of this mess. There was no way this could have...a good ending, or maybe a decent one. And I were right, I watched episode 12 found out that episode 3-12 doesn\'t even have to be there. Because the relationship between boy, sister and girl in episode 2 is same as the ending of episode 12. its hard to explain. But what I want to say is that if you haven\'t watched this anime yet, you can just skip episode 3-9. the story doesn\'t change.Even though it had  good soundtracks, famous voice actors and good character desing, it wasn\'t as enjoyable as it should have been. the story ruined everything lol.THANK YOU FOR READING THIS CRAPPY ""REVIEW"".oh and btw this isn\'t a review, its just me writing shit while sleeping. a good ending, or maybe a decent one.

I wanted it to be a bit more cliched cos if it was it would have been more fun to enjoy since you get those butterflies in the end when you see that the two main characters end up...together.The art was good, i gave it a 9.The sound was okay, i have no comment.

However, after watching this tripe named Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka, I realized that isn\'t always the case. Nothing can compare to the amount of disappointment I got after finishing this series. This anime, although clichéd in a lot aspects, I actually thought was pretty passable. Well, that was until that asspull ending so big I think I ripped my anus.*STORY: 4/10Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka or Akasaka for short, is an anime produced by TNK based off a visual novel with the same name by Feng. The story...starts off with our main protagonist Nagase, Junichi saving a girl from being harrassed by men while on his way to school. Junichi later found out the girl he saved is the rich new transfer student Katagiri, Yuuhi. Yuuhi, at first, had a good opinion of Junichi but that changed when Junichi, because of his chuunibyo delusions, kissed Yuuhi out of nowhere. Now branded as a pervert, Yuuhi hates Junichi\'s guts. Much more to Yuuhi\'s disappointment, she discovered Junichi is actually her fiancé she transferred in to check up on. Yuuhi now decides to live with Junichi, together with Junichi\'s little sister Minato, to see if he really is worthy of being her bride. Thus the start of your typical romance harem.The story is nothing special. Right of the bat we are bombarded with anime clichés like arranged marriage, the transfer student and the mandatory ""accidental"" kiss. It is your standard harem storyline complete with harem/ecchi tropes you have probably seen hundreds of times. However, if I have something I\'ve learned from watching anime for years is that not all clichés are bad so I stuck with it. While Akasaka uses a lot of trite jokes mostly in the form of fanservice and side plots I couldn\'t care less about, there\'s still some enjoyment to be had in this anime. There was a point where I actually wondered why the rating was so low when it\'s not really that bad. The progression of the story is very slow, but the cute budding romance between our main couple, Junichi and Yuuhi, is enough to keep me watching. I genuinely got feels from this anime but sadly, everything was short-lived as they start to fuck up everything that was good about this anime.~SPOILERS STARTS HERE~I was in a pretty good mood when Junichi and Yuuhi finally became a couple in episode10 and shared a steamy kiss (unaware of the impending disappointment waiting for me). What happened next was an obvious attempt by the creators to be ""unique"".Junichi started doubting his feelings for Yuuhi so he had a serious little chat with his best friend (at this point I\'m already filled with great trepidation) well you know what happened next. On the act of the imouto gods, Junichi realized he\'s actually in love with his little sister Minato. WHAT THE FLYING FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!! And what\'s worst, Yuuhi is ok with it! Junichi confessed to Minato later, and it seems their feelings were mutual. The anime ends with Minato entering the bathroom to give Junichi a nice incestuous back scrub and later, Yuuhi also joined the bath saying she wouldn\'t just give up so easily blah blah. Ending credits.My buddha, the only saving grace of the anime turned out to be a bag full of dog shit. Mind you, I\'m not a fan of incest but that\'s not actually the main reason why I\'m ranting so much about the ending. On the scale of 1 to Yosuga no sora, this anime is about a 7. Well it was hinted (but never confirmed) that Junichi and Minato aren\'t blood-related. You know, the usual pseudo-incest anime pulls off? The incest is part of the reason too but the main reason I am not very happy about that ending is because the ending basically rendered 10 episodes of developing Junichi and Yuuhi\'s relationship ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS. It felt like a everything was a fucking waste of time. Junichi and Minato hardly had any romantic interaction through-out the show and we just found out later that they actually liked each other, like what the fuck?To be honest, I like Minato more as a character (not really as a love interest though) because Yuuhi is an annoying tsundere, but this is not how you end an anime. It\'s obvious the creators were trying to be different here, which isn\'t bad, it\'s just this time they failed VERY MISERABLY.~END OF SPOILERS~*CHARACTERS: 5/10Well there\'s nothing really much to say about the characters because they are very one-dimensional; aren\'t unique or special in any way at all. We have the usual violent tsundere, the caring little sister and of course Akasaka wouldn\'t be considered a harem without other girls crushing on the main protagonist for reasons we don\'t know.The main protagonist Junichi, in my opinion, is probably the most likeable of the characters mainly because he\'s not your usual overly perverse romcom harem MC who blushes and have fatal nosebleeds on every sight of something titillating. MCs like him are more common in action harems and I must say I greatly prefer this type of MC. However, that is not nearly enough to make up for the lack of character development in almost all of the characters, and not to mention, the whole bunch of other unimportant characters added just for the sake of having more characters.*ART/ANIMATION: 6/10The first thing I\'ve notice was the character designs, more specifically the character\'s hairstyles that looked like it took them 10 cans of hairspray to shape it that way. They have some of the wildest hairstyles that I\'ve seen in anime that is not battleshounen. TNK doesn\'t really stand out when it comes to art quality, though their animation can be good sometimes. When you look at their other works, art and animation is average at best. Akasaka\'s art and animation quality is not that much different.*SOUND/MUSIC: 8/10When you have a cast of talented voice actors like Rie Kugimiya and Aya Hirano you can almost never go wrong with voice acting. And for Akasaka\'s opening and ending theme, well it\'s pretty okay but not really what I would consider memorable.*OVERALL/ENJOYMENT: 4/10Akasaka, while it had its good moments, was mediocre at best, but it just have to sink even lower by pulling off that stupid ending. Unless you have a thing for imoutos, you should just stay away from this anime and forget it even existed, because what awaits you is just great disappointment and possibly anal fissures. starts off with our main protagonist Nagase, Junichi saving a girl from being harrassed by men while on his way to school.

This is not one of your typical harem animes. Yes indeed the plot has been totally overused, but the real plot is what makes it different from  all the other animes I've seen.First of all let me say this:   This is not your typical comedy/harem anime like Love Hina or School Rumble. This to me is more drama/harem. There are funny moments  indeed,  but there is more emtional drama than comedy throughout the anime. The anime, to the average comic/harem lover will be kinda slow and with little or...no comedy. Reason being why many people gave it a very low score.This is what I like to call a Serious  Harem Anime since the characters feelings ( (Junichi, Minato Katagiri) are all genuine and real and not the lovey dovey type like Rosario + Vampire. This is what totally blew me away and kept me on toes throughout the ending.I really enjoyed this anime ^_^ 11/10 no comedy.

The voice actors were awesome!Character: I felt as though all the characters were very well developed!Enjoyment:...every part of it...I loved! The art was AWESOME! I didn\'t see the anime in high def, but the art was awesome. I\'m not a fan of \'fan-service\', but there were little bits of it...Minato was my favorite character but her breasts were HUGE!

The voice actors were awesome!Character: I felt as though all the characters were very well developed!Enjoyment:...every part of it...I loved!', ""This series is incredibly hard to interpret.Story: to start, the basic story is Junichi engaged to Yuuhi Katagiri, but Yuuhi refuses to acknowledge the engagement that her father has arranged and so she stays with Junichi before finalizing a decision...unfortunately, before moving in, she didn't have quite the pleasant experience meeting him...The first episode already was bland and it didn't really get interesting until we saw Junichi's sister, Minato, implicitly become Yuuhi's rival in Junichi's love.  That is where it got interesting...so there was a hint of incest relationship, which was a start for this series, but was eventually poorly executed.  Things are...often resolved too quickly in the series as if by magic.  Making each following episode very unappealing to look forward to as the show would continue to shift focus.  Eventually  Minato is chosen by Junichi but it was far too rushed with too many unexplained pieces of the plot in the final episode.  One after the other new things came out like Junichi as a subject, File X, etc...none of which was actually revealed earlier on in the series except in dull comedic scenarios.  All in all there was a story but it was poorly paced and executed.  4/10Art: Very noticeable poor animation quality, especially in the last episode where characters laughing looked like a bunch of bobble heads and possibly much more throughout the series that I don't remember or even want to remember.  The artwork was only mediocre.  Even worse in the last episode during the whole subconscious scenario and &quot;shadow of Junichi.&quot;  3/10Sound: One of the only redeeming points of this series was its seiyuu cast.  What more could you possibly ask for than Aya Hirano, Rie Tanaka, Rie Kugimiya, and many more of the like all in one show?  Music, as expected was nicely done as a result.  7/10Character: If anything, there was no character development...at most we only got a bit of Junichi's past in the final episode.  Everyone else essentially played as side characters.  There was one episode with Tsukasa getting some nice plot development, but other than her, even Minato and Yuuhi who were the two lead female protagonists didn't get much background, and I won't get started on Karen, Mitsuki, and Nagomi. 3/10Enjoyment: This was suppose to be one of my highly anticipated shows this fall after being postponed from the horrendous summer 2008.  However, it clearly became one of the worse in fall 2008 and if anything one of the worst series in anime history for school-life romance series. 3/10Overall: This series was not good at all.  It had an amazing seiyuu cast and that was really about it.  I don't understand how anything could fail so hard with such an amazing cast.  If your old enough or simply daring enough, go play the ero-game...it's much more worth your time.  I only hope now the OVA will live up to its promise of a different story, let alone a much more compelling one.  This is not worth anyone's time watching despite the cast.  In a sense this show is like bad mouthing the seiyuus behind the scenes.  It had potential of being a satisfactory series around episode 9 or 10, but conflicts were simply rushed to be resolved leaving nothing really interesting for the final episode to work with much without having to rush the series to finish on a conclusive note... 4/10 often resolved too quickly in the series as if by magic.

Directed by Keitarou Motonaga, notorious for directing other harem anime (School Days, Onii-chan no Koto) and Katanagatari (a big surprise) Akasaka proves that it is a product of many trite, anime/eroge cliches that were mixed in a blender of sorts with hints of fanservice added as some sort of seasoning. Ah yes, the eroge itself was produced by feng around 1 year before...the anime adaptation as well.Either way, I shall get on with the reviewing now. This is also my first review that isn\'t a joke so the probability of me making mistakes is pretty high.Story: 3/10The main plot (which gets shoved out of the way within only 2 episodes, wow) is the stereotypical ""girl who has a bonus of being rich but she tries to make sure people don\'t know that ends up living with an ordinary high schooler who also turns out to be her fiancee, hilarity ensues"" one that is quite common amongst anime and eroge. The little differences are that the main heroine, Yuuhi Katagiri, turns out to be a tsundere (plus the ""ojou"" role is relegated to Karen Ayanokouji, someone who is only an add on heroine for the PS2 adaptation) and the Rie Kugimiya type too. The protagonist, Junichi Nagase, also probably fell for her at the beginning and as the series goes on he does build up his relationship with Yuuhi but it ultimately goes to waste in the end, for reasons that are possibly obvious and are what kind of add to the notoriety of the Akasaka adaptation. (Oops, spoiler.)When I mentioned in brackets that the plot does get shoved out of the way within only 2 episodes, it really does. The first 2 focus on Yuuhi meeting Junichi and making herself out to be a tsundere (since Junichi impulsively steals her first kiss, oh Junichi look at what you\'ve done you indecisive harem protagonist) and Yuuhi getting to know Junichi\'s little sister, Minato. We learn about how Yuuhi is a sheltered rich girl in the second, but then we end up watching the cast\'s harem shenanigans afterwards until the last fewepisodes.Oh yes, the classmates also decide to constantly remind Yuuhi and Junichi of the first kiss, to their dismay, and the dismay of the viewer since it gets irritating after the first few times. Episodes 3-10 are ultimately filler, even though some of them are dedicated to other not noteworthy cast members like the two childhood friends of Junichi, the main ""ojou"" (I think i\'ll say rich girl from now), the mysterious character whose motives aren\'t touched upon throughout the series, the school idol and student council president who is a trickster, the teacher who is childish and male and possibly others who will be described in the characters section. You could say they\'re there to develop the relationship but that could\'ve been done without all these wasted minutes.Actually, there were some things that were pretty cool (Junichi\'s parents, Nagomi\'s behaviour) but they were executed poorly and should\'ve been relegated to a different series altogether. Here they were seen as unnecessary and plot holes that are never given any more thought.--Art: 5/10The animation in Akasaka wasn\'t the worst, but it wasn\'t the best either. The animators possibly slacked off while working on the figures, as their faces were consistently off model at times (except for the last episode) when they were moving around and what not. The backgrounds were your standard fare for anime, not being really special in particular (although compared to others I haven\'t watched much so I might not be right in this area). The character designs were pretty fancy, mostly with the hairdos. The faces are cute, with the boy\'s faces making themselves look like they could qualify as successful crossdressers. Even though they weren\'t bad, they weren\'t entirely unique (Yuuhi\'s and Mitsuki\'s hairdos are pretty similar and if it weren\'t for Mitsuki\'s hat and different face they could\'ve been mistakened for each other) the somewhat different faces and colours of the hairdos were the only ways you could differentiate the others. Watching Akasaka with the designs felt like watching someone playthrough a dating sim with animated scenes all around.--Sound: 5/10There\'s not much to say about the sound and music and whatnot, since the themes themselves were pretty forgettable and your standard J-pop fare. On the other hand, you can see that they used an all star seiyuu cast as replacements that would be used for the anime. With Rie Kugimiya (Yuuhi, of course), Aya Hirano (Minato), Wataru Hatano (Junichi), Akira Ishida (Fuyuhiko), Marina Inoue (Tsukasa)... anyone who wasn\'t a really minor character practically was voiced by a well-known seiyuu. (Aya is an exception as she was voiced by Kaori Fukuhara, and the Nagase mother since she was voiced by Atsuko Tanaka.) Sadly, their talent was put to waste and ended up being considered kind of annoying, especially Rie Kugimiya\'s tsundere spouting nonsense as Yuuhi. Some of the voices can get on the nerves of people, namely Minato\'s and Fuyuhiko\'s, maybe to mimic the original seiyuu? Who knows.--Character: 2/10Ah, the part where you could easily frown at how badly they were handled. The characters in Akasaka were walking cliches, only having maybe one or two traits to separate them from the norm. The anime does try to make them look important and not flat; actually, that only goes for Junichi, but they fail.I\'ll be describing each of them, well at least from what I gathered from watching the anime.Junichi Nagase: Stereotypical harem protagonist who is living with an often praised little sister! Has two childhood friends, Fuyuhiko and Tsukasa, who like to trouble him a lot! Just like the student council president, Mitsuki Shiina, who uses him as some sort of lap dog of sorts since he\'s free! He also comes with the added traits of being somewhat idiotic when it comes to handling a tsundere, being untidy, really childish and having a back story that mainly gets focused on it during the last 2 episodes. Junichi comes off as manly and the only sane man in the first episode but he is then shown as a harem protagonist with a swimsuit fetish afterwards.He is also snarky but that\'s because he gets treated like shit a lot by his friends. He goes through minor character development that maybe shouldn\'t qualify as character development. At the end he\'s revealed to have Chuuni syndrome (eternal manchild syndrome), something never mentioned anywhere else. It comes off as a weak excuse to add weak character development that you would only notice by him stating what happened. Indecisive as hell.Yuuhi Katagiri: Token tsundere heroine who gets the bonus of being voiced by Rie Kugimiya and is also short and flatchested compared to the others. Also a rich girl who gets engaged to Junichi but shows her tsun side when he unexpectedly steals her first kiss and ends up using his first kiss too. Compared to other tsunderes, Yuuhi isn\'t as likable. She isn\'t as bad as, say, Naru from Love Hina or Louise from Zero no Tsukaima but she comes off as an incredibly shallow one who blames Junichi for most things. She also can\'t cook when she isn\'t being supervised and requires master chef Minato to help her. She seems to be knowledgeable about flowers and types of tea and teacups due to her upbringing as a rich girl too.Minato Nagase: Disgustingly sweet little sister demi-heroine who is possibly related to Junichi. Practically perfect, since she\'s great at household chores and is used to living in the jungle, she gets praised a lot by the other characters. Minato could be considered a Mary Sue because of her really friendly nature and plus she gets a good amount of attention in the episodes from the writing staff and the characters. Minato seems to be a bit of a brocon, as she knows a lot of things about Junichi to an extent that can be considered stalker behaviour if it weren\'t for the fact that she\'s his sister. She\'s the perfect girl of the dating sim in a little sister persona, but we actually never get told whether she does well academically. She\'s also in the tennis club.Tsukasa Kiryuu: Childhood friend character who is one of the haremettes but you only get mild hints with a noticeable one in her spotlight episode, Tsukasa is a lively girl who is often seen with Fuyuhiko (as they apparently have the same personalities with some differences) who is in the Newspaper Club. Because she\'s in the newspaper club, this means that she\'s automatically a gossip. At times it is shown that she cares more about Junichi and the others, even moreso than Fuyuhiko. Apparently she wanted to be a seiyuu when she was younger because of a magical girl anime she watched with Junichi, and this is what her episode is all about.Fuyuhiko Nishino: ""Bromantic foil"" character who surprisingly doesn\'t show much interest in persuing the girls. Practically has Tsukasa\'s character traits except he\'s an otaku of sorts who has the ability to talk to Junichi when he\'s going through brain revelations. He\'s shown at the end to be a decisive character who helps Junichi go through character development, so he\'s possibly genre savvy without constantly pointing it out. Also the vice president of the student council, but that\'s only seen twice.Mitsuki Shiina: Student council president and school idol Amitie with an accent, Mitsuki is a trickster of sorts who isn\'t very good at keeping secrets (or is just a pest). Enjoys using Junichi as a lapdog and likes him but it\'s very easy to assume that she doesn\'t. There\'s not much to say about her, what a shame. Also a haremette.Nagomi Shiraishi: ~Mysterious~ girl who acts like a dandere. Hinted to be an alien since she talks to some sort of unknown entity who wanted her to observe Junichi or something. A poorly executed character who is there to fulfill the fantasies of those who think that Yuuhi\'s breasts are too big, and she\'s also got a sister called Yutori. Also a haremette.Karen Ayanokouji: Rich girl character who tries too hard when it comes to pleasing people. Gracefully hot blooded and (assuming these jokes were hers) can\'t tell jokes. Competitive with people who are well-liked or something, wasn\'t on the best terms with Yuuhi at the beginning but they eventually become sleepover buddies or something. Also a haremette.Mikoto Tachibana: Senpai character who hangs around Mitsuki. Plays tennis too? I dunno, she\'s fanservice space with little screen time. Also a haremette.Seijirou Sugishita: Playful teacher who\'s possibly gay for Junichi and gets into a only mentioned once rivalry with Fuyuhiko for the homo subtext with the protagonist space. He\'s a genderbent version of the unreliable teacher, and he also helps Junichi go through character development. He\'s poor.Aya Nijou: Secretary and Treasurer of the student council. Shown to be blunt and considerably normal amongst the standards in this series. Not a haremette!Nagase parents: Adventurous! Also, the mother is practically Fujiko Mine except nicer.So there you have it. Cliche, cliche and cliche.--Enjoyment: 4/10Yes, despite all of the flaws I pointed out needlessly in this review, I didn\'t really mind watching it. Sure it\'s bland and cliched, but there were not many really really horrible bits aside from the ending. Also, it averted some of the cliches that it used too (no hot spring peeking) so it wasn\'t entirely facepalm worthy? I don\'t really have much to say for this part, surprisingly enough. All the characters are unlikeable though.--Overall, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka is an anime that achieves nothing in trying to be spectacular within its genre and was practically made to be fapping material (or what I said at the beginning). Others might like it, but I can say that it didn\'t tickle my fancy. I\'m sure the original vn was hopefully better, and that the anime was just fucked up like most of eroge adaptations, so maybe this was just promotional material instead? The ending being like that so the angry people can just play the vn and experience the so-called true ending? Maybe. the anime adaptation as well.Either way, I shall get on with the reviewing now.

I think, how he was described in the story exactly what makes him bad. Its not that because he realized that he love his sister after all this while, but the fact that, he actually dont make move on that, never even consider that as an option, and apart from that, trolling over some women heart - kiss her - make her fall in love with him - and finally have some balls to dump her without even trying to make a proper discussion. ok im done- Minato, oh Minato, she just that beautiful imouto, cute, perfect, know how to do housework, smart, pure and popular. and oh, she gets the male lead without doing a shit, ok thats too harsh... *roll eyes* maybe a little shit, like cook curry rice for him, wash his clothes and stuff. zzzz u know, women stuffEnjoyment 5/10- I was kind enough to give this show 5 after all that unexpected end.- I did enjoy it firsthand.- The ending spoil my fun- I guess maybe its because the story kinda trick me into believing that nagase likes yuuhi ( i mean duh, like so obvious) but then in the end choosing his sister ( wtf)?- I never get harem like this.Overall 5/10- i pretty much spit it all out already.- the show will be good/fair/great if they pull it a little longer with some explanation on each character background and development.- The ending was too rush.-  To be honest, after watching half of all the episodes about how he's 'in love' with Yuuhi, and to end the other 2 last episodes of him depressed because he cant choose who he love the most, then finally go for his sister ( who apparently not his biological sister) .- Really, who are not going to piss of because of that?

At the beginning of the series, you end up forming high expectations of the Anime because it in the long run is different from the cliché, only to have these expectations dashed at the end of the Anime because the storyline just couldn't hold itself together. Because of this, it is going to be very hard to leave out spoilers in my review.The Anime starts off with the protagonist finding out that he has a fiance and the two of them living together. This particular plot device is...actually used in quite a few Anime, which makes it a cliché. While this cliché tends to come across poorly, what drew me into this particular storyline, was the fact that this seemed like a fresh side to the cliché that was actually for once fleshed out. I found myself rooting for Jun'ichi and Yuuhi to get together by the end.And that is exactly why the Anime is such a let down. Basically, “Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka” is based off one of those dating simulation games over in Japan that are so popular. Normally, when this kind of media is adapted to an Anime, the viewer will have a bunch of pairings to choose from to root for, because the feelings of a bunch of characters are actually obvious. This way, when a different pairing then what you were rooting for becomes canon at the end, you aren't disappointed.However, with this particular Anime, the viewer is hit good and hard through a good portion of the episodes with Jun'ichi and Yuuhi. There are rather mild hints at other possible pairings, but the truth in the matter is, they are so very, very mild it isn't funny. They feel more like hints that could be misinterpreted as having a very different meaning. So, when the pairing between Jun'ichi and Yuuhi doesn't occur at the end, it is just disappointing, not matter how much you like the beginning.The beautiful art work does make up for some of the plot failing, but the sound actually brings it down. Amongst the beautiful art work, I found myself wanting to slap my hands over my ears every time I heard Jun'ichi and Yuuhi speak. I know that their voice actors are popular and some people will fawn over any of their work, but I've heard both of them do better, or maybe the better word is, I've heard their voices in roles better suited towards them.I actually liked the characters at the beginning of the show, only to find myself frustrated with them later on. Sure, they were built on stereotypes, but the way they interacted was funny. So much so, I enjoyed the interactions. However, later on, these interactions fell apart and/or became boring. A lot of the sub characters were shoved aside for the main three and their importance diminished to filler.As for my enjoyment, I honestly did like the beginning of the show. However, I was not happy with the ending, despite the fact it didn't come out of nowhere. I didn't really think of this as a harem Anime, until the end either, and then because of the ending, it became clear that this is a poorly done one. I think it is worth watching though, even if it is just once. That said... I do have an important warning that includes spoilers, but it is important for those who don't like this kind of show.WARNING: The person Jun'ichi decides that he likes is his sister. actually used in quite a few Anime, which makes it a cliché.

Would I group this anime with that 1/4? Yes I would.Story: 6/10The story in the anime is not that original, as I\'ve seen it in lots of anime. Boy has a random encounter into a girl -> Girl transfers into that boy\'s school, not knowing that the boy was in the same school she was transferring in. -> turns out girl was boy\'s fiance -> sister gets angry. Something along those lines. The story lacked originality, and another added to that is, it was a bit boring to me....Why did I rate this a 6? Mainly because of the comedy. Though, I don\'t know how misunderstandings like boy falls onto girl and magically touches her breasts or sees her panties. I\'ve seen that shit too much now, please stop it. The romance side, there was some subtle Yaoi in there, for the girls of course, but yet I find myself laughing at it too and not being disgusted. The relationship that builds up between Junichi and Yuuhi is basically arguing and fighting but it can be very sweet sometimes. Oh yeah, I forgot, there\'s fan-service, and there\'s quite a lot.Art: 8/10The art was above average, considering it\'s from 2008.  I swear, they probably put all their time designing Minato because damn, she\'s very cute. The animation was average and the design on each character is simple, but I like that simplicity.Sound: 7/10The OP is very nice, fitting the theme of the anime, being happy (mostly) and so does the ED.

A type of person who has a princess aura. Very calm and is very good at chores. Also super cute. She also thinks about others before herself.Katagiri Yuuhi, the tsundere who surprisingly doesn\'t have a flat-chest. Can be annoying sometimes, but hey she\'s a tsundere. Compared to Minato, not that great at cooking.Enjoyment: 9/10I watched this anime awhile ago, and I re-watched it earlier.

The end female is unexpected , and gradually worked in.  (Personally this gave me enjoyment score of 10.  but i still have a write a fair review)-Great...character design on males and females.

You may notice some completely irrelevent things going on in this story that just makes you go ""wdf?"".Overall, this anime is solid for any romance/harem/comedy genre lovers.  If your just going around to look for a great anime, this is not for you.  This anime belongs to fans of the genre.IMO, if your this genre fan of romance/harem/comedy (well technically, the harem factor in this anime is minimal to non existant), this anime is a MUST WATCH for the genre fans.I\'ve been disappointed time and time again by predictable endings in dramas and romance comedies alike of the predictable ending.

A curious romance story, but the most surprising thing is the last episode. It was unbelievable. That's truth, I can't understand why the writes choose this way to end the anime.Anyway, I can't fault. The story was interesting, and feelings and relationships between characters were amezing. And the nude scenes... SO interesting :PIt's sad that there won't be a second season. It would be interesting see more episodes after the last episode event. In any case, I liked that anime. "", 'Things you should know about this series:a) The side antics and filler episodes, while humorous to a degree, feel exactly like what they are, side antics and filler. The story as a whole doesn’t suffer because of them, but you suffer through them mostly to get the tid bits of character progress they hide within them.b) The core story should be strong enough to keep you interested, but where I feel this series kicks it up a notch is within the last two to four episodes. The drama starts to build up, and the ending is refreshing in the way it breaks from the cliché...way slice of life harems usually end.There are little things here and there that make you wonder, and some of those questions never get fully answered, but even with what you end up with, it’s satisfying.Ultimately, I really liked this series. Right after I post this, I’m going to go see if there is a manga associated with it in an attempt to get maximum story exposure.I recommend it, even if the overall score is low… but ultimately… who am I, but some guy on the internet. Those are my two cents, take them or leave them, but don’t give them back to me… I don’t like pennies. way slice of life harems usually end.There are little things here and there that make you wonder, and some of those questions never get fully answered, but even with what you end up with, it’s satisfying.Ultimately, I really liked this series.

Although Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka gives a rather similar feel as Final Approach, nonetheless I find it very entertaining and think that it deserves 7/10.Story: Yes I have seen anime with similar story line but the story is still different and it caught my attention. This is especially so at the ending, which gave me quite a surprise. Being a romance comedy(more of comedy actually), it will definitely give you a laugh or two each episode. However, while the story slowly builds up to a...peak, it suddenly took a short dive midway: I felt that the ending was a little anti-climax. Furthermore, I did not really like the ending :)Art: The art might not be the best in this season [best art probably goes to Clannad ~After Story~?], but it is not horrible either. The use of bright colours definitely captures the audiences and makes up a little for the lack of detail.Sound: I like the opening song. It fits nicely to how the anime is like. The voice actors are great too!Character: I think they are quite nicely drawn. Furthermore, the main characters are all well developed. Also, the character voices are very natural. As expected of Kugimiya Rie and Hirano Aya. Oh, tsundere-lovers will fall in love with Yuuhi.Enjoyment: I was looking forward for each of the episodes to be released while it was still airing.

The only things they have in common are the character designs, as most of the show has been re-written to be more of a love-comedy than a more serious love story like in the game. This isn't a downside however, the show is still enjoyable and fun to watch. However, in the later parts where the show reaches the climax, the transition from comedy to serious isn't done very smoothly and leaves a lot to be desired.In other words, if you're just looking for a fun love comedy, then...you should watch the show. If you want a more serious and elaborate love story then you should play the game. I prefer the eroge myself, it's hard to beat out h-scenes. you should watch the show.

Don't get me wrong, I really liked the series. It was just a bit uninteresting compared to other Romance/Comedy Anime you could have seen. But the fact that it was a basic summary of all the elements of a Romance/Comedy Anime made it a nice heart warming show to remind why I love that genre.The story is very stereotypical, a young rich girl comes from her higher-up family to be-wed a city boy living with his caring sister. I haven't seen that in any other wife-based Anime (Sarcasm). Anyway, lovable characters pop...out left and right from the beginning and it becomes easy to tell who is important and who is semi important. The whole story revolves mostly around three main characters, although most of the side-characters each provide a little something to the plot in nearly every episode. One of the things I like about this Anime is that the ending is very dramatically built up which keeps you watching. I won't spoil the ending, but it gave me a good sense of satisfaction.This Anime was made in the late nineties and the art style is very borderline between its time period and the millennium. Mostly everything is detailed, but not to a remarkable point where it stands out: it's about a step above bland. Some of the hair styles left a lot to be admired, but other than that it had a nice soft feel to it.As far as the BGM and sound goes, there is nothing really to say. It's not bad, but it's not good. The intro and ending aren't something you'd add to an Mp3 player and listen to in your free time, but they didn't completely break your ear drums.One of the main things I like is that the characters are all very lovable. Simply put, there's two arguing lovers, an extremely caring sister, a poke-fun-at-you-and-make-funny-rumors-about-you best friend, a nosy reporter friend, and the list goes on. They are your stereotypical cast of Romance/Comedy characters, but they aren't very exciting. In addition, only do the three main characters really develop like I mentioned before.This is a very well rounded Anime that you could probably finish in one day and enjoy it. It won't pull your heart strings, but it will make you chuckle once in awhile. The one thing is that it's hard to really feel like you are in the characters shoes, which is a main concern in my definition of enjoying Anime. In any Anime, you want to take yourself away and imagine what it is like in the eyes of the characters. This one, sadly, keeps you in a glass box on the outside looking in.Overall, I say this Anime is good for the genre that it is, but nothing sticks out about it.

Today\'s title is very interesting in that it is pretty much a cliched stomp through the familiar grounds of romantic comedy and harem sameness, but it is charming enough on its own to warrant a look, I believe. This isn\'t top shelf stuff, but sometimes that\'s okay. Very serviceable, even if somewhat predictable at times. Let\'s see if we will let this one on the RTLR wall, or if we will have it dead!Story: 6As I said, the story isn\'t anything to write home about. The synopsis does a good job covering what is going on. The rich girl...is rescued from some thugs by a gentle, but powerful guy. Before she has time to thank him, he walks off with a wave, leaving her with nothing but the nickname the bullies said when seeing him, ""Genokiller"". She transfers to a new high school, and of course is in his class, and finds out that he\'s the one her father has arranged for her to marry as well! She decides the only way out of the situation is to prove this new stranger\'s unworthiness by living with him and his sister. This is the beginning of the crazy hijinks that carries this series.The main girl especially become enraged and entrenched against our main guy because he kisses her due to a misunderstanding, having \'ruined\' her first kiss. She is then determined that no man like him could ever be her husband. And we\'re off to the races with the establishment of a tsundere character.Throughout the show various friends hover around the two, egging on the feelings, some pushing for them to be together, a few pushing for them to be apart, and a member or two who are just plain right mysterious. As time goes by, more and more events happen, misunderstanding occur, and while the wall of separation seems to get higher, in truth both girl and guy are breaking down and slowly falling in love with each other.As I said, very typical in execution. We also are trotted out the rich girl who thinks of herself as a rival to the main girl (both families happen to be wealthy) and declares herself a \'love rival\' more on the grounds of saving face than of any actual interest in the main guy. The sister is so sweet sugar wouldn\'t melt in her mouth, constantly taking care of her big brother like he\'s completely helpless. Without her, our main guys really IS clueless, and that becomes a problem later. A few other girls round out the cheerleading squad, always pushing the couple together and generally sticking their nose into everything.This all happens around a very traditional slice of life setting. In a high school, of course. They go through that whole experience, the festivals, etc that we\'ve all seen. They do throw in a curve here and there, like where there\'s forbidden building on school grounds that features dungeon-like rooms. A teacher, the \'cool\' teacher ends up having to stay in the building for reasons, and accidentally falls into one of the dungeon rooms where there\'s no apparent way out. Of course main girl and guy end up in it too, though for a while they don\'t know the teacher is there, and they begin to work through some of their issues, tear down the tsundere wall a little bit before he pops out, plays the \'cool cat\' card, and the three are rescued by the other school mates.More events happen that slowly move our couple together, an interesting night on a cruise ship party, an interesting festival with a giant octopus and a less than quality built giant mech, and similar that helps break down the bonds and bring our inevitable love birds together. This is again nothing new, but it\'s done in a way that\'s got it\'s own spin on it, it\'s unique flair. One that is strong enough I never felt as wearied by watching as I have with some Slice of Life shows.Add to this the possibility of an alien running around in the middle of the whole group, and the fact that the main guy and little sister\'s parents are perpetually gone, as they are undercover spies and operatives for some unnamed secret organization. Instead of relaying that by a throwaway line here or there, we actually spend some time with Papa and Mama, and get to know a little about them. Well, considering how Mama is dressed, we get to know a little MORE about her! Also little sister mentions oftentimes of the places they\'ve lived, and the skills she\'s acquired, taught to her by her spy parents. For some time, the main guy has lived alone, before the spies decided to leave little sister behind as well, either for her safety (since they do things like blow up ships and all) or for the guy\'s well being (he\'s a slob).So we get a life with the two siblings relying on each other, until the main girl\'s father meets the spy, and decides his son should be the next leader of the family corporate group, which would make him quite rich. The two old men seal the deal, arranging the marriage. So that\'s when the main girl shows up, desperate to prove that the main guy just will not do for her.At first the romantic tension is provided by the main girl and her desire to make the main guy out as unacceptable no matter what. She\'s fully against the proposition of them marrying and finds him quite disgusting. As she lives with him, and experiences life as a normal kid, not just a rich one, she comes to grow in her feelings towards the main guy. As she finally admits her feelings and they share their first \'true\' kiss, a new problem surfaces.The main guy is romantically attracted to his sister. Yeah, eww, right? Not like we\'ve not seen incest before, and if you can keep rolling with it, I think it\'s worth continuing to view even in light of that. The sister also develops feelings for her brother, but doesn\'t want to be in the way of the main girl. She\'s not accepting of her feelings, honestly wanting what is best for him, but still a little melancholy in her heart. When main girl returns home to confront her father with her thoughts on the main guy, the sister does cuddle up to the brother, holding him in a romantic embrace, but nothing sexual, no kissing, just a moment where they hold each other.When main girl comes back the next day, she can tell something is off. After much effort she gets the sister to admit her feelings. The main guy also admits he can\'t live without his sister. The main girl, who is still in love with him, says its okay, it just means she has to live with them forever so they don\'t do anything bad. Basically it hit me like she was going to marry him at some point, so he has her to release his sexual energy on, instead of doing something immoral like having sex with sister. Sister seems to be good with this too. So the incest antagonism is basically dispelled before it becomes an \'eww gross\' feeling. We\'re NOT going anywhere near Yosuga no Sora or even Koi Kaze levels here. It was more an invention to give the main girl some competition in the back half of the series, when her primary resistance, the tsundere act, had crumpled away.So, like many of these shows, the harem doesn\'t break up, and the guy never makes a \'forced\' decision.The saving grace of it all is that it\'s pulled off with a great deal of humor, and in some unusual ways. This show puts its own spin on the overall genre. It ends up coming across as quite charming when doing so.Art: 7I think the show looked good. There\'s some interesting choices in female hairstyles. A couple of the girls, main girl included, have hair that comes down their heads, but spreads out to at least shoulder length by the time it hits their collar. So they kind of have a pyramid shaped head, from the back, including their hairstyle. Its kind of quirky looking, and I\'m probably not describing it very well, but it was interesting. The school president\'s hair seems the biggest, almost like it was all shooting almost horizontally out right above her ears or something. Not ponytails or pig ears, just natural \'flare\'. The colors are nice and interesting, nothing is garish, except when it\'s meant to be.The character appearances are all very well done, and each girl is easy to pick out when in a scene. I love the choice of tones and colors, it just really fits in my mind, I don\'t know if I can explain it more deeply than that. They just made good decisions on the overall look.Sound: 7The music is nice, I really liked the themes. I might play the opener as a general music file. The voice actors, (seiyuu I guess as it\'s subbed?) all sound very good for their parts. The sister, main girl and the \'rival\' rich girl are all very well cast. The guy works better than most guys in these hare/romcoms. There\'s another guy that between the voice given and some of his odd actions makes me think he might have a crush on the main guy too. Gives a bit of mystery to that character. Overall the entire cast was well done.The background music fit as well, the pumping tension when the spy parents were being shown during one of their missions, and light and airy when the lovey moments come around. The background music and sound effects enhanced the viewing enjoyment. Always a plus there.Character: The characters are one of the reasons I found this show charming and kept it from the 4 or 5 it would have clearly been otherwise. The continual harassment about the main guy\'s past, the so-called \'Geno Killer\' kept him from becoming completely bland, as every time he slows down and gets too mushy someone\'s there to make fun of how the \'Geno Killer\' is getting soft and what have you. Also makes me wish we had more information on the details of getting the nickname. A little mystery in a character\'s past is never a bad thing though. He is a bit bullheaded, a bit lazy, and a bit careless sometimes, but he really does do what he can for the people he loves, especially the main girl and his sister. He\'s still a bit of a bumbling oaf at times though.The main girl, arriving with her nose in the air, is a classic tsundere type, starts mean as hell, but as time goes on, she slowly warms to the main guy and finally finds herself in love with him. This is so cliche it hurts, but the way she pulls it off is very believable. She\'s not one that turns to utter putty after the wall comes down either, she retains her haughtiness in a lot of situations. She\'s still a tough one, even though she obviously loves the main guy very much.The little sister is interesting in that she admits to the main girl that she has romantic feelings for her brother. She\'s spent most of her life away from him, her often with her spy parents, with him, older and living alone in Japan. When they go come together, and she sees how badly he needs someone like her, she just slides right in, and the feelings blossom. She\'s a realist though, knowing she can\'t ever really have what she wants, and that she seems to be more concerned with making sure he\'s taken care of, over any concerns she might have in her heart. She\'s a caring and beautiful character really, even with the twinge of incest hinted at.There\'s a rich girl that takes the main girl as a bit of competition, as they are both from well off families, and she seems intent to show off the wonders of her name, probably to impress the main girl more than anyone else. Rat race kind of thing. The main girl isn\'t really impressed, but this girl gives huge amounts of humor and levity to the situation, firstly by declaring herself a romantic rival (she seems to have zero interest in the guy) and then by using her money and status in ways that always ends up in disaster. Say like people being chased by a huge man in an octopus suit that ends up catching the yacht on fire, things like that.The school president and a few of her friends rally around the little group of girls, cheering the main girl on, and offering advice and ribbing her and the sister about things, and are a good time to watch.There\'s even a mysterious girl that might possibly be an alien, (in the ship shown during the opening theme maybe?) and has the ability to appear anywhere at the blink of an eye. She also is in some odd sequences where some crazy stuff happens. For example, during the school festival, they end up making the main guy pilot a huge mech to protect the school from a huge giant octopus that this girl drives. Yeah, the octopus gets to be a running joke. I won\'t reveal what happens here, it\'s just funny but odd. Everything around the girl is odd, which is not something you see in most slice of life romcoms.And that\'s not even getting into the half dressed spy mom, the teacher who thinks he\'s the epitome of cool, or the mysterious group that seems to be watching the main guy. There\'s plenty to wonder about, and even more to laugh at.Enjoyment: 8I thought this was a fun little ditty of a show, familiar enough with all the romcom tropes to feel inviting, but with enough twisted and just odd things to make it fresh and worth watching. I liked how the characters presented themselves, how the relationships worked, how the sweet little sister sounded sweet and the arrogant (at first) main girl had her nose in the air before crumbling and admitting her feelings.Best Girl: Shiraishi Nagomi, the girl suspected as being an alien. She keeps one eye covered with her hair...or maybe she only has one eye! and she\'s often all over the place, in the spy parts working with some mysterious people. She\'s often reporting to some mysterious group about the movements of the two main leads, and even shows up to hang out with the girls like a regular school girl at times. Oooooh mysterious! And I love her for it!If slice of life isn\'t your thing, clearly pass. If you want something that might break the mold a little bit, check this one out. It\'s not top shelf, but it was fun enough in its own right. I wouldn\'t ask for my money back, that\'s for sure. I\'ll remember this one for a good while I think, though no new RTLR entries for the moment.Saved the biggest kicker (or most irrelevant info, depends on your view) for last. The show hints STRONGLY that the little sister is NOT blood kin to the main guy. That could have an influence on things, but I don\'t think no one ever finds out. Two thumbs slightly up, with a happy smile! is rescued from some thugs by a gentle, but powerful guy. Before she has time to thank him, he walks off with a wave, leaving her with nothing but the nickname the bullies said when seeing him, ""Genokiller"". She transfers to a new high school, and of course is in his class, and finds out that he\'s the one her father has arranged for her to marry as well! She decides the only way out of the situation is to prove this new stranger\'s unworthiness by living with him and his sister. This is the beginning of the crazy hijinks that carries this series.The main girl especially become enraged and entrenched against our main guy because he kisses her due to a misunderstanding, having \'ruined\' her first kiss. She is then determined that no man like him could ever be her husband.

Two thumbs slightly up, with a happy smile!', ""Well, this is officially my first review, so please bear with me.Story: 6/10I liked the way the story progresses for the most part, it was exciting to see what would happen next and how the relationships develop. You get to see how the main character is dealing with an uneasy situation at home all while all his friends seem to be prying in on his private life no matter how hard he tries to keep it to himself. Pretty standard slice of life stuff, just seeing how everyone interacts with each other on a daily basis. My only quarrel with this show is that it...stops after one season and the story is really inconclusive at the end. I'll try not to go into too much detail, but the MC is faced with a difficult choice in the end and even after he's made his choice it doesn't seem to have changed anything between the characters. That's the only reason I had to rate story at 6, just didn't get any feeling of resolve or satisfaction after I was finished watching.Art: 8/10I am not really picky about art, although it will have an effect if it is just awful. That being said, this has decent artwork and animation is nice and smooth, so I have no problems with it.Sound: 6/10Not really picky about sound either, but the problem with this is it seems to have a pretty big lack of any enhancing music. I don't have an opinion on OP or ED considering I never watch them, but there just seems to be a lack of music to enhance moods or situations during the anime.Character: 7/10I liked the characters, they all have their own personalities and are all equally zany throughout. Character progression itself was a little lacking as I was left only caring about the MC and one or two others, the rest just didn't have any impact on how I felt or how the story went on.Enjoyment: 9/10I did enjoy the show, it has plenty of laughs and an entertaining slice of life for every episode. I'm not sure yet if this is worthy of a rewatch, but I did enjoy this time through.Overall: 7/10This is a decent anime for those of you that like a little romance with some comedy dashed in there. If you're looking for harem though as the anime information suggests this show has, you'll probably be disappointed as this show has almost nothing at all harem related in it. Anyway, if you're looking for an entertaining show to add to your list, this is worth checking out. stops after one season and the story is really inconclusive at the end.

The characters seem like any other from a harem. You have the sometimes self-aware, but mostly dense main character, two love interests, one being the tsundere, and the other being the kind, caring one, followed by all the side characters that may or may not show romantic interests in the MC. Standard layout, so it should be fairly enjoyable, no? Not really. There are very few shows I have watched where I felt frustrated watching it, let alone having to force myself to continue through most of it. Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka was one such...show.From the get go, there are two characters with the silliest hair design I have ever seen. It was to the point that I would be agitated when I saw them just because of how ridiculous their hair was. Other than them, the characters all look rather nice. The voice acting for them was also rather enjoyable, but I am no expert in that area. The one thing I will say is that sometimes the main character's voice sounded rather stuffy.There are some episodes where the show really just shines, and was a blast to watch, where you're really invested, and others where you feel like you have to slosh through them just to get to more of the good ones. To be honest, the episodes between 2 and 10 are completely skippable, where random stuff happens but there's little to no character development. You could skip from 2 to 10 and, for the most part, understand what is going on in the show. You should watch them, they do add some important details, I'm just making the point that they're basically filler. Episodes 10 and above are the part of this show are the parts in romances everyone has been waiting for, the parts with the actual romance. By ep. 10 you, more or less, know how the show will end, but it's being able to experience it and watch how it unfolds that really grasps you. All of these episodes were fantastic, so much so, that I was talking to the characters and yelling obscenities when one thing or another happened.While I am not going to spoil who ends up with who, I will say that the ending was absolutely ruined when the character who was not chosen barges in when things are about to get good, and declares that she will be staying with them to keep an eye on them. What? Why? Why would the writers do that? The viewers do not get any pay off or reward after all of that. It's so bad that the girl who was not chosen, received more time than the one who was. How is that satisfying? It's not. The ending left an awful taste in my mouth, enough to get me to write this review, my first one. Overall it wasn't the worst show I have seen, but it had gotten my hopes up only to not deliver on a satisfying ending. show.From the get go, there are two characters with the silliest hair design I have ever seen.

By ep. 10 you, more or less, know how the show will end, but it's being able to experience it and watch how it unfolds that really grasps you. All of these episodes were fantastic, so much so, that I was talking to the characters and yelling obscenities when one thing or another happened.While I am not going to spoil who ends up with who, I will say that the ending was absolutely ruined when the character who was not chosen barges in when things are about to get good, and declares that she will be staying with them to keep an eye on them. What? Why? Why would the writers do that? The viewers do not get any pay off or reward after all of that. It's so bad that the girl who was not chosen, received more time than the one who was. How is that satisfying? It's not. The ending left an awful taste in my mouth, enough to get me to write this review, my first one. Overall it wasn't the worst show I have seen, but it had gotten my hopes up only to not deliver on a satisfying ending."", ""[Might Contain Spoilers]I've always been a fan of the 12 episode series thing, and I thought this one had a good story for such a short series, but like a lot of the 12 episode series I've watched, it didn't wrap it up as much as I was hoping...The story itself was good, rich girl comes to town to live with her fiance to get to know him better, runs into a group of gangsters, boy comes to her rescue, she falls in love with him... yada yada yada, unoriginal was what I thought at first, but then as soon as she fell in love...with him, it was hilarious to see how she immediately fell OUT of love with him when his hormones took over and kissed her in public. That's when her scary side kicked in and stuck with her the rest of the series, and to make it better, he's her fiance. I immediately knew I found a series I would like.As in any harem anime, there are plenty of things that would put anyone in an awkward position (bath houses, hot springs, tripping on top of a girl, etc.), and that's what I love about this anime, it's got all that. So it has a good story, AND plenty of those scenes.I liked the entire anime up until the point where incest kicked in. Sure, there have been some great animes with that kind of stuff in it, like Ouran High School Host Club (Hikaru and Kaoru), but I still can't picture dating a sibling. Cousins, sure, but Sister, no. All of this is when the story got complicated. I was able to understand it all, but it was a total love triangle, which always ends up with someone's heart being broken in the end...Overall, great show. Good story, interesting characters... all of it was great.

Guy lives with girls; one girl was set up to be his fiance;  which leads to many, many emotions. However, the grade is above average because they put a teeny twist on it. I try to write spoiler-free reviews and this one is no different. If you want to enjoy some love triangle romance without too much (hardly any) deep thinking/thought, this one does an above average job at it.Art: 8Very good. Not disappointing at all.Sound: 6Well, the girls sound like girls and the boys...sound like boys; the inanimate sounds sound like inanimate sounds. It\'s done in an ""okay"" manner, but excuse me for there being too many ""Mmm""s, ""oh""s, and ""uh""s.Character: 7Good. Would\'ve liked to have seen more character development in the majority of the girls, due to the fact that really 2.5 develop along with the plot. 2.5 because of a startling expression of love in one of the hero\'s friends near the end of the series, and it seems so rushed and brash, like the creators thought that it would be a great idea to have one more girl fight for his heart. However, ****SPOILER****it obviously doesn\'t pan-out in the end and, like I said above, seems rushed for no reason at all.I\'m really leaving out one important detail pertaining mainly to one character, but saying anything will ruin the story completely. I\'ll leave you with this: you would have to be completely ignorant of the fact if you don\'t know what I\'m talking about by the end of the series.Enjoyment: 6I had some fun watching it. But for a 12 episode-long series, it moved along at a snail\'s pace. Most likely because of a lack in story and this anime suffers because of it.Overall: 6In a 12 episode spread, the overall grade should be based on your enjoyment, the characters, and the story. The animation and sound act only as a nice little piece of garnish on top of a [would-be] steak dinner.Ah, I just can\'t write a totally comprehensive review without giving a pretty big ""something"" away. So, if you found this review satisfactory, and have decided to watch the show because of it (or others), stop reading, now because this is pretty big. Oh, before I get to that, there is one OVA after the series which I haven\'t watched, but expect plenty of fanservice or airtime with the girl he chose.****SPOILER****One of the love interests is his sister. But, the things is, we are told right at the end of the 12th episode by some dialogue between our hero\'s parents that Minato, his sister, probably isn\'t his sister.

I really didn't like the opening and ending songs weren't too enticing. Regarding the characters, besides the main protagonist and his friend there wasn't anything special. I enjoyed it a little but it kind of gets a bit annoying. I have to give my respects out to...the ending because this is one of the few animes where the main character actually makes a choice in near the end. Overall I would say this anime was not as entertaining as i thought it would be. the ending because this is one of the few animes where the main character actually makes a choice in near the end.

Really show your really going to do this why?Because you had something good going here and you decide to throw it off a cliff.It doesn't completely bother me that much because at the end of the day the story could only go so far being what it is.But they could have done something a little different.Which would have been nice.Characters, 5/10The main character is pretty much a generic protagonist with the only thing interesting about him was being this geno killer thing.The other characters were pretty one note nothing really special about them.There basic cardboard cutouts pretty much.Art, 5/10The animtion for the most part was all right nothing good nor bad about it.The art style is a bit bright and colorful for my taste.the character designs also looked alright.It's just usual shit.Sound, 6/10It had an ok op. The ost was pretty average by rom-con standards.Because nothing really took my interest.Enjoyment, 5/10When it comes to enjoyment about this show I really don't have much to say. It was pretty generic.But one thing I did enjoy about it is that it had some promise and it had some good parts about it.Overall, 5/10So overall akaneiro ni somaru saka is pretty much a standard fare when it comes to rom-com thing.

Why Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka? I started watch it three months ago, but i stopped, cuz it really annoyed me. Now i have tried again and i was thinking to myself "" why i actually dropped this?"" Now i remember. It\'s not like i don\'t like harem and simple plot. I like it = anime must enjoy. But srsly... don\'t waste your time on it. I watched it and i still don\'t know where the story is? Of course it has a lot of funny moments, but it\'s a little.. caricatural sense of humour.The art? I...think is fine. Hmmm it\'s the best side of all anime. Sound? Ekhem i don\'t even heard beside opening (which is horrible).---So if you don\'t like sister-brother love, harem, no character - don\'t watch it !I really tortured myself T_T think is fine.

It is a form of Harem that has a bit more refined in that the girls are not all immediately over the guy with crazy actions of love, but they are more a group of friends that show interest and respect each other for the most part vibe. Depending on whether it is the game, Manga or Anime they have different endings. Some vary between the sister being blood-related and some not so that changes endings around. There is a bit of a Yosuga no Sora...vibe in the solitude they have which presses actions in the anime. At one point it is a comedy romance and suddenly it goes super serious with the odd things in the background happening too. Main point that starts the show is mistaking a girl’s intent and kissing her which goes for an expected scene.ArtThe art is very good for the show. Must remember it is 2008 and for 2008 it is a very good. Some odd times with faces being a bit out of context with odd angles shown but ultimately it is good. Nice to see how wacky hair styles and extremely long hair a staple for has been so long.SoundThe OP is a nice tune to go with. The ED changes after ALMOST every episode with some sharing them. They are satisfying to listen too and the other sounds in some cases are spectacular. In its own way it is great but also at times slightly odd but then so is the whole show.CharacterKatagiri, Yuuhi is an interesting rich girl pretending to be normal. She is naive in many ways of the world due to a sheltered upbringing. She is a nice and kind girl with Tsundere traits for a fair amount of the entire show.Nagase, Minato is the younger sister (Adopted depending on the scenario) she is a perfect housewife, affectionate and overall a great person. She does get jealous and bottles things up which creates its own friction. Much to the fault however of the parents who fail to tell if she is adopted or not and just let it play out.Nagase, Junichi is the MC. He is somewhat selfish and deviant to which he is somewhat annoying being closed off in his selfish world. His personality is the cause for the majority of issues during the show. He does recognise a girl’s feelings but fails to act properly. He has a Chuunibyou personality which causes him to have delusional behaviour.The other Harem girls are all generic in filling tropes. The childhood friend, rich girl, Idol etc.The most interesting girl away from the main bunch is Shiraishi, Nagomi who is somewhat unusual in her actions, she also appears out of nowhere and is likened to be an alien. This is recognised by Shiina, Mitsuki.EnjoymentThe show is enjoyable throughout from start to finish. It takes a light romance vibe with comedy up until episode 10 where it suddenly gets deep in the relationship aspect so unexpectedly so.

The side story about the protagonist\'s parents has no sense, it\'s an attempt to make deeper the plot, but is just filler.However, for an harem anime, it\'s ok.Art (6/10):This anime was released in 2008, the art is fine for that time....Sound (6/10):The OST is also ok for that time, it\'s not a masterpiece but it\'s fine.Character (4/10):My personal disappointment about this series is the character development, especially the Yuuhi Katagiri\'s development. In the first episodes, Yuuhi was ok. She was a good character, nice look and personality, out of stereotypes (not hime and not tsundere). But, after ""you know what moment"", she turned into a complete stereotyped tsundere. In the last episodes, she turned back to that way. But, in my opinion that doesn\'t solve my disappointment.About the other characters, they\'re the common stereotypes in this kind of animes:Junichi, the distracted protagonist who pretends not to know anything about what is happening around him. His best friend Nishino, who helps him with advices.

The protagonist\'s sister isn\'t ""Imouto"" stereotyped at all, but she\'s the typical female character who appear in old animes, she\'s like Sonozaki Mion from Higurashi no naku koro ni.

They do add a couple token love interests, but they don\'t *actually* add them, if that makes sense. If you\'re a...Harem disciple, you won\'t be getting 4-5 girls courting some lucky bastard. You\'re getting two girls in love with the same guy, which is often (mis)labeled as ""Harem"". Not really Echii either.That isn\'t to say it was bad, I certainly liked it, especially near the end. If you want to hear how or why it succeeds (or at least doesn\'t fail) as a romance anime, I\'m sure some other reviewer is going to do a better job then I could.In short, I\'m glad I watched it, but it\'s not a Harem.

Truman in 1945 after hearing Japan had released Akaneiro.Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka, or Akane as it shall hence be known, is everything that is wrong with anime. A bland and boring cast and plot, combined with a stupid ending makes for a show that will either make you wish you had yor time back, or that you could remove the rest of your remaining time and end it all. So let\'s dive into this dumpsterfire of a show.Story- 3Spoilers inbound.So our main character Junichi meets this...rich young mistress called Yuuhi who due to WaCkY cIrCuMsTaNcEs ends up living with him after he creates a misunderstand with her ruining their relations. After another 9 episodes of filler which contain nothing either related to the plot or anything interesting, Yuuhi, after beating Junichi up every episode, realises she likes him too. I would like to point out that this show has focussed entirely around these two characters, with everybody else being resigned to small support roles who don\'t have much screentime...Which is why it blindsided me and probably everybody, when Junichi decides to get with his sister, TitsMcOniisan face instead. Not only is this a bizzare incest ending, but Breastylechest had little to no time spent in this show at all, and basically null and voids any point of Yuuhi having been in the show at all. In effect we could have had a 1 episode show where a character realises he likes his sister. I\'m not necessarily opposed to the incest route (although it is bizzare), if handled correctly, like say Oreimo does, but the bit that really gets me is how the MC does a 180 on who he has feelings for and just says ""Yeah. I like my sister now"", and his sister who had no screen time ends up as the main heroine in the final episode. I\'m sure I\'d feel even more annoyed if I was actually invested in Yuuhi at all and she wasn\'t just a 2d cut and paste rich girl who beat the MC and wowed herself at the fact that there was a real world every episode.Art- 6The art\'s alright. It\'s not the best. It looks a bit dated and a bit eh, but there\'s nothing wrong with it.Sound- 6I genuinely can\'t remember much about the soundtrack, but that might be partly because I watched this a long while ago. After going back and listening to some of it it doesn\'t seem offensive, but once again is very eh.Character- 3Any development had is forced and happens unexpectedly. The show seems to think massive arbitrary changes in the character\'s mindset is a personality change. The show could\'ve worked well if they\'d maybe been able to have a few more episodes. And then actually spent those, along with the 12 they already had, developing a good relationship between the two main characters + sister semen demon, instead of just have some bland scenario the rich girl gets into every week because look she\'s rich!Enjoyment- 2Why is this a thing? I don\'t mind cheap slice of life that goes nowhere, much like I don\'t mind jokes that ramble on and lack a punchline. But those jokes need a good set up to be worthwhile. The point of that type of joke is the journey and not the destination, and this anime had neither journey not destination. It essentially was chucked in a jungle and handed a map with nothing on it an told to explore for 30 days, whereupon it goes in a big circle before ending up back where it started having lost the map and settling down to die.Overall- 3This dumpster fire should be avoided unless you like wasting your time/want to torture some poor prisoner of war.Do I recommend Akane?Only for those who enjoy self harm. rich young mistress called Yuuhi who due to WaCkY cIrCuMsTaNcEs ends up living with him after he creates a misunderstand with her ruining their relations.

The plot was fairly adequate with many twists and turns. However, after the first episode I feel that the plot went dry as it progressed.However, the last 3 episodes were so infuriating I could have pulled my own hair out. I honestly hated the ending and that is what made me feel that I wouldn't watch the anime again. "", 'Nagase Junichi, a gentle student, however, is reputed to be a killer, he is the victim of rumors spread by his friends, but fate preached a play to him: a beautiful girl was in danger, Nagase saved her from the men who were on top of her, and she felt a special feeling for him at that hour. Over time, their relationship turns into a typical love triangle whose storyline is very different from the manga.In short: Anime medium, main characters immobile, secondary almost null throughout the plot. The story has remained firm in the proposal until the end, which saves this anime. ', 'This anime was just another short anime about a lucky ass guy running around with cute chicks that all like him, with him getting beat to crap all the time for thinking anything perverted the creators somehow though them knocking him up all the time is comical not at all.. good drawing though i cant do it. ', 'Before I start this review, from this point forward, I will be calling this anime ""Akane"" cause I don\'t want to write the full name at all.  Nonetheless, let\'s get going!Story: The story of Akane involves a faithful meeting between our main protagonist Junichi, and a cute girl by his words, named Yuuhi.  Saving her from 2 guys who were possibly going to do some bad things to her, Junichi saves Yuuhi and that faithful encounter sparks them to know who the other person is.  On another faithful encounter, the 2 meet each other again, and deciding that he should ""take the...chance"", Junichi shoots himself forward and gives Yuuhi her first kiss. (God, I sound like I\'m writing a sappy-ass fanfiction.) But, all does not go well in the world of Akane as Yuuhi reveals her true nature as a tsundere via telling him to die, and a punch to the face.  (This case is more tsun- then -dere.)  And even bigger faithful meeting happens later that night as they both find out that they are fiances to each other, via arranged marriage by families.  Though this premise sounds hilarious and interesting as hell, looks can be deceiving.  Hell, look at Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  The story itself basically builds the audience up, then craps on them over and over and over and over again, till a really strange and stupid ending comes up and basically destroys the whole point of this anime ever needing to exist in the first place.  The anime also uses a full scenes in random parts of the anime as really dumb side stories on Junichi\'s parents that has really no significance in the story whatsoever.Characters: (I will be only doing the main 3 characters.) First is Junichi.  As a person who has had Chuunibyou in the past, Junichi is currently a bright and happy person who lives with his sister while their parents are out doing god knows what.  He completely relies on his sister for everything, as he is not really able to take care of himself too much.  Junichi follows the typical harem king where he is completely dense and indecisive, thus creating problems to himself that lonely guys everywhere would consider a frikin\' luxury.  Next is Yuuhi.  Known as ""Hime"" to her friends, Yuuhi is a daughter of the Katagiri family, a well known family that owns a crap ton of companies.  In the series, she is shown to be a tsundere and could really care less about Junichi, really.  With a child-like personality, she becomes extremely fascinated by everyday things and has a habit of pushing random buttons.  Finally, we have Minato.  As Junichi\'s younger sister, Minato takes care of her brother on practically everything and has an incredibly close bond to him, to the point of having a brother complex.  Kind and mature, Minato acts as a motherly figure towards her brother.  Other characters in this really have no other purpose then to drive the plot along.  They have one trait only and exploit that to the point of being annoying.Animation and sound: The animation for this is actually pretty decent.  The character design is well done and deserves praise with its fluidity.  The voices in this are pretty decent as well, with everyone\'s favorite tsundere voice actress, Rie, and Aya Hirano as the voice of Minato.  (I seriously cannot believe that Haruhi Suzumiya and Minato are voice by the same person.)  The opening songs and endings however sound-wise, are very generic and boring, and I suggest to skip it.Personal enjoyment: Believe it or not, I have a harem spectrum.  It ranges from really good harems (i.e. Clannad, Kanon 2006), to really, really bad harems (i.e. HSOTD, School days, demon king Daimao).  This anime is smack dab in the middle, maybe edging towards the bad side.  While this anime has several ups, it has many downs and so many unnecessary plot points that I can say with an honest voice, are random and stupid.  Above all, the ending, is just, no.  The ending can bring any anime down a lot due to its unsatisfactory conclusion. If you like crappy love stories, go ahead.

The anime has the love & romance scenes. After watching the whole anime in my opinion it does kinda border the ecchi/hentaish catagory. There are several funny scenes - love scenes and some heart breaking scenes. After watching the anime I felt it was knid of similar to the anime Tora Dora. Not only because the same voice was used for both female leading characters in both the animes but also the story was knid of similar to. If you like this anime then i recommend you watch Tora Dora.

It's either this or Yosuga No Sora, but at least that had a plot that somewhat made sense. There's so much bullshit going on yet hardly any of it ever gets explained.The main issue I have with this show is that I feel like it's constantly hinting at some big plot twist or revelation that completely changes the plot, but that moment just never really comes. So the main guy's father is like some secret agent guy who saved this rich guy who then tried to force his daughter to marry the main guy. Apart...from one scene where they don't even really talk to each other you don't even see the two fathers together. When did they even get a chance to talk about this bullshit? The secret agent stuff is only there to give a reason for Yuuhi to live with the main guy.Then there's the alien shit. Why are aliens in this story? I have no idea, their motivations aren't explained and they're only outed as aliens while the credits roll on the last episode. If you've got aliens in your story then what's the point of basically hiding that they're aliens until the story is over? I feel like I'm watching a spinoff of a more interesting anime.In my opinion, the best parts of this anime are when the characters are just interacting with each other. No random secret agent bullshit, no hints of supernatural beings, no random mechs that fall apart as soon as they're revealed. The anime tricking you into thinking some major plot twist is going to happen takes away from the drama between the characters in my opinion. What even is the point of the scenes in the last two episodes where the main guy meets his father again, all it does is take him away from the other characters. Same with when he goes to pilot the mech in an underground lab IN A SCHOOL, or when he falls down a trap door because of Nagomi for reasons I still don't understand. All this does is exclude him from the rest of the characters for a while, without rewarding you with any meaningful reason for all the build up.One more thing, I get that this was hinted at throughout earlier points of the show, but when you've got a show with so much bullshit going on why would you make the dramatic climax of this show the incest between the main character and his sister? And why does every other character encourage this? You've got secret agents and aliens who don't contribute much to the plot but you make sure the incest story line is wrapped up and explained? Explain why the school is wasting their budget on a lab to create mechs that don't work!The cruise episode was probably the best one as the plot actually made sense, even if it was stupid. If there wasn't so much unexplained random bullshit then this show wouldn't have much to talk about so I'll give it that.

Its compete in almost every way. Great character chemistry and seiyuu Amazing amount of detail (down to the nipple, har). All crammed in a 12 episode package. What is not to like? If you don't like harem comedy this will obviously become fodder for low scoring. Especially for the fools who try to find seriousness in comedy...

Its shallow storyline, with decent slice-of-life elements, is coupled with a false harem theme that is nowhere to be found. Akaneiro ni Somaru Saka is deceitful in its attempts to be profound, with twists and messages that would only be impressive to high school boys.The show follows a trend common in shonen/non-shoujo romance shows of the 2000s, in which an unassuming love interest is introduced with little screen time, while the male protagonist develops chemistry and dynamics with another character. Only to be revealed at the end that his feelings for the latter were superficial, and...that he has been in love with the former the whole time.Ten whole episodes of this anime focus on Jun\'s relationship with Yuuhi, their development, how they come to terms with their differences, and how they build their chemistry. Until the final cour, when the show pulls a ""sike!"" and reveals that he actually likes his sister.I saw this happen in True Tears, and I hated that anime for it too. There is nothing profound about writing false romances, and adolescence getting the better of young people. Jun\'s confession to Yuuhi and his subsequent realization of his feelings for his sister are explained by his impulsiveness. He did not want to confront his love for his sister, and preferred to find solace in the excuses he made to hide it. Yuuhi was an outlet, and she was understandably angry about it. In reality, they should have either done away with this dynamic entirely, or doubled down and focused on his past developments with his sister to provide viewers with some context.This writing trope may seem cool and deep to some, but it is not. It is weak, overused, and frankly a spit in the viewer\'s face. If you wanted to run something like this by the audience, you should have given sufficient developments or flashbacks or anything to create credibility between Jun and his sister\'s relationship.

It\'s average at best, however I would recommend you pick up something else and give this one a wide berth.', ""I watched Akane Iro Ni Somaru Saka with high hopes, but sadly, it was a disappointment. The anime suffers from a painfully slow pace that makes watching paint dry seem like a thrilling activity. The story moves at a snail's pace, leaving viewers in a perpetual state of boredom. What's worse is the complete lack of resolution between Yuuhi and Minato. The narrative builds up their relationship, hinting at a promising connection, only to toss it aside carelessly. Instead of focusing on the main characters, the story veers off track, leaving the audience frustrated and unsatisfied.The potential for a meaningful and engaging plot is squandered,...opting for pointless detours and neglecting to tie up loose ends. It's a disservice to the audience and a waste of time for anyone seeking a coherent and fulfilling storyline. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this anime unless you enjoy being left hanging without any resolution in sight. opting for pointless detours and neglecting to tie up loose ends.

Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this anime unless you enjoy being left hanging without any resolution in sight."", 'Not exactly, but it\'s not much better than that series. Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka is yet another visual novel anime in a sea of recent visual novel anime that have all become the rage in Japan as of late. But how does it fare against most others of its type? Not very well, honestly. Despite cute character designs, a decent cast of actors and actresses, and a few humorous bits here and there, most of the series spends 12 episodes saying things it could have said in half that.Part of this is responsible by a single character: Yuuhi. If tsundere was an actual part...of the English dictionary, you would probably find a picture of her there (along with nearly every other role done by her actress, Rie Kugimiya). Frankly, I\'m sick of romance series plagued with these kinds of heroines, as these characters come off less as girls who are shy around their love interest but act mean or violent as a way of hiding their true feelings than robots that have switches on the back of their heads that allow them to change emotions at will. One episode she\'s being shy, flustered, and helpful, the next she\'s being a grade-A bitch.Not like Junichi is much better. He\'s surprisingly careless when it comes to those around him (especially to his sister), and comes off less as a teasing but well-meaning guy like Yuichi from Koyoto Animation\'s Kanon and more like an ass who only thinks of himself, only having a venerable change of heart when the show needs him to open up to Minato and Yuuhi. Oh, and let\'s not get into how he lusts over his sister a couple of times in the series, even fighting his inner demon at one point to resist the urge! As for Minato herself, she\'s domestic to a tee. It\'s less cute than it is disturbing, and Aya Hirano doesn\'t sound all that interested in her character as she reads from the script (can\'t say I blame her). So already Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka fails to tell a decent romance story by having a couple with no chesmisty or any reason for them to get together other than the writers making them do so.As a comedy, it\'s not much better. Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka attempts to be funny by having Nagomi, a weird pink-haired girl, randomly pop up in places and jot down data concerning Junichi and Yuuhi\'s relationship. While a fairly amusing character, she is underutilized and doesn\'t really do much until the final episodes. The rest of the ""comedy"" revolves around the same tired jokes you\'ve seen in stuff like Love Hina and Girls Bravo. Like the boy walking in on the girl while she\'s naked, or the lights go off and the guy falls on top of the girl and touches her breast, or the girl getting embarrassed by something and slapping the guy in the face. (Stuff the Japanese consider to be ""comedy gold"".) The only genuinely funny moment I found in the entire series was when Minato told Yuuhi about her older brother\'s porno collection, keeping a straight face through out, even when she reveals to her his second stash of porn. It doesn\'t sound funny when you read it, but trust me: that one scene is funnier than 90% of the series hands down. I rarely laugh out loud when I watch anime, but I did then.Okay, so the humor is (with the exception of the above scene) stale and not all that funny. But hey, this is a visual novel anime adaption! Surely there are other girls that you can attach yourself to and like, right?Again, not really. There are other girls in this series, but since they all think Junichi and Yuuhi should be together, it takes a lot of the tension that could have build up between them. Again, this wouldn\'t bother me so much if Yuuhi was a like able character, but she isn\'t, especially when Junichi\'s childhood friend, the snoopy Tsukasa (voiced playfully by Marina Inoue) is a much nicer girl overall and (in my opinion) would make a far better choice as a girlfriend for him. The rest of the female cast isn\'t very interesting. There\'s Karen, the rich, pampered girl, Mitsuki the cutesy student body president, and various other supporting girls. The show mainly revolves around Junichi, Yuuhi, and Minato, and they never let you forget it.Eventually Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka gets serious and stops playing with kiddie gloves when it comes to Junichi and Yuuhi\'s relationship, but not until the final two episodes. The writers waste whole episodes on stupid filler (like the obligatory school festival and the obligatory ""haunted"" house) instead of utilizing the time they had to flesh out the characters more (main and supporting alike). You know who I found myself liking the most in the series? Junichi\'s amusing parents, who are explorers and travelers by nature, infrequently arriving in helicopters to talk to their son about what\'s going in his life. They\'re cool, calm, and collective (unlike the rest of the series\' cast), which is part of the reason I attached to them pretty quickly. Every time they came and left I felt a little annoyed, because I knew that I would be going back to the Accidentally Careless Boy Lives With His Annoying Fiance and Overly Domestic Sister Show soon after. of the English dictionary, you would probably find a picture of her there (along with nearly every other role done by her actress, Rie Kugimiya).

Although my main problem is the ending so I'll probably mention it once. So *spoilers* you've been warned.Story: 7/10The story is about our stock character protaginist (for those who don't know it's means a character usually the main one who has no defining qualities) saving a girl from being mugged. Afterwords he misinterpretes said relationship as one in romantic nature which she doesn't like, causing her to go (adorable) tsundere. Later they find out their parents are actually set up an arranged marriage between them. Me being a lover of cheesy romcoms...with unique (or not so unique. I think I've seen a couple other anime with the same arranged marriage things though for non-comedy this is probably the best.) twists I thought the story was pretty interesting. Though since it was based off a visual novels and only like 12 episodes it did have faults. Mainly basic harem problems.Art:7/10It was basic modern anime. Meaning it had nice color, and well made backgrounds. So yeah..Sound:5/10I didn't actually pay attention...Character:6/10The character's were actually pretty well done. Our main character despite being a stock character had a interesting back story. His little sister was unique, and our main heroine was really cute. Of course their other character's like the best friend guy which was good because instead of being the pervert who does pervy things, he's basically the devil tempting our protaginist. I thought it was fun.Overall:6/10Despite everything else having decent scores. I had one major problem with this show being the ending. *Spoiler* I have this whole harem double standard thingy where I hate any harem where the main character doesn't choose my favorite girl. (Like this and Hoshizora) This developed the main girl a lot just to have his sister picked! His sister! Oh wait, they're actually not related by blood! How convientent! Too bad he didn't know, and he still was okay... Not that I have anything against you incest lovers this is soley for my hatred of animes that don't let my favorite girl get picked.So if you want to cry in bed for about a couple weeks (it's Sakurasou all over again! I liked Nanami) then yeah! If you want to watch a romantic comedy until episode 11, or 12 then pulled out that last couple chapters of the manga even better! with unique (or not so unique.

The anime looked very good and the sound was also pretty good too, overall I really enjoyed watching the anime, but you should ask yourself whether you like the genre or not, because if you dislike these kind of anime, you are going to dislike Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka. I would recommend watching it if you are into these kind of anime. ', 'First, let me say this; this anime was not a ""harem"". A harem needs to have a minimum of 3 girls being love interests to the protagonist through out the series. And while a few of the girls can be considered ""implied"" to like the Main Hero, it\'s not really set in stone and as such, this is not a ""harem"" anime. It is based off of a harem game, but with only 2 love interests, you can\'t call this a harem. (Karen did call herself Yūhi\'s love rival, but that was barely in the last episodes, and it was more gag effect, she wasn\'t...really a love interest; even if the girl has no chance, she needs to be a love interest and it has to be a part of the story, not just randomly thrown in there)Now besides that point, this was a good story though I would say that you should avoid this anime if you don\'t like incest, stay away from this (there are a few things that could point to it not being incest, but those might also be something else), so be careful.It\'s funny, it\'s sweet and the art is pretty well done. It\'ll give you a good laugh and it\'s nice. A great anime that is fun and lovable. You\'ll really love this anime and will wish for more, so be warned and enjoy XD!!! really a love interest; even if the girl has no chance, she needs to be a love interest and it has to be a part of the story, not just randomly thrown in there)Now besides that point, this was a good story though I would say that you should avoid this anime if you don\'t like incest, stay away from this (there are a few things that could point to it not being incest, but those might also be something else), so be careful.It\'s funny, it\'s sweet and the art is pretty well done.

I don't let your kids watch it if you want to keep them away from such ideas. "", ""I have sort of a mixed opinion on this anime. I mean I've never really liked Harems, I've always liked Reverse Harems so this was a first for me. I first watched this because the quality of the Art was outstanding. I wish the story would have moved faster though, and I was pretty upset with the ending. But all in all it was a pretty feel-good anime that gave you a lot of entertainment. "", ""Honestly, I went into this anime with some pretty high hopes, but in the end, I was left feeling pretty let down. Maybe I was a bit too generous with the score I ended up giving it, but hey, that's just me.The storyline mostly centers around the usual school life stuff, but with a few quirky twists thrown in. Things seem to be going smoothly for the male lead, who's engaged to a girl, until the final episode comes along and totally drops the ball. It felt incredibly unsatisfying, and I think that's a big part of why I wound up disappointed with the whole...thing. It started out strong, building up to something intriguing, but then it all fell apart, leaving us right back where we started with the same old tired drama.The animation was okay, nothing to write home about.

Each character had their own distinct personality and felt like a real person, but unfortunately, the storyline just didn't live up to their potential.Even though the source material might be pretty decent, the anime just didn't do it justice.

This is a spin-off of the Western cartoon Beast Wars: Transformers we probably all loved and aired around the time (Spring 1998) between Beast Wars and Beast Wars Transmetals aired in Japan.*May contain minor spoilers - incase you aren't familiar with Transformers in...general*The planet Gaia, better known as what we can compair to our own very Earth is home to a powerful but unstable energy source known as Angolmois energy (you can pretty much compair it with lava in my opinion), which has come to attention of the Destrons (or Predacons if you’d prefer, you know the descendants of the Decepticons) being led by Galvatron (not to be confused with the G1 one). The Cybertrons (Maximals) are being led by Lio Convoy, whose mission is to stop Galvatron from extracting the Angolmois Energy and protect the planet Gaia from destruction. Lio Convoy is teamed up by Tasmanian Kid, Diver, Scuba, Big Horn and Apache, while Galvatron’s soldiers include Starscream (not the Starscream G1 one, but a complete other one according to the sourcebook that I own), BB, Dirge, Thrust, the Autorollers and his own younger brother Megastorm. Would Galvatron succeed his plan? Will the Cybertrons (Maximals) stop Galvatron and his team just in time?Pretty much every Transformers fan knows up on this point “Japanese-made Transformers series” is not a good combination and it has it's good reasons. The fact that it's quite obvious the Transformers franchise only exists for purely one thing; 'to sell toys' (big suprise, huh?) and the Japanese also try to earn some money within the franchise in the form of much more show accurate toys made by TakaraTomy compaired the ones we have gotten by Hasbro. The show itself also aims for a much younger demographic than its Western much darker counterpart. Even though this anime is a fun watch if you really loved Beasts Wars or even the G1 Transformers cartoons. Even though it has a quite boring beginning and I was myself on the verge of dropping the show, but once the ball started rolling the show became much more enjoyable to watch even though with some quite outdated artstyle and re-used clips where our Transformer characters transforms, but once you get past that it's no problem.The characters are quite enjoyable to watch, despite how childish Beast Wars II can get. I personally loved Scuba, Starscream, BB and the Jointrons the most. The characters Artemis and Moon are two androids who watch over the planet Gaia, frequently commenting on the show’s events and are offering small factoid segments at the end of each episode and would serve almost no real purpose in the plot. The show also has 3 'recap episodes' and it's up to you to skip them if you want. Remember; this show is aimed for childern and is basicly one big toy advertisement just like any other Transformer show basicly is.Despise it's flaws, I still enjoyed the show and I look forward in late 2018 when Karyuudo Fansubs will have scheduled the release the fansubbed sequal called 'Beast Wars Neo'.Overal scores:Story: 6/10 (Fine)Art: 6/10 (Fine)Sound: 6/10 (Fine)Enjoyment: 7/10 (Good)Overall: 7/10 (Good)Recommed if you're a Transformers fan, especially a Beast Wars fan and when you can get past the childish approach of the show. general*The planet Gaia, better known as what we can compair to our own very Earth is home to a powerful but unstable energy source known as Angolmois energy (you can pretty much compair it with lava in my opinion), which has come to attention of the Destrons (or Predacons if you’d prefer, you know the descendants of the Decepticons) being led by Galvatron (not to be confused with the G1 one).

Black Magic M-66,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1270/Black_Magic_M-66,"['I’ve had conversations with some people who have either general or diverse opinions over older anime. There are tons of older anime series, but people will either pass them off or think they are all like Dragon Ball. It\'s to be expected because the majority of them are outdated. But there is a difference, I think, between ""classic"" and ""outdated."" As for Black Magic M-66, I believe it fails to reach any sort of “classic status” and as always, I plan to explain my reasoning behind my claim.Released in the year 1987, Black Magic M-66 as a whole is somewhat... well, FRUSTRATINGLY mundane. Of course,...it was directed in part by Masamune Shirow, and he did the Appleseed, which was awesome, (maybe I’ll review that one) so I don’t understand how M-66 came out as a bad anime. Well, it IS of the typical type of anime ova-- a cyberpunk, action-based free-for-all that delivers a lot of blood and gore and horrible plot structure with hit and miss characters, yet, these ovas usually contain decent animation and value that aspect over all things, despite their crappy music and a butt load of major issues with the ova itself. So, now I wish to address those issues.The story begins by showing a fighter plane flying through a storm. The next thing you know, this plane that was introduced only ten seconds ago goes down and explodes into a billowing ball of fire, crashing into the trees, and (finally) hits the ground hard. The title screen is shown, then, a naked girl appears on screen and walks out her house unclothed…....It only took one minute for this ova to throw me for a loop. I know that barely anything happened yet, but the things that did happen are complete B.S. I feel that there are no aims to ovas like this, because all they do is show of horrendous plots and titillate nude women (no pun intended) and fanservice for the majority of the show.Moving on, there seems to be more going on in this ova than what seems to be, but actually, that’s the main problem with this one. There’s too much crap thrown into the beginning of the anime and as a result, it distracts from the important elements of the plot and ruins the entertainment factor. All in order, there’s the spectacle of an explosion in the first 30 seconds of the anime, the title screen is dropped, a naked girl is immediately thrown into the focus of the camera and all she does is scribble on some film containers and go streaking. Next, some government people are in the forest where the plane from earlier crashed and we learn where the M-66 robots come into play. But after a brief introduction and explanation of the components of these robots, they story shifts and continues to shift between the main characters Sybil and Leakey, then onto the military grunts, then to a girl with barely any clothes on (seems to be a recurring theme in this anime), then to a weird professor, then all of a sudden the military is back in the forest, and apparently Sybil is too, and gets captured.  Then a bear is shown dead with its blood and ribs pouring out, and the M-66 robots begin to do random things and kill anybody they see in the forest, and then we jump-cut back to the apprehended Sybil about to be killed before FINALLY the heart of the story takes place and the robots start to wipe out the military forces.  Afterwards, the characters find out that the aim of these combat robots is to kill the professor’s granddaughter, named Ferris, shown briefly in a bra and panties moments ago. And all that happens in roughly 15 minutes.Now, I’ll admit that there was a pretty solid twist that starts off the action, but I only have one small complaint. I have but one, tiny, miniscule problem with this…Everything I explained previously about the story of M-66 is arbitrary.I didn’t spoil the anime nor did I ever hint of a climax. I’ve only BEGUN to explain the opening of this anime. That is absurd!! This is what ruins anime ovas, a bunch of useless, unimportant garbage thrown into opening scenes and information and actions that are irrelevant to the main plot! M-66 might hold the trophy for the worst opening ever in an anime because there are so many unnecessary things thrown into it. Ovas are only so long, too, so you’d think that more time would be spent on developing a decent story, but M-66 goes off the deep end and flounders its writing. Between those first 15 minutes, there are so many things introduced, so many random events happening, and so little time for any narration or explanation that the story is incomprehensible. The frequent scene switching and jump cuts screw the flow of the story over even more. The only worthwhile part to this is watching the soldier at about 14 minutes and 52 seconds into the anime being turned into visceral. Yeah, keep rewinding that over and over. It’s better than sitting through the rest of M-66. M-66’s opening story is very flawed; it’s like watching Genocyber all over again…Buuuuuuut Genocyber was 100% bad… and I have to say that… the latter half of this anime is quite decent. I’m actually impressed. They didn’t screw around when the better scenes came along. There are many points that drive home the suspense and those are periods while watching that I really hoped that Sybil would make it out to the end alive with the girl Ferris, who ends up being a target of the killer robots. The drama works with many of the more intense action scenes and I’m sure that you would agree that everything falls into place well in some moments of this half of the ova.Surprisingly, there are actually very few “action” scenes in this ova that aren’t just a robot killing a bunch of military grunts. However, the scenes that exist are worthwhile and very well done, despite this being just one of those ovas that are just an excuse to show copious amounts of blood onscreen. It doesn’t hinder the experience much this time around, and by the time Sybil has to keep Ferris safe from the renegade combat robots, the “excuse” is justified: these robots are going to tear up anything and everything that stands in their way in order to complete their goal. However, the resolution to the story is unsatisfying, and does NOT justify what I went through watching the beginning of the story, which was a lot of bewilderment and confusion.Moving on to the characters, I think they suck. Sybil is the only interesting one, but only because she’s a bit comedic and if I ignore the moment where I see her nude in the first 60 seconds of the anime, I dare say she’s kinda cute. The professor who created the M-66 robots is too dumb to live; In fact, he’s probably even worse than the people in the story who go up to the super-powered killer robots and fight them out of free volition. Why do I think so? He let these killer robots get close to his only granddaughter, and one of them became familiar with her and went apeshit, so naturally it wants her dead. The plot of M-66 is all the professor’s fault. Leakey is seemingly Sybil’s grunt worker. He’s uninteresting. Ferris is the professor’s granddaughter and she’s very annoying, and I don’t like her. And there’s a Major of the military and some other military guys who help out or go against Sybil, but the thing is that this story spends zero time on character development. Although, for Sybil’s character development, it’s all decked out for fanservice. There are plenty of one-shot characters as well, who usually die right after they are introduced since they take on the M-66 robot bullheadedly. The plot simply leaves characters dead and just goes right on into the action. I guess getting to the point is not a bad thing for an anime and in an ova, there’s hardly any time to pull out anything good like what FMA does with its characters.  Unfortunately, this anime fast-forwards to the action at a bad place. This anime should’ve gotten to the point right after the title screen and THEN explained it’s characters if need be, instead of crapping all over its introduction and skipping the character development so that they can focus on the action.Looking at the sound of this ova, the acting is fair. The dub is certainly far from fair, but it’s not as atrocious as Lily C.A.T. or Violence Jack. It’s tolerable, and if subtitles bother you as much as they bother me, try the dub. Otherwise, stick to the original Japanese audio and dialogue. The closing theme is actually a wonderful song by Kitahara Yuki. If a song from an anime makes me feel like searching for it in Google, I think it is pretty good by default. For me, it’s a memorable song, but the rest of the score is disappointing. Most times, the music is ignorable, because the music doesn’t stand out much, but other times (the final scene on the rooftop for example) the music does not suit the mood of the situation. Outside of that, most of the score is unimpressive.M-66 looks visually unimpressive as well and not just because it’s an 80’s ova. Lily C.A.T. is garbage, but it had fluid animation scenes and stunning (and gory) designs of its monsters. Comparing M-66 to Lily C.A.T., the animation seems to be done on the cheap for most of the ova and the most important parts have an art style that is just like standard animation for an 80’s anime. The blood from the dead people and animals looks more of a magenta color than bright red. The robots are interesting characters on their own, but look like nothing more than the dolls you see in the windows of clothing stores with wigs on them. The animation isn’t flawed, but it fails to impress.For the most part, every aspect of Black Magic M-66 is generic. The outstanding aspects are usually the worst parts. If you didn’t catch everything I explained or need a bit more clarification as to why this anime ova is a piece of crap, in my opinion, I’ll gladly clarify on my points, which is something M-66 never does once.Creator-Kun’s Score:Story: (3) Quite appalling. There is no consistency for much of the beginning of the anime, with random events occurring left and right, and the way the story introduces the combat robots only confuses me more. This story doesn’t pull itself together until 30 minutes have passed. It’s a 45-minute ova…Art: (5) Not good, and not up to par, even for an 80’s anime ova. Even though this was released prior to Lily C.A.T., that’s not an excuse.Sound: (5) It’s plain and mediocre. Can’t say much about it. I do find some solace in the theme by Kitahara-san.Characters (2): This ova has a severe lack of character development overall.  They all felt very loose, at least the main characters did. Other characters don’t even last that long before they meet their doom. I don\'t consider the androids characters either.Enjoyment: (4): I only enjoyed three things about this ova: the ending theme, Sybil’s humor, and again, minute 14:52. The guy just takes a hit for the team. That scene will stay in my head for a long time to come.OVERALL: I bless Black Magic M-66 with a 4.Between the surprisingly good action and chase scenes, horrible characters, and a mediocre score, I could’ve just passed off this as an average ova series and considered the flaws mentioned very miniscule actually. But the thing that destroys the entire flow of the ova and the enjoyment factor is the horrible beginning. I don’t need to say much else because you know how I feel about it. I don’t like it. It’s as if Shirow wasn’t thinking when he directed this. Outside of the suspense, there is not one quality aspect to the rest of the story since the ending is sub-par and most of the plot is pathetic, with its crappy beginning and incessant portrayal of men being turned into ludicrous gibs by the robots. It wears on your patience FAST! It\'s not enjoyable in the least; it’s BELOW AVERAGE! The flow of the story of this anime is bad, cased closed!Once again, this is the part of my review where all the exaggeration ends and the seriousness begins. I don’t think I can speak for people from the 1980’s when I say that this story is flawed. It was a different time back then, and most ovas have come a long way in huge strides. But the point of this review is to review the anime ova and see if I could recommend this to people out there, not to focus on reviewing other periods of time or other people’s tastes. However, when it comes down to me labeling M-66 as “recommendable,” I don\'t think that I will do that either… it was directed in part by Masamune Shirow, and he did the Appleseed, which was awesome, (maybe I’ll review that one) so I don’t understand how M-66 came out as a bad anime.

Made by the people behind Ghost in the Shell it's obvious these guys can really pull off even a 50 minute OVA. Now when watching this, it reminded me a lot of Terminator and I really mean a lot but I didn't have a problem with that since I am a Terminator fan my self. Unit M 66 is basically a Terminator with one job. Eliminate the target. The action in this anime was overall very impressive especially for an anime approaching the age of 30. Some the scenes were designed...way ahead of its time and the suspense was amazing. The art was of course, amazing. But what can you expect from the same guy who illustrated Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed.In fact there is an Appleseed reference in this show, which was kind of amusing. The sound was pretty good. It was appropiate to all of the events happening and it had the smooth 80s suspense music that fed me so much nostalgia. Music score is very similar to Terminator's music score. There really is so much a like between this and Terminator. Characters act similar to the leads in Terminator but here you don't really get to know them that well but I give it some slack since this was only 50 minutes and there is no other anime for it, which personally I think it needs a reboot. The story is rather interesting. I'm not sure if the similarities between this and Terminator are coincidental or on purpose I don't really know. If you got some time to burn, watch this. I wish there was more to this classic. It probably is a VHS and DVD copies as this was a minor hit in Japan and did receive some attention here in the states.

The two androids are suppose to be the perfect robots and at times they seem to be, by utilizing stealth tactics and later on displaying a wide range of all out attacks. They quickly make short work of the military forces. The story begins to develop more of a plot when the target is finally revealed.The main character Sybel, a journalist whom was captured by the military learns who the target is and decides to protect the person. Surprisingly, even for a short film(48mins.) character development is present. Sybel...is well developed, and she eventually puts her personal goal aside to try and save the very possible victim, therefore it's pretty easy to cheer for her. However, the androids are the standouts to me despite having no dialogue.The characters of the M-66's are developed and greatly enhanced by their robotic demeanor. They fit my vision of a true robot: A being whom happens to be cold, emotionless, and cannot be reasoned with. They are cold blooded killing machines with cruel tactics and they will accomplish their mission by any means. It doesn't take the action long to begin, and it delivers once it gets there. The action scenes are pretty cool during the first half. There's a good amount of violence with minimal gore, but it never becomes over the top. Later, the action scenes lose a small amount of appeal when the plot turns into just another chase.The animation is pretty fluid during the battles. Some of the close in battles and shootouts are pretty good, with well animated choreography which switches between swift fisticuffs and weapon use. I really like the character designs of the two robots, because they come off really creepy looking. Their facial expressions tells the story completely.The soundtrack may not be spectacular but it's well used. I really enjoyed how the soundtrack was put to work. Before the androids make their full appearances the BGM enhances their menacing nature, by speeding up to a more sinister tone when they were in pursuit of their possible victims via first person view. In this area, the BGM was also well assisted by the camera work.I don't quite understand the deal when it comes down to older anime; but a majority of the time the dubs aren't really up to standard. The sub clearly outshines it in terms of better voice acting. The dub has a small amount of foul language though. There's also a small amount of fan service that doesn't get out of hand.Black Magic M-66 also has a pretty good ending and surprisingly it doesn't feel rushed. Those out there whom truly believe that Blood: The Last Vampire can be excused for having a phantom story due to length should see this. This movie managed to pack quite a bit in its short run time.

The narrative is intriguing and lends itself well to the action/thriller vibe the anime is going for.  The animation holds up and is a delight to see.  It is well paced, never feeling overly long or drawn out.  All that being said, the best part is the character writing.  The characters aren't unique or complex but, the main lead Sybel is an excellent example of a strong female character, and straight up cool.  She has a lot of courage and doesn't run from danger.  The...soldiers are also well written, being competent and professional throughout.  Black Magic M-66 holds up well and is extremely enjoyable to watch. soldiers are also well written, being competent and professional throughout.

It's got a lovable main character, a phenomenal art style, stunning animation, and nearly non-stop action. Sure, it may be light on story - but that's not really the point of Black Magic M-66. It came to give thrills, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a roaring success.Also, there's an important distinction to be made between story and character. The story, the actual plot of how everyone gets from point A to point B is weak, but...I must reiterate - the protagonist, Sybel, has an unbelievably strong character. She steals every scene she's in with trademark Shirow tomboy spunk and snappy dialogue, letting her bounce off the rest of the cast with ease. Seriously, she's on a fast track to being one of my favorite sci-fi anime protagonists.Oh, and it has androids vs military action. You really can't go wrong with that.

Based on a story by Masamune Shirow, directed by Hiroyuki Kitakubo (worked on AKIRA, GUNDAM and GOLDEN BOY). 50 minutes of cyberpunk technology and action. The characters and the plot are pretty dumb, but I still loved it. Feels like an 80s sci-fi-action movie - doesn't take itself too serious, but excites nonetheless. I also liked the designs of the futuristic cities and mecha. Artwork seems a little bit more polished than the animations. Good show! "", '""My favorite anime of 2021 is Osama bin Laden Ranking.""- Neimaj, 2022I\'m not sure what I was expecting when I saw the cover art and the title for this OVA. Black Magic M-66 is gonna be the name of my new indie metal band; talk about a sick name.Very straightforward anime here. Sexy, naked, tanned, anime lady Sybel is hoping to get a new big story or scoop for whatever news channel she\'s working for. It\'s never really clarified who she works for, but it doesn\'t matter. She discovers that the military is hiding some kind of secret weapon and tries to get more...information out of the situation by spying on the military. She does this with the help of her not so helpful partner in crime. He\'s not important at all and you don\'t need to remember his name. Turns out, the military was hiding these robot assassins that go on an insane killing spree once they escape, and it was fascinating to watch. The fight choreography and animation of the robots were pretty damn good. The military stood no chance and it was a solid gold ass whooping.If I could describe this entire OVA in one phrase it would be, ""Discount Terminator."" The robots have a specific target they must kill, which is the granddaughter of the man who created them. I can\'t remember why they\'re after her, but Sybel encounters her and protects her for the entire episode. It was a fun 48 minutes. If you just want to watch a stone-cold, cybernetic killing machine causing a lot of collateral damage to kill a single girl for 40 minutes with above-average animation, be my guest. It was cool. The robot is absolutely terrifying because of the amount of resources and tricks they had to use to actually put the thing down. Other than that, it doesn\'t have that much substance and is lacking a real story. It has no real rewatch value and everything I said in this review is the OVA. The OST is mediocre, nothing special. I\'m not sure what compelled me to write this review. Definitely one of my shorter ones.I would give Black Magic M-66 a light recommendation. 6 out of 10. information out of the situation by spying on the military.

An action thriller with clear terminator inspirations based on a manga by Masamune Shirow? I was ready to cum all over myself, but it turns out that it really was too good to be true.In concept this anime has all i ever wanted, loads of inspirations from holywood blockbusters alongside Shirow's classic sociopolitical commentary and dystopian themes, but what ultimately happened is that they took all of those great concepts and tried to cram them into a 50 minute OVA. The pacing is way too fast, and the moment to...moment plot get's reduced to basically acknowledging something important to the plot for a few seconds before quickly moving on to the next thing. There is no set up to anything, nothing get's properly established, and worst of all, nothing get's time to breathe.It's hard to care about the story, when your understanding of all the going on's is so minimal. All you really get to know is that the robot's want to kill a girl, and our main heroine decide's to save her, queue some action scenes and bam roll credits. The little context they give us is just a set of excuses for everyone to be where they are.With that said, this OVA still has some value in it. The animation is certainly a highlight, many scenes are very nicely done, and there is even some very impressive motion shots that you didn't really see much in the hand drawn era. The aesthetics and design of everything is also very appealing, even tho you can see some corners cut in a few places.And also the composition of some key scenes is very good, they are just undercut by the general lack of context or care when it comes to the story.This OVA is not really bad, it has good art, and decent enough concept, but it just fails because of sloppy execution. I assume that if the studio had more time and money, their ambitions could come to fruition and we would have ended up with something truly special, but as it is, it's just an interesting piece of animation that fails in many regards.I would still recommend it if you are a fan of Shirow's works, but if you really want to get into the Black magic series, just read the manga. moment plot get's reduced to basically acknowledging something important to the plot for a few seconds before quickly moving on to the next thing.

It’s short, and to the point.No complicated details about...anything, for the most part; this film has a plot, some good lucking characters (and character design) and great set pieces. It’s a very simple action movie that doesn’t get weighed down with existentialism or any of that other cyberpunk philosophy stuff, and instead just sticks with the bare nuts and bolts.There’s a crazy military-grade robot on the loose, and because of a programming accident it’s trying to kill the granddaughter of its creator and the only one who can save her is Sybel, a gutsy, front-line war reporter! Sybel’s character design reminded me of Ellen Ripley. That should tell you basically all you need to know about her (assuming you’ve seen Alien).The OVA plays out like a mish-mash of all the popular western action movies from the 80’s and it works kind of brilliantly. I can imagine Masanori Ota sitting in a movie theater in Osaka on a late afternoon, drinking a beer, and smoking a cigarette, and getting inspiration to create this movie… but then again, that’s just my imagination, because the original doujinshi for this predates most of those movies by a good bit.Moving on…Because there’s not really much of a backstory for any of setting or characters, it’s all left to the imagination, which is great, because it lets you just enjoy the set piece action scenes, which are pretty great, even by today’s standards.I really enjoyed this movie, finding it very nostalgic for simpler times. The background art was extremely well done, the vehicles were all overly designed in a typical 80’s anime way, but the level of detail in just the random truck that explodes shows you how much attention to detail artists paid on the little things back then. The crazy robot looks fierce, cold, and cool. Its weapons don’t require any long explanations of science or physics to understand; they’re very lazerbeam pew pew, hulk smash kind of deal. The same applies to all the countermeasures the military takes to fight the robot. We’re acknowledged to be a smart enough audience to know what “the donut” does (because I certainly don’t remember them telling us), but I find that very refreshing not being babied. No excess exposition required. Great.This was yet another movie I found looking through the HIDIVE vaults. Crazy to think that when you go hunting for hidden gems, sometimes you actually find them.Hard recommend. Go, grab a pizza, or a beer, and throw this on before you get back to your seasonals. I’m sure it will be a nice change of pace. anything, for the most part; this film has a plot, some good lucking characters (and character design) and great set pieces.

And then some more. And after that I see shows like Zankyou No Terror which also shows high school students capable of destroying the world (mind you they were pretty old, but they still went to a high school). And then I see this show which I thought I would give a try since it was only one 11 min long episode. Considering that most of the YouTube videos that I watch are also approx. 10 mins long, I figured I might as well...give it a shot.And after that, lets just say it was nothing exceptional. With a rating of all ages, i'm assuming that it was meant for little kids due to the type of humor used in the show.

It is a simple series of short animations films presented by YKK. What is YKK? In short, they are a manufacturing group based in Japan that\'s known to as the world\'s largest zipper manufacturer.  That\'s right, this is is a series of shorts meant to promote their zipper products. The products are even listed on their official site along with which episode the product is used in.There are currently 7 episodes. Fastening Days 1, 2, 3, and 4. For some reason  Fastening Days 3 and 4 is divided into...3 ""episodes"" for some reason on youtube but put together are roughly 10 minutes long. I guess you could say its really 4 episodes but it\'s just divided weirdly on YKK youtube channel and official site for Fastening Days (which just plays the youtube versions).I\'m making this review mostly cause I think the low score is unreasonable despite the positive reaction from a majority of viewers. Maybe they were expecting a full fledged series with a well developed plot. You won\'t find that here.Enough the background of Fastening Days and I\'ll get into some light spoilers to the Fastening Days 1. You have orphaned two kids taken in by a windowed grandma. They invent a device that can shoot and attach zipper that the two kids use in creative ways to help and protect the people of their town. This can vary from zipping up a kiddie pool, helping a couple stay together by zipping their sleeves together or stopping a disaster from happening to the city. All of which are meant to promote a Zipper product.Got to give YKK props and the directors who worked on this for the creative ideas to use zippers (specifically YKK products that they wer probably told to include). Also there\'s a bear that\'s invention left by the grandma\'s husband that can apparently understand human emotions. Obviously not explained by anything of the films and this is information I got from the character bios from the official website.There\'s little to no explanation to the characters, the plots are simple at best, the animation can be repetitive (zipper pool scene) but at least the art and voice acting are pretty good. Non of the films are trying to be anything more than than a product placement with some child-like imagination and that\'s OK. Back when I saw this in 2014, I was quite fatigue on anime which is why I tend to prefer western animations but this was a breath of fresh air that I needed. It reminded me of why I still enjoy Japanese animation by letting relive that child-like awe.Think of it as when seeing a Ghibli film. Now those typically have a more though out plot and a better budget. However, there\'s a consistent feeling that Disney and Ghibli films make their audience experience. I believe that\'s a kind of child-like nostalgia from how imaginative or creative or silly one was as a child. Fastening Days achieves that and that\'s why you should give it a watch. It\'s available on youtube and the official site in Japanese audio, Japanese audio with subtitles, and English audio.Side Note:The dub isn\'t too bad either but I know Japanese audio ""purists"" will refuse to listen. For dub listeners, it\'s pretty good and it\'s not like most Japnese Engrish. Some characters are voiced by either Japanese, British or American voice actors. The Japanese voice actors for the dub are more obvious from their accents but they still do a good job for the dub. A very strange dub but it gave amazing results.It seems to voice actors change sometimes from film to film. Possibly due to the availability of the actors at the time. There are also different directors for Fastening Days 3 and 4. You may find a new character in the 2nd film annoying but I believe they got an indian voice actor for an indian character. (Based on the accent I heard). Unfortunately non of the voice actors are credited on the official site of facebook page so it\'s hard to tell.Some may turn to the Japanese audio cause it\'s more at home or familiar in quality. Regardless of what version you watch, both are good.Some may also enjoy that there is a very diverse range of background characters in the films which is refreshing to see from the same typical designs of some anime. It\'s not just skin tones, its race, accents (a little bit) and hair styles. 3 ""episodes"" for some reason on youtube but put together are roughly 10 minutes long. I guess you could say its really 4 episodes but it\'s just divided weirdly on YKK youtube channel and official site for Fastening Days (which just plays the youtube versions).I\'m making this review mostly cause I think the low score is unreasonable despite the positive reaction from a majority of viewers. Maybe they were expecting a full fledged series with a well developed plot. You won\'t find that here.Enough the background of Fastening Days and I\'ll get into some light spoilers to the Fastening Days 1. You have orphaned two kids taken in by a windowed grandma. They invent a device that can shoot and attach zipper that the two kids use in creative ways to help and protect the people of their town. This can vary from zipping up a kiddie pool, helping a couple stay together by zipping their sleeves together or stopping a disaster from happening to the city. All of which are meant to promote a Zipper product.Got to give YKK props and the directors who worked on this for the creative ideas to use zippers (specifically YKK products that they wer probably told to include). Also there\'s a bear that\'s invention left by the grandma\'s husband that can apparently understand human emotions. Obviously not explained by anything of the films and this is information I got from the character bios from the official website.There\'s little to no explanation to the characters, the plots are simple at best, the animation can be repetitive (zipper pool scene) but at least the art and voice acting are pretty good. Non of the films are trying to be anything more than than a product placement with some child-like imagination and that\'s OK. Back when I saw this in 2014, I was quite fatigue on anime which is why I tend to prefer western animations but this was a breath of fresh air that I needed. It reminded me of why I still enjoy Japanese animation by letting relive that child-like awe.Think of it as when seeing a Ghibli film. Now those typically have a more though out plot and a better budget. However, there\'s a consistent feeling that Disney and Ghibli films make their audience experience. I believe that\'s a kind of child-like nostalgia from how imaginative or creative or silly one was as a child. Fastening Days achieves that and that\'s why you should give it a watch. It\'s available on youtube and the official site in Japanese audio, Japanese audio with subtitles, and English audio.Side Note:The dub isn\'t too bad either but I know Japanese audio ""purists"" will refuse to listen. For dub listeners, it\'s pretty good and it\'s not like most Japnese Engrish. Some characters are voiced by either Japanese, British or American voice actors. The Japanese voice actors for the dub are more obvious from their accents but they still do a good job for the dub. A very strange dub but it gave amazing results.It seems to voice actors change sometimes from film to film. Possibly due to the availability of the actors at the time. There are also different directors for Fastening Days 3 and 4. You may find a new character in the 2nd film annoying but I believe they got an indian voice actor for an indian character. (Based on the accent I heard).

Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1799/Fatal_Fury__Legend_of_the_Hungry_Wolf,"['Well, this story is your typical &ldquo;you killed my father and you must pay&rdquo; kind of old school martial arts story, but brought more into a modern day context. After all, the story is a descent adaptation of the original material which the Street Fighter Zero anime fails to do and that&rsquo;s what made that anime bad. I think the personalities of the characters that were previously featured in the games are well adapted as well. Terry despite his strength is a laid back kind of guy. While his brother Andy is more hot blooded. Joe is a party animal. So you really don&rsquo;t need...any familiarity with the games to get into this anime because the story of at least the first game is also told in this one.Other featured characters are Geese&rsquo;s henchmen like the staff master Billy Kane and the masked pro wrestler, Raiden and they are transitioned faithfully themselves. On one hand, it&rsquo;s a faithful interpretation, but the story in terms of being a martial arts flick is a little too clich&eacute;.The character design is by Masami Obari. He has a real distinct style of drawing character faces and bodies. Like Joe Higashi&rsquo;s built is really like a true Muay Thai fighter&rsquo;s built being all lean. The clothing of the characters is of course well faithful to the gaming design originally done by Shinkiro. I also like how he gave Terry&rsquo;s hat a steel plate to it. Makes me wish I want a hat like that because I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool. Some notable exemptions are of course Andy&rsquo;s hair color being silver in this one though the sequels will change it to blonde. In common trait to his other works, he does tend to use lots of colors which brings out the resolution and it gave me a feeling of being alert to a lot of details with the characters. Of course other traits of Obari will be well built women but the only featured female character is Lily and she happens to wear something like a Victorian dress but you never see any body parts exposed.The fights also well utilize the character&rsquo;s signature moves. It tends to be based more on the games rather than realistic fighting which was the Street Fighter II animated movie approach was. Like Terry will use his burn knuckle and rising tackle. Geese will have his raging storm and reppuken. And so on and so forth. The fights translate very well but the problem is being a 45 minute feature, the fights tend to be a bit short. Though the fights are short, they are still exciting and plenty of action.First, I would like to talk about the Japanese voice acting and compare it to the dub. I will admit it. These are the rare kinds of anime that I prefer the English dub over the Japanese track. The Japanese voice actors were ok, but they did not have the same passion or intensity as their English counter parts. The voice of Joe from the Japanese version is a famous world champion kickboxer, Masaaki Satake. I have seen his fights and granted he&rsquo;s a great fighter, but as a voice actor, he sucks. He made Joe who is supposed to be in his early 20s sound twice his age. He sounded like an old man and the voice didn&rsquo;t really reflect his prankster personality that he has in the games. While Jason Gray-Stanford who plays him in the English version does a great job of making a voice for him that really reflects his usual childish qualities. I also liked Geese&rsquo;s dub voice because he really sounded intimidating and evil. I really liked Mark Hildreth as Terry because he made him sound like the passionate person that the anime also made him portray. Usually if I ever want to watch this anime, these are the rare occasions I will put this anime in English rather than Japanese.The music is also pretty cool itself. It has a modern day Hong Kong kung fu flick feel to it. It has a lot of guitars but not necessarily sounding Eastern but still something you&rsquo;d feel a little Asian. The ending song Fly Away is pretty good. Not really intense but it really helps reflect the ending of the story and what really happens and tells things in the point of view of Lily and Terry.Well, if you&rsquo;re a fan of the games or want to watch an action anime, then this anime is for you. It&rsquo;s not the best, but still far from being the worst. I wouldn&rsquo;t call this anime in the same league of something as Street Fighter II V or the animated movie, but is still worth a shot for the martial arts anime fan or fans of the video game series. It&rsquo;s an anime with some stand out flaws and there are sequals which later correct it as they go along the way. And if you&rsquo;re a person that really prefers dubs, then this anime is perfect for you. any familiarity with the games to get into this anime because the story of at least the first game is also told in this one.Other featured characters are Geese&rsquo;s henchmen like the staff master Billy Kane and the masked pro wrestler, Raiden and they are transitioned faithfully themselves.

As to not give any spoilers here's what I'll say: The entire story was done in forty minutes, obviously not a whole lot of time to much with. As it would be expected the story was rushed, the characters surface, and much of the battling was short and to the point.However, I found this Anime to be fantastically enjoyable not as an action film, but as a comedy. Much of the fighting was over the top, the deaths were extremely...ridiculous, and the characters were all around fun extremes.Not an amazing life changing story, but a nice fun film to kill time with at three in the morning. ridiculous, and the characters were all around fun extremes.Not an amazing life changing story, but a nice fun film to kill time with at three in the morning."", 'Geese Howard is a wealthy martial artist and crime boss who operates in South Town. He plans a successful ambush to eliminate his martial arts rival Jeff Bogard. Jeffs two sons named Terry and Andy witness the murder along with their master Tung Fu Rue. On Tungs request, the two brothers leave South Town to learn and master their own style of martial arts, because they are no match for Geese due to their ages.Ten years later, the brothers return to South Town and they reunite with Tung as promised. He informs them that he will teach only one of them a secret technique...that can defeat Geese. The two brothers plan to battle each other in the King of Fighters Tournament which is sponsored by Geese, with the purpose of learning the move to avenge their father.-summaryFatal Fury: Legend of the Hungy Wolf is based on the popular SNK video game Fatal Fury, which made its debut in November of 1991. The game featured three fighters as the main characters: The unorthodox martial artist Terry Bogard, his brother Andy Bogard whom uses Koppo-ken, and Muy Thai expert Joe Higashi. All three fighters with some of their opponents appear in the movie. The most notable opponents are the formidable martial artist Geese Howard, a staff fighter named Billy Kane, and the wrestler Raiden.Fatal Fury caters too much to fans of the video game. Non fans will know what\'s going on story wise but may find it difficult to care for this particular movie; and if non fans are searching for martial arts action similar to Street Fighter: The Animated Movie, or good martial arts action in general, then they will definitely come away hating this movie. Fatal Fury is billed as a martial arts anime but you really don\'t get much, if any of it.The weakness in the animation shows in many areas with the action being the most notable. The fights are very poorly choreographed with some bad exchanges. To include, they are incredibly short consisting of one to two hit victories, with only the use of their trademark special moves and some of these techniques come off looking incredibly silly. Terry Bogards ""Rising Tackle"" immediately comes to mind. Also, the final battle ends up being a very big disappointment, especially when considering how tough Geese is in the game.Although the action scenes are short they can be kind of bloody; but if you\'ve seen enough bloody and brutal anime, then you won\'t really be impressed by this at all. The artwork is fairly done with the characters resembling their video game counterparts. However, only Andy appears to be somewhat out of character with his hair being blue instead of blonde. The voice acting wasn\'t really an issue for me and I feel it was well acted during numerous key moments. The soundtrack is something I did enjoy which is made up of J-Pop that adds some type of life to the fight scenes, while also making the thin as needles plot easier to get through. This is a good example of a well used soundtrack.Fatal Fury is also very cheesy too. The romance angle is every bit as unrealistic as it was unnecessary. Terry\'s love interest Lily was mainly used as a plot device for Terry to have more of a reason to hate Geese, as if brutally killing his father right in front of his eyes wasn\'t reason enough. I will admit that the characters are mildly developed though.I also give some credit to the writing team. Unlike many video games that make it to film. Fatal Fury seems to be done by those whom have a bit of knowledge of the game. At the very least, there was an attempt to give the fans something.The production team used what they had to work with. The effort was there, but the end result is what counts and I\'ve always been disappointed with this one. Then again, video game to movies have a notorious reputation for being disappointing anyway. I recommend Fatal Fury only to fans of the game and the very easy to please.Highs: Pretty faithful to video game, good soundtrackLows: Bad animation, too short, fights are very unimpressive, may not appeal to non fans that can defeat Geese.

Er, sorry I got ahead of myself. Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Man is the first of the trio of FF offerings in anime, and while it's not great, it has a charm about it that earned it's place in my rewatch cycle. In the line of fighting game-based anime, the Fatal Fury series is probably the best at sticking to it's core story.......sort of.STORY (5): It follows the simple plot of the game; Andy and Terry train to avenge their father Jeff, killed by a suave Geese Howard (fresh from getting his butt kicked by Ryo...Sakazaki of Art of Fighting, I guess) ten years ago. I admire a lot of anime protagonists' resolve. I'd be pretty pissed if a guy killed my dad in front of me, but I always figured that around year seven of my rigorous training, I'd be impressed with my awesome build and pose for Muscle and Fitness or something.So, it's not that great, but it's decent enough until a cheesy romance is seemingly forced into the show with Terry and a completely meaningless cookie cutter female lead named Lily, who helped (?) set up Jeff years ago. I think even casual viewers will also see nothing in this and label it as weak storytelling, which it is. I'll get to her later.ART (6): For as much as I criticize Masami Obari's character designs, his representation of the FF cast is pretty good for the most part. Hungry Wolf's art is sketchy and dated, but it looks decent.....until it moves. It's amazing how little fighting there is in this, but thats probably a good thing. The fight scene animation is on par with Weiss Kreuz or Slayers, the backgrounds are garrish and bland, Andy's hair is the wrong color that even the box art got it right, and the effects for the character's signature attacks are so bad, it's laughable. Not horrible, just incredibly cheesy.SOUND (8): This was back when not only VIZ, but Ocean Group, utilized their best talents. I still believe Mark Hildreth is the most underrated male voice actor in the business today next to Troy Baker. Ward Perry does a great Geese Howard, channeling a voice thats so evil and smug, you wanna punch him yourself. Paul Dobson's Billy Kane rules (he's used that accent for Zarbon, which suited him more than Funi's dub). The rest of the voices are great, the sound effects have a nice, old school, early 90's anime feel to it, the two musical scores in the movie are catchy and I sing them in my head all the time, and the background music, while limited, is not bad.CHARACTER (4): All the characters from the game do their job great. I give all the characters from the Fatal Fury video game franchise an 8. This score is for one character, and one character alone............Lily. This is Sulia from the Motion Picture all over again, and this is the last time I hope to say this. If it's not Blue Mary, keep these women away from Terry Bogard! She means nothing, serves nothing to the plot, brings out nothing new in Terry, the rest of the cast barely acknowleges her existence, and wastes about eight minutes of film time that could've been better spent making better fight scenes! She got more screen time then Raiden and Richard Meyer combined, and all she did was turn the best fighting game lead into a generic, lame-duck softy who needs THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP to fight his foes! I was scratching my head when this character became prominent within the first few minutes of the movie and she makes this painful to watch, although I've found it easy to block her out over the years. Give me more Joe Higashi, dammit!ENJOYMENT (7): I'm such a sucker for the video games that I've rewatched this a lot of times. I gave it a 7 because it's short run time makes it simple to sit through, and I can listen to the voices all day. Every few years, I watch this just to kick back and bask in the stark cheesiness of the film, knowing that as goofy as this is, it's still not Virtua Fighter or Street Fighter II V. The lack of action might make it a bore, but it's been eleven years and I can still have fun watching it.OVERALL (6):Pros: Voice acting, musicCons: Kind of boring, terrible fight scenes, Andy's BLUE hair Sakazaki of Art of Fighting, I guess) ten years ago.

Gakkou no Kaidan (OVA),https://myanimelist.net/anime/22053/Gakkou_no_Kaidan_OVA,"[""Unlike the far more popular (and now infamous) 'Ghost Stories', Gakkou no Kaidan SP is a collection of very short Japanese spooky stories - a bit like Goosebumps or Tales from the Crypt. There are usually 2 stories per episode, with  cut-outs to the 'Ghosts' who host the show and serve as the main cast - they don't normally appear in the actual stories though. These cut-aways usually are comic relief or riffs on the ending of the story, but they do some running themes which are nice. From what I can tell, most of the stories are taken verbatim from the Gakkou no...Kaidan manga, though they do tread some similar ground from the TV Series.I think the animation is on the whole quite good. It's unfortunately hard to do any detailed comments since the only versions that exist have quite low image quality. But the character designs are all really well-done, and I really like the face-styles and less detailed eyes that they went with. It definitely hides things that might have been more obvious if they tried to go more traditional. The only issue really is that the OP has very, very noticeable dips in quality, though it's not too bad. The character design of the various ghosts is really good, I especially like how they restyled Kinjiro in particular and comparing to the Manga / DS games that came out it's very stylistically faithful.The audio is pretty standard, there's not alot of background noise but it is fairly by the books for childrens horror. The VAs are all pretty good but one or two like Rabbi are super grating when they get longer parts. The ED is very very generic and barely feels like it was written for anything horror related, however as best I can tell it was only used in the last 2 episodes (which are only around 5 minutes long) However the OP is seriously punching above its weight, the song is 'すぐそばに～another world～' by Lisa Takahashi and it absolutely rocks, and feels way more suited to the tone of the show. I'm really surprised it ended up in what was a fairly standard anime.The stories themselves are all pretty good, though alot of them are hyper-japanese to the point that they can be a bit hard to follow if you're not familiar with them - then again this never made it outside of Japan to begin with. Some are easier than others, but on the whole they're all fairly entertaining and short. (I did have to look up what alot of stuff was however, your mileage may vary.This is definitely a strange one and very obscure compared to the TV series, but if you like short spooky stories and can understand it without subs I think you'll probably enjoy it.And as a tangent, there is a Promo OP for a planned sequel series included in the final episode, 「ふしぎ通信\u3000トイレの花子さん」(Mysterious Communications, Hanako-san in the Toiler), that unfortunately never got a full release. It's a shame because it looks like a very interesting take, with some really good looking character designs and a catchy OP song - it's worth a look if you haven't seen it.

The ED is very very generic and barely feels like it was written for anything horror related, however as best I can tell it was only used in the last 2 episodes (which are only around 5 minutes long) However the OP is seriously punching above its weight, the song is 'すぐそばに～another world～' by Lisa Takahashi and it absolutely rocks, and feels way more suited to the tone of the show. I'm really surprised it ended up in what was a fairly standard anime.The stories themselves are all pretty good, though alot of them are hyper-japanese to the point that they can be a bit hard to follow if you're not familiar with them - then again this never made it outside of Japan to begin with. Some are easier than others, but on the whole they're all fairly entertaining and short. (I did have to look up what alot of stuff was however, your mileage may vary.This is definitely a strange one and very obscure compared to the TV series, but if you like short spooky stories and can understand it without subs I think you'll probably enjoy it.And as a tangent, there is a Promo OP for a planned sequel series included in the final episode, 「ふしぎ通信\u3000トイレの花子さん」(Mysterious Communications, Hanako-san in the Toiler), that unfortunately never got a full release. It's a shame because it looks like a very interesting take, with some really good looking character designs and a catchy OP song - it's worth a look if you haven't seen it.""]"
Gamera: Rebirth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53627/Gamera__Rebirth,"[""It's great to see Gamera back, but perhaps he should've taken a few more years off.This series is painfully mediocre, offering up: one-dimensional characters, plotline clichés with convoluted 'twists', and cheap animation. It serves as a solid celebration of the franchise it represents, but has little to justify the road from kaiju to kaiju.If you're a fan of Gamera, Rebirth provides heavy nostalgia by revisiting & reimagining many of the more recognizable kaiju from his Showa era. These are beautifully executed & redesigned, even if a few of them fall flat in terms of delivery. Nonetheless, I think that's where this series shines. It's a...fun experience filled with quality kaiju battles and a handful of duds, but if you're looking for anything more that's where this starts to fall apart.Characters are largely unlikeable & shallow. There are a few occasions where the series tries to expand on and grow characters, but it's never done in a way that feels organic. Sometimes, it feels like subverting expectations just for the sake of it. Other times, it tries to create an emotional payoff without any meaningful build-up.The plotline is about as good as you can expect from a Showa entry, existing solely to move from one kaiju to the next - often borrowing clichés and overused ideas from the genre as a whole in a way that doesn't feel particularly satisfying.It's really the kind of anime you just want to watch for the action sequences, but even those are often held back by its lackluster animation. Though, admittedly, the animation is best during those climactic moments whereas more clumsy animation tends to show up during the build-up of an episode. Most characters look unnatural, static, and often even lifeless throughout the series.Ultimately, Gamera: Rebirth sets out to be a love-letter to the series and as such it delivers well enough. Returning kaiju are well utilized, and there are plenty of homages for a long-standing Gamera fan to sink their teeth into. If you're looking for something that might measure up to the depth & storytelling of Gamera's Heisei trilogy, however, you're not going to find that here. And if you're new to Gamera entirely, I'd recommend skipping this one until you've become more acquainted - ideally through the aforementioned Heisei trilogy. fun experience filled with quality kaiju battles and a handful of duds, but if you're looking for anything more that's where this starts to fall apart.Characters are largely unlikeable & shallow.

I loved this series. Veteran fans who have been talking about Gamera from 1965 are very annoying, seriously, you can\'t see everything the same as you did 60 years ago. If we had to judge everything by the original canons, nothing would ever be right, because the original is almost always the best, so don\'t be annoying.And then there are those who directly suspend the series for having this type of animation. Netflix has already released quite a few series like this (quite good...by the way), and that\'s okay, for me it\'s not my favorite style of animation, but this animation fits very well with the type of anime it is. I found the kaijus spectacular, as well as the battles, which is the main thing. In addition, I found the story quite entertaining and much better than I expected. It\'s not easy to make a compelling story when you know that there is a pattern for each chapter where a new kaiju, gamera, and fight will always appear.That Gamera has an average rating of between 6 and 7 with these two previous handicaps, means that the series is really 8 and 9, or at least, 7 to 8. These series with this type of animation do not go beyond ""fine"" by default is already a classic that surprises no one.

And while he started out as what could be considered a ""spoof"" character, he quickly earned himself a spot alongside the other big monsters (Godzilla, Kong, Ultraman). Hell, Gamera even has managed to outshine Godzilla on more than one occasion! Especially in regards to the 1990\'s ""Heisei Trilogy"". However, Gamera disappeared in 2006 after the film ""Gamera the Brave"". Not even the ""kaiju resurgence"" in the early 2010\'s managed to bring him back (with titles like ""Pacific Rim"", ""Godzilla 2014"", and ""Kong: Skull Island"" bring monsters back into the mainstream media...feed.)So this begs the question, how does Gamera fare after his 17 year hibernation? I\'d personally say this series is a great start and I\'m just glad the big turtle is back in action. The choice to bring the character back via animation was a questionable one (especially after the reception of the ""Polygon / Netflix Godzilla Trilogy"" and ""Godzilla Singular Point""; which I am going to say are not nearly as bad as the ""durr no hooman only monster"" crowd would have you believe). The animation is definitely, less than desirable for the human characters. But when it comes to the monsters themselves, the designs are excellent modern interpretations of these classic kaiju! Gamera & co move surprisingly fast and the battles are all very entertaining. And while we wait for these colossal clashes to happen, the human storyline is pretty decent and keeps your attention. Another thing non-fans may not know is Gamera\'s association with children, he is usually their protector and this series continues that tradition. While the story isn\'t groundbreaking, its a blend of the Showa & Heisei narratives that delivers about what you\'d expect. Now the music is phenomenal, and the ending credits play a wonderful, tear-jerking cover of a beloved Gamera song and it\'s just perfect!I certainly hope we get to see more of Gamera, and sooner rather than later! The lead up to this show was a lot of fun and it would be terribly sad to see him disappear after finally coming back.

Because just looking at the small score, I already know what the content is, For the first story, I think it\'s pretty good as an opening.But unfortunately the animation is not very good, And it looks strange when you see the movement of his mouth when talking,...for the rest I think it\'s good when fighting.Another drawback is that the background sound effect when entering a battle between Kaijuu sounds strange, I\'ve heard this sound effect in a football match, I don\'t think it fits combined with animation about Kaijuu.And the storyline is also a bit inconsequential.Contains story spoilers:inconsequential because the aim of the Kaijuu\'s arrival is to eradicate control the human population, And this sounds similar to one of the anime I\'ve watched before called ""Gurren Lagann""Maybe that\'s all my opinion, I hope there is a new film but with better quality and storyline. for the rest I think it\'s good when fighting.Another drawback is that the background sound effect when entering a battle between Kaijuu sounds strange, I\'ve heard this sound effect in a football match, I don\'t think it fits combined with animation about Kaijuu.And the storyline is also a bit inconsequential.Contains story spoilers:inconsequential because the aim of the Kaijuu\'s arrival is to eradicate control the human population, And this sounds similar to one of the anime I\'ve watched before called ""Gurren Lagann""Maybe that\'s all my opinion, I hope there is a new film but with better quality and storyline.', 'It\'s literally a cheap crap... And it\'s unfair, but since the IP apparently is owned by le big noses that explains what they did.Let me explain, beginning with a little bit of context.Gamera is a decades old IP which managed to be the big rival of Godzilla, at least during Showa and Heisei eras, specially Heisei era since it\'s the time Gamera got the best treatment possible, but them 00\'s came, with not the worst but just a bad move from the Gamera owners that costed them everything, they went bankrupt, Gamera went stolen by $Kadokawa$, and the IP got dormant for years, outside of...cringe collabs with cashgrabs like $Symphogear$.Then there\'s 2015, and a very teaser trailer like short was shown to the world for the 50th anniversary of the Giant turtle, it was incredible, and showed potential for a good return, but then, the notice of it being just a commemorative short devastated everyone, don\'t matter if it was a person or not, it was just a big ""fug you"".Now we are here, Kadokawa finally does something with the IP and it\'s incredibly bad, not just the CGI, but literally everything screams ""laziness"" being the most worked thing the kaiju design, and that\'s saying much since it was literally a hit or miss, alongside Gamera itself being apparently a recycled version of the 2015 short, but green.Other problem is the general aesthetic, specially character design, is just boring and bland, not too much anime generic but if I have to be honest, even a generic anime design is a better option than these trash that looks like pokémon SwSh white npcs.and as a last note for visuals, man, that obnoxious zoom, literally every single time, in every shot, there\'s a enough notoriously and unnecessary zoom that disrupts immersion, it\'s not just the opening, it\'s everywhere.But now the worst things, being this:1 -censored by OP-It\'s a specific moment that happens on episode 3 or 4, I can\'t expand further but it\'s a horrid morbid horrible implication about a main character.2 The story is just boring, like, you have children really forced on being constantly involved with the kaiju, despite being unbelievable, the involvement of the main characters only has sense on the first chapter, then is just a nonsensical festival of ""yeah, let\'s take this random group of friends to dangerous military operations"" and even if it\'s not realistic, at least they would tried a little to have a good execution on the idea of these children being in middle of the military drama, but no, there\'s no intelligent twist for this plot point that is just a big reference to certain element of showa Gamera.To conclude, it\'s just offensive how little the people at kadokawa Gamera care and what they can do to ruin such an important intellectual property just because ""it won\'t make enough money"". cringe collabs with cashgrabs like $Symphogear$.Then there\'s 2015, and a very teaser trailer like short was shown to the world for the 50th anniversary of the Giant turtle, it was

I'm a bit of a Gamera fan, so here are my small thoughts on it!For those who don't know about Gamera himself: Gamera is a giant turtle Kaiju that got quite the fame before the 2000' in Japan for being a Godzilla's contrasting rival when it comes to Japanese monster movies. But the big guy went silent for quite a long period, his last movie being Gamera the Brave from 2006 and no other projects have been taken since. But...finally the turtle has made a comeback with an Netflix animated series called Gamera: Rebirth, it draws the attention of not only our protagonist, but also 5 other Kaijus that Gamera has already faced before during the Showa period: Gyaos, Jiger, Zigra, Guiron and Viras. The series is mainly focused on our protagonist fighting other monsters to save the Earth and the population in danger, but there's also a side story about four kids going into an adventure trying to escape and getting safe from the Kaijus.The plot is as simple as you can get: monsters fly around and hit each other while the human characters are trying to give us a reason of why we should care about the monster action. If we have to compare for a moment this series to other anime with giant monsters like Godzilla Singular Point, the Godzilla anime trilogy or even Attack on Titan, Rebirth doesn't try to give a complex story or a deep meaning message behind the Kaiju fights, which in my opinion is a good choice because it will let the fans enjoy what they came here for: mindless monster action. The action itself was quite the spectacle, the way the monsters can fly or jump around while still having some sort of weight and impact on every hit they get is satisfying + the GCI on the Kaijus doesn't look that bad, I've seen better CGI in other action oriented series but the monsters aesthetic, along with their creative design, are charming to look. Gamera was also a very likable character, he's intimidating whenever countering another Kaiju but also protective and badass with the main cast around, maybe one of my favorite interpretation of the big turtle so far, his design is very sick and awesome as well.So the story and action scenes are decent enough to recommend Gamera: Rebirth to a certain type of audience who wants to get at the edge of their seat. The show knows what it is and it's not afraid to be a mindless destruction fest with giant freaks, so I can give Rebirth a small respect for what is trying to be, but at the same time I can't call myself satisfied with Rebirth for probably insignificant reasons that other people might think. While the fights are well made and the protagonists are always set in dangerous situations I didn't felt much excitement, mainly due to the generic soundtrack playing in the background that kinda killed the tension it was getting. The human characters aren't anything to write a book about, I've seen worse squad of kids in different stories (even in Gamera movies) but I can't find a lot to relate to them and I won't call their friendship unique or strong at all, and it makes me think of them as a generic group to follow. By the last two episodes when the main cast were getting in life risking events and the plot was getting a lot more serious I simply couldn't care. Also while I complimented the CGI for the monsters and how nice it looked, it was a deal breaker for me seeing how terrible it look on the human characters, on top of having bland design they also have stiff and janky movements which makes them look very unnatural. It's one aspect I can compliment Godzilla Singular Point for, creating characters with generally unique design while being 2D animated, but Rebirth does the very opposite. It was a very noticeable problem after seeing the first trailer and sadly it has been the same from start to end. They also revealed a twist villain at the end, a character that seemed genuine and friendly for most of the adventure except not really when the plot needed at finale, it felt to cliché in my opinion.So... this is what I generally think of Rebirth. Despite the overall nice attempt to bring the big turtle guy back in game, I can't help but feeling they could have made his return a little more epic and fascinating. Am I being to harsh on this small and inoffensive anime? Yeah maybe, but at same time I can't recommend it to a general audience who wants to look at something more memorable and there are other Gamera entries that can offer you a much better experience: like the Gamera Heisei trilogy or Gamera the Brave that I mentioned before. For being a return of an iconic monster, I just wasn't very interested. But then again this is just a dumb animated series made by f**king Netflix so, what could I expect.

It\'s about damn time!Hiroyuki Seshita has more than made up for the Godzilla anime trilogy with this. Granted the frankly awful 3D character models don\'t blend at all with the 2D backgrounds nor more stylistic kaiju designs but for what it\'s worth, the writing is actually rather decent despite the confused tone which can\'t decide if it wants to be for kids or adults. It constantly vibes like one of those 80s ""band of kids go on an adventure"" movies, e.g. The Goonies which is probably why I liked it so much, it also...pays homage to every Gamera movie and iteration although much more from the Shōwa era than the superior Heisei trilogy. Helps that the episodes are 45 minutes long which makes it feel like linked mini-movies as opposed to an actual series. The music by Shuji Katayama is awesome, every time Gamera appears he is accompanied by a rocking guitar riff and the songs by WANIMA are pretty fabulous as well. The voice acting is all pretty good but no one really stood out to me in either language. Overall, Rebirth is a particularly fine return to the screen for our loveable giant turtle. It\'s not perfect but I would gladly take more if they could iron out the animation issues. pays homage to every Gamera movie and iteration although much more from the Shōwa era than the superior Heisei trilogy.

However, I can confidently say that this anime is not just for the die-hard fans; it has a lot to offer to newcomers as well.One of the standout features is its homage to the Showa Era (1926-1989) of the Gamera Films. The inclusion of classic kaiju from that era, the focus on children, and even introducing an American child character all pay tribute to the nostalgic elements that fans of the original films will surely appreciate.The core of the story revolves around the children introduced in the first episode...and Gamera's unwavering commitment to protect them. The kaiju battles are a definite highlight, filled with excitement and showcasing Gamera's remarkable adaptability in the face of formidable adversaries.While the kaiju action takes center stage, the human story is more focused on the children and the adults accompanying them. Additionally, Gamera Rebirth injects a dose of sci-fi elements into the mix, adding a layer of intrigue and expanding the universe beyond simple monster brawls. The voice acting in the anime is praiseworthy. The cast, which includes a few notable names, delivers solid performances that enhance the overall viewing experience. I would recommend this overall, enjoy and watch some kaiju battles along with a wacky human story. and Gamera's unwavering commitment to protect them.

Additionally, Gamera Rebirth injects a dose of sci-fi elements into the mix, adding a layer of intrigue and expanding the universe beyond simple monster brawls. The voice acting in the anime is praiseworthy. The cast, which includes a few notable names, delivers solid performances that enhance the overall viewing experience.

For every incredible Netflix anime adaption, there must be anime that is such incredible garbage you’d think it was taken from the “Crunchyroll Originals” lineup -before that piece of marketing died- to balance the scales back to neutral. Gamera: Rebirth is one such piece of stinky doo-doo-faeces. An unholy matrimony between some of the worst Kaiju movies in recent memory, the Micheal Bay Transformers movies and the 1995 animated TV series, Reboot… somehow?Gamera: Rebirth is a coming-of-age story about three young friends trying to buy communication devices so that when they’re split up...due to one of them transferring to another school they can stay friends forever, and an older cowardly American bully and son of a military general learning to what it means to be brave. I didn't care for these Saturday morning children’s TV storylines as I came to this anime about Kaiju for Kaiju battles. Unfortunately, Gamer: Rebirth told me to go and fuck myself as Kaiju battles took up maybe five minutes of each episode forty minute run time. The rest is spent on meaningless American Military leaders saying things to each other that don’t matter or “Oo-Ra-Ra-ing” before getting splatted by giant monsters, scientists theorising things the viewers have just witnessed or the four main kids being morons. The script is so uninspired yet weirdly American military propaganda-y and with the pacing of a slug even at 1.5x watch speed this anime is so fucking boring to watch.Of course, this isn’t helped by the insanely bad CGI animation which is so janky you have to watch the anime at 1.5x just to make the viewing experience smoother. The character designs feel like a barely upgraded version of Reboot yet I feel like I’m watching animatronics. It's not as bad as something like Ex-Arm and to the show's credits there are some decent lighting and shading, but still, unless you’re watching the show at double speed it feels awkward to look at. That can be said of the Kaiju themselves. Despite being the title character. Gamera, along with Gyaos and Jiger look like CGI monster models animation studios use in half-assed isekai light novel adaptations. This is Studio ENGI’s first 3D anime and as the old saying goes, “If at first you don’t succeed, maybe don’t do it again, at least for a while…”Gamera: Rebirth is a clumsy mess filled with too many human cliches, flat deliveries and episodes that are way too long. When will the creators of Kaiju battle media learn that people who come to watch giant monsters punch and fire lasers at each other are here to watch giant monsters punch and fire lasers at each other, destroying everything in their path whilst humanity helplessly looks on? Not to watch thirty-five minutes of kids spouting about how they'll be friends forever or American soldiers shouting nothing of value whilst we wait to get to the good bits.1/10 The Worst. due to one of them transferring to another school they can stay friends forever, and an older cowardly American bully and son of a military general learning to what it means to be brave.
