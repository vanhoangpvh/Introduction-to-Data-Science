Sukuwareru Ramiris,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51309/Sukuwareru_Ramiris,"['The story is after the first season, but before the second.Can be watched after the 23rd (before last) or after the 24th (last) episode of the first season as the story is technically a continuation of a part in the 23rd episode.This is a very short story put into two episodes in which Rimuru makes the golem he promised to Ramiris after destroying her guardian golem.If you wish to see what exactly Rimuru does and how the golem is created (as it wasn\'t really explained in the main story) then take a look and see for yourself.The art style is the same as the original,...so are the animations and voice actors.Characters do not feel out of place nor do they do things which they normally wouldn\'t do.In my opinion, this story is more for those who wish to see more of ""Slime Anime"" than for those who are just here to watch the main story and move on. so are the animations and voice actors.Characters do not feel out of place nor do they do things which they normally wouldn\'t do.In my opinion, this story is more for those who wish to see more of ""Slime Anime"" than for those who are just here to watch the main story and move on.', 'Sukuwareru Ramiris consists of 2 short episodes of 2 minutes each that feel like scenes they forgot to put in the anime somehow. The episodes happen in the middle of the 23rd episode of the first season of ""That time I reincarnated as a slime"" and can be watched at any point after the 23rd episode.In these episodes it is shown how Rimuru creates a golem for Ramiris. The significance of this is pretty minor but the golem will play a role in the second season and these two mini episodes get explicitly mentioned in a flashback which is pretty confusing if you haven\'t...watched them.The animation, voice acting and sound are all the exact same as in the main anime.Overall I\'d definitely recommend watching this to anyone who likes ""That time I reincarnated as a slime"" and especially to people who just finished the first season so that they won\'t be confused about the origin of the golem. watched them.The animation, voice acting and sound are all the exact same as in the main anime.Overall I\'d definitely recommend watching this to anyone who likes ""That time I reincarnated as a slime"" and especially to people who just finished the first season so that they won\'t be confused about the origin of the golem.']"
The King of Fighters: Destiny,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35204/The_King_of_Fighters__Destiny,"[""Funny story: the one who wanted to watch this was my mom, she chose it initially because of the avatar-profile-picture or whatever that's called (guy with a clenched fiery fist).I was just glad she wanted to watch anything in general, so we hopped right in. It wasn't what she expected, but she enjoyed it nonetheless.It's silly, it's lighthearted and so cliche it's actually funny. There is a scene at the beginning where it opens with main trio walking on the street, then suddenly, next shot, bunch of guys in black get kicked out from a club, they leave one of them behind, and as that...guy hops on his motorcycle to rejoin the rest, one of the guys of the trio just punches him in the face for no apparent reason and then chaos ensues. It was so random that it made us laugh hard and we rewatched the scene over and over again. That's just the first one at the beginning, many more silly moments like that one happen.You'd think that would have a negative impact on the story, but just the contrary, it was hilarious. Anime never takes itself seriously and it's reminiscent of 90's action comedy shows. In fact, I believe it originates as a video game made in early 90s, I remember playing a version of the game called Fatal Fury or something along those lines for DOS system in Europe back when I was a kid. I'd never say that 15 years later I'll watch an anime with the same characters in it. Small world isn't it?Music's awesome, very high energy funky rock music, art's very video game like, not anime typical art at all, I don't mean it in a negative way, just don't expect conventional artwork.Anyways just as I finished the anime I can say it's a satisfying anime with some clear flaws. Cliches are still cliches, and sometimes they don't get away ignored, they ruin the overall picture when occasionally anime tries to be something more. Story and characters are generic, and you can never say it's a masterpiece with a straight face, because it's not and this type of show never will be. guy hops on his motorcycle to rejoin the rest, one of the guys of the trio just punches him in the face for no apparent reason and then chaos ensues.

Teekyuu 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35370/Teekyuu_9,"['9 Seasons later and the girls have finally formed their own idol group! The intro to Teekyuu finally brings closure to a gag established a fair few seasons back. The 9th Season of Teekyuu is here, and it’s largely the same Teekyuu you know and love.Since this is a short series, this is gonna be a short review with mostly short sentences. I liked how Yuri was made the Boke briefly in the Birthday episode. I liked the introduction of the 2 new side characters, Tennouzu Airu and Kiyozumi Shirakawa and how the series didn’t just throw them aside as one-off gags but actually developed...them (however briefly). I liked the 100th episode which was essentially a character ranking episode but with the good ol’ Teekyuu twist. I liked how Marimo was the Tsukkomi for 2 episodes. Toma-Tomarin!Teekyuu 9 excels at what Teekyuu normally excels in, frantic pacing and machinegun jokes. Although, this season’s pacing is noticeably slower than all the other seasons, with one episode even featuring an eyecatch and another episode featuring a beat panel! It’s not as slow as the dreadfully dull Usakame, but it is a bit offputting at times, especially if you’re used to the series’ madness by now. Despite being 30 seconds longer, the extra 30 seconds are dedicated to the frankly mediocre ED  (Yes Teekyuu has an ED now and it’s basically idol shilling), but one wonders if the extended length contributed to the slower pacing. Think Yama no Susume when it got extended from 2-minute shorts to full episodes.  Also there were some minor continuity errors but this didn’t impact my enjoyment of the show.  Still, some jokes do benefit from the series’ new slower pacing, such as the aforementioned beat panel or the ending to the Marimo Tsukkomi episode.All in all, Teekyuu 9 is a return to form after the quite frankly miserable 6th and 7th Seasons. A bit slower, but still the same Teekyuu goodness. Part of your 5-A-Day!And as usual, if you’re a fan of the series, you’d have already watched it at least 3 times. But if you’re curious, you could always start here. Or marathon the series from episode 1 if you’re brave enough. Don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal when your nose starts to bleed at around the 30-minute mark.7/10Toma-Tomarin~ them (however briefly).

It was a little dull if I’m being perfectly honest. They relied too much on their earlier successes and tried to make the entire show just made out of running gags instead of just the witty humor it usually used. A lot of other things (like the themes) just didn't seem as up to par to me.Regardless, I still watched the whole thing and it wasn’t terrible, but it just didn’t measure up to the earlier seasons.If you enjoyed the first few seasons, I would still watch this because it's not entirely...disappointing-- just not as good.Have a great day everyone! :) disappointing-- just not as good.Have a great day everyone! :)""]"
Toki wa Meguru: Tokyo Station,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23439/Toki_wa_Meguru__Tokyo_Station,"['I\'m going to preface this review by saying ""It\'s 5 minutes, give it a shot.""This will contain as minimal of spoilers as possible - it IS only 5 minutes.Story: 7There really isn\'t much to say about the story, as it is 5 minutes. HOWEVER, given that, the short works with this time constraint very well through its introduction of back-story through both dialogue and flashback snapshots.Despite the cliche story and associated elements - in this case, the fate of our protagonist\'s father, the journey by train, the emotional catharsis through meeting the watchmaker - the emotions built up cannot be disregarded. The short exceeds...its original purpose of commemorating Tokyo Station\'s 100th anniversary, providing a short and sweet story of a daughter discovering her father. Oh, and keep in touch with your parents. Ow, my feels.TL;DR - Cliche story&elements presented wellArt: 9A-1 Pictures does a GREAT job, as usual of their works. I may be at fault for overrating their work, but the short was visually captivating.TL;DR - A-1 PicturesSound: 9Despite the entire short consisting of what is essentially a pop song sandwiched by a short string/piano instrumentals at the beginning and end, it works well. What really caught me was when the strings came back in right following the pause in the song, when the daughter reveals that she\'s getting married. The piano dying out right when our MC begins crying was timed perfectly.(Side note: The harmonica that comes in roughly 2 minutes into the song to mark a change in tracking from strings/piano to just piano and voice was really well placed, though this is more of a commentary on the song itself than the short.)TL;DR - Timing of animation to song is greatEnjoyment: 10I watched this without the voice acting as well and had just as good of a time as I did with the original.(Here\'s a link to the voice-less version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKdaY0slYyQ)I really enjoyed this, and I think the fact that it can be appreciated even without the voice acting/narration shows how well done this short is. Its short length did not hinder it at all - the brief snapshots of the past really accentuated the seemingly cliche story. I love how the short can make the viewer ask themselves questions - for me, it was whether or not the timekeeper she chases in the station was her imagination or just a stranger. What\'s supposedly a kind of ad became a short that tugged on the heartstrings.Overall: 9It ain\'t a masterpiece, but it\'s really good. its original purpose of commemorating Tokyo Station\'s 100th anniversary, providing a short and sweet story of a daughter discovering her father.

It's a simple charming story about a girl with a watch from her grandpa. The art is absolutely stunning and the sound is great too.

Tsuyokiss,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1198/Tsuyokiss,"['===Foreword===In this review I might be quite often using the term “tsundere”, which simply stands for a personality which is initially aggressive and then loving. For more information see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere.Xinil, please don’t kill me for posting a hyperlink…===Animation===I don’t really like commenting on animation, since my artistic skills/thinking are very close to non existent. In my opinion the animation was good. It was nothing special. The backgrounds were simple, but the character designs were nice, and stayed consistent throughout the whole show. There also weren’t any drops in the quality of the animation. During the show there were bits where the characters were shown in...different costumes, and sometimes barely with any costumes on. However this is excusable, since this anime was based on a hentai game, therefore it is aimed at a male audience. Though I wouldn’t say that girls should stay away from this. To tell you the truth there was barely, if any, fan service or ecchi in the series at all, but as mentioned before those scenes did sort of even out this fact. If I could give this a more precise rating, then it would be 7.5.===Sound===The sound was all right. The opening tune was the more notable one. It’s quite a catchy tune, at least the first thirty seconds of it. The ending song is pretty good as well, however it is on the soft side which I didn’t really like since the whole theme of the anime is quite cheerful just like the OP. On the other hand this does have a “relaxing” effect to it. Background music was fine, but nothing special. The voice acting seemed to be done relatively well.===Story===The story isn’t the strong point of this anime. It starts off with the lead female character Sunao Konoe who wants to start a drama club in her new school. However she is stopped by Erika Kiriya, the student council president. She sets up all sorts of challenges for Sunao, which makes the story start off in a cheerful and funny way. Then it starts developing some of the supporting characters, which I think was a waste of time since they didn’t really play any major part in the plot. And then the last few episodes suddenly jump to romance between Sunao and her childhood friend Leo. The romance isn’t bad, however the fact that the story jumps in this way just wastes time. Half of it is basically wasted on useless character development. They should have just stuck with the core plot and carried on with that, after all, 12 episodes is too little for developing many characters.===Characters===You love tsundere? Then you will love this show! All female characters, except for two or three, are tsundere. Originally this was supposed to be the strong selling point of the game, where this was quite notable. However I’m unsure whether it will have the same effect for the anime as well. The female characters aren’t bad, but their tsundere personalities aren’t done too well. It does come out quite strongly, like heavy quarrelling between certain characters, like the Coconut and Crab. As for character development, there are only a few characters that get developed fairly well and others don’t get any development at all. There are some male characters as well, including the main male lead Leo. Again, he is your average male character. He’s the only male character who gets fully involved in the story, the rest is there just for comedy and to fuel the story at times. Nothing special, apart from a curious fact that he is tsundere as well. How shocking. The other male characters are his friends, one of them who is a sensible guy and another who is a pervert. Then you have a scary principal with scars on his chest and a sexy teacher with a parrot that can speak Japanese fluently (and play the drums). Quite a “typical” cast, nothing surprising on this side.===Enjoyment===I had quite a lot of fun watching this. It was quite a welcoming change to see so many tsundere characters in one series. The main objective of this anime was comedy (with some light drama here and there) and the never ending quarrelling between the characters. And I think that it was accomplished well. I can definitely see myself watching this again someday… different costumes, and sometimes barely with any costumes on.

On the other hand if you're a fan of Rom/Coms you might still enjoy this anime. ^_^Here we have another high school romantic comedy anime to add to your collection. However unlike the truly great ones like: &quot;Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;, &quot;Midori no Hibi&quot;, &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Panic&quot; the plot of this anime is so ordinary it's boring. Watching a girl struggle to get a drama club established in her school is something that really could happen, which doesn't give...this anime an edge like other ones. This is one of the major downfalls in this romantic comedy. However this does give the opportunity to pump out a series of random events, with the standard clich&eacute;s found in most comedies. This is pretty much how the entire series flows, with the romantic element barely playing any part in the series until it reaches the halfway point. From here the series picks up a bit, as the romance starts to take the lead in the story and there is even one major development that even I couldn't predict. Nonetheless it was ruined by the ending, which didn't even make any sense and it probably was the director's idea to end with both of her goals completed, but the result was a bit of a mess.The other is the animation which can be described as effortless, meaning no real effort was put into making this series look good. I can say that it looks decent for a romantic comedy nevertheless this anime was released quite recently so the standards have changed.The music is nothing special and nothing good or bad can be sad about the background music, on the other hand it does have a pretty catchy Opening and Ending Theme song.Overall this turned out to be an alright show to watch to pass the time and it is not at all disappointing to see it end after just 12 episodes. For a comedy the jokes weren't funny half the time, especially throughout most of the series the jokes were &quot;daikon&quot; related. The romance was what helped the show, no matter how predictable it was and it sort of helped put an end to the terrible jokes. Nothing can be said about the characters because they are also the typical mix clich&eacute;s, with no real depth to them. So all in all this anime tries to be like an average rom/com but even fails at that, but some fans of rom/com may still enjoy this.^_^ this anime an edge like other ones.

The show is about Sunao, and her desire to have a Drama club in her new school. She has to make her way through the student counsel, and their leader Eri, or Hime. Hime is a total ass, and makes Sunao do all these round about things. It just goes through Sunao's fight for her stage, for her want to act, for her love of Leo and for her friendship with the various members of the student counsel.The music in this show was such that you hardly notice it,...making it perfect background music.The story was a good, if overused, concept, and they stuck with it and played it out well.The art...

I can easily compare the two since they both have highschool life and childhood love themes. It's surprisingly good. Good enough to be better than Tonagura that is. It's not a must watch, but it has great potential. I feel like it should have a remake of about 30+ episodes to become magnificent. Check it out to know why.It's a comedy show with childhood romance, some respectable action, and drama. It also has a lot of fanservice.The story is good and when I think hard about it, it's like a fusion of Tonagura and Clannad. It's about a...girl creating a drama club, dealing with the student council, making lots of friends, and fulfilling an unrequited childhood love. The show had a problem presenting the story because it was too short and lacked detail but anyways, the story was still okay and had great potential.Considering that this is an anime released in 2006, the same as Suzumiya Haruhi and Ouran Host Club, the quality is bad. Nevertheless, the characters are drawn nicely and proportionally. All the characters, specially the girls, look good, unlike Tonagura with the disappointing hairstyles and the way off proportionality of Hatsune-neesan. The art has a good base, it just didn't develop well and came out with an older quality of animation.The sounds are the biggest let down. No problems with the voices, and sound effects. The voices are good by the way, but the rest were so-so and the OP and ED songs were not good, specially the OP song, it's most unwonderful.*TIP:* -there is always a continuation footage after the ED song-*NOTE:* -the extra footage idea is brilliant, just like Luckystar's-The characters are great, but a few are a bit disappointing. This show has a good variation of interesting personalities. The problem is that the show failed to properly present some of the supporting and extra characters and just gave random appearances. This is most likely because the show was compressed into 12 episodes.Tsuyokiss is enjoyable, specially for the boys because of the good looking girls. It really has good potential and will surely become great and most enjoyable with a good remake. girl creating a drama club, dealing with the student council, making lots of friends, and fulfilling an unrequited childhood love.

All the characters, specially the girls, look good, unlike Tonagura with the disappointing hairstyles and the way off proportionality of Hatsune-neesan. The art has a good base, it just didn't develop well and came out with an older quality of animation.The sounds are the biggest let down. No problems with the voices, and sound effects. The voices are good by the way, but the rest were so-so and the OP and ED songs were not good, specially the OP song, it's most unwonderful.*TIP:* -there is always a continuation footage after the ED song-*NOTE:* -the extra footage idea is brilliant, just like Luckystar's-The characters are great, but a few are a bit disappointing. This show has a good variation of interesting personalities. The problem is that the show failed to properly present some of the supporting and extra characters and just gave random appearances. This is most likely because the show was compressed into 12 episodes.Tsuyokiss is enjoyable, specially for the boys because of the good looking girls. It really has good potential and will surely become great and most enjoyable with a good remake."", ""After going through so many anime and game, my experience tells me that mostly all visual novel game have one thing in common: 1 lucky guy got surround by lots of lots of pretty girl with romance add it but in the end he choose 1 and happy ending, that's call harem in genre. Even it had a chance to be animated, they all are probably the same.Some great visual novel like Keys visual novel or D.C./Ef and to name the other were the best with their good story telling moment, weather is mysteries, suspense, tear-dropping moment. But for Tsuyokiss, trying to be 'Cool X...Sweet' (that's in their full tittle) wasn't enough to bring the whole house down; but a least they alter the way how harem anime look like. Rather focus on the guy, Tsushima Leo, who was the main lead in the game; but the anime focus on Konoe Sunao, one of the main female (and tsundere!) in the game who is the main lead in this show.This anime is completely different from the original and the other visual novel anime. Point 1 is what i mention earlier.Point 2:Though i don't know the original game plot line. The anime is about Sunao who is love stage play and being doing it from childhood til today. As she enroll her new school surprisingly and shockingly she found out that:A, the stage play club has been disbanded. Much of her disappointmentB, Leo also enroll this school (who also kept calling her 'daikon' (bad actress) unintentionally, but actually is for being strong and great. That's what he mean). Much of her dislike.C, Seitokai prez won't let her establish the club, and instead 'torture' her form start to finish endlessly. Much of her getting fired up!Because of this (and SHE IS A  Tsundere!), is her 'mission' to establish the club no matter what.Point 3:Rather throwing Sunao with Leo into a loving-harem-romance situation, the anime staff just have to throw Sunao into crazy situation (and a lot of 'daikon'!) to show off Sunao tsundere side. Plus she didn't do it alone, everybody is involved in the situation, weather is ninja girl, Leo, loli, other male and female cast are here and making sure the show keep the flow energy that are made by Sunao and the rest of the cast.That's the 3 point of being different. Overall from this 3 point, point 2 of the story is nothing special and not worth remembering. Is just serve as a normal basic for a slice-of-life story. But point 1 and 3 was somehow able to overwhelm point 2 weakness.The cast however also not worth remembering, the only character was Sunao only. But still they were able to put some gimmick for their own like for example 'Crab girl' Kinu and 'Coconut girl' Nogami always calling their nickname and fight. (and Nogami wins!) Other of course Leo kept calling Sunao 'daikon' is something strangely i find never gets tired of the jokes. Only some have their own stand point and character status, other like Otome who is the ninja girl, or Erika the Seitokai prez and a Ojou-sama, for example. Still that wasn't enough.Why? The visual and art quality. Look very decent and normal, nothing special. It almost fall in the category of 'poor', but instead hang in between 'decent' and 'poor'.Speaking of hanging, the music, opening, ending also has nothing worth remembering or special.Lastly, the cast seiyuu. You find someone you familiar seiyuu like Mizuki Nana (Sunao), Nakamara Mai (Erika), Kobayashi Yuu (Nogami), Wakamoto Norio (The principal), and to name other. Might consider needless talent but i praise their voice effort on the show. Especially Mizuki and Nakahara-san as they play out their role. Of course the other were likable as well.Tsuyokiss, 'Sweet X Cool' might not 'Sweet X Cool' enough to convince why we should watch the show because if the bad visual quality. But try think of it this way: What happen if a show is focusing one of the main heroin of the game rather the guy? Will she have his love or the guy went out with other girl then sad ending? Well, that's just thinking.Not a worth remembering anime but a good change on how we think about harem. And more daikon!!! Try out Tsuyokiss, and you be the judge.

Besides being 80% fanservice and very predictable it lacked originality. another one of those animes where the girl always thinks about a boy since childhood and is motivated by the actions of that boy. girl meets boy in new venue and gradually falls more in love with them. insecurity and depression sets in due to another girl who likes boy. boy turns out to help...girl passed depression and feelings are conveyed and recieved. Nothing else happens(dissapointing for it to end that way).  ive seen this done a million times but due to my ablility to completely absorb myself into anything and treat old as new i enjoyed the story to some extent.I liked the art style and animation seemed smooth. The way the expressions are drawn really annoys me though. it almost seems as though they're getting ready to each a banana vertically(up and down) whenever they smile and once or twice the animation seemed overly recycled and relied upon.Seeing as i don't pay much attention to the sound i have no right to remove points or comment on it.The character layouts carried a few original characters which is more than i can ask from most anime. besides the few original ones though everyone else is rehatched and boring. the typical shy, kind, idolizing, first friend for the heroine and the cold, cool, strong, and strict character who's nice towards most girls. Of course theres the frequently used dense, nice, popular male lead and the heroine is just another hides her true feelings with an angry front type. overall nothing special really just another set of the same types.The enjoyment for this was good. it was fun and made me laugh often and for those who like fanservice(i don't mind a bit) it was probably the holy grail. in the end you enjoy watching this girl give it her all throughout and finally have her dreams realised.Overall it was good but not really special. it was very rehashed but contains all the same fun elements as well. it looked good and made me feel like i was watching another wacky and enjoyable cartoon only with more fanservice and a little bit more reality. It leaves you mostly satisfied without much more to long for from this genre. girl passed depression and feelings are conveyed and recieved.

I understand why people think this way of critics, but just because something is lighthearted and easygoing doesn’t mean it doesn’t need effort put into it. If you want to watch a fun, light anime then the anime must use various methods to give yout this feeling. Comedy takes as much effort as any thoughtful story.There’s nothing very brilliant about Tsuyokiss. Nothing about it stands out from its genre. If you have no interest in Slice of Life stories about school, then there’s nothing here for you. It’s...not even an admirable failure, like how Date A Live has sparks of originality but holds itself back. The only purpose this anime has is to deliver a light story with amusing characters, but it’s successful in doing that.Plenty of school life anime has been released since. Plenty of them tried to add craziness to make it feel alive, like Kemeko DX or Akikan. Nothing worked like this anime. Somehow, I found way back to this unassuming anime and rewatched it. That’s because Tsuyokiss doesn’t breathe life into its world by artificial craziness or just making everyone scream their lines. It does it by having a wide cast of characters, each with their own quirk.None of them are deep or as memorable as Galaxy Angel, but they’re all branching out out from the archetypes they start with. They start as tsunderes or lolis or best friend or sexy blonde, but quicky get a bit more than that. It didn’t dawn on me that Kani is supposed to be the loli until very later. That’s because she’s defined more by her short fuse and simplistic worldview. Erika isn’t just the beauty. She’s a person who is so successful she’s bored of success, and is dying for someone to challenge her and stand up to her. Her stereotypically beautiful look is just a visualization of this nature.It’s an anime that’s aware the characters need a life outside the plot. The romance doesn’t pop out of nowhere. Rather, it’s added smoothly like another aspect of everyday life. Romance in real life may be dramatic, but it’s rarely something that traps people’s lives. People keep meeting friends, going to school and do things other than fantasize about their crushes (or if they don’t, that’s a very bad sign and it stops being romantic). Showing Kani playing video games with the guys, Sunao’s fight to establish a drama club and attempting to get a day job are all here to show these characters lead an actual life and don’t just serve the plot. Everyone also seems to have hobbies or things they’re into.It doesn’t always work, of course. An episode about Nagomi’s familiy problems is means well, but is out of place. It’s a series that creates unique characters with silly attributes, not deep ones. Such a story would be more fit for something like Mushishi (Actually, Mushishi would be a whole lot better if it had one). This stands in contrast to the part-time job episode. That one takes advantage of Kani’s and Sunao’s personalities – one is a self-absorbed actor and the other is childish and vulgar. Boring females with straight long hair seems to be everywhere for some reason.The whole tsundere thing was supposed to be the game’s selling point, but only Sunao feels like an actual tsundere. Then again, she’s only the second girl to be involved in the romance. Sunao is another good example of using an archetype and playing with it. She’s not aggressive and hides her feeling for no reason. She’s a wannabe-actress with big ambitions and a big obsession. Her obsessive nature comes into play much more than the tsundere one, with Shizuka and Honoka acting as foils (althugh of different kinds). It’s these ambitions that drive most of the episodes, with Sunao trying to do everything in a gradnois way even when it’s not needed. Tsundere is also, in a way, an act – so it fits to make your tsundere girl an wannabe-actress. It’s the hobby and the obsessive nature that lead to tsundere-ness, not the opposite.As always with these things, the male is competing against growing grass to see who’s more boring. The lack of effort put into such characters is astonishing. Just compare his designs to the other males, who do have a personality. Shinichi has big eyes that give him a soft look that goes well with he’s romantic but wimpy nature. Subaru sports narrow eyes and sleeveless shirts that show his confident, calm nature. These two act in unison.What is Leo’s personality or purpose? He’s not even a voice of sanity, because that’s a role Subaru or Nagomi often take for that group of friends. Even if a character’s only role is to be a voice of sanity, the character it’s related to can affect how it’s done. Shizuka is the voice for Sunao, but she also acts as an admirer that goes well with Sunao’s view of things. Leo just stands there, doing what requires of him. There was no way to connect anything he does to a personality. When Kani thinks Sunao is sad for a silly reason, it’s because Kani has a childish nature. There is no moment like that for Leo.That’s why the series loses steam when the romance kicks in. I could live with the switch in tone. These characters are alive enough to make me care about their emotional problems even if they overdo it. When one person in the romance exists so there will be the romance, it’s hard to care about it. A romance never exists alone. A romance always grow out of two people’s personalities. It’s not a mystery that can have no relations to the people involved.Isn’t it odd that most romances directed at males have these terrible male characters? Look at a shoujo romance and there will be pretty girls and pretty boys. Look at a romance directed at males, and the male lead is so boring you run out of creative ways to say it. What does it say about viewers?The art style is very simple and contains nothing flashy. There aren’t any unique character designs, except Kani’s braids (co-incidence? She’s the best character) and Yoshimi’s hair color. It’s weird how characters that aren’t very important like Yan, who becomes active only in the second half and Murata have more effort put into their designs than main characters like Leo or Yagomi. It understands its style, and everyone has a colorful hair and the simplicity of it all goes well with the story. If you look at the visual novel though, you’ll get something different. There’s something so lifeless and stiff in it. If they tried to replicat the visual novel’s art style I wouldn’t survive.This flaw is all too common, but at least everything surrounding it is fun enough. Tsuyokiss has nothing to offer to those who don’t like the genre, but it does what a school anime does good enough. I could tolerate not aspiring to greatness, so long as the creators understand their style well enough.3 tsunderes out of 5 not even an admirable failure, like how Date A Live has sparks of originality but holds itself back.

From what I had seen of it before watching it, it seemed like it'd be full of panty shots, top heavy girls and erotic scenes. This anime seems to be one of those average series, that doesn't often appear on peoples' anime lists.STORY: If you're into those high school drama and romance genres, (like the ones used for almost every eroge) you may take an interest in this. In fact, Tsuyokiss (or CoolxSweet) was originally an eroge, although with a slightly different storyline compared to the anime,...or so I've read. Now, although I'm glad they put it in, the creators have 'tried' to be original, by 'sugar-coating' that high school drama/romance crap with Sunao's passion and determination for a drama club in her school. I like that, yeah, it does make a change, but it doesn't cover it up completely. Some of us anime fans are teenagers, and as a personal opinion, I see and hear enough drama at my high school, not to mention having to deal with some myself currently since April. (I'll be glad to go since this is my last year.) You don't really notice that high school drama until about 3/4 in. Honestly, Tsuyokiss would have been without it.ART: I think the bright colours may have been what had attracted me to this anime, and I don't think I really cared about anything else. I'm thinking this was about 2007 though, when I decided that I was going to watch it at some point in my life. Right, well. Overall art design is pretty average. Animation is pretty average. It's an average, for-the-hell-of-watching-it anime, so don't expect anything outstanding.SOUND: Both the ending and opening are annoying. I can't really remember much about the sound though. Must be, wait, wait - pretty average, if I can't remember it or it doesn't phase me.CHARACTERS: Characters are cliched slice of life characters (expect for Noriko. ... certainly... unusual..). Oh my God they're annoying. Especially Erika, Kinu and Otome. Could kick them all in the teeth.The reason why this anime cannot rise above its current ranking can be understood after watching it. Average. However, the most enjoyment I got out of it, is Sunao's perseverance for a drama club. or so I've read.

Besides checking if someone is buried under concrete there was no purpose of it because she can\'t save them herself and she can\'t go through people or their attacks plus her fighting skills are pretty weak (that is why she trains) so it normally ends with her and her face in the floor.The Osts i thought were out of place.The opening Ost was cheerful and happy and was like \'Hey lets run in a field of sunflowers\'.While the ending Ost is the opposite it\'s heavy metal and really dark, a bit too dark for this Anime. But this Ost for me was probably the best thing about this Anime. Just waiting for the episode to finish just to hear it again.So yeah, thats all i can say about Tokyo ESP not really a great Anime to watch and has quite a bit of flaws. Ga-Rei fans will be disappointed. no they\'re just there for 2 minutes and then never seen again.Well anyway, i\'ll keep the story brief.Tokyo ESP centers around a teenaged girl named Rinka Urushiba who must stop some douchebag from creating conflict between Humans and Espers.A few people are introduced and help her along the way including Peggy a flying penguin (the anime does not explain why it flies) whos main purpose is just to sadly get its ass beat by the enemy.One annoying thing is during the last 2 episodes of the anime the characters randomly pull out a ""Special Move"" and end it with something like ""This is the fruit of my training!"" well then, when the hell did you start your training? the only character we see training (and failing) is the Protagonist and her final result is the ability to normally kick someone in the face.I thought that Rinka\'s ability was a smart idea but for this Anime it was stupid.

But this Ost for me was probably the best thing about this Anime. Just waiting for the episode to finish just to hear it again.So yeah, thats all i can say about Tokyo ESP not really a great Anime to watch and has quite a bit of flaws. Ga-Rei fans will be disappointed.', ""Tokyo ESP. A show about people with a variety of superpowers duking it out against each other. How can you go wrong with that?Story: 3/10Frankly, the story of ESP is a jumbled mess. The first episode sets the stage well. It introduces the world and the conflict between factions, and leaves the story open to development. Super powered beings called Espers have rebelled and taken Tokyo hostage. People are panicking. Everything is going wrong. And then the protagonist appears to save the day. The first episode left me keen for more. I was exited to see where the plot would go.And then, it pulled a...Gungrave and threw the plot back into the past.Starting a story in the present and then jumping back to the past is a horrible decision. If you see a character in the present episode, you know they at least survive until that point. Therefore, any fights that are supposed to be highly impact full and tense really don't amount to anything.The entire past arc felt like I was watching a drawn out montage.After trudging through ESP's past sequence, eagerly awaiting the part of the story I was interested in, I was greeted with one of the most lackluster finales I've ever watched. All the plot's events basically amount to nothing, the villains motivations make absolutely no sense, and the conclusion is left open ended for a second season. On its own, Tokyo ESP just doesn't stack up, and I doubt a second season will change that.ESP also tries its hand at making a love triangle between characters, but it feels forced and falls flat. There's also an attempt to touch on themes of racism and unfair judgement, but again, this doesn't strike a nerve at all.Art: 5/10Art wise, ESP doesn't stand out, nor does it suffer from poor animation quality. Its just average.Sound: 4/10Again, nothing that memorable here either. Whilst background sounds and the VO are passable, Tokyo ESP's OST is lacking, so it falls below average.Character: 3/10Nothing special about Tokyo ESP's characters at all. They're mostly shallow and one dimensional, and a lot of their actions don't make any sense. There are some moments where they can be likeable, but these are few and far between. ESP also contains the contender for worst villain (I've never witnessed a character this poorly constructed).Like the other categories, the characters just fell flat.In conclusion, Tokyo ESP just felt like a waste. The premise is wasted, the story is jumbled, the characters are dull. All that stands out are its flaws, and there are many.Final Verdict: 3/10 Gungrave and threw the plot back into the past.Starting a story in the present and then jumping back to the past is a horrible decision.

That anime is Tokyo ESP. Tokyo ESP is produced by Xebec.STORY (4):The story follows Rinka Urushiba, a normal high school student who is a bit poor and her father is the only one who raise her. Rinka has to work as a waitress after school to raise money for rent and food. One day, she sees a penguin and some glowing fish swimming through the sky. Rinka came into contact with the fish and she develops ESP powers. ESP...Powers are basically supernatural powers.This anime was inspired by X-Men powers and so they produced an anime that deals with supernatural powers. It wasn't known in the US because people might think that this anime copied X-Men powers.The problem with this anime is that they never address where does the glowing fish came from. Not only that the plot is a complete mess. Events just happen randomly without any meaning at all. The second episode is basically the first episode where Rinka was lying naked in the room.The ending gives no closure to all the characters.ART (4):The animation at some parts are bland and wooded, while other parts are decent. The first episode fight was good while the rest not so much.SOUND (4):The opening and ending are ok.CHARACTER (3):Black Fist is my favourite character of the show. She is intimidating and badass.Rinka is also a badass however, her personality wasn't interesting to me.Azuma is a generic character who is always there for Rinka.I guess there is not much to say for the rest of the characters. They are too generic even the main villain as well.CONCLUSION (3):Overall, Tokyo ESP could have been entertaining but with it's lacklustre story, uninteresting characters and anti-climactic ending, it just comes off as forgettable.So I give this anime a 3 out of 10.

Tokyo is the location of the setting while ESP stands for extra-sensory perception. Add two more letters to that and you get ‘esper’, the term used to designate individuals who possesses powers beyond human capability. The premise is essentially about a girl named Rinka Urushiba who develops special abilities of her own after one faithful day that changes her life forever. It’s nothing new to see really as generic would be the first word that comes to mind if I was to describe this setup. To enjoy Tokyo ESP, you’ll have to see the show...from another perspective for some painless fun.From the same author that bought to you Ga-Rei, don’t be surprised if you see some similarities. Hajime Segawa’s writing combines an essence of supernatural in a modern setting with some depth of dark edginess. Director Shigehito Takayanagi’s involvement is also somewhat noticeable with his return. Nonetheless, the first episode essentially drops down a lot of concept. The main focus is that espers are perceived as monsters due to their potentials. Treated perhaps as malevolent entities of the world, the introduction shows espers showing off their powers while the world appalled by their actions. It quickly goes with a path of action in full throttle mode with even a bike crash gimmick to add to the mix. However, that’s only the beginning.The show actually breaks down the barriers of the story in little molecules. That’s because the following episodes begins to follow the life of a regular high school girl. Meet Rinka, a girl who has developed the ability to phase through objects. When using the power, her hair turns white. Hence, the medium dubs her the “White Girl”. Get it? Sounds cheesy but it makes sense to portray what she is. What we also learn about Rinka is that she has a strong sense of justice developed by the influence of her father. Justice comes at a price though as we learn how dangerous some of Rinka’s opponents can be. The show introduces other espers some who uses their power for good such as Kyotaro Azuma while others uses them for evil. The generic ‘good vs evil’ cliché takes onto high gear as each episode begins to unravel itself. What we also learn is the hidden motive of an organization seeking to bind the world under their power. In honesty, this whole superpower enterprise is so straightforward, one can’t help but thinking the concept is overdue. Perhaps X-Men would ring a bell with this show’s gimmicks. I don’t label Tokyo ESP as an X-Men clone though but rather as an example with their similarities. Taken for granted, Tokyo ESP also likes to play around a bit with its premise with a balance of lighthearted comedy.Despite the parallelism with X-Men, Tokyo ESP is somewhat clever with its concepts. The series both tell and shows how esper develop their powers through contact with a mysterious fish. Did you hear that right? As bizarre as it sounds, the premise adapts these tones and gets stranger when you see a penguin flying in the air. By the time Tokyo ESP ends though, you shouldn’t be too surprised with the methods this show use to introduce characters and concepts. You’ll feast eyes on flying psychic fishes, talking panda, flying penguins, and over-sized tankers in mid-air during broad daylight. This show might as well rename itself Tokyo War when it comes to the way espers are treated. From propaganda and accusation, espers are labeled as evil. The amount of prejudice is almost surprising as the show sets it up so that almost anyone can gain esper powers thus changing momentum. However, cleverness also has its limits. The classic ‘evil organization tries to rule the world’ takes no time to make itself well known. The organization led by a man named “The Professor” plays the role antagonists with his sub-coordinates. Of course, it’s easy to guess what Rinka has to say about that. But with all this, it leads to inadequate balance of the story especially with pacing. In essence, it’s bad storytelling.Besides Rinka, the show likes to surround itself with others that gets involved with the story. Characters such as Kobushi and Peggy steps into the shoes of supporting roles with little development. There is some relationship dynamics though. The most prominent would be Rinka and her father as we see their closeness. Azuma and Minami also shares an oddball bond although it sharply contrasts with the family values of Rinka’s connection. Unfortunately, characterization is almost non-existent for many of the characters as the show goes full turbo with its story. Actually, that could be wrong as the pacing of the show’s story also feels slow at times. Training exercises and peculiar humor substitutes with story development while high school girl crushes recreates an attempt at romance development between the main characters. It loses focus when it comes to the heartfelt moments. Although there are some back stories (mostly vague and leaves viewers in the dark), it doesn’t ultimate achieve its intended purpose. The heartfelt moments doesn’t really touch the heart at all as it’s easy to lose interest in the characters.Additionally, the story couldn’t be any more generic as The Professor declares the world (in his own view) as ‘beyond saving’. In truth, the show uses these generic attributes to flesh out the potentials of the heroes. Rinka in particular challenges against The Professor’s ideology with both her words and actions. Besides that, the show also likes to challenge itself with how much prejudice can go. In one particular case, a woman almost gets herself and her son killed as the world realizes how dangerous espers can truly be when provoked. It teaches a lesson to humans as to what justifies as morally right or wrong. The problem is how Tokyo ESP presents this lesson as it’s too straightforward…especially with the resulting consequences. However, the series is able to rebound a bit itself when it comes to creativity with espers. There are a variety of powers that let the viewers see the testament of esper powers. Whether it’s telekinesis, teleportation, or phasing, the show stays honest with its technical aspects. These powers also result in some spectacular fighting sequences with decent adaptation.Studio Xebecs had their hands full on this adaptation. They played around with it a bit and the result is a moderate portrait of its framework. Character designs are tolerant with faithfulness to the manga. However, there’s nothing particularly special about it either. Fan service is minimal although there are some suggestive camera shots that raises eyebrows. Background artwork is also fairly simple and underdeveloped. The most prominent aspect of the visuals might be the special effects. Some optimism will pay off as the fighting between espers can be attractive to watch. Overall though, the artwork isn’t anything special but not terribly wrong either.Music reminds me of the time when I used to watch X-Men. The OST has this vibrant beat that suggests every action should be shounen-like while adapting superpower themes. It shouldn’t be a mistake to underestimate this show’s diehard edginess with the soundtrack either. Most climatic scenes are capped off with dynamic entrances and exits. Now, I do give credit to some of the character voices in particular when they are in situations that evoke emotions. The OP and ED songs also have a sense of creativity with the artistic montage and symbolism.12 episodes. This might raise the question such as “is that all?” The show could probably work better for a full 2 cour series especially considering the manga actually has two parts. Nonetheless, Tokyo ESP seems like one of those shows that grows progressively incoherent. It’s good for some combative action and sets up its premise right with developing interest. However, the way characters are crafted falls into a hole of non-sensational worth. The minimal character development, lack of relationship building, and dive between goofy/serious moments struggles to earn the show any praise. In the end, Tokyo ESP is a show with somewhat acceptable fashioned action and fun.

Do you believe in miracles? Well I hope you do because you\'re going to be hearing a lot of that if you\'re planning to watch this series.[STORY: 7/10]The storyline is actually a very simple and traditional template of ""Good v.s. Evil"" and that\'s pretty much it. I\'m giving extra credit for the fact that they have a pretty decent back-story to back up all the latter\'s actions. A good back-story never fails to hit a soft spot in me. So apart from that, there are moments of fighting (somewhat... at least they tried) which may or may not intrigue you....For me, the fighting scenes didn\'t really work out that well, it looked more like they did it for the sake of doing it, and it wasn\'t well produced at all.[SOUND: 9/10]Oh, now this is BRILLIANT. Barring the OP and ED which can actually sound quite catchy after listening 12 times (or more), the background music was fantastic to say the least. Suitable music were played at suitable moments, and the tracks themselves were very good. This was especially the case in the last episode where every track I\'ve heard throughout the past 11 episodes were actually played in somewhat quick succession.[CHARACTER: 8/10]Don\'t know \'bout the others, but this series actually features decent character development, especially for the lead female (obviously). A typical story about how a character overcomes her weaknesses and gains strengths from various sources to beat down the enemy. Oh, but the romance side of this series was irritating to me, if I need to criticize on an area.[OVERALL: 7/10]So taking into consideration other factors as well, I feel that this series deserves a 7 in my books. It\'s not too bad, but it ain\'t that great as well. But I\'d think that it was worth a shot and worth the time. So check it out, guys!

This was especially the case in the last episode where every track I\'ve heard throughout the past 11 episodes were actually played in somewhat quick succession.[CHARACTER: 8/10]Don\'t know \'bout the others, but this series actually features decent character development, especially for the lead female (obviously). A typical story about how a character overcomes her weaknesses and gains strengths from various sources to beat down the enemy. Oh, but the romance side of this series was irritating to me, if I need to criticize on an area.[OVERALL: 7/10]So taking into consideration other factors as well, I feel that this series deserves a 7 in my books. It\'s not too bad, but it ain\'t that great as well. But I\'d think that it was worth a shot and worth the time. So check it out, guys!', ""I'll keep this short and sweet.Characters absolutely sucked ass. The story was predictable and cliche. The soundtrack was okay. The art suffered immensely during action scenes (not to mention the weird lip shadows).Cliche, cliche, cliche. Nothing much to it. May be a good anime for beginners that haven't seen enough cliches yet, but to someone who actually watches a shatton of stuff, this anime was complete booty. "", '...And all of a sudden errryone had superpowers. Tokyo ESP is an anime in which many people get superpowers because they are on drugs. I say this because a select few persons can see fishes swimming around in air (obviously they are under influence of drugs). The first thing I would think if I saw a flying penguin or fluorescent fishes in the air is ask myself if I am sane. Not these characters, they just believe and inmediately accept what they see. Anyway, jokes aside, these fishes seem to give people superpowers by going in a person. All you have to do is wish...for it (that\'s the impression I got, at least) and you get it.There is no real explanation as to how the superpowers work; in the first episode I even thought the superpowers were due to the accesories the villains were wearing. However, this disappears later on, so it might be the authors thought the same thing and wanted to make clear that the superpowers were the real deal. There also seems to be a very limited amount of superpowers. I think it does not make any sense for people to have the same skill, but this is, again, not explained.Another issue is the powerups. It looks like less than a week of training makes you a pro fighter; if you are a genius, you can certainly make faster progress, but not this fast. Besides, all the people are not so bright, most people have mental disorders and some people just know everything; no explanation as to why they know. Are they psychics or something? This obviously makes no sense.All right, I will just say it: this story does not make any sense. As the story progresses, events seem to have less connection to each other, which results in a bland story. One example is that the connection with the first episode is not well made, since statements that were done in the 1st episode are overwritten and forgotten. Finally, the last episode is an incredible ass-pull: everything ""ends"" in one single chapter, making everything that happened in this episode plain dumb.Tokyo ESP has a cast of characters made in such a way that they made me laugh when I first saw them. We have Wolverine as ""Muscle Dad"", Aristotle as ""That yakuza guy"", the male main character (whom I liked most) as ""The youngster that has seen too much JoJo"" and the female MC as ""She who became super strong all of a sudden but is useless anyway"". Of course there are other characters; one of them is a villain who all of a sudden decided to become friends with the MC just to help fight against ""true"" evil. There is that girl with glasses that appears in EVERY anime who is quite useless and a boy with glasses who looks like an idiot. I will also write a line about mascots. There were three exotic mascots in this anime. One. every. 4. episodes. Personally, I don\'t think mascots make something more popular (I found them annoying), but it looks like the authors thought it was the key to success.The characters have vague pasts at best (even for the male MC), and the reason why they do what they do is not clear either. I guess the authors did not want to think too much about it, since all explanations have holes in them. I think that in the end the villains were the righteous ones. Personally, I won\'t trust a government that hires Jason (you know, that madman with the mask & bat) as policeman.The soundtrack is quite good, but I have the impression that battle music is used in the wrong moments. And there is a serious issue with the first episode; the music is so ridiculously loud you can\'t hear the characters talking, which I found quite annoying. Or maybe I just downloaded the episode from the wrong place.The art is allright, not really special. Almost all the side characters are incredibly ugly, which is quite funny. I guess all attention has to go to the main and secondary characters. But the mouths... my god. The shading on them is just weird, it feels like the characters are continually using ""smug face"".So, Tokyo ESP is not something really good, but if you have some time to fill you might want to give it a shot. Just don\'t expect much of it.

For this anime, you most likely will have to shut of any kind of logic you might reconsider, you wont find any of it here. If you decided to give it a shot, then listen closely to its story as it will likely kick you of to the reaction of ,,Wait,What?'' when you miss a small detail. Now to to the real review..Tokyo ESP had also been one of the newest Animes of the last season. It is the Story of a Highschool Girl called Rinka Urushiba. Now the first thing you'll see is that the atmosphere...reminds of old and brings you nostalgia from animes like ,,Detective Conan'' or ,,Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne''.Now Rinka does seem to be the everyday Highschool-Girl until she meets a dear Friend to her. And from here on the story takes the crazy route.Both of them meet and are able to see flying golden fishes, a living phenomenon that if it flies through you , you are going to get ESP-Powers. Rinka in this way did get the ability to go through objects and let objects pass through her.The Story then takes quick and fast turns, which is incredibly confusing if you are not very focusing. So if you just casually watch anime , without trying to invest yourself into a particular anime, this will not be a good choice for you.It takes a few episodes to realise that what I already said, it takes good examples from old animes and unfortunately fails to recreate their glory and has some incredibly corny lines now and then. What never had gotten into me is the first approach of the villains-it is not menacing it is just a girl and a huge-hulk-like guy that dress up as samurai and are able to ,,guide'' those fishes.The Sound is a bit lost and query, you dont feel emotion with it as you normally should. Like an epic battle theme or to show the struggle. It is rather mediocre, so if you are an audible person like me, you wont like this anime.Characters, as I already said - are a bit corny and more stereotypical, there could have been much more done with the old man in the panda costume for example. It leaves much questions open like , why did the professor change to a hatred with such big extent. Why does his daughter keep following him, despite her wanting to change, is ESP lost with death ?Overall I didnt enjoy it that much, the only point where the emotion really hits you is when the doctors wife , after they were badly wounded, uses her esp and her last bit of power before she dies in his arms.An overall point of 5-6. It didnt really go where I thought it would have beenIf you decide to immerse yourself in this anime, do one thing, which is keeping an open view and do not try to find the red line to connect everything, it will be much more enjoyable then. reminds of old and brings you nostalgia from animes like ,,Detective Conan'' or ,,Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne''.Now Rinka does seem to be the everyday Highschool-Girl until she meets a dear Friend to her.

Unfortunately I only managed to make it to episode four so bear that in mind while reading my review. The most glaring issue I had with this anime is the pacing. From the get-go, the series attempts to depict the story as with other stories; having an event that occurs in the future end it getting shown in the first episode.Now, this is a tool often used in stories which I am fine with if it is done properly. This anime did it in an appalling manner to where I was nearly turned-off from the first...episode. The purpose of telling a story in such a way is to bring up question and intrigue the audience. This anime made the mistake of throwing in too many names and pieces of information that normally we would know later in the series. It felt like series that you jumped into the 100th episode and are completely baffled (not in a good way).The animation was what kept me going with the slight hint of some sort of hope. Unfortunately, the pacing continued to where it felt like scenes were missing and dialogue felt off. A major contention I had with the series was the lack of proper transitions within the scenes which leads to losing all interest. I had hoped it might turn into something alright but I just could not bear waiting any longer. episode. The purpose of telling a story in such a way is to bring up question and intrigue the audience.

Below I will list the grades I gave to each topic...-Story (8):The story could have been really interesting, but it was rushed and had some plot holes that weren't explained, nothing that a second season couldn't have dealt with. The plot is about a girl named Rinka that all the sudden finds...out that she acquired some kind of powers, witch are called ESP in the anime. At the same time a treat appears, a guy that calls himself professor is threatening all Tokyo and the human kind. She then decides to start fighting for the humans alongside her friends. As it is only a 12 episode anime there are a lot of explanation missing, but it is still a fun plot that could turn out to be really good.-Art (7):The art is not horrible but it is not great. It is like any other average action/supernatural anime.-Sound (7):The opening has a good music, nothing special but i enjoyed it. The anime it self has a good soundtrack that again, is nothing that would give it a 10 but it still works.-Character (6)I guess that an 26 episode anime would have fit this anime well. Characters are not developed enough, even though there are some flashbacks that makes you understand some of their purposes and histories. I felt like there are still some things missing. They are just average, nothing great.-Enjoyment (8):I Enjoyed it. Even though it has its drawbacks it is still an enjoyable anime if you can look past its mistakes and just enjoy the show itself. It probably won't be between your favorites but still deserves a shot, my final score is a good (7) out that she acquired some kind of powers, witch are called ESP in the anime.

Well, some people would like doing some cool stuff or try to become a hero or “joining the dark side”. Tokyo ESP is about a teenage girl who become an esper and later on become stronger in order to protect people and becoming a hero. When I heard the manga will be animated, I am so freaking happy since I’m a fan of its manga. But, the anime adaption seems fast pace adaptation, and doesn’t follow up its original story although the chronology of time is same, so you would want to read the manga (absolutely, do it!!) from...the start because the story has a potential to become much more awesome.The synopsis follows up Rinka, a teenage girl who lives a normal life until she has a power to become an esper. After that, she meets a boy named Azuma and together fights the evil that come disturbing Tokyo. The story seem plain with good versus evil, but as story progress which is focus about Rinka having train to become stronger in each fight she has lost and Azuma with its background story.The animation seems ok in my opinion, although there is some fight scene which looks like awkward. But, other than that, it was good with the background building, power display animation, and the teleportation scene was awesome to me.Original soundtrack in this anime was okay, like when they change the music to make the fight scene more impact or when the sad scenes more immerse. Other than that, it was average.The conclusion, it was good but I do not recommend for those who have read the manga first, because the anime will crush the hype from the manga. For those who don’t read the manga, I do recommend to watch since it will give you a little bit insight about the story, and I still want to recommend reading the manga after watching the anime.

to be subjected to bad bad words leave now and don\'t come back.As i\'m writing these lines i still can\'t understand what Tokyo ESP is all about.Is it an anime that wants to be taken seriously?Is it a parody?Does it want to be many things at once?Honestly after watching the whole damn thing i can\'t for the life of me understand its\' purpose.Oh certainly the story,or the thought at least of the story is very.....Well i would say unheard of,but that\'s simply not the case.The X-Men similarities are...too many you see.It\'s like a cover band this anime.It does almost everything as you would  expect but it\'s nothing like the original.I mean look at all those tribute metal bands out there.They certainly do a good job covering  a band\'s songs but as for their own songs..Nada.Zilch.There\'s nothing to show for their own creativity.And that seems to be the case for Tokyo ESP.As a standalone anime it\'s nothing sort of absolute rubbish,as a parody it makes more sense.I like to think of it as a parody cause i can\'t think of a way that the writers stood back and said:""Oh yeah that\'s our lifetime achievement"".It must have been made to make fun of the western equivelants.But anyway let\'s talk about what this anime is all about,yes?It\'s a touching story,really,of a girl that one day awakens to some super powers..And she does that by some fish that only the select chosen few can only see,that float in the air like they inhaled helium.There\'s also a flying penguin that has a purpose to serve..Not sure what that is but hey,penguins are cute right?Well......Sort of no..Did you know that penguins are necrophiliacs?Now you do...And like that all super powered bastards gather together and want to rule the world and all the super powered good guys try to stop them..Sounds good?Well again as a parody it\'s good.As an anime that wants to be taken seriously no.Cause the way the story is delivered to the viewer is atrocious.Characterwise imagine X-Men without the flashiness,the flamboyance.Animation is....How can i put this...Well it\'s shit.For a 2014 anime the animation is a mess.Maybe they couldn\'t be bothered.Maybe they has something else scheduled.No matter what the reason is the end result is appaling.Soundtracks and all,was good.Nothing that stands out,nothing to catch your attention.All in all,we\'re back to the beginning.As an anime that wants to be taken seriously?It doesn\'t work.Not one bit.As a parody it does work but even like that it isn\'t what you\'d call special.And special is what we\'re looking for.Can you imagine yourself

series. Tokyo ESP is one of action series which I took because of the action genre only. As the series first made, my expectation is it would become a little good because of the promising almost-ending scene in the first episode. But, as the series went, my expectation came down and almost drowned into the deep of the sea with the ending.Tokyo ESP is a series which told us a normal high school girl and got a special ability. The girls then become a hero who tried to save the town from another special...people. It's cliche premise, but I was hoping the plot would be different. It turned out I'm wrong.I hate the story most than another part. Many mystery at first, but a half-baked finishing for the mysteries. Not only the premise is cliche, the plot is really cliche too. The plot is a mess up, you might find it's so boring because of the repetition of same reaction of the characters. The ending is really bothering, because in my opinion, you won't need all of the 11 episodes just to reach the final plan of the antagonists.Another boring part of the story is how the action came. The action is really messing up with you because of the unresolute main antagonists. The main antagonists would make you dejected. I don't know how many time I were punching my desk just to watch the another unresolute desicion of the main antagonists. I hate how the antagonists made. The reaction of another side character such as one of the main character's mom is really made the series worse. It's okay if the mom's reaction like that, but I didn't get how the development of this character can made her changed. It really turn off the series, she should have never made into one.Despite how bad the story and how the character not made well, I quite like the art. The art is one of the reason why I was choosing this series. The art is solid and use a good coloring. The background is made well. The art is good overall, but not the best.The OP and ED is quite good. The ED give you a little sense of gore of the series, a quite true if there were no sensor there. I don't think bad about the BGM, I think it's fine as it is.Because of the story and the characters, I don't really enjoy this series. Several times I wanted the story ended quickly, I was tired to see the character.Tokyo ESP is a good example for a series with bad plot and the bad character. It can't be helped even with the art or another good part in this series. For you who want to watch a mediocre action series, this series is for you. people.

You should definetely read the manga and skip the anime you won't regret...it, it's really worth your time, plus the art is much more interesting than this generic new anime style. it, it's really worth your time, plus the art is much more interesting than this generic new anime style."", ""Too bad, Tokyo ESP Anime version, has started from Rinka encounter Professor on Battle at Diet (Japan Parliament Building), I think Tokyo ESP has good story quality, Doing anime that started or follow story on its Manga.

If so it's just like Plot drift.Second Assumptions is the story having Reverse chronology and...of course timeskip, coz the story is already near the second arc, where story is about Tokyo as well as the fate of the other ESP users after ESP law passed, and then Rinka Urushiba and Kyōtarō Azuma take part on Human Trafficking and International Crimes and of course it isn't ordinary human but ESP users.I can conclude that this is just doesn't good because the story will not much episode, whereas the quality of story is great because there are element such as International and Political Issue, Nevertheless there are people who argue it is just like X-Men, of yeah cause the story is just fighting and ESP users (having weird power) and I worried if it make a great distinction than its story in manga which already great, but i hope Minami can be together with Kyōtarō to defeated other enemy as well as to save Minami father. of course timeskip, coz the story is already near the second arc, where story is about Tokyo as well as the fate of the other ESP users after ESP law passed, and then Rinka Urushiba and Kyōtarō Azuma take part on Human Trafficking and International Crimes and of course it isn't ordinary human but ESP users.I can conclude that this is just doesn't good because the story will not much episode, whereas the quality of story is great because there are element such as International and Political Issue, Nevertheless there are people who argue it is just like X-Men, of yeah cause the story is just fighting and ESP users (having weird power) and I worried if it make a great distinction than its story in manga which already great, but i hope Minami can be together with Kyōtarō to defeated other enemy as well as to save Minami father."", ""I decided to watch this simply for the cover art, it gave me the feeling that this might be a fun watch.

It's different, but it's not terrible.Also that the story is jumpy and fast, it's not. Everything works its way together. If you pay proper attention you're fine....There are some things that aren't explained, but if the series continues (which the ending is left open with a continuation insinuated), they're the type of things that probably will be explained then.As soon as it starts, Tokyo is being attacked by a group of Espers.Then the White Girl turns up.Kyoutarou wants to protect the world from Espers doing bad things, and he wants Rinka to help him.The plot starts coming together and new characters start coming in.Rinka's dad, Rindou, he's giant, but also a softie.Kobushi, she's usually trouble, but comes more involved toward the middle.Murasaki, a young girl that Rinka and Kyoutarou make friends with.The group of enemy Espers are killing, stealing and destroying whatever they like, for what reason it's not made clear at first.It is a darker styled anime, with a heavy focus on powers and random phenomenon, but it has it's comedic and even romantic points too.If it sounds interesting to you, give it a chance, don't let the low rating put you off something you might really enjoy, like I did.

The story is to similar to X-Men and Star Wars and more, but it manages to create a decent enough atmosphere and setting.

While making sense of their unique predicaments, Rinka and her comrades have to deal with an enemy organization trying to organize an esper resistance against humanity by using the mysterious fish to force people into becoming espers.My thoughts on this series as a whole are a bit mixed. The series starts out like Berserk and Ga-Rei: Zero where you are tossed immediately into the main conflict of the series without any buildup before the second episode takes...events before said conflict starts off to show how it got to that point. I\'ve started to get irked when titles pull this type of plot structure off because it risks turning off first-time viewers of the series who have no clue what they are in for. But setting that gripe aside for now, the second episode and onward do a great job for the most part at establishing its characters and building up its plot to show the characters reacting in varying ways to gaining their esper powers. Established characters have their motivations explored for how they utilize their newly acquired esper powers and why they protect or oppose humanity utilizing them. The series also explores the origins of the mysterious fish that grant espers their power and how this knowledge is being abused by the enemy esper organization. In addition, the animation for the series is quite impressive with highly-detailed scenic shots and character designs, as well as fluid and smoothly animated action sequences that are a treat to see in fights that break out between espers and/or military and police forces.Setting aside praises, the series does come with its fair share of issues. Being based on a shounen manga series, the idealist bent that many titles of the demographic have in presenting their characters has a bad habit of coming up quite often throughout the series. This is quite notable with our series lead, Rinka, who seems single-mindedly interested in upholding justice and being a hero, which makes her character seem two-dimensional and hard to connect with as a result. The series also gets in the bad habit of seeming to get a bit too preachy and heavy-handed with the whole ""being a hero"" belief in opposing the enemy esper organization at large. Not helping matters is also the inconclusive ending as another enemy appears to enter the conflict with little established about them and still being at large, a typical issue with many anime given the title\'s manga source material was still ongoing at the time Tokyo ESP began airing in Japan.Overall, Tokyo ESP decent plot structure and buildup in focusing on how its major characters respond to gaining esper powers and what side they will take against an enemy esper organization, that gets somewhat marred by the typical idealist bent that many shounen titles fall into and its inconclusive ending. Still, it is a decent sci-fi action/ drama title that is worth tracking down if such titles catch your interest.Note: Pay attention to the start of episode 1 and you\'ll catch a cameo appearance from Ga-Rei Zero\'s Kagura and Yomi.

I usually reserve 2 and 1\'s for shows that scream, ""No effort,"" or are plain offensive. This anime... I don\'t know where to begin. I can tell there was actual effort put in, and I never felt that it offended me in anyway. But it\'s still is so bad I can\'t believe it even now.At least, with Skelter Heaven and Mars of Destruction, they were only one episode length long. Tokyo ESP is twelve episodes. And nowhere in those twelve episodes are any shred of dignity. I was...embarrassed to have finished this. Everyone I knew told me how they dropped it after two or three episodes because of its atrocities. Maybe I was foolishly hoping it would get better as I force-fed myself.The plot is an origin story of the ""White Girl"" and her band of crime fighters. Although, it starts off near the end of the story because seventy-five percent of this anime is a flashback. And also flashbacks within a flashback just to add some depth, I guess. It really is hard to remember specific details of the plot due to how unimportant most of it was. Overall, it was forgettable and uninteresting. What was memorable was the ""Deus Ex Machina"" at the end! Boy, was that memorable!When boiled down, this is a show about superheroes fighting villains. What is probably the single most important thing for any type of media or literature with superheroes in them? Character development! Batman wouldn\'t be very interesting if he didn\'t grow as a character from his past to his present. In Tokyo ESP, this is practically nonexistent! Literally, no one ever changes. There might be that occasional flashback within a flashback that tells the history of a character but that is it. Character development isn\'t why or how a character is, it is why or how he or she grows from how he or she normally was.Since this is an animation, I\'ll talk about the art style and quality. I feel bad to have to kick a dog while it\'s down. The art style is rather bland and uninspired. The art quality is the icing on the cake, though. It is utter garbage. Characters look stiff, scenes show signs of laziness, animation is inconsistent, and the CGI is as dreadful as Skelter Heaven\'s. It\'s just not good.Now for the best part of the anime! The music was fun to hear... for the first two times. Yes, the music is catchy and pumps up the audience, but it can only be played so much. There are many shows that use the same music for the ""big finishing move"" in multiple scenes, but the ""big finishing move"" music in Tokyo ESP is on a ten second loop. It will play the same tune over and over every ten seconds five minutes at a time at almost every fight scene.So, that\'s pretty much all there is to it. Tokyo ESP is a downright terrible anime, and it makes me feel icky inside to have had the experience of watching it. embarrassed to have finished this.

The first episode was misleading in comparison to the anime. There's great pacing, great action and the story plot excites you. However after the first episode we plummet downwards to a long stretched flashback. After episode 4 I became disinterested. The anime starts to drag and the quality of the art seems to drop somewhat. For that reason I'll rate it a 3/10 and if the ending is good i may push it up to a 4. Either way I'd avoid watching this anime.

Uchuu Kazoku Carlvinson,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4533/Uchuu_Kazoku_Carlvinson,"['I never meant to review anything here on MAL, but here I go.The recommendation below labels this OVA ""horrible"". What I\'ll try to say is: it\'s NOT.It may be old. It may be odd. But it\'s not that terribly bad.NOTE: I haven\'t read the manga.So.1)Story (8)Well, you\'ve read the plot synopsis haven\'t you. That\'s the story. It\'s just a single-episoded OVA, and that makes the plot [just a little] bit rushed. What you get is: the beginning - something episodic in the middle - and then, the end, which turns out to be quite open (well, the manga used to be on-going back then)....What\'s really good is comedy; it varies from being naive and all-too-simple to being surprisingly refreshing and enjoyable (no really!).2)Art (8)My God yes, it\'s oldschool. And it\'s none of a masterpiece. If you hate 80s anime artwork and find it out-of-date, better skip. If you like it, you may even find it quite pleasing at times.3)Sound (8)Nothing outstanding as well. Sometimes you just don\'t notice the music; though it gets better in the final part of the OVA. The opening and the ending sequences are nice (op: cute; en: nostalgic). The sound effects are quite good for a 80s anime. Seiyuus do a decent job.4)Character (9)If you\'re still here and have read the above, you may ask ""why on Earth shall I watch it?"". Well, here\'s the possible answer.The characters ARE great. It would be ridiculous to expect any character developement; still, they\'re bright and catchy. A fluffy, pink, mouselike creature that seems to be the head of the gang. The omnivore mecha robot with an extremely reserved personality. A brain-like something that\'s complaining all the time. A furry-like female who has special powers and rides a motorcycle-like vehicle. An aged alien lady who appears to be a loli-lover. The Cherry Hill dragonflies who just look like dragonflies. And a pack of other characters, each of them unique in their own way. Even if this was the worst anime of all time, these guys\'d drag it out of hell.5)Enjoyment. (10)That depends. It\'s too subjective. I DID enjoy this.6)Overall (8)If you want to have a good laugh; if you want to see something a bit different; if you don\'t get sick every time you see the 80s artstyle, give it a try.I hope this helped somehow in explaining why on Anika shall you spend 45 minutes and watch it.

"Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou",https://myanimelist.net/anime/34522/Wake_Up_Girls_Shin_Shou,"['“Wake Up, Girls!” (WUG) came out in 2014 without much fanfare. While it wasn’t completely unknown to viewers at the time, it was definitely not a show that many paid attention to. Marred by poor production values and a plot that failed to really shine against its competitors, WUG never really managed to be a major player in the idol anime genre.But nonetheless, it was a remarkable series in its own right. While more popular idol series like “The Idolm@ster” and “Love Live!” gave an idealized version of life as an idol, WUG always had a grounded approach in regards to how it represented...its young idols. Life as a young star was not as glamourous as it seemed. It was a life filled with competition, stress, and bottom lines. Producers were not there to help their girls achieve their dreams. They were, for the most part, there to ensure that their stars were profitable and marketable. WUG’s willingness to show this side of the business stood out to me, which is why I have always been on the lookout for WUG-related media.So how does the “Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou” (WUGSS) fare?Not too well.Firstly, I will admit that I didn’t head into this new season with very high expectations. People who have read my review on the last entry of the series, “Beyond the Bottom,” will note that I had a rather low opinion of the movie. In my opinion, none of the entries that followed the original series were able to capture the feeling that WUG had. And unfortunately, it appears that this series is no different.I have a fair share of issues with this season, which is why I am not surprised to see that the show has had such low scores on MyAnimeList.Firstly, I thought it was impossible for the animation for the WUG series to get any worse. As I mentioned before, WUG had a rather poor production values, which I was hoping would be fixed when WUGSS came around. For whatever reason, the new animation team has not only failed to improve the animation quality, but has managed to make the art shoddier than before. One prime example would be the dance and singing sequences which, unsurprisingly, are the crux of any musical idol series.Rather than utilizing traditional animation for these sequences, we have been given CGI sequences that are ugly as hell. For those of you that have played mobile idol games like “Idolm@ster: Theater Days,” I am about to tell you that your mobile game boasts far better animation than this animation series. I understand that this may seem like I’m exaggerating, but the animation is so damn choppy for the CGI that I was beginning to worry that my monitor was beginning to lag.When you finally get to the fifth episode (assuming you last that long), you will begin to realize that the animation has devolved to the point that you are literally watching a glorified powerpoint. WUG has taken animation shortcuts before, but never on the scale of WUGSS, which has led me to believe that either the animation team was completely absent that day, or that they somehow ran out of budget and decided to take an Evangelion-esque approach to animation.If I had to sum up the story, I would say that it is just alright. There are glimpses of the harsh idol industry that was so well-captured in WUG, but those moments are few and far inbetween. Perhaps there’s more to the story, but at the time of this review, I have decided to drop this season at episode 5. I don’t expect the show to get any better in its remaining episodes. I would love to be proven wrong, but as of now, the show is not very good. If anyone reading this review would like to let me know if this show has gotten any better near the end, I would appreciate it if they send me a message sometime. I don’t expect much in any case.The only real positive thing I have to say would be in regards to the music and voice-acting. As always, the musical talents from the real-life Wake Up, Girls! Have come to bless us again with their catchy and phenomenal tunes. Although not as great as WUG’s opening “7 Girls War,” “7 Senses” is a decent opening song that lives up to its predecessors. It’s a shame that the opening animation is absolutely terrible.All in all, “Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou” is an example of sequel that fails to improve upon itself. Its poor animation makes the original look like a masterpiece, while its mediocre and forgettable story prevents it from being anything but missed potential.I can’t even recommend this to the most dedicated of WUG fans.I’d stick with the real-life Wake Up, Girls! if I were you. its young idols.

As someone who loves to binge watch everything, I was waiting until the entire franchise finished, and I binge watched it.My Overall Thought:Some cool characters, ok story, good music, bad animation.Synopsis:Just the continuation from the ""beyond the bottom"" (not going to spoil it). However, we are introduced to a group of three girls that wants to become an idol. Job for the WUGs are steadily increasing, and are ready to put out their first album.Story:It was neither good or bad. Compared...to the previous seasons, it felt lacking, but this is expected. It\'s hard to have a good story when you already develop your idol\'s story. The addition of the new 3 girls was refreshing, but it was nowhere close to revamp the story. I think this is why many idol anime end in 2 seasons, and WUG was no different. I don\'t think you can make another sequel with these characters. To me, this story felt more like the studio saying ""we gave up on WUG and want to create a new story in the future, so let us add some new characters for the future franchise"".Art:If you love watching the artwork (someone like me, especially if you can understand Jpananese and watches anime for the animation), I would not recommend this series. It got worse and worse over time. There were cut scenes that were too long, and I think it had to due with financial problem with WUG production. I think the overall rating would have been 8 if the artwork was better. Last episode was the only redeeming quality (it was really good).Character:I actually quite like the characters, but the character development is poor. We are introduced to some of I1 idol\'s problem (find out who yourself), and that was quite nice. However, I wish there were more to this. Also, alot of the characters disappeared from the previous seasons. For example, I was wondering what happened to bvex?Sound:Idol anime needs good songs. One thing I really liked about the songs in WUG is that all the songs felt like it was WUG (as they include this in the song). However, I felt that the songs were overused too many times, and it felt stale towards the end. I would rather have one new song being played, than have a repeat of 5-6 songs that WUG has already sung. Especially the last song they sang. I don\'t understand why the production team though it was a good idea to play the last live song before the actual finale.Enjoyment:It wasn\'t terrible. If I had my full attention to this anime, then it would have been a much lower score, but its not a bad anime to zone out of.Overall:I gave it a 6. But, this series did have potential. Nicer artwork, more funding, etc. Especially when there were some cuts that were okay for too long. to the previous seasons, it felt lacking, but this is expected.

One thing I really liked about the songs in WUG is that all the songs felt like it was WUG (as they include this in the song). However, I felt that the songs were overused too many times, and it felt stale towards the end. I would rather have one new song being played, than have a repeat of 5-6 songs that WUG has already sung. Especially the last song they sang. I don\'t understand why the production team though it was a good idea to play the last live song before the actual finale.Enjoyment:It wasn\'t terrible. If I had my full attention to this anime, then it would have been a much lower score, but its not a bad anime to zone out of.Overall:I gave it a 6. But, this series did have potential. Nicer artwork, more funding, etc. Especially when there were some cuts that were okay for too long.']"

Well only if you really need a short comedy parody anime, don´t mind randomness and probably need to be stoned too XD I seriously shouldn´t have watched this series fully.Well I have made an review for the first season, now I wanna address the differences between 1th 2nd and the third season.Compared to the other seasons they stepped up the game and made it 7 minutes long compared to the 4 minutes and they also changed the format totally from being 5ish small ""sketches"" to now one full episode.But...if you liked the randomness and lots of parody of anime elements, stereotypes and series then you won´t be disappointed with this one.For me this was just like the first and the second season there were some quite funny, but sadly it was a mixed batch.So yeah probably not worth it XD if you liked the randomness and lots of parody of anime elements, stereotypes and series then you won´t be disappointed with this one.For me this was just like the first and the second season there were some quite funny, but sadly it was a mixed batch.So yeah probably not worth it XD']"

Winter Garden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1718/Winter_Garden,"[""===Foreword===As you might know, this is a spin-off from Di Gi Charat, which I have never seen or read about in any great detail, so there is some stuff on which I just can't comment or write enough detail about.===Animation===Not the strong point. The colours are simple, without any gradients used. The backgrounds are simple as well, but nicely drawn. The character designs are quite simple too, but they are cute. The notable thing is that as soon as there many characters on scene, like crowds, they are just drawn plain white with black lines. Something that doesn't actually ruin the animation in any way,...or doesn't annoy the person watching it. Running animation is I think one of the better points. Sometimes there is a chibi scene thrown in, but they are done fairly well and are not annoying in any way. Overall the animation is poor, but I don't think it's a factor that affects the overall rating by much, but I was expecting something more complex than this.===Sound===This special features quite a nice OP and ED, and fairly good background music, which is a bit on the simple side. There is also a French song in the second episode, which is quite good as well.===Story===Since this is only two episodes long you can't expect anything complicated. It's a simple story about a girl who meets a boy. An unexpected encounter which starts off everything, and a misunderstanding as well to create some drama. It's a rather light and sweet story. Considering the fact that they had only two episodes I think that it was done quite well, with a good conclusion.===Characters===This is a section on which I won't be able to comment too much since I don't know what the characters were like in the original Di Gi Charat. Overall they were good. Though this special lacks characters, but what would you expect from a two minute special? We barely get to know the names of four characters, and the rest is there just for comic relief. Overall the characters are good, and some are cute as well, like Puchiko. :)===Enjoyment===I enjoyed watching this, since it was nice to take a break from all the other serious anime around which fills my mind with questions and useless answers, and also had a laugh over some light comedy which fits in well. However don't watch this if you want to see something serious. Watch this if you want to take a break and need something light, then you'll see the hidden beauty of this... or doesn't annoy the person watching it.

Anyway, I'm very glad that I did. If you don't want to read the whole review, the bottom line is this anime is very much worth watching, regardless of its score, and also that you don't need to see the main series to enjoy this special, as I saw this first. I've seen better scored animes which I didn't enjoy quite as much, so take that with a grain of salt, not to mention this review.Story:The...story is a typical anime romance scenario, except the beauty of this special is that they manage to fit so much action into two episodes and make it work extremely well and make you wish it were longer (at least in my case). But the story doesn't really leave anything unanswered, so if you're a perfectionist like me that has to have closure on everything, you won't be disappointed.Art:Well, what can I say, really? It's Japanese animation and it's quality. some of the scenes seem to be low detail in the distance but it's the style of the anime and it works well. I didn't find any part of it to be really lacking. The colours are bright and easy on the eyes, and everything looks very nice.Sound:Well, there's not a whole lot of songs to the anime, being short, but what it does have is superb. This is the quality of Winter Garden that made me want to watch it, which is surprising because I tend to go for anime for the story, but that's okay. The sound is very good.Character:Well, there aren't many characters, but they are introduced quickly and everything develops nicely and you never really forget any character's name because they are all important in this anime, there are hardly any &quot;minor&quot; characters. This is another thing I love about this special.Enjoyment:The plot in this anime is very well constructed and keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end (or at least it did for me). For only 2 episodes, you get plenty of bang for your viewing buck (please excuse the overused idiom, I couldn't find anything much better to use here). But I really did enjoy this anime. It is one of the best ones I have seen despite being short and is worth watching.Overall:If you haven't seen this yet, I would highly recommend doing so sometime. You probably won't feel like you wasted your time, and with only 2 episodes, you're not risking much anyway. I would recommend this anime to anyone who likes romance-driven plot and interesting characters. story is a typical anime romance scenario, except the beauty of this special is that they manage to fit so much action into two episodes and make it work extremely well and make you wish it were longer (at least in my case).

Dejiko is no longer the cute, temperamental, sassy protagonist everyone grew to love. This series portrayed her as a cookie-cutter anime girl: Complacent, shy, easily embarrassed, who spends her days doing little more than hoping the guy she likes will notice her...nothing like her original personality at all.The plot was dull and uneventful. The art was lackluster compared the the original; even the colors were a lot duller.  I really don't understand why this was created, and I kind of wish it hadn't been. "", ""I have absolutely no idea why does this even exist. It has barely anything to do with Di Gi Charat universe. It's not bad, but I think this should have been own anime in itself. But I guess nobody would care about it in that case.The story is incredibly average at best and very predictable. Yet, the pace is really good and it's pretty interesting how many things they were able to squeeze into two 24 minutes long episodes. And while I knew how the story would end, I will admit that I was at the edge of my seat at the end, which definitely...delivered.When it comes to the characters - Dejiko was stripped of any personality she previously had and became a very flat character. It's hard to imagine that such a temperamental, assertive and over all not-to-be-screwed-with girl would turn into such a shy girl that only hopes that senpai will notice her. I am glad that at least Puchiko kept her sarcastic and sassy personality, which I loved. There is also a Rabi~en~Rose in few scenes, but she doesn't talk or interact with main characters in any way, but it was nice to see her.The art style is pretty cute, but veeery simple. It can't match the art style used in Di Gi Charat Nyo. Colors were not so vibrant and some things reminded me of original Di Gi Charat - especially the use of simple sketches in crowded scenes.So, nothing that special, really, I'm afraid. I am giving an extra point for absolutely amazing and catchy music, as is always the case with Di Gi Charat. And another extra point because I am currently in love, so it had a slightly bigger impact on me - reviews are subjective after all. delivered.When it comes to the characters - Dejiko was stripped of any personality she previously had and became a very flat character.

Unlike its parent story though, it holds very little similarities to it and could be viewed completely on its own.The only shared traits among Winter Garden and Di Gi Charat are the character designs, names and a few references that reveal the link between them. From the setting and tone of the original series to the personalities of the characters, everything is changed.

For example 7th episode which is dedicated for Kaede shows events unfold in the last couple episodes of the original which you will see again and again for every episode after that, only shown from the eyes of the other characters.Another problem comes from squeezing 24 episodes into 10 episode (maybe even less time considering important events that are concerning more than 1 character is shown couple of times) which is a huge hit to character and story development.

The only episode worth watching is episode 12 since it is actually a 100% original content/ new epside and that should have been released as a ova  or as episode 25 with a english dubbed box set with the first series. So I actually enjoyed episode 12.   Recaps irritate me more than anything because all they do is just chop of clips from various episodes and paste them together. Its like somehow they are trying to trick you into thinking that you are actually watching...a new episode and when you watch it is nothing more than extreme disappointment because you were expecting something new,  but instead you get reruns. One recap would have been tolerable but not 11 recap episodes for a previous series that only has 24 episodes. a new episode and when you watch it is nothing more than extreme disappointment because you were expecting something new,  but instead you get reruns.

The only new things happened in the 12th episode. Every other episode were copied from the ''first'' season. "", ""Story:As many other reviewers have said, Shuffle Memories is pretty much a review of the Shuffle series. Thus, it's missing some vital information about some of the few events as Shuffle Memories.For example, [spoiler]the date between Asa and Rin was preplanned. Rin was determined to only follow Itsuki's plan, making him not enjoy himself. And Asa scolded him for it. This was not included in the Shuffle Memories[/spoiler]Moreover, the story is told fuller in the Shuffle series.The thing is the series' scenes become quite redundant because they show a summary of the story in each of the character's point of view.Art:I'd...give a nine for Shuffle's art. But since the art was not its own and was taken right out of the original series, I'd give it a 7. The only original thing was the art of the opening and ending themesSound: Frankly, since many of the parts have been cut and paste to create this series, many of the songs were not connected. However, since most of the time, the BGM was absent, I cannot criticize for its performances. Other than that, the opening and ending themes were okay.

The only saving grace of Memories is the final episode, which is completely unique and is another story. Honestly, they could have just done the final episode as an OVA and just be done with it instead of teasing the viewer into believing they were getting another season of Shuffle.

SmaSTATION-3 SMAnime,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9421/SmaSTATION-3_SMAnime,"['This going to be a very short review because there isn\'t too much to say about this collection of shorts. SMAnime are three shorts about as long as an anime OP. They were directed by Takeshi Koike of Redline fame and they\'re meant to be advertising a concert. I couldn\'t tell you what kind of concert it was from the shorts because the seem so far removed from it and there were no subtitles. As for the shorts themselves they\'re freaking awesome. I wouldn\'t want to spoil the contents of the shorts but what I can say is that they are opulently animated absurdity. Koike...as an animator is known to be a bit ""extra""  by exaggerating proportionality and depth of field as well as cramming what feels like ten thousand frames and detailed character designs in his cuts. So it\'s more Koike goodness, hence why I\'m rating it so highly: the art and animation stand out on their own. So who is this for? I guess if you wanna deep dive into his career, then this is an interesting stop. If you like cool animation, this is for you as well. Otherwise you\'re not really missing out. But if this piqued your curiosity, its not a bad way to spend about 5 minutes.

Sonic: Night of the WereHog,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5583/Sonic__Night_of_the_WereHog,"[""Slipping under the radar of a lot of fans out their, &quot;Sonic: Night of the WereHog&quot; is basically a promotional video made for the newest video game, where Sonic changes into a werewolf at night by one glimpse of a full moon. And you know what? This thing has potential at being a great series someday!Story: 6/10Sadly this was the weakest part of the show. Basically we have two kids wandering into a haunted house, after which they are scared by two ghost who are taking pictures of any passers by who happen to come a callin. All the while making sure they get to...capture them when they are in their most terrified look, only to take it for their female love interest ghost which seems to have a weird fetish for it. Sonic happens to make his way into the mysterious house later on, and it all plays out as them simply trying to take his picture while scared, which I must say just doesn't seem to be that interesting. We never even learn just why Sonic is even there to begin with, nor how he can even change into a werewolf. (unless you have played the game that is) What makes the story really bland is the fact that nobody on this title ever says one word, it would have been a bit more entertaining had they added some actual dialog to the mix. We do get some good action scenes when Sonic transforms into his werewolf stage though, the camera does these sorta slow motion effects once in a while when one of them lands a blow, which are pretty cool and stylized. The story is okay for the short 11 minutes, I just personally felt they could have done more with it.Artwork: 10/10Oh my gosh its just gorgeous, everything is pain stakingly detailed; from each floor board in the house, to Sonic's fur when he is in werewolf form, to the realistic rain in the background! The animation is also stunning, each character moves with great fluidity and make neat facial expressions, you can just tell that the animators went all out on this one. There were times that I actual paused the video, just to soak in all the wonderful art and detail that went into every CG pixel!Soundtrack: 7/10The background music (sorry, but there is no opening or closing theme) is just great, it really sets the spooky mood for the title. It ranges from these eerie style haunting drowns, to a pretty ear pleasing jazz style beat that has both a calm or fast pace beat to it, depending on what is going on. The thunder sound effects are also well done, and seem to strike at the appropriate time. There is one problem to the sound though as I mentioned earlier..........nobody talks!!! While I did hear Sonic say &quot;Oops&quot; once, other than that its just a bunch of mumbling by the characters. Which depending on your taste, you may find to be a killjoy. Though the antics of the characters are enough to where you don't feel lost at what they are trying to tell you. As they make more facial and hand movements to where you probably will get the general idea. Still, this title should have had dialog!Characters: 7/10Sadly the biggest problem with this is, we only get Sonic of the main characters. All the supporting cast are is ghosts and this funny little creature that follows Sonic around. I would love to have seen some of Sonic's pals from the video game go in with him. While Sonic doesn't really retain his sort of &quot;attitude&quot; that you get in other incarnations of this character, he does do well to retain his overall personality, at least as much as you can get from no verbal talking. The ghosts I found to be pretty funny and entertaining, most of the time they get these goofy looks on their faces whenever they don't succeed in capturing Sonic's image, or when they are scared themselves! Overall, the characters do come off as silly yet entertaining.Bottom Line: 7/10This title really does show great promise, while the overall concept of the story might fly over the heads of people who haven't had a chance to play the game yet, or perhaps the lack of conversation by the characters might bore some. Its an overall nicely made short, I feel that if Sega (the company that made Sonic) actually made a series out of this, it would grow to be quite popular with anime and non-anime fans alike.

The look and the expressions of the characters are nice and the reactions to  cartoony, which really helps making some of these really funny to watch.

At one point Sonic and Chip visit the house and the duo once again have an opportunity to impress their love interest.  The ghosts manage to take a few photos of the scared Chip much to the girl ghost's delight, until she...notices Sonic's face on the picture and throws a tantrum, I assume because on said shots he's not showing fear of any sort.The duo then make their mission to try and scare Sonic to have his picture taken, but then he turns into the Werehog to fend them off, having their own pictures taken instead.  This in turn sends the girl ghost into a fit of laughter that looks more like she's having an epilectic seizure, to which the male ghosts then decide to unite forces and turn into a menacing spectre to fight Sonic out of retribution for having their pride dishonored.  What transpires can be depicted as a very shoddy fight scene, filled with slow-downs and unnerving camera shaking, the likes you would most likely experience in current Sonic games in fact.

On the post credits scene we see Chip tied up to a chair struggling to set himself free as the two remaining ghosts watch Sonic and the transformed ghost girl walk off in despair through a window.The first thing that bothered me was the fact that this animation seems to come out of nowhere and out of the blue, being that it doesn't seem to be adapted from Sonic Unleashed itself so I am not sure where Sega intended to go with this in the first place.  I agree that it is a random short and the story would not really matter as with other animated shorts of any kind done before, but if there is no connection between the scenario and characters introduced with said videogame world then it leaves watchers a bit confused as to what exactly this has to do with everything overall, this includes the fact that Sonic and Chip simply stumble into the mansion with no reason in the least. While the lack of spoken words seem ideal, it would had help if there was dialogue including Sonic's reason to enter said mansion in the first place.The animation can be nice but blurry at times, some movements seem awfully awkward, as with Chip when he gives Sonic tips on dealing with the ghosts and the ghost girl having a giggling fit for instance.  The ghost girl is awfully cute, and probably the best designed character of all, but her affections towards Sonic seems trivial at best.  Another aspect of the animation is the fact Sonic remains as a Werehog even during sunlight, when he and the ghost girl posing as Chip leave the mansion.

Sure why not give it a try but don't go in it with high expectations... really it's just a promotional video which fits the energy of those cutsences and clips from the game itself especially when it comes to comedy and entertainment.So overall for me because I'm a Sonic fan since my childhood to this day and also think Sonic Unleashed is one of the best Sonic games out there this rates for me as:overall:7/10"", ""Well, I sure wasn't expecting this on MAL, but I ain't complaining. It's just more Sonic content, so that's a W in my book.The story isn't anything special, just a fun little story for a short.The art (or animation in this case) is outstanding, very much like the cutscenes in Sonic Unleashed, It is very well done, and the style the credits used is also great.The sounds are very well done, and it's pretty neat how it doesn't have characters talking, rather making noises to convey what they are feeling.The characters are pretty good! Sonic and Chip were nice to watch, the antagonists are also...pretty funny.Overall, I enjoyed this a lot. It's also very short, so you can check it out and add something to your list in less than 20 minutes. I am still surprised it got on My Anime List though. pretty funny.Overall, I enjoyed this a lot.

Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki 4th Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31861/Tenchi_Muyou_Ryououki_4th_Season,"['Of all the negative things I can say about OVA3, and I can say a lot, boring and dull is not one of them.This is not something i can say about OVA4.Animation:Where is it? The animation and art work is bare bones, everyone basically just stands around talking about nothing. This is a far cry from the amazing cel work done in OVA 1 and OVA 2.Story:...Man, my favorite part of Tenchi Muyo, the part that truly brought me into this show all those years ago, is where they all stand around talking about characters from other shows and spin offs.I remember, back in OVA 1, being absolutely riveted as everyone sat around a table talking about silk. Or or! I remember that part in OVA season 2, where they spent a whole episode around a table, talking about characters from other shows! Oh man, i just loved it in OVA 1 where instead of fighting Kagato, they sat around a table and talked. Or that part in OVA2 where they dealt with Dr. Clay, by sitting around a table talking. I just loved when they talked about Zero, but never actually showed her. Oh and how could i forget that episode in OVA 3 where a bunch of characters i have never seen all sat around a table talking about who will get married next.Oh! My absolute favorite part was in OVA2 where half of a episode was spent around a table advertising a show that came out 7 years prior? Man i just loved that part.When I watch Tenchi Muyo, I want to watch Tenchi Muyo. I want to see the antics of Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, Washu, Sasami and Ryo-ohki. Not characters from GXP, and not characters from Gemini. For example, none of the original characters even show up in OVA2 until past the 10 minute mark. As some one who has no interest in GXP or Gemini, i had just about no clue who any of these people are. And even worse they don\'t even show who all they are talking about, so i hope you have all their names memorized!.Episode 1:~ Scene: Everyone is sitting at a table ~""Hey hows is Character X from GXP?"" ""Oh he is doing good""""Hey how is Character Y from Gemini doing?"" ""Not to bad""""Hey hey, you remember  Character Z from GXP?"" ""Oh yeah, i heard he is still in space""Repeat until end credits.Oh and now Tenchi has yet another sister who wants in his bed right from the get go.Music:What music? There is a opening and ending song, and that about it. Background music is nearly non-existent.This is not my Tenchi Muyo Ryo-ohki.You could have removed all of the original characters: Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Ryo-ohki, Washu and Mihoshi from this show and it would not have made one difference at all. I mean, its not like they had any screen time here anyways.

I mean, its not like they had any screen time here anyways.', 'BIG ADVISE FIRST!!! Before watching this season of Tenchi Muyou you have to watch the S3 of this one (duh!), Tenchi Muyo! GXP  and Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari. This season ties the 3 of them, in my case, I haven\'t watched GPX and it hurt my enjoyment a bit.Second, my view on this 4 seasons of the show, the first season was a solid and enjoyable entry that I really recommend for anyone that likes cute girls, harem and an actual story. Second season is a bit worse than the first one but it\'s decent too. Third and Fourth are a bit disappointing.The problem...with this show is that it feels stale, there is no progression and the plot becomes less important with every season. The lack of focus in the characters also hurt the harem part and in the last 2 seasons I doubt if you could even call this show a harem because of the lack of romance... and ecchi. This show becomes kinda like a SoL with no focus on the characters, and to shake up the things a bit the keep adding and discarding characters without developing anything.In terms of animation, the first one has the best one (and it\'s actually good compared to most of todays shows) and it really made the story more enjoyable. Seasons 2 animation was kinda weak and in s3 and 4 it was fine.Art, it improves with every season imo.Music, forgettable.Overrall, a decent franchise that deserves to be checked out, but the last 2 seasons of the main series are a bit disappointing... but they never reached the point of being ""bad"".I decided to made my review in the season because I think that the advise is the most important part of the review, lol. with this show is that it feels stale, there is no progression and the plot becomes less important with every season.

It is awful. I certainly don't recommend to watch. You waste your time. You don't really make any sense of what's happening.If you already seen the 3rd season. You don't need to watch the 4th season at all, because most of the plot is reused from season 3.The whole plot of this series is literally about alternate Tenchi Muyou universes series characters while reusing plot from the original trilogy. This is not Tenchi Muyou Ryououki anymore. The main characters barely exist in this series. The only thing that exists is maybe the Tenchi residence.The way they...do it is by cutting everything the show had good in it, starting with the main characters, with the art itself, and by literally throwing dialogue as a main plot device, to introduce a new main character in the place of Tenchi. The original characters have little to nothing to do with this show, while there are introduced up to 20 characters per episode.The art was wholly digital, and the old Tenchi drawing style was redone into a new one. Most of the characters where copy paste with few alters. Colors were poor. Very few shades were used. Contours, what are those. The backgrounds where redone as well and because of that we won't be seeing but few residences, most of the time - Tenchi's.Sound was obviously poor. I am ashamed to hear this. The intro and the outro changed the whole tonality of the show. They don't have anything to do with it really.The story is awful. There is nothing but too much dialogue with little to nothing about anything that really matters in this series which is hard to follow and make sense of it. do it is by cutting everything the show had good in it, starting with the main characters, with the art itself, and by literally throwing dialogue as a main plot device, to introduce a new main character in the place of Tenchi.

Then they switched to specific seasons spoofing the hell out of themselves and the voice cast mercilessly parodying their own character. This special also focuses on self-parody, taking Accelerator\'s ""villain"" persona to some absolutely hilarious places. It\'s arguably the most fun thing about the whole Accelerator spin-off, besides some Last Order and Misaka clone scenes, and I didn\'t exactly hate the whole show, just found...it very inconsistent...Hard to say much more about something this tiny, but I had a few very good laughs from it, so that\'s worth something. it very inconsistent...Hard to say much more about something this tiny, but I had a few very good laughs from it, so that\'s worth something.']"
Transformers: Car Robots,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2284/Transformers__Car_Robots,"[""The Transformers saga \x96 thirty years of a war between shapeshifting alien robots, the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons \x96 has had many iterations in its history. It's gone from a fun adventurous cartoon in the 1980s, to a live-action series of brutal war films. This particular show is perhaps the most little-known chapter of the whole saga, but is able to stand on its own as an enjoyable work in its own right.This show was one of the first Japanese TF shows to be brought over to the US; it was part of the anime boom that occurred in the 1990s and 2000s.... It features all the trademarks of the anime genre: power- ups, a rival to the hero, a ton of goofy comedy from both the heroes and villains, and gradual escalation into a climactic final battle. However, these trademarks are scripted fairly well and generally provide maximum entertainment, and the characters acquire enough screen time and development to stand out as basic but distinct. Two of the most memorable characters in the show are the evil clone Scourge and the bumbling henchman Sky-Byte; one is a legitimately menacing threat to all around him, and the other is a lovable oaf that endears himself with his comic antics.However, because the show is basic anime it can come off as predictable and dull, and also Transformers (which is basically robots beating up each other) is an acquired taste that only a specific group of people (generally fans who grew up with the TF cartoons/toys) can enjoy. Still, if you are able to overlook these issues, you will be able to greatly enjoy yourself with this show.All In all, this was a truly underrated part of Transformers, and one that deserves more love. .

Tokkou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/916/Tokkou,"[""Wow... I must tell you before you read this review that it has been awhile since I watched Tokko.I really do not think this anime has gotten enough love. It was actually a VERY great anime with a great story. Even though, it made me very upset that they ended it with pretty much... no ending. It was kind of just... over.This anime... is not for little kids. Very bloody and a lot of swearing, but that was one of the reasons I liked it so much!STORY: I think that this anime had an amazing story. I mean, sure it's kinda getting old, the whole,...&quot;My family died in this major massacre/accident and only I survived...&quot;. But, looking past that, the way Ranmaru deals with it and wants to right the wrongs is very inspiring. This is a story of... killing demons pretty much. But the creators of this anime made it more interesting than that. Because there are so many stories like this one, they had to do something to make it stand out from the rest. I think that the characters make this story. I'll get to that later, though.ART: It's true... the main reason why people have not watched Tokko is not because the story is not amazing, but it's just because the artwork is not &quot;blow me away&quot; incredible. It's just... decent. The drawings have that kind of rugged look to them, which suits it well for a horror/slasher anime.SOUND: The OP theme is TO DIE FOR! I totally adore it. It even put it on my I-pod. But don't listen too many times, or it gets stuck in your head forever... mwahaha! Throughout the anime, the sound is just... eh. Not too amazing. They do some cool background music I guess, but nothing that really makes you get into the story.CHARACTER: This is where I belive Tokko excells. At least, with the main characters. Ranmaru Shindo is probably one of the coolest anime characters ever made in my eyes. He's hot, he's a policeman, and he has special powers that he doesn't even know about. Plus, he's got that traumatic past thing going for him. :) I dig that. It took me a few episodes to start liking the main female character, Sakura. First of all... the name Sakura is so over-used. But looking past that, she really turned out to be a great character and played a very important part in the story. Without her, Ronmaru would not have been as amazing. They were a great pair :) A few of the lesser characters (the male ones) where also great, but I'm not gonna spoil it for you. Sadly, the lesser female characters were semi annoying. Especially Ronmaru's younger sister Saya. But, she was important to the story and she made for some good laughs along the way.ENJOYMENT: VERY enjoyable anime. I mean, who doesn't like hot men and women running around fighting monsters and cutting them up and swearing all the time? Cause I know that I like that sort of thing. There were some intense and emotional moments. Not very many laughs, but a couple popped out along the way. :)Please tell people about this anime. It really needs more love.

It was incredible!"", 'Overview:When you hear the word ""anime"" what pops into your mind? Do you think of the beautiful movies of Hayao Miyazaki? Do you think of generic shonen series like Dragonball Z, Naruto, or Bleach? Perhaps you think of the artistic and Avant Garde works of Satoshi Kon or Masaaki Yuasa? For someone like me who was born in the late 1980s and grew up in the 1990s watching the anime available on American TV, I first think of highly formulaic action series with clear character archetypes, mediocre animation, and attempts to use pointless gore and nudity to make themselves edgier than the animation of...other countries. Tokko aired on 2 separate channels in the US: Syfy and Chiller. It is the very epitome of mediocrity. It perhaps above all other series I can think of perfectly represents what my generation thought of ""anime"" at the time.Plot and characters: 4/10Spoilers!!! (Not that anyone reading this would care)Tokko begins with a group of teens fighting demons that attacked them years ago and now those demons wish to finish the job. The teens all have special brands on their bodies that help the demons hunt them down. This plot point was completely stolen from Berserk, but I digress. Our teenage heroes slay the demons with magical swords and many times the action and plot heavily resembles that of Bleach. Although actually Tokko came out the year before Bleach. The demons that are causing trouble in the human world all came through a portal opened by mad alchemists seeking immortality. In order to seal the portal, the powerful 108 demons (Hindu/Buddhist reference) must be defeated and their shards reclaimed. With 108 main enemies to defeat, you would think that this series would drag on for years. Although that was indeed the writer\'s original intent, the series was dropped after 1 season and ended forever on a complete cliffhanger. A brief Radio Drama came out only in Japan that was supposed to wrap up the plot, but even that didn\'t work out! The characters are all the exact types you have seen again and again! I have said before that this is one of the most generic anime you will ever see, and I REALLY mean that.Art and Music: 5/10The opening ""Sunny Day"" is very generic J-pop tune representative of the time. The OST is completely forgettable. It isn\'t bad, but it isn\'t good either. The animation was considered mediocre then and would probably seem a bit dated to young viewers today. The people on Syfy channel really thought this anime would sell because it had some tits and blood, but no one really paid attention. This anime quickly vanished from the public mind and plunged into the deepest obscurity.Overall: 5/10Tokko is not a good show, neither is it a particularly bad show. It is an extremely generic action anime of the late 1990s/early 2000s. It is the exact kind of anime that me and my peers grew up watching on American TV at this time. If any of my fellow ""oldtaku"" want a blast from the past, they should watch an episode of Tokko and have a laugh. If younger readers of this review want to see what watching anime was like in the old days when all the anime we saw was either on TV or at the local video store, then check out an episode. This was the kind of stuff we watched, because the total quantity of anime available to us was low and the quality was also fairly low. We usually were much less cynical and jaded than today\'s otaku. We didn\'t attack series for lack of realism as if everything NEEDED to be a Chekhov play(or Ping Pong). We didn\'t freak out that visual quality wasn\'t 1080p. If something didn\'t absolutely SUCK ASS, like the shit Central Park Media always dumped on us, we were God damn happy! That is why we watched shit like Tokko and were content with it. Before you young ones judge us, try and put yourselves in our shoes and imagine what it was like. other countries.

(I have finished this anime before reviewing) It's like marmite / veggie mite lol You love it or hate it.StoryWhile watching this I was always wondering what was going to happen next, have seen alot of horrors / slash 'em up movies and anime, I wasn't entirely sure what was going to happen through this. There was various suprising moments through-out the entire anime. The idea of demons trying to kill humans isn't as simple as it goes, that is just the impression you get at the start...but there's a little more to it than that. Alchemists summoned the demons for certain reasons (I'll try not to give anything away to spoil the plot) Anyway theres a few twists and turns there was alot i didn't expect to happen that did. Yes, it could have been better, the ending was a little rapid and maybe it should've been 14 episodes, but this is the reason i don't make 10 out of 10 and only 8. It felt somewhat slightly rushed on the last episode, but I still enjoyed it.ArtThe art was somewhat different to other anime, it could be related to elfen lied in some ways, but in others it's nothing like it. The blood and gore was well drawn as was some of the characters, it was simple in alot of places yet effective but nothing special, so although I really like this anime I will have to mark this as just a 7.SoundsI don't know how anyone can say there was no ambience in this...it was full of it. I guess if you're not enjoying the anime you won't pay attention to little things like this. There wasn't a whole lot of BGM but the OP was nice and the EP was not too bad. Remember this section is about SOUND not just MUSIC though. The sound went well with the series although maybe they could've added a LITTLE bit more music. The sound of death, gore spilling, OP, EP, music in some places, ambience reverb effects, this HAS sound, just not a great deal of music or if there was I didn't notice too much of it. But what i heard was nice...7 out of 10.CharactersI remember reading before about character's having limited emotions. But I think people forget one thing...from what happened in the story the characters was trying to make themself strong I don't think they would show much emotion after having been traumatised from the event that happened. I think people expect too much in certain circumstances instead of thinking about how they would really act in certain situations. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10 because the characters represented themselves well and I really don't think I'd act any different given the same situation, I think it would be hard to show anymore on character development because you had someone who rarely talked, to having convosations because of how someone effected her. If you really take a step back and look at this, theres alot to the majority of the characters.EnjoymentI may watch this again...I think I probabaly will. It was nice to watch, it was entertaining, blood gore, character development, not to the extent of elfen lied but it was good! 7 out of 10! but there's a little more to it than that.

Remember this section is about SOUND not just MUSIC though. The sound went well with the series although maybe they could've added a LITTLE bit more music. The sound of death, gore spilling, OP, EP, music in some places, ambience reverb effects, this HAS sound, just not a great deal of music or if there was I didn't notice too much of it. But what i heard was nice...7 out of 10.CharactersI remember reading before about character's having limited emotions. But I think people forget one thing...from what happened in the story the characters was trying to make themself strong I don't think they would show much emotion after having been traumatised from the event that happened. I think people expect too much in certain circumstances instead of thinking about how they would really act in certain situations. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10 because the characters represented themselves well and I really don't think I'd act any different given the same situation, I think it would be hard to show anymore on character development because you had someone who rarely talked, to having convosations because of how someone effected her. If you really take a step back and look at this, theres alot to the majority of the characters.EnjoymentI may watch this again...I think I probabaly will. It was nice to watch, it was entertaining, blood gore, character development, not to the extent of elfen lied but it was good! 7 out of 10!"", ""Dreadful, boring, plot goes absolutely nowhere...Man, FUCK this show!Tokko is an anime that seemed to have a lot going for it, at first at least. Too bad Tokko was too busy fucking itself. Truthfully, I was not able to finish the entire series; I only watched 8 out of the 13 episodes. Honestly I do not even care to finish the rest of the show, even if Tokko happens to have an amazing ending, which I highly doubt. I bet the ending sucks as much bullshit as what I saw. The 8 episodes I watched sucked dirty asshole and wasted my time.Story:The premise may sound...interesting, but trust me, the story sucks. It was one of the most boring and dull experiences I have had watching an anime show. At times I kept hoping that something would eventually happen; yet nothing does. It was a huge disappointment and letdown of something that had potential.Characters:The biggest problem I have with this show is the main character, Shindo Ranmaru. He has a pretty interesting character design and personality. But that is all wasted, cause he doesn't do jack shit the entire time I watched this show. The main character doesn't get any stronger or anything, which really bugged me, because Tokko has a shonen feel to it, like Bleach. What a shame.The monsters are all generic and are a completely uninspired mess.Overall:This show could have been good if something actually happened. The show has to much suspense, like something big is going to happen later in the show. Yet there is only 13 fucking episodes and before I knew it I was already on episode 8 and nothing cool happened. I was pissed off.

Though it lacks anything spectacular or unique with its plot, setting, or characters, Tokko is for the most part a good action series with good action scenes, and is able to hold the viewer in with its deepening mystery and conspiracy behind the secret organization Tokko and the evils it fights. Another thing it has going with it is, yes, fanservice - some may complain it's overboard but I think it's actually handled rather well. However, once again, the series is ultimately ruined by its short length and obviously rushed conclusion - it's...such a shame they couldn't continue it for as long as they hoped.Story: 3 (Poor)Don't get me wrong, the story behind Tokko is excellent - and, as much of a paradox as it may seem, that's precisely why its rated so low. Tokko's plot revolves around Ranmaru, a recent graduate of the Tokyo police academy who is accepted into a special operations branch; he spends much of his time trying to investigate a mysterious, paranormal event that occurred in the apartment complex he lived in as a child which left his parents dead. Soon after joining the police force, however, he begins to encounter strange monsters which inhabit people's bodies and induces as demonic, zombie-like state. When bullets prove ineffective, a mysterious and secret branch of the police known only as Tokko steps in and cuts the demons down. Ranmaru starts investigating Tokko at the behest of his boss, which attracts their attention. They discover that Ranmaru possesses powers which may prove helpful towards fighting the demons, and Ranmaru discovers that these demons may be links to his parents' deaths.Unfortunately, all of the binding plot points and intrigue that comes with a compelling, mystery-laden story like this comes for naught. The story comes to an abrupt end at episode 13 as it is cleared that this series was not renewed for what should've been a well-deserved second season, and the only conclusion we get is a trite epilogue over the end credits of the final episode that leaves the viewer feeling cheated. It is for this reason that the story ends up being rated so low; there's no point investing any time or emotion for a story that builds up to a blank conclusion.Art - 7 (Good)The art is at least decent and on par with other popular works, the special effects help carry the story along, and at least the ladies are very sexily drawn :)Sound - 7 (Good)The sound quality is good, and the music pretty ok save for the OP, whose only saving grace is that TVs come with mute buttons now.Characters - 7 (Good)Tokko comes with some pretty interesting characters - Ranmaru himself is pretty interesting: devoted towards the care of his sister who also is a recent recruit into the police force; towards the investigation of who's responsible for his parents' murder and discovering the truth behind the Tokko organization and discovering the true meaning behind the dreams he's been having. The show's supporting cast is diverse, along with Ranmaru's boss who provides a combination of comedic relief and a level of GAR that sometimes approaches Kamina's, or at least Bruce Campbell's, taking down a horde of zombies with a freakin' machine gun! The female cast is pretty interesting as well; they heap on the fanservice yet are very well developed and motivated.Enjoyment - 8 (Very Good)For the short while it lasts, Tokko is a very enjoyable series with the right amount of action mixed in with the right amount of mystery and intrigue. People will be glued to the series wanting to discover whether or not Ranmaru will avenge his parents, if Tokko will stop the &quot;Big Bad&quot; from accomplishing his demonic goals, and just how deep and twisted does this ancient demonic conspiracy run. This enjoyment, however, is ruined when most of these questions are given rushed answers, or none at all.Overall - 6 (Fair)Overall, Tokko is an excellent series which unfortunately got cheated from a proper ending, and this will effect the viewer's enjoyment in turn, as much of the enjoyment comes from the deepening conspiracies which revolve around the forces Tokko fights against. Unfortunately, these conspiracies come to rushed conclusions, and the final show-down between Ranmaru and the evils Tokko fights barely happens at all.

Anit-climatic indeed."", ""Based on the manga of the same name which was written by Tohru Fujisawa and directed by Masashi Abe. Tokko is an action anime that dabbles in the supernatural and Japanese mysticism. It involves a group of supernatural detectives taking on supernatural threats, in this case it's some type of zombie like creatures possessed by demons whom devour the living. Many naysayers hit on the unoriginal feel of the series, yet I can outright ignore just how derivative the story is, because the real problems are stale characters, unnecessary filler, bad story progression, poor interactions, plus a rushed and unfinished ending. This is more than...enough to bury any title 40,000 leagues under the sea.I honestly do not watch anime for the sake of complaining but there is so much about Tokko to complain about. The characters are a real problem beginning at the top. The main character Ranmaru and his sister Saya have a relationship that can only be described as disturbingly creepy, while the rest are bland stereotypes meant to fill up roles. There's only one character by the name of Chief Kunikida who is funny as hell (English dub), and I doubt he was meant to be the real comedy relief.The plot follows Ranmaru as he becomes intrigued by these monsters they face and he eventually meets the girl in his dreams, the sword wielding Sakura, and her team equipped to deal with this threat called Tokko. It appears that they are the only one's capable of killing these monsters. He learns a lot about them, plus the main threat which has a whole lot to do with him and the tragedy they all experienced that changed their lives.Tokko drags its feet revealing smaller parts to the mystery, and the pacing is bad as it jams in more moments of Saya and the weak cast. I found no one in this worth attaching too. Ranmaru is the typical shonen guy that acts as if he's afraid of women, gets in danger, all that good stuff. The characters are so weak and can't carry the plot leaving only its story to try and save things which had plenty of potential. There's another organization to battle the creatures, other warriors of Tokko's type with one couple actually doing something weird to the monsters after they kill them. Unfortunately, a lot of this stuff goes nowhere and it's even more frustrating that the episodes contain more filler than substance. It also does a terrible job at foreshadowing; it's too obvious what's going to happen and who could be working something behind the scenes.Even the production values are quite mixed; the action department consists of the quick swipes and falling body parts which gets old really quick, yet there are some nice moments of some brutal gore. The bullet holes to the face and eyes looks pretty cool, with monsters being outright obliterated into pieces along with blades through the head. It's a shame that the viewer isn't treated to a lot more of that.The backgrounds of buildings, trees, and hazy flashbacks make good use of the visuals, yet still character backgrounds and CG background vehicles look awkward. I'll give credit to the creepy monster designs though; those baby-face looking, parasitic maggots, are something that will stick with you. Whenever I think of this anime those sick looking things come to mind. They are definitely the highlight in terms of designs. The J-pop soundtrack is just there, but the series BGM does have its moments where it tries to work with its horror-like atmosphere using static background music which works well in the hazy, choppy like flashbacks and visions.In the end though, Tokko crumbles underneath everything it wants to do. I saw a professional review once stating that this anime is an unrelenting blood bath, and it's one of the most violent series ever created. Do not buy into this; the violence is pretty average when considering how violent this genre has been for awhile. In addition, it spins its wheels with not much happening until around half way, plus the ending is a serious jip. The only people I can see falling for this are the very easy to please. If you do not fall into that group then I recommend other dark action titles such as Speed Grapher, Basilisk, or Berserk. I agree that Berserk has a jury-rigged ending, but at least everything before the ending is very gripping and leaves a damn good impression. Tokko is simply boring and forgettable.Highs: Decent production valuesLows: Lots of missed potential, undeveloped story elements, unfinished enough to bury any title 40,000 leagues under the sea.I honestly do not watch anime for the sake of complaining but there is so much about Tokko to complain about.

"", 'TokkôTotal score: 2/5I had high hopes before watching Tokkô, I really did. I was expecting, hoping for, looking for something dark. I wanted an anime rich in horror, blood, violence. I was looking for scenes bathed in the blood of unjust enemies who committed horrendous crimes. I wanted to be kept uncertain as to whether or not someone would be left alive at the end. I wanted uncertainty as to the fates of everyone involved.I got none of that from Tokkô.I have only watched this show once, so I\'m the first to admit the possibility that my disappointment stems from setting my expectations too...high. I had just watched Hellsing Ultimate and wanted more of something in that vein of violence, treachery, and uncertainty. Tokkô did not give me that.Instead, it left me feeling confused, rushed, off-kilter. There were frequent pauses, full of discussions of ""Wait, what? Did we miss something?"". There were far too many instances of half-tilted heads and squinted gazes as we struggled to make sense of the uncertain and contradictory storyline being presented to us.SoundOverall Score: 3/5In its defense, the soundtrack (barring two points which I will discuss at the end of this section) was excellent. The music fit flawlessly within the show\'s theme, and did an excellent job of providing an appropriate emotional tone for the scene at hand. The sound effects were also extremely well-done, complimenting both the music and the scene without being too prominent or overbearing.The overall sound quality was acceptable. I\'m not much of an audiophile, but I was never disappointed with, or blown away by, the overall quality of the sound itself. There was a good balance between the inherent volumes for the voice acting and the rest of the audio. I never struggled to hear the voice actors above the noise of any scene (I did watch the show in Japanese, with English subtitles), and if any rewinding was done, it was for my better half to listen carefully to the specific words used, in order to better understand the nuances being missed by the English subtitles.My biggest complaints with the music, however, lie within the opening and closing songs. The opening song was extremely upbeat and poppy, while the animations had the potential to be rather dark and foreboding. The song felt overly long and hugely at odds with the show itself. It wasn\'t quite in line with the show, and so watching it before each episode was slightly jarring. We eventually started fast-forwarding through the opening credits, largely because of the length.The closing credits were especially jarring, especially with the chosen background art. The tone of the music was light and airy, which was also extremely disconcerting. The background art chosen was a silhouette image of the male lead reaching out to take the hand of the female lead. Both were topless, for whatever reason, but the semi-nudity was yet another piece that came across as slightly off and not fitting with everything else. We choose to fast-forward because we felt off-balance by everything with the closing credits and simply wished them to be over as soon as possible.In total, the overall sound, while clear, didn\'t stand out either way and stayed middle-of-the-road in terms of quality. If the opening and closing songs had been better, or more suited to the show, my overall score for sounds would have been 4/5. As it sits, the perfection of the in-show music coupled with the sound effects does counteract the detractors that was the credit music.CharactersOverall score: 2/5I struggled with the way each characters were established early on and the ways they each grew.The biggest source of my complaint lies almost solely within the lead, Ranmaru Shindo. The show starts with him dreaming, and we everyday see a half-naked woman rescuing him with a sword. He wakes up to his half-naked sister, bouncing everywhere and essentially stating that she\'s doing it because he doesn\'t have a girlfriend. I don\'t have a problem with incest in anime because it\'s not real. What I found to be confusing about it was the way he dreamt about the half-naked woman.The character somehow moves away from the incest angle to suddenly Ranmaru becoming a perceived ladies man. We on the other side know differently, but the transition didn\'t make sense, when you go back to the first episode. I felt further disconnected when Ranmaru switched from being a perceived ladies man to having a woman presented as his soul mate. I will say this: I\'m an anime novice. Haven\'t watched much until recently. I\'m semi-familiar with character tropes in anime. I don\'t know if the switch from incest to ladies man to the man finding his soul mate and never leaving her side. If that IS a thing in anime, it was very poorly done.It felt, to me, like the writers weren\'t sure of Ranmaru\'s character and that he was being rewritten from episode to episode until they figured out who he was supposed to be. Now, this isn\'t genuine character growth I\'m talking about. This was an unfinished character, who was slowly being fleshed out throughout the show instead of having him grow. UNLESS I\'m wrong about how characters in anime transition from lusting after their younger sister\'s nether regions to standing by the woman of their literal dreams. If I\'m wrong, then great! That actually changes a huge part of the show for me, in a positive manner.Any other characters felt exactly like characters, in every sense of the word. They weren\'t people defined by their past and making choices based on that, they were characters making decisions the writers said they made. The one exception, the absolute best person was Kaoru Kunikida, Ranmaru\'s boss. Kunikida had motivations that drove him, he took stands, and unlike everyone else around him, he didn\'t allow his past to chain him, but instead used it to move forward. He grew. I can\'t say that about anyone else.Overall, the strength of Kunikida wasn\'t enough to effectively counteract the constantly rewritten Ranmaru and the lack of depth regarding everyone else. A story filled with characters isn\'t compelling, it isn\'t captivating. You are never presented with moments where you see genuine growth, just worn out scenarios where nothing ever changes.StoryOverall score: 2/5I found the story immensely frustrating. In a nutshell (POTENTIAL SPOILER WARNING; DON\'T READ PAST HERE): Ranmaru and his sister were orphaned because somehow everyone in his apartment complex was brutally slaughtered. He becomes a cop to hunt down the killer. It\'s revealed that the attack was because someone opened an alchemical box (I didn\'t write the story) and opened up a gateway to another dimension. This box has 108 pieces (I don\'t know why the weird number), and it cannot be closed until every piece is found. There is a group of people dedicated to finding said pieces to close the gateway because reasons (there are legitimate reasons, but I\'m trying to avoid spoilers and take as little time as possible).Here is my issue. The entire storyline felt like it was slowly being reworked. People were saying things that they shouldn\'t have known, things were being presented suddenly that contradicted something said earlier. The storyline as a whole felt clumsy, unfinished, poorly thought out. What was ESPECIALLY frustrating was the realization that the story had AMAZING potential, but was lost somewhere.The story felt like it was intended to run on for much longer, but was cancelled or ended prematurely. Honestly, I see why. The story takes eight episodes to go anywhere. The plot was unfinished, not fully formed from the beginning. I had a very strong feeling of ""Figure that part out later"" or even just adding something solely for the episode to make sense. That\'s bad writing. That\'s incredibly bad writing.I\'m struggling to fully express just how frustrating it was to watch the lack of progression from the story. The show shied away from actually getting into the action and just going off, and instead held itself back the entire time until the very end. The story dawdled, moseyed, and doddered about, avoiding it\'s true core: people kicking demon ass. And that\'s not even all of my problems. When you look at the actual storyline of the show, from beginning to end, it just falters from the beginning. So much of the first seven episodes could have been done in the first episode, freeing up the remaining episodes up to explore the world being presented to the viewer.We were not given that. We were given a lost show, confused about its characters, storyline, direction, ending. The show is short, only 13 episodes. It took eight to get going. It shouldn\'t.There are, in my mind, two ways to look at the show. Either it was intended to be 13 episodes, in which case the show was a an overly ambitious train wreck. You don\'t create some arbitrary number of enemies to kill, and then spend a full quarter of your show before you even show off how bad-ass the main character is. You just don\'t. That\'s terrible writing. OR the show was meant to be longer, but was cut short due to whatever reason and so they were forced to create SOME kind of ending that had any kind of logic. This makes more sense, because I refuse to consider the former a possibility.  I can see why the show failed to gain any interest. The storyline was poorly planned, the characters were dull, and the art was uninspiring and bland. It could have been so much more, if the story hadn\'t been afraid of itself.If you\'re going to do a thirteen episode anime about kicking demon ass, don\'t wait three quarters of the way to get going while simultaneously introducing probably one of the most arbitrary enemy counts I\'ve ever heard.If you want to do a long running anime about kicking demon ass, you STILL don\'t take eight episodes to show off the big bad-ass. The only thing that kept us watching was we bought it and started it. There was no compelling reason in the show to make people keep watching.We didn\'t finish it because we wanted to know what happened. We finished it to avoid having an incomplete anime hanging over our heads. We were watching out of a sense of an unspoken obligation, to see an unpleasant task all the way through.In total: this was an anime that had tremendous potential, but was lost or squandered. It was poorly planned and executed from the very beginning. On the surface, the story sounds great. But it was incomplete. I\'m willing to try one more time with it, to see if I wasn\'t in the right state of mind for it, but I don\'t have high hopes. I can\'t give it anything higher than a two, despite how strong the music was. The music wasn\'t enough to redeem the rest of it. We\'ll see how the show fares with a rewatch. high. I had just watched Hellsing Ultimate and wanted more of something in that vein of violence, treachery, and uncertainty. Tokkô did not give me that.Instead, it left me feeling confused, rushed, off-kilter. There were frequent pauses, full of discussions of ""Wait, what? Did we miss something?"".

Now, this isn\'t genuine character growth I\'m talking about. This was an unfinished character, who was slowly being fleshed out throughout the show instead of having him grow. UNLESS I\'m wrong about how characters in anime transition from lusting after their younger sister\'s nether regions to standing by the woman of their literal dreams. If I\'m wrong, then great! That actually changes a huge part of the show for me, in a positive manner.Any other characters felt exactly like characters, in every sense of the word. They weren\'t people defined by their past and making choices based on that, they were characters making decisions the writers said they made. The one exception, the absolute best person was Kaoru Kunikida, Ranmaru\'s boss. Kunikida had motivations that drove him, he took stands, and unlike everyone else around him, he didn\'t allow his past to chain him, but instead used it to move forward. He grew. I can\'t say that about anyone else.Overall, the strength of Kunikida wasn\'t enough to effectively counteract the constantly rewritten Ranmaru and the lack of depth regarding everyone else. A story filled with characters isn\'t compelling, it isn\'t captivating. You are never presented with moments where you see genuine growth, just worn out scenarios where nothing ever changes.StoryOverall score: 2/5I found the story immensely frustrating. In a nutshell (POTENTIAL SPOILER WARNING; DON\'T READ PAST HERE): Ranmaru and his sister were orphaned because somehow everyone in his apartment complex was brutally slaughtered. He becomes a cop to hunt down the killer. It\'s revealed that the attack was because someone opened an alchemical box (I didn\'t write the story) and opened up a gateway to another dimension. This box has 108 pieces (I don\'t know why the weird number), and it cannot be closed until every piece is found. There is a group of people dedicated to finding said pieces to close the gateway because reasons (there are legitimate reasons, but I\'m trying to avoid spoilers and take as little time as possible).Here is my issue. The entire storyline felt like it was slowly being reworked. People were saying things that they shouldn\'t have known, things were being presented suddenly that contradicted something said earlier. The storyline as a whole felt clumsy, unfinished, poorly thought out. What was ESPECIALLY frustrating was the realization that the story had AMAZING potential, but was lost somewhere.The story felt like it was intended to run on for much longer, but was cancelled or ended prematurely. Honestly, I see why. The story takes eight episodes to go anywhere. The plot was unfinished, not fully formed from the beginning. I had a very strong feeling of ""Figure that part out later"" or even just adding something solely for the episode to make sense. That\'s bad writing. That\'s incredibly bad writing.I\'m struggling to fully express just how frustrating it was to watch the lack of progression from the story. The show shied away from actually getting into the action and just going off, and instead held itself back the entire time until the very end. The story dawdled, moseyed, and doddered about, avoiding it\'s true core: people kicking demon ass. And that\'s not even all of my problems. When you look at the actual storyline of the show, from beginning to end, it just falters from the beginning. So much of the first seven episodes could have been done in the first episode, freeing up the remaining episodes up to explore the world being presented to the viewer.We were not given that. We were given a lost show, confused about its characters, storyline, direction, ending. The show is short, only 13 episodes. It took eight to get going. It shouldn\'t.There are, in my mind, two ways to look at the show. Either it was intended to be 13 episodes, in which case the show was a an overly ambitious train wreck. You don\'t create some arbitrary number of enemies to kill, and then spend a full quarter of your show before you even show off how bad-ass the main character is. You just don\'t. That\'s terrible writing. OR the show was meant to be longer, but was cut short due to whatever reason and so they were forced to create SOME kind of ending that had any kind of logic. This makes more sense, because I refuse to consider the former a possibility.  I can see why the show failed to gain any interest. The storyline was poorly planned, the characters were dull, and the art was uninspiring and bland. It could have been so much more, if the story hadn\'t been afraid of itself.If you\'re going to do a thirteen episode anime about kicking demon ass, don\'t wait three quarters of the way to get going while simultaneously introducing probably one of the most arbitrary enemy counts I\'ve ever heard.If you want to do a long running anime about kicking demon ass, you STILL don\'t take eight episodes to show off the big bad-ass. The only thing that kept us watching was we bought it and started it. There was no compelling reason in the show to make people keep watching.We didn\'t finish it because we wanted to know what happened. We finished it to avoid having an incomplete anime hanging over our heads. We were watching out of a sense of an unspoken obligation, to see an unpleasant task all the way through.In total: this was an anime that had tremendous potential, but was lost or squandered. It was poorly planned and executed from the very beginning. On the surface, the story sounds great. But it was incomplete. I\'m willing to try one more time with it, to see if I wasn\'t in the right state of mind for it, but I don\'t have high hopes. I can\'t give it anything higher than a two, despite how strong the music was. The music wasn\'t enough to redeem the rest of it. We\'ll see how the show fares with a rewatch.', 'This is my first review so hmm where should I start.. I dont get it why is this anime so unpopular and ppl hate it. In my eyes it was pretty good if u like blood.The art is good for how old it is the characters are ok but now the bad thing the story is so unfinished they could have done much more it feels like the ending is just thrown at u this had a lot of potential imo.It also had a bit of humour which I like.Overall It needs more episodes and better ending. Im sorry its hard for me to rate...stuff with this scaling system so I did it this way and dont hate me for my bad review I just wanted to recommend it for ppl to watch it. stuff with this scaling system so I did it this way and dont hate me for my bad review I just wanted to recommend it for ppl to watch it.', ""This is my first review, thought I would make one since I'm feeling a bit bored.First of all, my opinion would be that this is a great anime show. It's a bit underrated, and I think it deserves more credit then it's given. I'm giving it a 10 because it's one of very few anime shows that actually had me interested. I would say this anime show deserves between a 7-9 rating, but I'm not one to give very low ratings.Story 7/10 - The storyline was okay, it wasn't anything original, but it wasn't bad either. There is your average sword fighting in it, and...battling against monsters that are trying to take over with the devil/satan involved, which is nothing new.• I thought the first episode was good, and it had a good start in the series.• The ending was pretty bad, it kind of had one of those endings you would see in a Freddy Crugar movie.Art 8/10- I thought the art was pretty good. When they had the fight scenes where they killed some of the monsters were definetely better than some anime shows. The art for when it showed the limbs of humans torn apart and the blood everywhere was great.The art kind of reminded me of Claymore [also a good anime show] The animation wasn't all that great, and wasn't the best quality, but I thought it was decent.Characters 9/10- The characters were great. My favorite character from this show would have to be Kureha Suzuka, her weapons were daggers instead of swords, which I thought was unique because most everyone else held swords. The main character was okay, but kind of forgettable. His personality was kind of like your average anime boy.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime show, and I would definetely reccommend it if you like really gore filled anime shows like Gantz. battling against monsters that are trying to take over with the devil/satan involved, which is nothing new.• I thought the first episode was good, and it had a good start in the series.• The ending was pretty bad, it kind of had one of those endings you would see in a Freddy Crugar movie.Art 8/10- I thought the art was pretty good.

I actually quite liked the little twists and the way they laid out the order of things to come.The characters are hard not to love. Ronmaru (the main character) certainly makes you smile, in the beginning he\'s very cute and fun and unknowing and he changes through out the anime, but you find out every reason why; which I like. I...hate when you watch anime and suddenly someone\'s all pokerface for unknown reasons. Plus the whole, living-with-sister-cause-their-parents-died thing kinda made you feel sorry for the guy.I wont go into detail about him or the other characters because you only find out snippets through out the series.Okay so I\'m going to give you the bad points now which might include the tiniest little bit of spoilage, you can either carry on or skip to the bottom of the review.Bad points :I am a little disappointed, at first I thought the anime was running at a smooth pace, but then suddenly as soon as his life ""up\'s"" he\'s this serious dude who knows everything? What happened to the guy who was too oblivious to notice girls blatantly flirting with him? I liked him! He was cute! Anyway..Don\'t get me wrong in the end he turned out to be pretty bad ass (pardon my french) but in 13 episodes that happened kinda too quickly for my liking. It got to episode 8 and they just completely rushed everything! Suddenly he can kill 6 main spirits one after the other?! 3 episodes ago he couldn\'t stand up infront of one!The characters where believable though while you saw part of each characters personal life and the way they felt, they never really let it shine through, apart from the 2 main characters.The ending was atrocious and I feel robbed. He JUST learned how to fight and suddenly he\'s ""The Chosen One"". It\'s bull! How did he manage to get through all that tripe at the end only for it to come back in his face?! Ooh that sort of thing annoys me so much, and happened frequently in other animes. MAKE IT STOP!End of Spoilers!!Anyway, I would recommend watching it, I mean, it\'s a good watch if you\'re not picky that is.:) x hate when you watch anime and suddenly someone\'s all pokerface for unknown reasons.

What they must understand is that unfortunately the manga as dropped after only 3 volumes. I think originally the anime was supposed to  have 24 episodes or another season. This explains why until episode 9 things go very slow. I personally found the show very exciting and interesting with strong and deep characters. There are no bad people just because like some shows have and a lot of things got explained by the end. I could say the only thing I did not like was the last episode which was...weird. It is clear that writers needed a quick end for a series that should have been longer while in the same time they wanted to leave place for a sequel/revival of the series that unfortunately never come (and probably never will). I do not want to give spoilers to those that want to watch it but I will say just this: if you decide to do so just see it trough, do not drop it because by the end most questions will be answered. weird.

The biggest problem for me with this anime was that you're aware from very early on there's not going to be a proper resolution.It seems more like a video game plot, where the main character has to defeat x amount of monsters to collect things inside them. Totally unoriginal.Animation is pretty poor too. Lots of unanimated characters rushing through static backgrounds. Also the character design is pretty dull. None of them break out of the most basic stereotypes.Avoid. "", ""I think I speak for everyone when I say that an old looking show doesn't mean that it's bad, and for the minority of you who have the brain to think that a shows age determines it's quality, you probably watched Ranking of Kings and then Mars of Destruction in that order in order to satisfy your shitty take, rather than watching something like Neon Genesis, Hotaru no Haka, or even Tokko.Tokko may not stand the test of time like other shows such as One Piece or Yu Yu Hakusho, but what it definitely stands the test of is whether writing ages well or not,...because for a show adapted by a manga written in 2003, this show really slaps with it's writing and personality. While the show is cheesier than a mozzarella stick throughout it's full duration it definitely doesn't disappoint with how well rounded the writing is, many if not all questions you may have on the series pre-finale are answered and foreshadowed throughout the show and it's really interesting realizing this as each plot hole is filled by the shows dialogue and events. Which I guess you can really just expect from the writer of GTO Great Teacher Onizuka.Regardless of the writing in Tokko, it isn't exactly anything worth paying attention to at this point in age, so allow me to direct you to something that is, and that's the shows successful genre-blend when it comes to shit like comedic accuracy in common sense. We all find lack of common sense in our favourite shows and get pissed off sometimes by it, but this show throws common sense in your face so much that when someone so out of the ordinary in anime but so normal in real life occurs you can't help but laugh and respect the little details. Such as the HORRIBLE troupe in anime where you can yell about incest loli rape in a crowd quiet enough to hear a pin drop, and NO one notices your existence or seems to have a mind for themselves, but no, no in Tokko these guys talk about all the shit they want like irresponsible teenagers and EVERYONE knows they're doing it and stare at them like they're having a schizophrenic episode, and you just can't help but laugh at such a troupe being totally overthrown in Tokko, which adds to Tokkos well executed genre-blend.Lastly, while Tokko may have personality and the appropriate mix of genres, it's hard to excuse for the lack of originality in concept. As stated prior, this show manages to cover up how cheesy it was, but not entirely. Tokko is undoubtedly a perfect example of edgy teenager bait, like something the 15 year old goth girl from high school would fan fic draw instead of writing up their english essay, it's just way to easy to understand why someone would hate the show or be put off, which in turn ruins a lot of the shows authenticity, unfortunately making what could've been one of the best shows of the 2000s period of anime, forgettable and overshadowed.Gore softened by comedy, comedy softened by personality, and personality softened by cheesiness, a prime example of how no matter how good you mix and match, it's nearly impossible to create an objectively good show with an edge lord concept written for rebellious teenagers. Oh yeah, and the dub is hilarious. because for a show adapted by a manga written in 2003, this show really slaps with it's writing and personality.

It began with intrigue into extra-dimensional creatures that infect human bodies like parasites (think H.P. Lovecraft or Parasyte) and ended with a sappy, gothic harem!This review of TOKKÔ is spoiler free!—Story/CharactersSynopsis: Shindou Ranmaru has just graduated from police academy and assigned to Tokko: Special Mobile Investigation Force. On the day of his graduation, he meets the half-naked girl he has been seeing in his dreams. Her name is Rokujo Sakura and she...works for a secret group within Tokki, known as Tokko: Special Public Safety Task Force. Shindou ends up joining Tokko to avenge his parents\' death, and solve the mysterious mass murder of residents in his hometown of Machida. Meanwhile, bottomless pits begin appearing around Japan, and mysterious creatures emerge from them. Could these events be linked to Machida Massacre?The name Tokkō is a reference to either the shortened version of, 1. ""Tokkō (特攻), a portmanteau for Tokubetsu Kōgekitai, literally meaning ""Special Attack Unit""—the official name for Japanese aviators conducting kamikaze attacks in World War II, or 2. Tokkō (特高), a portmanteau for Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu, meaning ""Special Higher Police""—in history, it was a special investigation unit used to dissuade what the Japanese government considered to be anarchists and socialists that threatened public order. Either way, if you add the historical connotations onto a story about a bunch of leather-clad rebels fighting demons, it has weird implications!More specifically, they fight demonic creature call Phantoms that crawl over to the mortal world when the seal between the two worlds is broken, it\'s literally referred to as the ""Box of Dirge (""Druj"")""! Regular weapons don\'t work on them, so Tokkō is employed because they have magical swords that can combat the creatures! They get possession of the swords by having the Phantoms cohabitate with them in a symbiotic relationship inside of their body, which somehow creates a tattoo. Man, all of this feels like it came out of a beginners guide to Wicca or something!There is a bit of intrigue when the main character, Ranmaru, is set up on a blind date with a woman, who\'s father just happens to be doing freaky experiments on the Phantoms. But, as anyone could have learned from any Resident Evil game, scientists tampering with otherworldly beings always has to go wrong somewhere! Not going to say how, because that would involve spoilers, but that arc (episode 5) is where the story ceases to be interesting.The series meanders on the ever-present mystery of Ranmaru\'s past and the secrets behind the Phantoms, which on its own would create intrigue, but the series vaguely mentions it and then has Ranmaru go on angsty dates with a random girls who all have tragic backstories (which is no wonder, why would you voluntarily join an organization of demon slayers otherwise)! There\'s even a member of Tokkō that wears no bra and leather jacket, I guess to the show\'s credit... she\'s kind of crazy (?), but still! How would that defend you into parasitic, flesh-eating monsters? Oh, well. I guess the series randomly has her show Ranmaru her nipples (er, tattoo) in one episode, so it\'s okay.There\'s about eight people in his harem: including his male best friend who always talks about how awesome he is, his sister, his sister\'s best friend, a bloodthirsty sword-wielding prodigy, the commander of the division (the ""cougar"" option), etc. And Ranmaru has the least amount of chemistry... with the lead heroine. The series barely shows them interact and then it tries to push them together in the end, because certain incidents in their childhood converge. She\'s presented as the strong, silent type but in the anime adaptation, she barely says or does anything!The only scene I can think of is when she stabs a sword through herself and Ranmaru to merge consciousnesses, but then Inukai (the only other male member of Tokkō) just randomly appears in their subconscious vision? I guess the sword thing was unnecessary? Everyone in this story is constantly angsty, and none of the mysteries ever get solved! The story just drags along: boring, repetitive, and nonsensical!—TechnicalKazuo Takigawa (chief animation director)* Chikyū Shōjo Arujuna, localized as ""Earth Maiden Arjuna"" (episode director)* Keishichou Tokumu-bu Tokushu Kyouaku-han Taisaku-Shitsu Dai-Nana-ka -Tokunana, localized as ""Special 7: Special Crime Investigation Unit""* Kidō Shinsengumi Moeyo Ken* Kurohime: Shikkoku no Yakata, localized as ""The Black Princess""* One Piece (animation director)* Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!

I don\'t know if the manga is any better. The anime may have just flopped due to bad planning and directional decisions. TOKKÔ could have been something interesting, but instead, it devolved into a bunch of boring clichés! Overall, I give TOKKÔ a 3/10!Rating: ★★☆☆☆ works for a secret group within Tokki, known as Tokko: Special Public Safety Task Force. Shindou ends up joining Tokko to avenge his parents\' death, and solve the mysterious mass murder of residents in his hometown of Machida. Meanwhile, bottomless pits begin appearing around Japan, and mysterious creatures emerge from them. Could these events be linked to Machida Massacre?The name Tokkō is a reference to either the shortened version of, 1. ""Tokkō (特攻), a portmanteau for Tokubetsu Kōgekitai, literally meaning ""Special Attack Unit""—the official name for Japanese aviators conducting kamikaze attacks in World War II, or 2. Tokkō (特高), a portmanteau for Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu, meaning ""Special Higher Police""—in history, it was a special investigation unit used to dissuade what the Japanese government considered to be anarchists and socialists that threatened public order. Either way, if you add the historical connotations onto a story about a bunch of leather-clad rebels fighting demons, it has weird implications!More specifically, they fight demonic creature call Phantoms that crawl over to the mortal world when the seal between the two worlds is broken, it\'s literally referred to as the ""Box of Dirge (""Druj"")""! Regular weapons don\'t work on them, so Tokkō is employed because they have magical swords that can combat the creatures! They get possession of the swords by having the Phantoms cohabitate with them in a symbiotic relationship inside of their body, which somehow creates a tattoo. Man, all of this feels like it came out of a beginners guide to Wicca or something!There is a bit of intrigue when the main character, Ranmaru, is set up on a blind date with a woman, who\'s father just happens to be doing freaky experiments on the Phantoms. But, as anyone could have learned from any Resident Evil game, scientists tampering with otherworldly beings always has to go wrong somewhere! Not going to say how, because that would involve spoilers, but that arc (episode 5) is where the story ceases to be interesting.The series meanders on the ever-present mystery of Ranmaru\'s past and the secrets behind the Phantoms, which on its own would create intrigue, but the series vaguely mentions it and then has Ranmaru go on angsty dates with a random girls who all have tragic backstories (which is no wonder, why would you voluntarily join an organization of demon slayers otherwise)! There\'s even a member of Tokkō that wears no bra and leather jacket, I guess to the show\'s credit... she\'s kind of crazy (?), but still! How would that defend you into parasitic, flesh-eating monsters? Oh, well. I guess the series randomly has her show Ranmaru her nipples (er, tattoo) in one episode, so it\'s okay.There\'s about eight people in his harem: including his male best friend who always talks about how awesome he is, his sister, his sister\'s best friend, a bloodthirsty sword-wielding prodigy, the commander of the division (the ""cougar"" option), etc. And Ranmaru has the least amount of chemistry... with the lead heroine. The series barely shows them interact and then it tries to push them together in the end, because certain incidents in their childhood converge. She\'s presented as the strong, silent type but in the anime adaptation, she barely says or does anything!The only scene I can think of is when she stabs a sword through herself and Ranmaru to merge consciousnesses, but then Inukai (the only other male member of Tokkō) just randomly appears in their subconscious vision? I guess the sword thing was unnecessary? Everyone in this story is constantly angsty, and none of the mysteries ever get solved! The story just drags along: boring, repetitive, and nonsensical!—TechnicalKazuo Takigawa (chief animation director)* Chikyū Shōjo Arujuna, localized as ""Earth Maiden Arjuna"" (episode director)* Keishichou Tokumu-bu Tokushu Kyouaku-han Taisaku-Shitsu Dai-Nana-ka -Tokunana, localized as ""Special 7: Special Crime Investigation Unit""* Kidō Shinsengumi Moeyo Ken* Kurohime: Shikkoku no Yakata, localized as ""The Black Princess""* One Piece (animation director)* Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!

It seemed as if the producers had run afoul of their budget and then quickly rushed the series to keep the big boys happy.The build up to the latter part of the anime is definitely worthy of recognition as one of the better series, but then things begin to unravel near the end where the whole tone becomes rushed and abrupt. There were some real golden moments, but they are few and far between.My biggest qualm is the fact that it...was tarnished by a complete anti-climax. The final battle is short and boring, and doesn't do the series any justice. If they had fleshed out the story a bit more by including at least another two or three episodes to bring it up to a nice closing number of 15 episodes, and had a far more epic finale, this definitely could have been one of the better animes to deal with demons and revenge.The series had the expected gore of one that deals with demons, and of course the usual shower scenes to add a bit of an ecchi flavour, some interesting characters, and a decent storyline, but once again the finale simply lacked that special touch that most highly rated animes are marked by.To repeat myself, this series had so much potential, but that potential was not displayed. I doubt they'll release a sequel as it has been four years, but we can hope. If they do take the dive, let's hope they improve on it tenfold. The ingredients are there, they are just not mixed together properly to make a tasty, mouthwatering meal. was tarnished by a complete anti-climax.

It wasn't bad at all and I actually enjoyed it, but there were flaws (Like the ending)Story: 7/10 - The story was good and had a cool plot. It was executed fairly well, but it went in a lot different direction than I expected. I did enjoy the story but it seemed lacking and it just kind of ended.... very abruptly.Art: 5/10 - I honestly don't care about art or how bad it is, but this did have an older feel to it, which honestly isn't my favorite style. It was...somewhat nostalgic though.Sound: 5/10 - Nothing too memorable, but nothing too bad. I don't personally care enough to put the soundtrack on my playlist though.Character: 6/10 - I actually liked a lot of the characters. At least the ones that I could remember. The show ended too soon for me to really get to know all the characters. The characters were not bad though. They just needed to be more developed.Enjoyment: 6/10 - I enjoyed this and watched it all the way through.

So Ranmaru wants to find the people who killed his parents, finds out they were killed by monsters, he joins Tokkou to kill the monsters, and at the climax fights the evil mastermind whose controlling the monsters and wants to take over the world.There weren't really any big twists or surprises and it fells like the writers were really dragging the plot out, like they were...struggling to make this anime 12 episodes long.Also, I thought the fight scenes were pretty boring. Ranmaru and the others characters just slice the phantoms half with one swing of their swords so there really isn't that much fighting.Characters 5/10Again, these characters don't feel like real characters as much as templates for characters.We never learn anything about them outside their origin stories. For example, I know Ranmaru wants to kill the monsters that killed his parents, but I can't say anything about his personality or anything I found likeable or memorable about him and that's true for all the characters.Even when one of the main characters gets killed (which should be an edge of your seat, heart-pounding scene) I don't feel sad or angry or anything because I didn't know anything about this character other than his name and origin story.Art 6/10I thought the art was decent. The phantoms looked okay and the little parasite monsters were legitimately creepy. Also, since this is a horror anime, the artist did a good job by including lots of blood.One character's appearance that really stood out, however, was Kureha. She doesn't  wear a shirt!! Seriously, her leather jacket just barely covers her nipples; why does nobody ask her about that?!Overall 5/10I'd say Tokkou is a decent anime, but it just doesn't feel like a whole of effort was put into the story, characters, or art designs. struggling to make this anime 12 episodes long.Also, I thought the fight scenes were pretty boring. Ranmaru and the others characters just slice the phantoms half with one swing of their swords so there really isn't that much fighting.Characters 5/10Again, these characters don't feel like real characters as much as templates for characters.We never learn anything about them outside their origin stories. For example, I know Ranmaru wants to kill the monsters that killed his parents, but I can't say anything about his personality or anything I found likeable or memorable about him and that's true for all the characters.Even when one of the main characters gets killed (which should be an edge of your seat, heart-pounding scene) I don't feel sad or angry or anything because I didn't know anything about this character other than his name and origin story.Art 6/10I thought the art was decent. The phantoms looked okay and the little parasite monsters were legitimately creepy. Also, since this is a horror anime, the artist did a good job by including lots of blood.One character's appearance that really stood out, however, was Kureha. She doesn't  wear a shirt!! Seriously, her leather jacket just barely covers her nipples; why does nobody ask her about that?!Overall 5/10I'd say Tokkou is a decent anime, but it just doesn't feel like a whole of effort was put into the story, characters, or art designs."", 'Were you a big Bleach fan who found yourself saying, ""if only this were a lot shorter and more like Elfen Lied in terms of bloody violence""?  That\'s Tokko in a nutshell and that\'s leaving out half the plot.So you had a cataclysmic event a few years back, some governmental coverup as to the reality of it, and survivors of the event are now gifted with the ability to kill demonic entities.  Good thing cause they seem to be running amok out there.It\'s a 13 episode run, but it wasn\'t rushed or over stuffed with details.  The story is actually well told...but ends on a ""this is only the beginning"" style cliffhanger that it\'s unfortunate we never saw resolved.  We easily could have gotten a two or three season run.The art style is a bright colorful palate for a dark horror show.  We do get some tease of skin but it\'s nothing blatant.  Kudos to the voice cast, the dub is quality and from the gag reel you can tell they enjoyed their time in the booth.

However, he seemed pretty positive that I'd like it, and he was right. Tokko is a fairly good anime that knows how to keep the story flow. If you are a fan of gory, bloody and gushing gruesome horror, Tokko doesn't hold up to the standard highly, however it makes a fair attempt to deliver those qualities to the viewer.I liked the anime a lot because simply I'm sucker when it comes to body-ripping, blood-flooding death scene, but...also because the story line itself holds up a continuous event. The anime succeeds in holding up secrets that slowly reveal its truth throughout the anime. The characters have a nice connection between each other, the sister, the cursed brother and the people who were effected by the incident at the hospital. The way they also slowly develop their relationship is well written.Some of the things I disliked about the anime is the way the main devil presented itself and the very vague ending.

This time pottery is the main theme of another honest and simple show, but one that deserves attention and careHimeno is the character that plays the key role in the construction and the sample of the show. The protagonist has an interesting past with ceramics. In fact, her mother is the cause of this. She was an excellent artist in this profession, which requires concentration, creativity, and especially innovation. Himeno doesn\'t remember much of the past she had with her mother, not even with the ceramics she made. In fact, Himeno had a greater appreciation for...this art only at school, when she joined a club with Naruse, Mika-chan and Tooko. All of them together go on to build a strong relationship with ceramics, regardless of the reason they were convinced to be in this club.Over time, the show creates an appropriate and simple ambiance, using elements such as scenery, contemplation, and colors that harmonize and cause an approximation with the audience. And it is the audience, that is, us, the main character of this show. Ceramics is a subject that is not appealing to everyone. In fact, many belittle even the ability of a show to do 12 episodes of this without being boring or repetitive.Yakunara really has episodes that don\'t cause much interest in us, but it is a great show to show a small portion of Japanese quality. Like Olympia Kyklos and the more recent Mashiro no Oto, Yakunara aims to herald a new vision in the culture and consumption of new cultural experiences from its country or region. Of course, each anime has its own goal, Olympia for example focuses on Greece, while Mashiro no Oto tries to convey a new perspective on Eastern musicality. Yakunara shows a timid artistic manifestation, but at the same time it causes an interest to the public, from the moment the show does not take place entirely in a closed room, such as a club, but promotes actions such as walks in cities that have ceramics as a public representation in squares and sidewalks. It is a simple action, but one that makes this show a good company during the week.However, along with these elements, the anime needs to sustain its quality in being an anime, but this is where the show loses some of its excitement. As I said before, the show has moments that don\'t matter much. Generally these are episodes that do not add to the relationship of the characters or do not convey a message or empathy to the audience. The show has a special attention in being simple, but at the same time it is necessary to have a special attention in its own execution in order not to seem like an unnecessary anime. The early episodes of the show don\'t draw as much, but it manages to sustain a theme that is better used in the future. But those same themes make the show ""forget"" for a while about the past and the interpretation of each of the characters with their perspective on pottery. Of course, Himeno has a very good moment when she makes a new piece of pottery for her father, but gets frustrated because she feels it didn\'t please him. But for the most part, the show fails to carry an absorption of these elements in a pleasing way and hurts its composition of episodes. The director and the person responsible for the script were good with their work, but it is a show that still needs to improve a lot if it has a sequel.Even with these problems, I must applaud Yakunara Mug Cup mo. It was a really fun experience and I enjoyed every little moment. Nippon Animation is not a studio that usually brings out good things lately, but this show was a positive leap for the studio. It really is a title for the few, it won\'t convince everyone of its relevance. It is even more likely that people didn\'t even care about this title while it was being released during the last few months. However, Yakunara is a show that delivered what it wanted in a positive way, I must acknowledge.The pottery may not interest you, but the friendships and small slice-of-life action may please you. If you haven\'t given this show a listen, please give it another try. You will find that it is more honest than most recent anime.

Despite being born in a country where it\'s recognized as a long-established profession (although neglected now, unfortunately), pottery never really caught my interest. However, after watching Yakunara Mug Cup mo, I might have become a little eager to learn about it.Yakunara Mug Cup mo takes place in Tajimi, a city which is known for its pottery. The story mainly focuses on high school student Himeno Toyokawa, who moved to Tajimi after her father\'s company went bankrupt. On the first day of her new school, a boisterous girl named Mika Kukuri invites her to visit...the pottery club. There, she learns that her late mother was an exceptional potter who was known for creating remarkable ceramic objects. Now eager to pursue pottery and learn more about her mother, Himeno decides to join Mika\'s club, where she is accompanied by her childhood friend Naoko Naruse, Mika\'s senpai Touko Aoki, and Mika herself.Yakunara Mug Cup mo seems like a typical CGDCT show at first glimpse, and for the most part, it absolutely is. Most of the anime revolves around our main characters – a group of four adorable, lively, and passionate girls – making mugs (and other ceramic utensils) and occasionally traveling around the city. What\'s somewhat interesting about Yakunara Mug Cup mo, though, is that it does have a recurring theme prevalent throughout its 12 episodes, which is surprisingly well-executed for the most part.The underlying (kinda) theme of the anime concerns our protagonist Himeno\'s self-discovery and her growth as a person. When Himeno started doing pottery, she wasn\'t confident if she could improve herself to the adequate standard. However, as she spent more time in the profession alongside her friends, she gathered up more confidence and gradually rid of her anxiety. By the end of the anime, Himeno does not only improve as an artist, but she also shapes up her persona and finds her ambition in life. Her relationship with her father plays the most important role in this, which is by far the best part about the anime.Pottery is actually a nice addition to the story; not only because it makes Yakunara Mug Cup mo stand out a little from other CGDCT anime, but also because it serves as an effective foundation for Himeno\'s characterization. This topic is expounded upon in a technical regard as well; the series provides the viewers a short glimpse of what it\'s like to work in the profession. Of course, you wouldn\'t learn how to make ceramic objects simply by watching the anime, but honestly, I learned a few interesting things about pottery that I wouldn\'t have known otherwise.The slice-of-life moments of Yakunara Mug Cup mo are also not bad, mainly because of its small yet playful and endearing cast of characters. The series sticks to a semi-episodic format for the most part; as I previously said, each episode follows our main characters partaking in fun little activities surrounding pottery (mostly). Most of the episodes are enjoyable to watch, and while there are quite a few segments that feel rather out-of-place and awkward, all in all, the anime is unexpectedly good at maintaining consistency.Honestly, almost all the characters of the show aren\'t much more than what you would find any other CGDCT anime, but they sort of compensate for that with their energetic personalities and natural dynamic. On their own, they probably wouldn\'t able to be as amusing, but together they manage to make the show enough entertaining. With that being said, I do genuinely think that the drama is well-executed, and it adds a noticeable layer of depth to Himeno\'s character and makes her a little bit nuanced.The animation of Yakunara Mug Cup is satisfactory. The backgrounds are decently drawn, and the ceramic objects look very well-made when they need to. The soundtrack isn\'t bad either; it mostly consists of cheerful tunes that aren\'t bad to listen to. The opening song titled ""Tobira wo Hiraketara"" is pretty okay, and the ending song ""Pale Blue"" sung by Aya Uchida is actually very catchy.To conclude in a sentence, if you are looking for a simple CGDCT with somewhat well-executed drama, there is a chance that you will enjoy Yakunara Mug Cup mo. It is far from the best the subgenre can offer, but if nothing else, it should be praised for providing some insight into a profession that\'s barely discussed. the pottery club.

Unsurprisingly, when you research about Tajimi\'s attractions as a Gaijin tourist,  Mino-yaki ceramics will be the first thing that pops up since it\'s very highly regarded over there. And this short show attempts to replicate all of that in the similar ""tourist attraction"" mood.As for this show, like I\'ve said, it\'s just CGDCT with making mugs that slowly evolve into more ambitious earthenware like bowls and sculptures.

Grab some kids and make sure they\'re glued to the screen and see them go in awe.One thing\'s for sure: everything feels monotone at first, until the Minoware comes around and pops the livery of the show to color. That\'s just the extent of this show, with both an anime and live-action part, teaching you how to make mugs with characters and the actual Seiyuus who voiced those characters in real life. Sure works well for advertisement at a wrong time, but garnering interest this will wane.Overall, it\'s fine across all boards.

It's not Berserk.Much like any other craft like drawing or painting, the underlying process behind such crafts are often tedious, underwhelming through intense self-scrutiny, and often-times boring to the outside observer. In other words, the uninitiated would only be able to appreciate the end result of fine art.Let's Make a Mug Too is about the beginning of an artist's journey, and it's a pretty damn good representation of it! It comes in two parts - half anime and half special.Let's start off with the specials, which are...the reason why this show gets a high rating. In it, the VAs go on a field trip to Tajimi and have the opportunity to make a mug and more! They also participate in its culture, eating local specialities as well as checking out some neat spots that really makes you FEEL like you're in Tajimi! The specials are able to convey the brevity of the craft, something the anime couldn't because y'know.. beautifully drawn anime mugs - while colourful - can't convey the real thing.The light-hearted story follows Himeno Toyokawa as she begins her pottery journey. Throughout the season, she goes through the highs and lows commonly found in an artist's journey. As a rookie, she explores the craft. But as she becomes more serious, the frustrations of a rookie begin to catch up with her. What's important to recognize is that this show isn't aiming for excitement. While the show could be pretty exciting if it had SHOKUGEKI-style battles between high-schools over which mug is more colourful, it wouldn't fit in with the spirit of pottery.The process of pottery is tedious, more nerve-racking than drawing because the kiln can waste your time and materials if done improperly, and requires laser-focus to produce results. As a result, pottery competitions are as exciting as it can get, and it can be pretty interesting to see what people can produce with ceramics! The show does an excellent job at showing creativity and (sometimes) technicalities, whether it'd be the history of Tajimi or pottery contests itself.That's to say that if you find this sort of stuff thought-provoking in a creative sense, you have the right mindset to appreciate this show in its entirety - you'd be able to appreciate the process AND whatever result the artist produces.And I do. Or, at least I think I do. I'm trying to get into drawing myself and I'm seeing the exact highs and lows of the artist's journey here, B-tier life drama and everything. Whether or not I succeed is entirely up to me, much like how Himeno's journey is entirely up to her. As long as the artist is having fun with the creative process... who the fuck cares!In conclusion,Let's Make a Mug Too is a very light-hearted, easily digestible anime for the mature and the mature alone. If you treat it like a write-off, then a write-off it shall be. If you treat it like an artist's journey and the exploration of the craft as a whole (both anime and specials), you sorely won't be disappointed. 9/10Until next time. the reason why this show gets a high rating.

The show does an excellent job at showing creativity and (sometimes) technicalities, whether it'd be the history of Tajimi or pottery contests itself.That's to say that if you find this sort of stuff thought-provoking in a creative sense, you have the right mindset to appreciate this show in its entirety - you'd be able to appreciate the process AND whatever result the artist produces.And I do. Or, at least I think I do. I'm trying to get into drawing myself and I'm seeing the exact highs and lows of the artist's journey here, B-tier life drama and everything. Whether or not I succeed is entirely up to me, much like how Himeno's journey is entirely up to her. As long as the artist is having fun with the creative process... who the fuck cares!In conclusion,Let's Make a Mug Too is a very light-hearted, easily digestible anime for the mature and the mature alone. If you treat it like a write-off, then a write-off it shall be. If you treat it like an artist's journey and the exploration of the craft as a whole (both anime and specials), you sorely won't be disappointed. 9/10Until next time."", ""This is one of the short anime that I've watched for a very long time. And it's definitely worth my time... Probably lmaoI don't know what to say because while it had a coherent story and a nice pacing, I don't think it really accomplished anything in the end. Like, I sometimes think what's the point of this anime.It just ended so abruptly.But that's aside the point. How about the pottery and sh*t that it introduced? Well, it's introduced well and properly. It had some scenes that taught the audiences on how to do certain potteries. But because it is a short anime, it needed...to limit those said scenes in order to make room for the boring story. Honestly, if this anime was all about pottery and not about some cliche sh*t, then I'd have like it more. Good thing there's no romance though.The characters aren't super well done, mainly because of the nature of this anime. Being short and all. It had to cram so much characters and stories, as well as the basics of pottery for audiences to learn. So yeah, it makes sense for them to be underdeveloped. But even then, some of the characters are so fun to watch (mainly the blonde with glasses) that I had to give it plus points for that.The animation is pretty basic. It's not outstanding or consistent by any means. But it's average at best.The music however is pretty d*mn great. The op and ed are so catchy, and the ost is pretty decent as well. Good stuff.Overall, it's an anime that is nice to watch if you're bored and want some slice of life anime.(5.2/10) to limit those said scenes in order to make room for the boring story.

The main character, Himeno, has moved to a new town famous for pottery, and joins the pottery club to learn more about her mother, a famous artist from that town that died when she was young.  It's part hobbyist anime and part tourism ad for the city of Tajimi, but the tourism parts aren't so in your face that they're...a turn off.  It also does a pretty good job of translating the hobbyist part for a general audience without getting bogged down in boring details.  The problem with the story comes in Himeno's relationship with her father and deceased mother, which is completely loaded down with unearned sentimentality.  Himeno's desire to make something that impresses her father is a good enough, if basic, storyline, but the entire part with the mother seems like cheap tragedy and fails to connect because of how obvious the emotional manipulation is.Audio/Visual: Visually, things are pretty hit or miss with this show.  The character designs are iffy and the animation is functional at best, but it uses its obviously very limited budget to display the pottery artwork nicely and the more-cartoony-than-usual character animation at least gives it a somewhat unique look.  The audio is more nicely done.  Sounds and effects are warm and comforting, the VA work is good if unremarkable, and the music is catchy and fits well with the laid back theme of the series.Characters: There's not really much to say about any of them unfortunately. This is the weakest part of the series.  Himeno is your standard shoujo protagonist to a T.  Kukuri is a loud idiot and Touko is aloof and serious, but both are talented and helpful.  Neither of them receive an ounce of character development or backstory until a brief look into Touko's past as a competitor in the pottery contest in literally the last episode of the series.  Nao is slightly more interesting, but what her entire deal is is never explained, so she's more of a curiosity than a real character.  Somehow she has incredibly detailed knowledge of anything the characters need to know, and this is quite literally just hand-waved away without ever properly acknowledging how weird it is.  She seemingly keeps a diary or or is writing a manga about Himeno and narrates what she's doing in one episode, but there is no explanation of why and it's never followed up on.  There really aren't any memorable or good characters the entire time in this series, which takes it down from being a no-stress slice of life relaxer to just being boring instead.Overall, it's a cute girls doing cute things show that lacks fun characters and isn't entertaining or unique enough to be worth watching. a turn off.

I love cute girls doing cute things.  This was a let down in every conceivable way. I won't even bother with how much Mika Kukuri's character grated on my nerves, how underdeveloped the main character was, how much I wanted to enjoy the rich potential of a daughter connecting with the mother she never knew through the medium of pottery and artistic self-discovery making lasting friendships along the way all taking place while getting to learn about a beautiful craft and the regions that produce them. What bothers me most is how much there was i could have loved,...wanted to love, and how much of a wasted opportunity this was to make this something I would have treasured. The ingredients were all there but the dish was a flop. wanted to love, and how much of a wasted opportunity this was to make this something I would have treasured. The ingredients were all there but the dish was a flop."", 'Not gonna lie, the only reason I even learned that Yakunara Mug Cup mo, or Let\'s Make a Mug Too, is that I lurk on the website Anime News Network like a madwoman. This is yet another ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime which surprisingly flew under the radar this past season. There is one thing that made me decide to watch it though: The fact that Nippon Animation animated the series. Nippon is primarily responsible for producing all the anime for the World Masterpiece Theater back in the day, along with shows like Future Boy Conan, Fantastic Children, the 1999 Hunter X Hunter anime,...and the Haikara-san ga Tooru remake movies. But they hadn\'t done much in the way of TV series since 2008, coming back with...this. Yeah. It\'s easy to think that Nippon Animation has fallen from grace from their glory days, but...after having watched this, I don\'t think they\'ve lost their touch. For the sake of convenience, I\'m shortening the title to Yakumo.So what\'s this anime about, anyway? The story centers on Himeno Toyokawa, a young girl who just moved to the town of Tajimi with her father and grandmother. She transfers to a new school and makes new friends. One of them, Mika Kukuri (the blonde girl), tries to recruit her into her school\'s pottery club. At first, Himeno isn\'t too sure about joining, but when she learns that her late mother, Himena Tokigawa, previously made a lot of famous ceramic pieces for Tajimi, Himeno decides to join the club and try her hand at it. Gradually, she learns more about the ins and outs of pottery, the impact her mother made on the city of Tajimi, and more about herself in the process.For a show that\'s just about girls in a pottery club, Yakumo is surprisingly well animated. Character movement is smooth but not overly so, the backgrounds are detailed and full of life, and from what I can tell, the animators really tried their hardest to replicate the city of Tajimi in animated form. But I do have one quip with it: Why does Himeno have pink hair but purple bangs and shading? Other than her mother, none of the other characters have this, and I find it kind of jarring because it looks like she dyed parts of it. I\'ve seen weirder, so normally I\'m not put off by this design choice, and it is in the manga as well, but it feels jarring because none of the other characters have dual-colored hair and they look more realistic. The music is definitely one of the stand outs, as it makes use of a lot of unconventional instruments like ukuleles and acoustic guitars that give it a sort of country music feel to it at times. It\'s especially prevalent in the opening theme song, though the soundtrack is much more varied and versatile than other CGDCT shows similar to Yakumo.One thing you\'ll notice about Yakumo is that all the episodes are 12-15 minutes long, including the opening and ending themes. This is because for some reason, the creators decided to shoehorn in live-action parts showing the voice actresses for the characters going to Tajimi, practicing pottery, and other shenanigans. I skip those, as I don\'t think they add anything to the story. That being said, I think the shorter episodes were to the show\'s benefit, as even though Yakumo is rather slow paced and low key, it never drags on longer than it needs to, and gets whatever it needs to get done without meandering or trying to bite off more than it can chew. This also forces the creators to really flesh out the characters in that short time frame, and I think it works here. All four of the main leads are fairly interesting and nice, even if they may seem like archetypal moe characters at first, and they do get fleshed out over the course of the series. A lot of the series focuses on Himeno learning more about her mother\'s legacy and trying to make something that her father will genuinely like on its own merits, and not simply like it out of superficial obligation as a father. I can definitely see Kukuri getting on people\'s nerves though, as she\'s the hyperactive genki girl with a screechy voice that you\'ve seen in pretty much every moe anime at least once. I wish more had been done with Himeno\'s friend Nao, though. All we know about her is that she\'s Himeno\'s friend and that she likes Godzilla/Sentai movies, that\'s it. That\'ll probably change when the second season comes around.In all honesty, the only real critique I have for this show is that episode 8 was kind of a weird episode. It\'s basically a dumb filler episode where Kukuri falls asleep in a restaurant and has a weird dream based on things people next to her are talking about. It did nothing to advance the story and seemed mostly just there to shoehorn in some pointless comedy. It wasn\'t a bad episode by any means, but it did feel very out of place in an otherwise grounded show. Plus, the title is rather misleading, because even though it implies the girls will make mugs, they never actually do so in the show. Again, this\'ll probably be rectified when the second season comes out, and yes, as of this writing, a second season has indeed been confirmed. And I\'m super stoked, because I really like this show and I wish more people gave it a chance! The story, conflict, and characters may not seem like much on the surface, but there\'s just enough nuance, subtlety, and little details that make it stand out from all the other CGDCT anime out there. It\'s not ambitious like, say, A Place Further Than the Universe, nor overly sugary and saccharine like Kiniro Mosaic. It strikes a fun, heartwarming balance, and I think after this, I can say that Nippon Animation is still as good as it\'s always been.Not something that\'s going to bring the house down, but Yakunara Mug Cup Mo is a nice, laid-back, heartwarming anime that deserves way more love and recognition than it gets. and the Haikara-san ga Tooru remake movies.

It may not mean a lot, but honestly, they mean the most when you want something to sit back to and generally pass the time with ease too. For Spring 2021, 2 of these types of anime caught my attention. One other I will mention for another time, the other being today\'s reviewed ""Let\'s Make a Mug Too"" (will abbreviate to ""Mug Cup"").Mug Cup doesn\'t have too much of a real story, and whilst that may be looked down upon, it must be understood that this is no anime trying to be...beyond what it sets out to do, something I would imagine people find pleasure in watching, considering how it also implies the simple nature of the anime is maintained throughout. Anyways, as it says on the tin, or in this case mug, Mug Cup is about girls making pottery, it also goes the extra mile and looks into pretty much everything there is about pottery. That\'s pretty much most episodes of the anime. One thing I have noticed with Mug Cup though is that it somewhat ties in real life affairs with pottery, it\'s not like everything is based around the girls doing pottery, there is some look into the background of the characters, to make stuff more interesting than your basic CGDCT anime. I will also say that sometimes the way the anime goes around it makes it slightly melodramatic, so you are there thinking can some drama and wholesomeness in a show of this kind even work? And, it kinda does, but it is slightly awkward. You shouldn\'t need to worry about this too much but I thought I would comment on this a little. As for characters, they follow their personalities, so I wouldn\'t tell one to go in hoping for some huge developments, for the most part, they are really likeable, and do what they must well. Not a lot to comment on with them honestly, but I would imagine they are fine for people who want to watch this.The technical aspects of the show are for the most part, as you would expect your usual anime of this day and age to look like. The visuals are average, but something that I find with nothing to dislike about, the audio checks out too, I think some of the OST was really good, but it never hit me in a way I could actively tell people to watch this for the OST if nothing else, on that note good OP and ED for its kind, so were seiyuus.I quite enjoyed this anime. I ended up bingeing the rest of it after episode 3 instead of watching this religiously every week, which tells me I should really do that from now on if I want my weeks to be ever so slightly better. But that also means that I can tell everyone that watching this as fast as you can is probably as enjoyable as it were to watch this every week. I suppose as long as you don\'t pause for the longest minute between episodes, this should be a good watch for fans of the genre. In a universal sense, it does everything it needs to do quite rightly for it to be enjoyable.TLDR: A good CGDCT anime, mostly made up of general conventions with an ever so slightly better storytelling method. Time-efficient too.----------Would recommend it for sure, it is time-efficient so you could watch the entire thing in a day if you really wanted to. Idk why anime like this get the lowest attention at times, but I suppose it was the same with another CGDCT anime I really enjoyed. Well, let hidden gems be hidden gems. I must also add that there is a live-action segment you can check out, basically the same thing as this anime only the seiyuus are doing more practical stuff I suppose. They are really fun to watch, there is something about real Japanese women doing things that somehow make for oddly entertaining watches. Anyway, that is for you to decide, you do you.Overall - 6.2 (6) beyond what it sets out to do, something I would imagine people find pleasure in watching, considering how it also implies the simple nature of the anime is maintained throughout.

Had it been any other season I wouldn\'t have bothered. Mug Cup is average, which isn\'t bad by any means, but it certainly could use some humor or relaxing elements to lift it up.Part of the problem stems from its direction and style. I gotta give some credit to the production staff for at least attempting several unique cinematic angles you don\'t normally see in a CGDCT show like this. The problem is that you don\'t see them for a good reason. There was a...scene where you get a grandiose reveal of the statue Hime\'s mother made and it\'s done in the most cinematic way possible with the eerie humming to lure hime in followed by several shots and angles emphasizing the alienness of its design. The thing is, in any other show (CGDCT included) you\'d use techniques like these to lead up to either a stunning revelation, or maybe subvert our expectations with a comedic scene, or maybe tweak it a little to truly aim for that grandiose feel I\'m sure the director wanted. The issue is that it leads to...nothing much. Hime just sees the statue and that\'s it. The show has many instances of using cinematic angles and techniques for a scene that really doesn\'t require anything more than a basic wide shot, and it just hurts the presentation. Another example of the top of my mind is a scene near the end of an episode which frames Hime on the right in silhouette against a rainy backdrop...for no good reason.To lift a quote from Roger Ebert\'s excellent review of Battlefield Earth, ""The director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why."" Merely knowing how shots are framed and styled does not make your otherwise boring scene good.Otherwise the show is fine if on the bland side. Some comedy bits here and there but most don\'t land for me. Still, at half the length of a regular show it\'s pretty harmless, if surprisingly morbid at times.5/10 scene where you get a grandiose reveal of the statue Hime\'s mother made and it\'s done in the most cinematic way possible with the eerie humming to lure hime in followed by several shots and angles emphasizing the alienness of its design.

Personal opinions only.I'll be honest, the reason I decided to watch was because there was a live-action half featuring the main 4 seiyuu. As my profile says, I'm a fan of Wake Up, Girls! and i☆Ris, so seeing that 3 of the 4 main characters are voiced by WUG (Minyami) and i☆Ris members (Seriko and Yuki), I got excited. Unfortunately the live-action half of the song has so far been impossible to find online (if anyone knows where it is, please let me know), so I had to settle...for only watching the anime half.With that said, I find this show to be...just there. It's not exactly special, apart from my sentimental connection with some of the voice actresses, the art is kinda okay (the ceramic stuff is decent tho), story seems a bit too relaxed for me (and I don't like action/shounen), and tbh, sometimes I find it a bit of a drag to watch this.Now for some positives. I think the music is at least good. Again, the OP is sung by the main cast, so biased opinion there, but I don't think the music is bad in any way. Some scenes are also kinda funny, and I'm rather fond of those. Also, I think Minyami and Seriko did well. Yuki as well. (Special shoutout to Kaito)Overall, it's not exactly priority watching, but if you like the genre, why not?

I\'m glad that the episodes were only 14 minutes long so I was able to watch five episodes and that is enough for me.Artstyle: Really nice and decent. Character designs were memorable and the beautiful pottery was definitely a highlight.Characters: I personally got annoyed with both Mika and...Naoko. Idk, I do sometimes like loud / weird characters but those two just were a bit too annoying for my liking. The main girl Himeno is just meh and the senpai Tooko was the only girl from the group that I liked. Idk, for me the main girls are the biggest reason why I decided to drop the series. Also wtf was the fifth episode, following their teacher in her free time like ""detectives""?? Wasn\'t fan of that at all. Also the first episode at school, Himeno promoting her dads business and bringing so many cups with her like huh?? I just found that odd lol.It is a short, not bad looking slice of life that you might wanna check out if you don\'t have any other series to watch or you are just so bored and have some time to spend so yeah, give it a go. I feel like it\'s a 50/50 type of show, you either like it or you don\'t. I can see some people liking it so I\'ll give this series mixed feeling recommendation, you can always drop it, if you don\'t like it. Naoko.

When i watch this anime, there some sort of scene that kinda relate to my real life experience. When everyone around you is so talented on their own way like creativity or aesthetics, you just want someone special for you to notice about how you capable on and don\'t want to live behind someone shadows. And when someone react ""normally"" to what you make without any reaction, it kinda hurt a lot like so relate to my real life experience. kinda coincidence right ?Also i never know there\'s a lot of cup type in japan. afterall, this...is pretty chill anime you can actually enjoy it on your free time to watch it is pretty chill anime you can actually enjoy it on your free time to watch it']"
Yuusha Exkaiser,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3325/Yuusha_Exkaiser,"['Ah, the series that started the whole Yuusha franchise... Yuusha Exkaiser is the 1st installment of the 8 Yuusha (Brave) series that have been released.For those who don\'t know about the Yuusha series, here\'s some brief information on it. GaoGaiGar, being arguably the most well known out of them all, Yuusha series all involve giant transformable mechas (robots) that basically fight evil and save the world. Although they all have ""Yuusha"" in the title, they are not connected to each other story wise. Here are all the series listed chronologically.1. Yuusha Exkaiser (1990)2. Taiyou no Yuusha Fighbird (1991)3. Densetsu no Yuusha Da Garn (1992)4. Yuusha...Tokkyuu Might Gaine (1993)5. Yuusha Keisatsu J-Decker (1994)6. Ougon Yuusha Goldran (1995)7. Yuusha Shirei Dagwon  (1996)8. Yuusha Ou GaoGaiGar (1997)You could say that I basically grew up watching the Yuusha series! I decided to write a review on Exkaiser first as although it\'s not a popular one, it is the one that started it all.STORYThis series is aimed towards children. The episodes are not related to one another for the most part. Most episodes follow a same formula. I will not get into the specifics of the story as I don\'t want to spoil anything here, but basically, you could skip a couple episodes here and there and you really wouldn\'t be lost until you get to the later part of the series when the storyline really starts to count. If you try to have a marathon of some sorts, you might get kind of tired of it as it does kind of get repetitive.ARTThis is an old school anime. The transformation/combination scenes are still quite impressive, bust just don\'t have a high expectations. When you look at the character designs, there\'s definitely that 80\'s~90\'s feel to them. The characters designs remind me of Hayao Miyazaki’s characters. The animation’s nothing too extraordinary, but it really isn’t too bad if you think about when it came out and how many episodes there are. Now, the highlight of the series: the mechas! Many of them transform from vehicles to robots (should remind you of Transformers) and they combine to form bigger and more powerful robots. I’ve always loved combination sequences... The animation and art quality is much better in those scenes as they are reused. The mechas are quite nicely designed and although I would be biased in saying this, I do like them better than the Transformers franchise.SOUNDVoice actings are well done as they are done nicely to fit into the show smoothly (kind of cheesy as the intended audience is children, but it’s not too terrible). The soundtrack’s quite nice and they kind of have that nostalgic feel to them. Unfortunately, the OP and ED songs stay the same all the way through the series, but it really wasn’t a huge factor for me. Basically, the music tracks are quite good and they fit the ""good vs. evil"" theme of the series.CHARACTERSThe main characters of the show are a boy called, Kouta and a transformable car called, Exkaiser, who actually is a space police (don’t worry this is revealed in the beginning of episode 1).  Kouta is a typical boy with good nature and Exkaiser has that perfect trait as a hero – a dedicated and an unshaken will to fight evil and protect others. I’ve felt that Kouta could’ve had a little more distinct personality rather than being a typical boy. There are other transformable mechas, some good, and some bad. From what I remember, no personalities were extreme or really unique, which was a little downer for me.ENJOYMENT & FINAL THOUGHTSThis is one of the series that you should watch without huge expectations. It was worth watching for me, because it is the first Yuusha series. I’ve actually watched many of the later Yuusha series before watching this series. People who have little or no experience with older anime might find it a little difficult to keep watching, which is understandable. Still, if you\'re fan of the Yuusha (Brave) series, or just a mecha fan in general, this series is certainly worth taking a look. Tokkyuu Might Gaine (1993)5. Yuusha Keisatsu J-Decker (1994)6.

I decided that, if I was going to get to know this franchise better, I should start from the very beginning, even though I really didn\'t expected much from Exkaiser exactly for being just the first series. I have to say, though, that this show really exceeded my expectations.It is, of course, a very formulaic ""monster-of-the-week""-style anime designed to sell some cool-looking robot toys to children at its core, but I believe the right way to...look at it is by appreciating how exciting it gets every time the Kaisers (the heroes) show up to fight against the bad guys, and how lovable and funny all the human characters are without ever getting annoying or uninteresting.One aspect that can throw some people off is just how absurdly stupid all the villains, called Geisters, can get all the time. They make any Decepticon ever (the villains from Transformers, just in case) look like an absolute evil mastermind in comparison. But, at least for me, their immense incompetence was also part of the fun of it all. They also get very creative with the wildly different monsters created by the main villains that appear during the course of each episode.Basically what I\'m trying to say here is that this show never gets boring because of the combination of all the elements I just mentioned. It could\'ve been a tad shorter, sure, as it can get a little repetitive to see the exact same animations being reused over and over again, but it will never fail to pump your blood once that amazing rock\'n\'roll-like soundtrack starts playing while the robots transform and/or perform their strongest moves.I was expecting something much more similar to the Transformers series that came right before it, such as The Headmasters, Super-God Masterforce and Victory, but what I got instead was a show that is actually much more fun to watch and has a much better pacing than all of those. I do like those series a lot as well, but they admittedly can get pretty bad at times, while Exkaiser never let\'s you down once you get in the right mood.Simply put, this is a perfectly innocent show that does its job pretty decently. For anyone looking to have a nice time watching an old school, very well defined battle between ""good vs. evil"" with no real consequences other than learning about the value of goodness just for the sake of it, I highly recommend you to check this one out.It also works pretty well as an introduction to the Yuusha/Brave franchise, as I am now a lot interested in checking out all the other series very soon.

A.I.C.O. Incarnation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36039/AICO_Incarnation,"['A.I.C.O. Tells the story of Japan being overrun with ""matter"", a sort of abstract material that destroys everything in it\'s path. The story is a bit generic but the pacing make\'s up for that. The biggest issue I had with this anime was the main character; Tachibana, Aiko. it\'s not that she lacks depth, it\'s the way she reacts to every situation. It\'s like she was made to be shocked at every turn. And it gets tiresome fast. The best aspect of the anime is the artwork. The elegant animations and fast pace of the series is what kept the two dimensional characters in check...and made the series watchable. I did like the small details that made the world of A.I.C.O feel more authentic, e.g. the artificial suits that needed to be fed in order to function properly. I wish a little more thought was put into the world building of the series, it felt like I was watching a CW series with good visuals. There\'s nothing groundbreaking here, but it does make for a good popcorn anime. and made the series watchable.

There\'s nothing groundbreaking here, but it does make for a good popcorn anime.', 'This show is a good example of how important good characters are. A.I.C.O.: Incarnation is visually fantastic with an intriguing story, but it falls flat when it comes to characters.Not only does it fail to properly introduce them, but each and every one of them are so badly written it\'s pathetic.For starters, we are given no reason to care about any of them. There are a few ""emotional"" scenes in this show that are clearly supposed to be tearjerkers, including a death and some drama. But, listen, nobody\'s going to cry over a character they don\'t care about!""Oh no, this character that I forgot...the name of and I can\'t describe to save my life is dead, so sad.""On top of that, there were a considerable amount of scientist side characters that they never introduced and I just... I honestly never knew who they were. Specifically this pink-haired scientist lady that ended up being semi-important.You can\'t just.... throw in random characters and say ""they\'re important now"" without any introduction whatsoever.As I sat watching the credits of the final episode, I came to the realization that I never found out who she was or why she was there.Oh, but I\'m getting ahead of myself.Our main characters, the ones that I previously said give no reason for the audience to care about them, are horrible.You see, they had to get to Primary Point, the end goal/location of their mission, quickly. They kept saying how they needed to hurry up, like there was some sense of urgency.""Like there was some sense of urgency"" ... well, there didn\'t seem to be for the characters themselves.They kept saying how they needed to go faster, get to Primary Point sooner, and it was urgent...! And then they took breaks that lasted basically almost full episodes every episode.YOU CAN\'T DO THAT. YOU CAN\'T KEEP REPEATING THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO HURRY UP AND THEN STAND AROUND NOT PROGRESSING AT ALL FOR SEVERAL HOURS.They weren\'t even doing anything important! They were just bickering and joking around! What? Like,  w h a t ? !Because of this, the middle episodes ended up being incredibly repetitive. Some scenes of them fighting Matter, supposed character/plot/lore/I-don\'t-even-know development, then more scenes of them goofing around and not doing what they said they should be doing at all.Yes, because I\'m sure everyone wants to see a bunch of flat, generic characters talking to eachother instead of the actual plot progression.And don\'t even get me started on the two MAIN main characters, Kanzaki and Aiko. If I elaborate on Kanzaki, I\'ll reach spoiler territory, so I\'ll just say this about Aiko...I don\'t think anyone working on this anime knew what her personality is supposed to be like. She changed sides and opinions every 2 seconds, got super emotional and caused trouble for the sake of plot progression and only for the sake of plot progression, and just in general had no character whatsoever. Long story short, I really hate Aiko.Moving on, I wish more things were explained in this show. Some things were painful like, ""HERE LET ME TELL YOU MY ENTIRE BACKSTORY AND FEELINGS FOR THE SAKE OF THE AUDIENCE TO INTRODUCE MY CHARACTER, POINTLESS BEST FRIEND WHO IS COMPLETELY UNIMPORTANT"" while others were left so unexplained I was very, very confused.A.I.C.O.: Incarnation has such an interesting world. One wrapped in mystery and sci-fi that I wanted to know more about. But, no, no. Obviously focusing on the idiot characters and their adventure was more important, right?It\'s not only the world. There were so many characters that I just. I don\'t know who they are. At all, actually. There\'s a bunch of different sides and organizations and groups and goals and I...!

Episode 12 is like a puzzle that the creator lets you try to find out what it means by yourself. I won\'t tell you the answer, the true meaning of the ending cause it will count as a spoiler which I don\'t want to do that at all.The stories are kinda interesting. Some people will say it like Akira the movie but at the same time, it isn\'t. This isn\'t...that kinda movie where they have a superpower like that. The stories will be like about the girl with a fake body try to stop the burst just as the synopsis said but when you watch the entire series it just adds even more than just that. They even use real biological logic in this series too. I will give it 9/10 due to how well made it is and just as the above to what trick it try to do. It explains you and at the same time, it gave you the solvable puzzle for you to solve for later on or it will be solvable in the future. At some point, they also somehow use some strong drama scene without any warning at the right moment too. Not just any BS one but some logical thing that should have to happen. I didn\'t even expect they would do a drama that hard without any warning too, to be honest.For the art style, its kinda gave you the creep and find it hard to watch but its the whole point. Since this isn\'t some happy anime but its the near apocalypse anime. It will be a horrible apocalypse anime if it looks beautiful. Even so, I think they can do better than that by making it, even more, creepier but considering that many horror anime still can\'t reach to the point of true horror yet so it\'s understandable. I will give it the 8/10.For sound effect, I think its only at the good lv. At least it isn\'t horrible but only just good so I will give it just 7/10 stand for good and just that.For the character design, I will say that it\'s kinda fun enjoyable to see how they act and only just that until some episode of course that it somehow made us care about the character. I think this is one of the anime that can do like some instant drama without any warning which is also super effective to how they timing that.This anime I find myself very enjoying it. I think it will be 10/10.In conclusion, it will be 9+8+7+8+10 = 42 then 42/5 it will be 8.04/10. I will just give it 8/10 due to the math. It isn\'t something that you call nonsense. Its what you call ""math""Extra: To be honest I never expect that Netflix will somehow make a very good original series. This kinda goes beyond what I have to expect in this series. Hope they will make something with this lv of quality a lot more soon. Since most of the series Netflix has a bad hobby of doing the ""Must watch more series to know how it will end""I don\'t wang that JoJo reference like ""To be continued"" memes. Wait... Not another Fing JoJo reference... But yeah that\'s how they mostly do so this is considering one of the best they have ever made. There\'s a lot more then this but its just so rare but it won\'t be if they said this anime is with Netflix without saying that its ""Netflix original series"" when that happens it always end up really good.

A girl called Aiko lost her family to this and an unknown student says she is the key to stopping the Matter once and for all.Now AICO's story was a mixed bag from the get go, in fact after episode 2 I was actually thinking...of dropping it because it was so goddamn boring to watch and the characters weren't helping either which I'll get to in a minute. I wanted to be interested in the whole science and story behind the Matter, but the conversations and exposition about this whole thing just kept boring me and I almost lost complete interest in the show completely.Yet somehow it managed to save itself a little when our group of characters decided to set out on a journey to fight through the Matter to reach the Primary Point, which is where it all started and from episodes 3-8 the show was pretty enjoyable to watch. It had some good action sequences, fairly decent character development and the journey getting through the Matter was pretty thrilling.Then we reach the final episodes and then everything fell apart, not because it got boring, but because it shoved so much more exposition that it got confusing and kind of annoying to watch as all this new information just suddenly came out of nowhere.The ending also felt rushed, we get to see like a 1-2 second clip our characters doing things I wasn't expecting them to do and I feel like they skipped out on having a sadder ending, but nope we gotta have a happy ending for everyone well except for that one guy who ended up dying.So yeah the story is pretty mixed for me with a poor beginning and end, but a somewhat enjoyable middle section.Characters (4/10)The characters were easily the weakest part of the whole show, with such a huge cast you'd think that there would be something here amongst them. Surprisingly there was it just wasn't the main characters.Aiko and Yuuya are the two main characters of the show and honestly they are so fu*king boring, I gave zero damns about these two as they showed zero personality especially Yuuya, who as a character would've been utterly pointless if it wasn't for the incredibly obvious twist that he was actually someone else. Aiko could've been a decent character, but she just didn't grasp me at all. Yeah she wasn't exactly human either, but that still didn't change my perspective of her and in the end I feel like she got off way too easily.Now the diver crew consisting of Kazuki, Kaede, Yoshihiko and Haruka were definitely the saving grace when it came to the characters. Each if them actually had a kind of personality, it wasn't amazing, but it was still something and the chemistry between them kept me watching until the final episodes came along and kinda put them in the background and the development choices for them during the last episodes weren't really great, but they still managed to keep me somewhat entertained.Of course there is a bunch of other characters, but they were so forgettable that they just aren't worth mentioning.Art (6/10)Surprisingly enough for a show as mediocre as this, the artstyle was pretty good. The design of the characters gave me a early-mid 2000's nostalgic feel and the suits plus the weapons the divers used were actually pretty cool. There was a nice variety of weapons and each of the diver characters had a specific weapon they liked to use which kinda helped to separate them as individuals instead of making them random cannon fodder, also for weapons that exist in the 2030's they look pretty damn advanced for that time period. The suits did give me a sort of Halo, Mass Effect feel like this what you would get if you combined them and gave them kickass roller skates.Now despite being CGI the vehicles still looked good especially the giant tank thing they had which kinda sucked to see get destroyed, yet I am kinda surprised the Matter wasn't CGI, well for the most part it wasn't, but I have to respect the animators for not making them completely CGI.One more thing there was one scene where one of the characters was standing on a beach with sticks everywhere and I noticed how detailed that one scene was and it just impressed me to the point where I had to mention it.Sound (6/10)Also surprisingly the op and ed were fairly decent as well. The op had a alright beat, but it could've been better. It's mainly the ed that caught my eye or ears in this case, because I liked how it showed Aiko walking up the gorge before the incident happened and gave me the feeling this the journey she is going to experience just with a lot of monsters in the way and that it'll eventually lead her to her goal. The soundtrack was fairly forgettable, but the instrumental notes in some scenes that had some emotion to them were nice to listen to.The last thing I have to mention and this is what completely killed my ears and brain throughout the whole thing which is the goddamn dub, now usually I'm pretty cut lose with dubs, but there have been a few in the past that I cannot defend them in any way or form because the dub here is absolutely terrible so for once I would actually prefer the sub instead of the dub.Extras:The action was pretty good and kept me entertained longer than I expected, the fast moving divers going up against an enemy that couldn't be completely defeated by their guns was kind of intense. But I am a little disappointed that only one character of the group died and it probably would've sucked seeing some of the other characters die too, but I felt like having a few extra deaths would've helped make the journey a little more emotional and would've helped develop the characters a little more.Enjoyment (5/10)Yeah the enjoyment factor was very mixed, one moment I'm hating it, being confused or just bored by it. Another minute there's a scene that was actually fun to watch and kept me going a little longer.Overall (5/10)Overall this was like I said a mixed bag of an anime, some people might like it more than I did, but word of advice watch this in sub and not dub (although considering the division between these two fan factions I doubt many will watch it in dub). of dropping it because it was so goddamn boring to watch and the characters weren't helping either which I'll get to in a minute. I wanted to be interested in the whole science and story behind the Matter, but the conversations and exposition about this whole thing just kept boring me and I almost lost complete interest in the show completely.Yet somehow it managed to save itself a little when our group of characters decided to set out on a journey to fight through the Matter to reach the Primary Point, which is where it all started and from episodes 3-8 the show was pretty enjoyable to watch. It had some good action sequences, fairly decent character development and the journey getting through the Matter was pretty thrilling.Then we reach the final episodes and then everything fell apart, not because it got boring, but because it shoved so much more exposition that it got confusing and kind of annoying to watch as all this new information just suddenly came out of nowhere.The ending also felt rushed, we get to see like a 1-2 second clip our characters doing things I wasn't expecting them to do and I feel like they skipped out on having a sadder ending, but nope we gotta have a happy ending for everyone well except for that one guy who ended up dying.So yeah the story is pretty mixed for me with a poor beginning and end, but a somewhat enjoyable middle section.Characters (4/10)The characters were easily the weakest part of the whole show, with such a huge cast you'd think that there would be something here amongst them. Surprisingly there was it just wasn't the main characters.Aiko and Yuuya are the two main characters of the show and honestly they are so fu*king boring, I gave zero damns about these two as they showed zero personality especially Yuuya, who as a character would've been utterly pointless if it wasn't for the incredibly obvious twist that he was actually someone else. Aiko could've been a decent character, but she just didn't grasp me at all. Yeah she wasn't exactly human either, but that still didn't change my perspective of her and in the end I feel like she got off way too easily.Now the diver crew consisting of Kazuki, Kaede, Yoshihiko and Haruka were definitely the saving grace when it came to the characters. Each if them actually had a kind of personality, it wasn't amazing, but it was still something and the chemistry between them kept me watching until the final episodes came along and kinda put them in the background and the development choices for them during the last episodes weren't really great, but they still managed to keep me somewhat entertained.Of course there is a bunch of other characters, but they were so forgettable that they just aren't worth mentioning.Art (6/10)Surprisingly enough for a show as mediocre as this, the artstyle was pretty good. The design of the characters gave me a early-mid 2000's nostalgic feel and the suits plus the weapons the divers used were actually pretty cool. There was a nice variety of weapons and each of the diver characters had a specific weapon they liked to use which kinda helped to separate them as individuals instead of making them random cannon fodder, also for weapons that exist in the 2030's they look pretty damn advanced for that time period.

But all things considering, A.I.C.O.: Incarnation is one of the more unique and interesting animes LA had seen yet why does LA feel like LA felt nothing in the process?.Anyways the plot revolves around Yuuya Kanzaki wanting to bring Aiko Tachibana over to Primary Point with a select number of Divers (those who handle and purge the Malignant Matter for money, so think of them as mercenary treasure hunters in...dangerous environments) helping both Yuuya and Aiko getting to Primary Point. On the surface the plot is a typical escort mission while we learn about Aiko, Yuuya and maybe some of the members of the Divers in the process. What really becomes interesting is once the plot twists comes into play and this doesn\'t become a simple ""escort mission"" more like a science experiment gone haywire and we find out the cause and cure for it with character development mainly focused on Aiko and Yuuya because ""main characters"" and the such.There is a villain in all of this of course by the form of Kyousuke Isazu where his driving conflict with Aiko and Yuuya (but mainly Yuuya) makes Isazu a rather sympathetic but ""wrong methods"" kind of villain in the process of it. He\'s not evil per say as it\'s more or less his agenda conflicts heavily with Yuuya and his plans and he will take ANY measures to attain his goal even if his ulterior motives splurges into frame.The plot twists were probably the defining things that kept LA interested in what really happened and it\'s the plot twists that really catalyzed the plot from mere escort mission to something much more. Now mind you, some of the plot twists were coming from a mile away due all the hints but still the majority of the time, the plot twists helped this anime massively into being almost something great from beginning to end.Character-wise well thing is, we do learn much from Aiko being the central character and our audience surrogate along with Yuuya being the one to whisk Aiko and the Divers into the dangerous Primary Point and is the catalyst for the plot to occur thus it\'s rather obvious they get the bulk of the screentime and development what with the revelations and everything. The problem goes to the Divers, they are rather stock typical characters, like the genki carefree Kaede to the motherly Maho and the steadfast leader Daisuke but as much as they essentially guardians and protectors to our main characters, they didn\'t develop that much as characters and they more or less went with the flow of the plot to define their actions in the plot with little to no backstories about them but considering their mercenaries for hire in a ways LA thinks a backstory wasn\'t necessary for two reasons, one they aren\'t the main characters and the the plot isn\'t focused on the Divers and two, they had more chemistry as a team due to their camaraderie that that was all they really needed and no LA isn\'t saying they were dead weight as they did have some impact in the plot in some sense but nonetheless the Diver group weren\'t the central focus of the anime at all.In terms of animation, done by Bones, well from character designs and the beautiful to fully desecrated places shown was GREAT all things considering. All the characters did have a distinct look to them while the background has either a beautiful look to it but mostly the desecrated look that looks like a science experiment gone wrong-look to it. Since this is Bones, the battles should look awesome right?, well LA will say \'decent""  to say the least as most of the battles focus on beam spamming with the damages on the Malignant Matter shown in full force but since there isn\'t exactly ""fighting"" involved, the battle animations are ""limited"" to say the least. Nonetheless the animation was great, expected form Bones.Soooooooooooooooooo...LA watched the English dub for A.I.C.O.: Incarnation (which is why LA didn\'t credit the characters VA when it came up as LA usually does) and ohhhh boy if LA\'s first statement to this review isn\'t saying something well, before LA gets down to the voice work, there\'s a bit of stupidit- history to this dub. Well for one, Netflix picked up the anime but instead of handling the dub themselves or to a studio that knows how to do it, Netflix gave a Korean-based media group to handle it in which they gave most of the casting roles to...Spanish dub voice actors who had NEVER done an English dub before...no seriously. The thing is LA won\'t blame the voice actors because of this because the main cause was the terrible scripting and directing by newbie to the dubbing field Phil Raeymaekers. How bad is the scripting, well how about to the point they made the translations into English quite literal sounding from using ""-chan"", ""-san""  and ""-kan"" into the script instead of going into nicknames or omitting them like most dubs do!, the thing is they weren\'t even consistent with it as they yes DO use the honorifics almost all the time but they don\'t use it with ""sensei"" or sometimes were INCONSISTENT in using the honorifics with this, so they couldn\'t even get that right. LA was nitpicking there but next thing only gets worse, being the deliveries of ALL the voice cast, again LA doesn\'t blame the voice actors because they really weren\'t given any proper direction by the director giving us stilted dull monotoned with consistently small pausing performances and with no emotions to ANY of the lines showing it was quite a ""literally translated script"" and this quite obviously HEAVILY impacted LA watching the anime. LA doesn\'t know if felt like LA both was invested in or was up to date with the plot and characters but not WHENEVER any of the characters spoke, LA knew and followed the plot yet didn\'t care all at the same time and worse yet have emotionally impactful moments be reduced to dull monotoned performances and this happened VERY often considering the plot LA was talking about. LA thinks some of the worse dubs is when one, your taken off the experience in the world the anime made itself and two, if your invested in the plot and it\'s characters yet doesn\'t give a crap about what\'s happening because the vocal work is soo terrible. Like if LA would have sum up the vocal work it\'ll have to be like one of those dubs made TWO DECADES ago but somehow was released in 2018, this isn\'t Garzey Wing levels of terrible dubbing but DAMN it\'s close. Oh and one more thing is that LA did watch one episode that was in Japanese dubbed and it was fine, LA instantly knew the situation (even though LA already knew it), LA got attached to the characters much faster and LA kept up with the plot. Seriously A.I.C.O.: Incarnation\'s dub both taught LA how important voice work is to ANY media as well how NOT to make a Japanese to English dub. Since LA does this for every English dub LA comes across LA awards A.I.C.O.: Incarnation the first E Rank in terms of dubbing because it fricikin\' deserves it!, seriously Netflix what in the fuck were you thinking?*ahem* A.I.C.O.: Incarnation was one of the more unique sci-fi animes LA seen in 2018 with plot twists weaving together to make a VERY interesting story of a scientist redemption, to right his wrongs. Sure the character department is lacking in some areas and some of the plot twists were kinda foreshadowed and the god awful English dub didn\'t help to the point of not even being a ""so bad, it\'s good"" situation, it\'s just THAT bad, but all things considered with it\'s decent animation done by Bones and especially with the scope of the anime it was going for that for the most part delivered to tell a full story and this being a Bones original is quite something. A.I.C.O.: Incarnation isn\'t perfect let alone the ""Best Anime of 2018"" for LA but it came and gave LA\'s expected expectations of what kind of premise and story it had in mind and it delivered.Note - If LA watched the Japanese dub instead then the Sound rating would have easily been a 7 or 8 (again aforementioned LA watched at least one episode in Japanese to gauge a comparison to it\'s English counterpart)  but LA only gave the Sound a 2 because LA watched the majority of anime in English dub thus LA gave it a 2. dangerous environments) helping both Yuuya and Aiko getting to Primary Point.

Some genuine mystique is built up around the Matter and its\' role in the world, and the pacing works well.After that, though, I think my final impression of the series gradually turned into something a little above average at best.There are some solid parts to the series overall.  The mechanical designs of the vehicles are pretty good and are well-animated CG, and there was...some nice effects work on the synthetic suits and other technological elements.  They also picked really fun intro and outro songs, I enjoyed those a lot.For a while, I watched with the impression that the story was going to turn into something interesting, and say something I hadn\'t heard on the subject of human-machine coexistence.  The setup of the Matter, artificial organisms, and the emphasis on medical technology and life-saving surgeries seemed novel in its\' treatment, at least at first.  But all the payoffs fell short of my expectations, and the story gradually unfolded into a much sloppier and more generic take on the subject.There are three big problems with the storytelling in this show.One is the confused morality it attempts to use throughout when talking about the moral rights (or lack thereof) of synthetic beings, which feels more pedantic and poorly defined the more the story tries to explore it in any depth.  This is most clearly seen in Yuuya\'s character, especially in the latter half of the series, and the main justification for his disregard for the rights of artificial life seems to be the fact that he\'s a smart cookie scientist so shut up.  Conversely, anyone arguing for the intrinsic value of said artificial life exclusively does so through the ""but I like them and my feelings are real so they must be real too"" empathic argument, which, again, is sloppy and unsatisfying.  So it strikes out on both counts, in my opinion.  In the end we *mostly* get the lazy light/dark bio/artificial we-cannot-mingle apartheid mentality, which was just a disappointment.The second is the way the story executes its\' attempts at thrilling twists, which often *almost* succeed, but which either rely on narrative ass-pulls, or - in one very important case - confuse things to the point of near contradiction, only to be (mostly?) patched by borderline retroactive storytelling (e.g. Aiko\'s eyes; you\'ll know it when you see it).  The result is that there is no point where these twists directly build off a past hint or event without introducing outright new information that was previously hidden from the viewer, and impossible to obtain beforehand.  The result is that I basically shrug and throw my hands in the air whenever it happens - because how am I supposed to even try to predict a twist that only the writer can see coming?  (This is a classic mistake in bad mystery story writing.  The reader should *always* be given just enough information to figure out who killed who with what and when, IF they care to put in the effort before reading what the protagonist detective thinks.  That\'s part of the fun.  There\'s no point to this, however, if it turns out that the real killer escapes all detection by everybody until the final act, and only appears at the very end, impossible to predict beforehand.  That\'s not a mystery; that\'s a joke.  Or cell assembler #3.)The third is the fleshing-out of the technology.  Most of the story is grounded in the concept of the ""cell assemblers"", which are basically synthetic biological cells which mimic their biological counterparts.  At first, things seem to tick along pretty well in the story.  The most outlandish thing we see is the ""Matter"", the uncontrolled bio-hazard which coats a good chunk of the local landscape; but it behaves in ways that seem plausible despite its\' alien and uncontrolled mystique.  However, as the story progresses, things become increasingly murky in terms of how things work or what we can even expect to be possible, and the show dabbles in random telepathy and spontaneous clairvoyance that have NO clear or even attempted explanation other than ""synthetic biology did it.  somehow."".  This means that the stakes and the dramatic tension become increasingly murky as well.  And that\'s half the story right there, really.  I think the most blatant example of this is the entire subplot for Isazu and his daughter, especially right near the end.  What starts as a tragic bond between father and daughter becomes an increasingly scattered and cluttered mess of a dramatic subplot that really comes out of left field, culminating in some borderline nonsensical biotech megalomania that feels awkward and shoehorned in.  (In fact, a lot of the final conflicts in the last four episodes feel awkwardly bolted-on in this way, rather than clear logical extensions of what came before.)Aside from those glaring issues, the action scenes were decent overall despite an occasional choppy shot, but I will admit that endless scenes of relatively samey Matter attacks did start to get old sooner rather than later.  The voice work was decent, no real complaints there.  The setting art was a bit on the darker and more unstimulating side, but I think it was serviceable.One general complaint is that there wasn\'t much character development after episode 4 or so.  Most of the characters don\'t really grow or change in significant ways, and most of their interactions are either cocky battle chatter or scared yelling, without much depth or insight into who they are or why they live the lives they do (aside from one rather awkwardly blatant scene on an outpost rooftop...).  As well, for all the screentime Nanbara gets, I didn\'t really feel like her character contributed much to the story other than some occasional narrative convenience and a halfhearted take on political intrigue.  Her stance on why the matter shouldn\'t be destroyed, which is practically her defining character trait, is never really clarified or challenged in any depth, and becomes moot to the story except as a means to buy time for other characters later in the story.  She could have either been made more relevant, or cut near entirely.The scenes that aren\'t mostly banter or battle cries are fine where the story manages to keep itself coherent and on the rails.  But Aiko is a mostly passive and reactive protagonist who is literally shuttled through the story from start to end, and this is a serious problem in itself when most of the story is centered around her point of view.  Many of the action scenes don\'t even involve her all that much, other than to show that she still exists and is struggling with the situation.  The only active decision(s) she makes after episode 2 is to keep going on this field trip in the first place, but her only real strengths are that she\'s a nice person and has a high pain tolerance.  That\'s about it.In short, this show initially seemed to offer something fresh, but ultimately fails to deliver on that impression.  If you want a half-decent scifi action show to burn through one afternoon, this is fine for that, but I don\'t specifically recommend it beyond the first or second episode.  Skim through it if you want to see more of the tank and vehicle designs though, they\'re pretty fun to watch as they scoot around.Thanks for reading. some nice effects work on the synthetic suits and other technological elements.

(In fact, a lot of the final conflicts in the last four episodes feel awkwardly bolted-on in this way, rather than clear logical extensions of what came before.)Aside from those glaring issues, the action scenes were decent overall despite an occasional choppy shot, but I will admit that endless scenes of relatively samey Matter attacks did start to get old sooner rather than later.  The voice work was decent, no real complaints there.  The setting art was a bit on the darker and more unstimulating side, but I think it was serviceable.One general complaint is that there wasn\'t much character development after episode 4 or so.  Most of the characters don\'t really grow or change in significant ways, and most of their interactions are either cocky battle chatter or scared yelling, without much depth or insight into who they are or why they live the lives they do (aside from one rather awkwardly blatant scene on an outpost rooftop...).  As well, for all the screentime Nanbara gets, I didn\'t really feel like her character contributed much to the story other than some occasional narrative convenience and a halfhearted take on political intrigue.  Her stance on why the matter shouldn\'t be destroyed, which is practically her defining character trait, is never really clarified or challenged in any depth, and becomes moot to the story except as a means to buy time for other characters later in the story.  She could have either been made more relevant, or cut near entirely.The scenes that aren\'t mostly banter or battle cries are fine where the story manages to keep itself coherent and on the rails.  But Aiko is a mostly passive and reactive protagonist who is literally shuttled through the story from start to end, and this is a serious problem in itself when most of the story is centered around her point of view.  Many of the action scenes don\'t even involve her all that much, other than to show that she still exists and is struggling with the situation.  The only active decision(s) she makes after episode 2 is to keep going on this field trip in the first place, but her only real strengths are that she\'s a nice person and has a high pain tolerance.  That\'s about it.In short, this show initially seemed to offer something fresh, but ultimately fails to deliver on that impression.  If you want a half-decent scifi action show to burn through one afternoon, this is fine for that, but I don\'t specifically recommend it beyond the first or second episode.  Skim through it if you want to see more of the tank and vehicle designs though, they\'re pretty fun to watch as they scoot around.Thanks for reading.', ""Bones..

For character design there really wasn\'t anything special. For Kanzaki lookwise reminded me greatly of Inaho Kaizuka from Aldnoah Zero and will definitely blend in to generic anime characters in my memory. I think the diver suits with the different splashes of color were the most notable outfit of the show.The enemy in this show, the ""matter"", isn\'t anything to write home about either think along the fleshy blob that Tetsuo became in Akira ....Honestly the first couple episodes before the characters venture outside the safety of the city is probably where the setting looked best. Afterwards most scenery is either blocked out by the matter\'s ability to produce mist or takes place within a research facility. The colors used often seemed dreary and bleak to me as well, and it was so rarely changed that it eventually felt visually boring to me. Also the repeated use of Aiko\'s memories throughout the show were a bit apparent as well to me. It never looked exactly bad, but none of it was exceptional or memorable either.The story of this anime falls slightly to the better side. Thematically the focus seemed explore is there a difference between humans and clones of humans if they retain the same ability to feel and make decisions. The politics of the show between the organization responsible for dealing with the artificial organisms (the name escapes me) and the state government was able to interest me as well. There ideals of taking any means to progress your nation face off against respecting human lives. Automatic bonus points are applied too just for having a satisfying conclusion to the show, I\'ve watched too many animes lately that finish the season never to be seen from again. The show leaves enough clues lying around where some of the ""twists"" were fairly predictable which isn\'t a mark against it. Enjoyment can still be had when the anticipations you have are met by the show.I\'ll eventually get better at writing about sound track but I definitely enjoyed the opening and ending.Finally I\'ll just lightly touch on the characters. For only 12 episodes it would be a very hard task to have deep characterization for the entire cast. Unsurprisingly many of the supporting characters don\'t get to shine at all. We definitely get to see the conflicts and growth of the main two, Aiko and Kanzaki which I personally thought was well done. Specifically Kanzaki\'s realization of what he initially started out to do and his inability to accomplish this was well done. We get to see minor character growth in Kaede and Kazuki, but really any characters outside of Aiko and Kanzaki are still underdeveloped imo.6/10 score - Nothing revolutionary thematically, but it presents its thoughts well. Visually the quality was alright but I personally thought it was bleak and thus boring throughout the show. Plot was fine, enjoyed the main characters but side characters weren\'t shown much love.

I\'d say it is a bit predictable though- I was able to pinpoint certain key points mid-series, but I still watched the whole thing just to make sure I was correct.As someone who loves sci-fi and more ""scientific"" anime, this definitely hit all my check boxes for a simple binge watching afternoon when you have nothing better to do. 7/10 development of the MC in the end.

There are many of them, but they all play off each other well and have decent motivations on what they want to do with their lives. I did particularly like the whole government vs the regular people going into the Burst. This is an old story beat of course, but there are some good ideas behind the specific take on the show and the motivations are done pretty decently as well. They are easy to understand and do demonstrate some character growth and regression (into a bad person) at times. The main character Aiko (or Aico)...however has a few problems. Aiko is a little bit clueless at times. Now this is somewhat acceptable, as she is thrust into a situation that she has no clue how to partake in. But her level of cluelessness is a bit too much and at times, off putting. She constantly suffers from that anime trope of just repeating what characters say or explaining things too far and not letting the viewer come to terms with the scenery or situation. This is probably the biggest hinderance on the series, as the concept of the Burst and idea of how and why it spread is actually quite interesting. I did find enjoyment in the sci-fi aspects of the show, but the main character is extremely hard to root for at times, and her personality is extremely lacking to really dive into who she is and how her existence affects the show as a whole.Sound:The soundscape of the show is a bit lacking. This is partially due to the fact that there aren\'t many memorable tracks besides the opening and ending. This is fine, as there are a lot of shows like this, but for this show specifically, the extra feeling that could have been achieved from this soundscape would have addd so much more to the idea of dread and looming from the Burst. The opening is very well made, and the song is nice and reflective of the anime as a whole. The ending is one of those reflective pieces that rather than juxtapose, it helps to remind you of what you\'re watching and the motivations and end goal of the characters. The ambient sounds and incidental music do help to make the feeling more real, but they would have been largely benefited from actual reoccurring tracks, than just sounds and small ambient music that dots the score. The sound design is pretty good, with some believable sounds for the mechs as well as the Burst having some nice ""goo-like"" sounds that help to show how the Burst would sound to the characters as well.Art:The art style is interesting. Its extremely cliched and does require some work, but stuff like the Burst are animated pretty well and do convey the venom-like nature of the disease. The movement of the mechs are pretty well done, but their use of CGI is a bit smooth. The characters have some good animation where the emotional drama and tensions are at highs, which helps to drive the scene or action as important, but scenes where there aren\'t many actions taking place, or are there for character development aren\'t being fully utilized by the animation team and just seem lackluster and out of place compared to the heavy action scenes in terms of animation. The art style is also an interesting one too, in which the anime falls victim to the ""redness"" when it comes to the joints of Aiko. This is a bit annoying to look at, as it is quite bright in this show and does clash with the dark muted colors of the rest of the show.Overall:A.I.C.O Incarnation is a pretty decent sci-fi action show that can be emotional at times. There are some good and bad parts to it. Honestly, the best way to watch the show is probably by foregoing any huge emotional ideas one would get from the show, and just watch it for fun.

It was an interesting watch, so here is my point of view on it.Story: 6 - A 6 is considered fair on this site, and this is what this anime deserved. It had an interesting, but overused premise, a girl who is the key to saving the world. This is actually a really generalized description of the story, but it's quite accurate. We've seen many shows with this sort of premise. Any fan would know what I'm talking about. But this show did it decent enough, it isn't anything revolutionary, but done well enough...to be understood. The story is fairly understandable, with reasonable development throughout the series.

But overall, the design of the suits, weapons, monsters, and technology were done very well.Sound: 6 - You know, I really didn't notice the music during my time watching this show.

There is an implied, or confirmed?, romantic or mutual feeling between the male character, who is like in middle school, and a boy. Who is actually an adult male, Yeah this gets weird. There was some good character development from the sides during the show. But there was also unnecessary drama and tension which only just brings this show down.

Such a great storie, great plot twists, are presented to us in the most simple of ways, whereas it could`ve been dramatized. While irrelevant moments are dragged with vain information. One of those unecessary moments, for example, would be dialogues or scenes with government agencies/scientists, talking about politics or projects with weird names/acronym. Don\'t think that I\'m belittling just for being...""politics"" or ""science stuff"", saying that those things weren\'t necessary. On the contrary, they would make much more sense if were better elaborated or explained with more emphasis if they had the time (24 eps would be a good time to properly develop this world imo). Everytime they started talking about any project or politics, I wandered to other place, thinking to myself why on Earth we need to see this agencie if they have no effect whatsoever in the main characters.

Then I actually started to get more into it as the series progressed. It was very unique and none of the characters looked the same, I loved it.Sound; 8/10I absolutely loved the voice acting in this anime, I don\'t usually watch dubs but I really liked it.

Most dubs are pretty fucking terrible, but this one was actually very well done.Characters; 7/10Some of the characters were just well, annoying.

Mechas, check. A lot of inspirations from other works ? I think yeah.Ever heard of “Saya no Uta” or “Sidonia no Kishi”? The basics are the same, humanity is endangered and needs to be protected or saved. And even if it wasn’t very original it had a nice plot twist that made it interesting.The art 8/10 :I think that for an anime that hasn’t had a lot of advertisement this art and design should be seen by more...people, it’s clear and corresponds to the vibes the story wants to give you. From the Matter’s design to it’s colors it gives a sense of worry and danger.  The 3D was actually really decent and used in correct ways, that is not used for the lazyness of some parts but really used for some tricky shots or time consuming scenes to draw.The sound 9/10 :The soundtrack is what kept me along with everything else in “The Zone”, they knew when to give breaks with calm music or even break it with a very aggressive soundtrack to break that sense of security creating doubt even in calm periods.The characters 5/10 :This is the tricky part, because you never really know who is who, they are kind of a mess because some characters didn’t get some proper details and were just there doing their thing. The best example for that is Isazu, he is just and only the villain.The enjoyment 10/10 :This was a hell of a ride, it had everything I liked, from Mechas to some kind of Lovecraftian Sci-Fi. As it is I think I’d put it in my top 25 for the enjoyment, if you have some time ahead of you I recommend to watch it more like and movie and not episode by episode, just watch everything straight, the experience and feeling is awesome. people, it’s clear and corresponds to the vibes the story wants to give you.

Incarnation is a sci-fi-thrill story with a unique and interesting plot and world. The dialogue, voice acting, and characters are a relative weakness, but the show is generally engaging and interesting. If you enjoy plot-driven sci-fi shows and don’t mind under-developed characters, this may be of interest to you.Story: 7/10The plot is intriguing, although the story is not always clear, and the viewer is thrown into the middle of a scene without any background knowledge at times. The plot is a relative strength for the show, and is its most redeeming quality. It is unique, and the world-building is interesting, although the story...is sometimes predictable.Art: 7/10The art style is simplistic but pretty. It is fitting for the story and helps to illustrate the unique world.Sound: 7/10The music is great, the voice acting is poor, and the sound effects are sufficient. Part of the issues with the voice acting revolves around the terribly written dialogue, so I am not weighting it as heavily in this area.Characters: 4/10The main protagonist is interesting, although the dialogue-writing is horrific and over-the-top in certain scenes. The protagonist also starts off with a very generic, ""damsel in distress"" vibe which does provide room for growth but makes her unlikable at first. Some characters do develop as the story progresses, while others stagnate. Overall, the characters could be worse, but they aren’t very memorable and are generally not well-developed.Enjoyment: 7/10This was one of the first Netflix original anime that I found truly enjoyable to watch, mainly because of the engaging plot.Overall: 6.4/10A.I.C.O.

Still very good art, but poor character development and a story maybe too intricated definitely holds this work down.Especially regarding the characters, the feeling I had during the whole 12 episodes was that I didn't care about them, or that they didn't give me a reason to do it. The supporting cast especially is very bland, very similar to each other and it looks...like it's there just to serve as a mere help to the MC, without a lot of involvement. Even Aiko and Kanzaki, the two Mains, aren't very charismatic, and apart from some predictables twists they basically don't get any character development.The story doesn't support them much, despite the good premises: a lot of parts seem forced down the throat of the watcher, some are not even explained very much and felt flat. It does stand on the same rails from the start of the mission, even if some moments kinda repay the attention you give to the anime.Artistic wise, it's Bones, so you know you're getting very good animations and sound, even if this last characteristic was kinda absent here, in the sense that is very generic sometimes, and both OP and ED aren't any special. Voice acting is good (I watched it subbed).Overall, I did enjoy it in the first 4-5 episodes, but the more I watched, the more it kinda fell for me. Maybe the fact that I expected a lot from this influenced me, as it isn't a bad anime per se, but it's not a great anime either. With two cours and a better writing, it could've been nicer and more enjoyable, but with only 12 episodes and not very good characters, it's just a fine show. like it's there just to serve as a mere help to the MC, without a lot of involvement.

It follows female protagonist Aiko Tachibana and male deuteragonist Yuuya Kanzaki in their journey to reverse the negative effects of the 'matter' (an organism that expands and absorbs humans that was thrust into existence because of the biological process that produced Aiko's artificial body) that were produced during a life-saving experiment on Aiko Tachibana after a car crash. This story is well articulated and documented throughout the series with vivid flashbacks and pivotal events (such as saving Aiko from the Defence agency and the sacrifice Shinoyama made to continue...with progression. Although the story was excellent, the character development wasn't fully considered (including the short antagonizing forces of Isazu and the defence force). Nonetheless, worthy of binge watching (As I have done...)Story:As described in my overview, the story is well articulated and logical within the circumstances, there were no 'MC goes berserk to save everyone' scenes which were a shame but still lead to a mature progression. The beginning of the series was a mystery to grasp as it shows the Divers amidst a group mission so it was difficult to grasp the overall presence of the story and the premises of the character that way too. Nonetheless, everything was explained by episode 2 and even in depth by episode 3 with the introduction of Kanzaki underway - This series took more care in maintaining characters rather than killing them off (apart from Shino and a few unlucky pursuit Divers) which made it less edgy or shock inducing. 7/10 in terms of plot and eventsArt & Sound:Art & Sound are as expected with any normal anime, there were a mix of CGI scenes but I noticed that Netflix don't have a standard against CGI as noticed with other projects they've licensed out (Ajin, Blame, Kengan Ashura etc.) but CGI used in this series followed its true form of imitating 2D animation techniques. Sound wasn't too surprising, as expected quality for a Netflix-funded project. 7/10 for both Art & Sound.Character Development:I'd say the larger events could be considered character development (where Kanzaki is revealed to be Dr. Yura and Aiko revealed to be the artificial body + brain) and such it could have been improved but for the duration of this series, it did a great job of finishing with a satisfying character palette - deuteragonist Kanzaki managed to maintain both Aiko bodies as well as his own artificial body, Dr. Isazu's daughter managed to wake from her comatose state, Aiko's brother and mother were confirmed to be alive and were saved and many more characters were maintained satisfyingly. Overall a good wrap up of character development. 8/10Enjoyment:The general premise of a dystopian Japanese society attracted me to this series but I was a bit personally underwhelmed about how the story progressed. It followed a text-book route of getting from point A. to B. with antagonizing obstacles but that's pretty much it; I would have liked some shounen inspired action scenes where deuteragonist Kanzaki saves the day after transforming into some ultimate being that can fend off the matter attacks but it would've brought down the rating even more. Overall enjoyment 6/10, the story could've been more dramatized if there were pivotal deaths earlier on or toward the end in order to reach a climactic state.Thanks for reading :) with progression.

Incarnation forgettable, and I think you may as well.The experience of watching this story unfold, the tale of an unexpected side effect that stemmed from the advancement of science in a modern world, left me confused and exhausted. The pacing of the story was littered with exposition that reminded me of the times I would cram before a test, leaving little room for us to imagine or be taken for a ride. The details of such an interesting sci-fi story was lectured onto the watcher with the same tone as a historian repeating an event for the past twenty years, and the...enthusiasm I had for watching reflected this. Had this story been given more time, perhaps another dozen episodes, there could have been a chance to fix it. As it stands I would rather have read a spoiled synopsis.The art was wonderful for the most part. I enjoyed the stylization of the characters and the detail given to the eyes of characters, but found myself considerably disappointed at times at having to bear witness to so much gray during much of the story. A medium capable of such visual wonders turning so dim was upsetting. Despite this issue, the visuals were pleasant during their best and simply uninteresting at the worst.The music, voice acting, and sound effects were immersive and excellent throughout. The soundtrack was wonderful and by far the most positive part of the viewing experience. There was a point where I considered simply listening to the series rather than observing because the sound design did the series justice at every point.The character's development was rushed and had no lead up. There were actions of characters that I could not either justify nor understand. There were actions that came out of nowhere and other times felt contrived. This ruined my connection to the characters in a series that was meant to lean heavily on the feelings of characters. This made it incredibly difficult to actually become interested in anything any character did. I consider no personality memorable, nor any of their actions.The experience was short and bitter sweet. I saw great potential in a work that fell short of those expectations, and this left me disappointed. Despite this, I do not regret watching this, as it still had high points that still made me feel and desire for more. It simply did not make me feel that way for enough time to consider it a recommendation, nor do I ever think this would be something I would ever watch again. If you are looking for anything to watch and stumble upon this, you could do worse. If you are looking for an unforgettable experience, do not get your hopes up.

Stop simping."", 'One thing you cannot take away from A.I.C.O and is worth witnessing even if you don\'t make through the entire show, is the artwork. It\'s superb, horrific, fascinating, creative, disgusting, and definitely a direction that is rarely pursued. They start and end strongly in this area, and if you are a fan of animation and art in general this show is worth the watch for the visuals alone. With that said, **SPOILERS** ahead.What makes the artwork great is ""The Matter"". What the hell is The Matter? It\'s basically a ""grey goo"", but based on multi-cellular organisms and how they form structures at the cellular level....In the dangerous zone The Matter occupies, it is absolutely everywhere, convering absolutely everything. More than that, it is capable of forming all kinds of disgusting structures and traps to impale, engulf, decapitate and/or smash to smitherines any organism or vehicle containing life forms that it encounters within it\'s territory. If you\'ve seen the horror film Life, this is basically what you could expect the monster to turn into for the sequel, ""Life 2: Red Dead Earth"". It\'s terrifying and super fresh.Unfortunately, I feel a bit let down with the initially promising journey into the matter-infested zone by the ""divers"" and the somewhat mysterious Aico. There was so much opportunity with this setting, with this cast of characters - so much to explore. But in the end, I could not help but feel that despite the very competent production team and excellent ingredients, and the undeniable artistic achievement in animating the unique countermeasures of the divers against the matter and the matter\'s relentless and horrific hostility towards the divers - there just wasn\'t a very compelling narrative to go along with the stunning presentation. Both the political intrigue and secret power games angle that revolves around the origins of The Matter and the value of it and Aico as specimes of artificial life, and the journey of Aico and the divers into the heart of The Matter fell flat and failed to tie into each other despite the efforts of the writers. Instead of the smart, ruthless nature of characters with competing aims making for interesting interactions, double-crosses, and outplays - it just kind of devolves into a power of friendship, oh look the bad guy has gone mad, wow made it just in time kind of thing... somehow they let this of all things get boring. I suspect they were playing it safe, and it really left huge cavity in the story and characters department that no amount of ingenious artwork was going to make up for.Now, on balance this isn\'t really a bad show. There\'s more to like about this probably, and it is at least more consistent and more ambitious with better production values and pacing, than other shows I\'ve given higher ratings. However, as a whole the drag in the story and characters department is so significant towards the end that it becomes hard to pay attention to anything but the visuals - and that\'s a disaster for this show because the visuals play off of the tense ""horror"" element. With no investment in the characters, or their situation, it\'s very hard to do anything but shrug when they are trying to fend off The Matter.Another gripe I have is that they really left no opening for a follow-up or spin-off. I think that would have been appropriate here - why does The Matter have to die? Unfortunately, this is a one and done and it wasn\'t done right. Still, it\'s a very watchable and very well drawn work that I recommend despite my criticism of it. I\'m just upset that it didn\'t end up sticking the landing, because it really could have been great.

It has an idea, it somewhat delivers on it. That's most of the show.The first two episodes build the story up relatively well.

Most of the time when it gets brought up around me, I just automatically think 'ah, that's the body horror waifu show'.Not to be blunt or unnecessarily vulgar, but that really is all that it is. The whole time I was watching this, I couldn't shake the feeling that this show was just the director blowing Netflix's money on his weird fetish. I don't know what that says about me, or where I spend my time on the internet, but it was definitely uncomfortable and deliberate.There...are a lot of original anime on Netflix now, and I mentally group them into being one super-genre; eleven-to-thirteen episode shows with highly developed aesthetics, blending two dissonant genres, with a lot of piano on a light soundtrack. They work out fine about fifty/fifty. This is one of the failures.AICO sets out to do a lot of ambitious things thematically, tackling questions about the perception of selfhood and inherent 'realness', familial issues, loss, and scientific progress. But it seems like every statement it has to make is weighed down or half-formed; even its climactic conflict feels clumsy and ineffectual. If I could go back in time, I would've made the writers give every single script about another ten or twenty passes. It's thirteen episodes. If this was a boat on a lake, the floor of it would be swiss cheese. You have got to get this stuff airtight before you put it out there for the world to see. There have to be actual stakes in a story that's written like it's supposed to have stakes.The characters are fairly flat, with only the two leads really receiving any depth or care in their writing. I did find Aiko sympathetic, even though she's got a very bland sad-girl-protagonist personality.The art is actually very pretty, when it's not CGI or focused on writhing masses of flesh. I found some of the clothing/costume design disappointing and I think the mechanical design also needed a lot more polish than what it got, or at least another perspective. A lot of the backgrounds felt too empty or undetailed, as well. The direction otherwise is very solid and it generally has good character design.The soundtrack is also very solid, though it doesn't necessarily stand out and I don't listen to pieces from it on my own time. I never found myself annoyed or disappointed in the music, but that also lends to the fact that it's very generic. If you've heard light piano in a Netflix original, you've heard this show's OST. I do recall the opening theme being bad enough that I skipped it every time, though.I would like to point out that Takehito Koyasu is in this, and for some reason or another he's serving full DIO in his performance.

It pulled a lot of elements from popular anime (you will DEFINITELY see a lot of Attack on Titan in this) which showed how creative the creators were.A lot of anime now-a-days have turned into a cutesy copying cesspool of junk & this is one of them.Animation can NOT save a bad plot.I couldn't even watch this as background noise,...it was so so bad. it was so so bad."", 'Edit: I finished the show and have rewritten this review here, so the side says I\'ve watched 8 eps but I finished and updated it here.I tried AICO because I wanted to start watching ""lower ranking"" anime. I have wonder why AICO is only a 6.8 at the time of this writing. It\'s a fun SciFi mech that could be described as Made In Abyss x Evangelion. Frankly, I think everyone should give it a chance because its score is sooooo underrepresentative.TLDR: Categorically - 7/8/8/8/9. Overall: 8/10. I can\'t give it a 10, but I would say that this is an excellent Sci-Fi...anime that seems somewhat grounded in a possible future (based on my own foundational level of synthetic biology and neuroscience). It has some eye-rolling dialogue now and then but I\'d say it hits most of the notes right.This show is riddled with twists, with at least one per episode. The characters are excellent, each with their own motivations and goals. Their unique personalities intertwine to produce drama, action, romance, tension, etc. All the loose ends in the story are tied up by the finale, which is an impressive feat. The ending is very well-done, and that\'s all I\'ll say about it because I refuse to spoil any of it for anyone. The Matter is a cool antagonist that\'s everchanging which keeps things fresh.Overall, I think AICO is definitely worth watching. I don\'t understand why it\'s ranked so poorly on MAL, my guess is that it\'s because it\'s a Netflix show. I will admit the VA performance of some of the supporting characters in English isn\'t perfect, but it\'s not half bad.

I struggle to say. Perhaps the animation is pretty decent quality, and no bad CGI was used for the monsters, but it was actually well animated.Other than that, nothing. This show is one where the story is just rushing past everything at a breakneck pace in order to cram enough plot to get to the conclusion. What I mean is that you\'re given info dumps left and right, and...random characters you don\'t know very well and never will know very well will be pulling the plot forward. You never really get to understand much of the combat, nor does the show care. There\'s no relevant development of any characters. Rather, they just ""brave it through"" and ""gain a new sense of motivation"" without much rhyme or reason. Basically, our main character is just dragged along with peoples\' agenda for the large majority of the show, and doesn\'t have much motivation themself. You never really get to know any characters particularly well, other than the ones where they shove flashbacks in order to artificially make you think more of a random stranger that\'s dying, doing something reckless, or going against the main character and her comrades. Our main character is merely taken for the ride because she\'s an important object, a ""key"" and that\'s exactly how she functions for the entire story. She\'s a mere ornament to the characters that are carrying her to ""ground zero"" and any involvement of her being useful is due to the plot thinking that she can\'t literally be a useless sack of garbage for the entire show. She somehow goes through a transformation in character and gains a new sense of hope and drive to save the world within the few minutes of character development allotted to her. She then becomes magically useful and mentally resilient in the short period in around 5 minutes. Her comrades that are going with her to ground zero? Absolutely nothing about them is revealed, and only surface parts of their personality are ever revealed, but guess what, I\'m supposed to care when one of them dies, or when one of them falls in love with Aico. What\'s the reason for them to be risking their lives in the first place? What\'s their determination? It\'s never explained really.What about the action packed adventure towards the goal that Aico and her team are doing? Surely the fighting is amazing. Yeah, well I can\'t say much about the choreography: its pretty decent, it\'s just that it\'s just them fighting tentacle monsters over and over again, with them deploying a ""kill gate"" at the end of each area. This gets repeated 4-5 times, with minor changes in the enemy. Was it really necessary for there to be so many repetitive sequences other than to waste screen time that desperately needed to be reallocated to something more important? Plus, the extremely slow paced dialogue that reveals little to nothing and the side arc with Yuzuha are just extremely painful to sit through even at 4x speed. Was it necessary for there to be so many parallel stories going at once when they couldn\'t even get the ""main story"" done well? There\'s a reason why this show is 12 episodes, rushes past so much plot, yet does so little with any interest with making characters have any development or personality.And For what exactly? What exactly is the plot rushing for? Nothing amazing, let me tell you. The overarching plot isn\'t that complicated, the story is just focused on the wrong things. Repetitive action scenes, Yuzuha/side arcs/random dialogue/repeated flashbacks take up an extremely large portion of the story when there should have been more worldbuilding onto what exactly the matter is,  what divers do, and how they adapt to different situations. It would have been so much better if there were separate story arcs rather than a single, long, boring and convoluted story arc that goes from 0-100. There\'s no introductory arc that really needed to happen. There really needed to be more time for Aico to adapt to the circumstances and rather than just have a billion info dumps, have natural way of producing information to Aico and make it more of a linear and slow paced  story.

The plot, focusing around a teenage girl who we\'re supposed to assume is ""normal"" is broken fairly quickly, though I wish there would have been more preamble before that point. The story only gives you what you need to knowright as it becomes important - there was a major \'plot twist\' later on that might\'ve had an effect if I\'d actually known what was going on with the characters.However, A.I.C.O makes up for a lot of its flaws with killer worldbuilding and art - the \'Matter\' has taken over part of Japan and ravenously devours anything that enters its...domain. This is the first thing we\'re exposed to in the first episode, and it\'s great. The main plot, without revealing much (though, it\'s not like revealing it would even be much of a pain, it\'s pretty much exposed from episode one) has our cast of characters going deep in to the domain of the \'Matter\'. It\'s a very good core concept, and the landscapes it portrays are quite amazing, hence the \'eight\' in art.To be honest, if you care about character in this kind of story, you won\'t enjoy it, but I had a good time just due to the spectacle and the quality of the combat.

While watching it I had the feeling that I had already seen something similar before, can\'t pinpoint what it was though. It had that ""roadtrip""-feeling about it. It was that perfectly linear story, where they progressed farther with every episode.I really enjoyed that full package. All in all I\'d say that story...and animation deserves a solid 8/10.

No, scratch that, it isn\'t, which is the problem.  It\'s not a bad anime, and compared to other shows I\'ve given similar ratings to, I think it actually has some intriguing elements with surprisingly few deep faults, but in the end, everything just sort of washes out to become part of the pack, and never really set itself apart.How\'s the story?  Honestly, it\'s pretty basic for an action-adventure with a contained plot: characters want to get from point A to point B and there\'s a lot of shit in their way.  There are some more interesting...notes of intrigue than that, but the story is dominated by the ""harrowing journey"" that doesn\'t really have an epic scope or scale.  It has one or two commendable twists, but not enough is really done with them to say they make the show.  And it has one or two twists that take awayThe art is pretty good.  The action scenes manage to keep tension going with good choreography, and the character designs all look nice.  But there\'s really nothing spectacular here, either: the series consists of facing down against endless piles and tendrils of blackish red goop in dark, misty environments.  Now and again the blackish red goop will take on another form or you\'ll see an amoeba-person or something like that, but even when they do mix it up, with various structures and a somewhat clever but not really praiseworthy use of color distinction in the last episodes, it\'s still serviceable, not a real feast for the eyesWatching it subtitled, the voice actors all did at least OK, but the overall sound was... nothing to write home about, and the opening and ending were bland and forgettable, the kind that I would skip (a rarity for me) even if Netflix didn\'t make the prospect easy bordering on automatic.  Maybe I\'m missing some subtleties here, but I didn\'t see any reason to rate it above a passing grade  -- nothing\'s truly godawful, but neither is anything really memorable.The characters are pretty similar, and for character that\'s a bigger sin.  The main character, Aiko, is the only one I care about or would look forward to seeing.  That\'s not terrible; main characters are often bland vessels and the weakest parts of their show, but this thing has a pretty huge cast for what it is including seven supporting members of the away team, a two man home team, Government Lady, the Obsessive Doctor, and at least a couple incidentals.  The creators spread their effort too thin; I feel like this could have been a wildly better production had they deleted (or handed red shirts to) about half the cast.  We didn\'t need a full four hired guns, we didn\'t need two ""in on it"" troopers, we didn\'t need so many scenes especially early with Government Lady or the two doctors... that\'s a lot of running time to waste.  They don\'t totally fail to make a connection, which is why I wouldn\'t rate this lower, but the entire cast (again, bar Aiko, who gets some decent growth and exploration despite starting out as an object going with the flow) is just sort of superficial.In the end, I feel like this story could have been a really good two hour movie, with a tighter focus on the couple of characters we do or should care about.  As a twelve episode season, A.I.C.O. feels rather bloated.  It didn\'t lose my interest at any point, at least, so I guess it did justify its existence, but it didn\'t go beyond that, didn\'t impress, and if not for forcing myself to engage with it by thinking enough to write this review, I suspect I would forget it entirely the next time something a little interesting arrived to occupy part of my mind.

Though, in this case it's the latter.Have you ever heard of that scenario when a mutated misshapen alien attacks a space shuttle trying to kill everyone? No? You probably should go and watch A space odyssey then.Anyway, A.I.C.O Incarnation's story is very close to that except that this time it's happening on earth and the alien is an experiment gone wrong while producing artificial humans. Thus, man race must fight in order to survive against this threat to the dominance over...the earth.I really liked the art style here. It might have been better if it were a little bit more gory, but it still wasn't that bad at all. The characters are well-drawn, the piles of Matter looked good and nothing seemed out of place at all. I should mention that it wasn't that demanding in art in the first place from the looks of it. There aren't those moments when you'd look at the scenery in awe since most of the events are in places packed with mutants, engulfed in fog and are basically wastelands.Character development was a bit fluctuating; some characters were well-developed, precisely the main cast, while others weren't. I won't go into much detail here since that would basically be ruining almost every plot twist in the show, but I'll leave you with a note that, yeah, there is characters development and you'd probably feel its relevance to the story as a whole.Enjoyment, pretty enjoyable if you ask me. I think it'd have been even more enjoyable if it wasn't released as a whole as I don't think it should be binge watched. I'd recommend the subbed version, most of Netflix exclusives had better dubs than subs. However this wasn't the case here which is somewhat disappointing. Even people who are usually comfortable with dubs and prefer it over subs have chosen to watch this one subbed which goes as far as to tell you how bad it is.I'll get to the point, this anime is very generic. There aren't many things I can say were mastered here or unique. Then why did I give it such a high score? Because while it didn't do much out of ordinary, it still didn't do anything wrong. The art is simply amazing and beautifully done especially the mutants or, as they're called, the Matter. The plot twists might be the best thing you'd find here.

Learning more about her unique origins, Aiko is partnered with a group of Divers, who specialize in technology to counteract the Matter and aid to get her to the center of it to halt its growth.A.I.C.O rehashes some typical tropes of sci-fi that include...good-intentioned science leading to chaotic events and the efforts made by those responsible to atone for those actions. Still, the series does a great job at establishing the science and technology employed within the series that include the genetic experiments that led to the Burst's creation, the mechs and weaponry employed to counteract it, and how the science led to major breakthroughs such as artificial limbs and the plugsuits worn by the Divers. The series is pretty thorough in establishing its logic with the behavior and habits of the Matter, as well as the Divers adapting to its varying forms and actions as they press further into its territory.In regards of plot and characters, A.I.C.O offers solid development of Aiko and her journey within Matter-infested territory with the Divers. Aiko gets much of the development throughout the series as she learns more about her origins and identity, gradually coming to terms with both as episodes progress. While much of the cast is not explored as deeply compared to our female lead, there is still enough dimension to their personalities for them to be likeable and there are still some within the cast who get their developments in connection to the problems caused by the Burst. In addition, the plot doesn't waste time on pointless side-plots or filler to pad out its runtime. The pacing of the series is reasonable enough to have its plot progress, while also allowing enough time to delve into more elements of the problems surrounding the Matter and those connected to it. The only major hiccup with the plot is the show's unnecessary need to add an antagonist in the final two episodes of the series, who becomes a tad bit over-the-top compared to his depiction in earlier episodes.Visually, A.I.C.O seemingly sports a higher-than-average animation budget with how nice it looks. It sports nicely detailed and vivid scenic shots, creative uses of the Matter's forms and means to attack, and the tanks and mechs used by the Divers are nicely rendered in spite of sticking out from the regular visuals. Movement throughout the series is very fluid, with visual highlights being any conflicts that the Divers get into with various forms of the Matter.In spite of some quality hiccups and not necessarily breaking any ground, A.I.C.O Incarnation is still a worthwhile sci-fi anime that offers up a solid foundation of plotting and exploration of the Matter's behavior and the advances that its creation brought about. I'd at least recommend checking the series out once if you are a fan of sci-fi anime. good-intentioned science leading to chaotic events and the efforts made by those responsible to atone for those actions.

The dub is quite awful and takes away from the mood of the story, especially the lead researcher Isazu Kyousuke who sounds like he has a mouth full of spit. Subbed is definitely the way to go for this particular anime.As for the story itself it starts off slow and confusing. In the last episodes when the truth about Aico is revealed it becomes even more difficult to grasp the concept. If you're into human eating matter that was caused by humanity itself than this is the anime...for you. The opening theme song is one of the few things that kept me watching this anime, but overall I'd give it a 7/10 because the character development was somewhat decent and I wanted to learn the truth about Aico Tachibana. for you.

I'd like to say it tackles this question quite well - generally speaking, when it comes to being an interesting piece of media though it really fails to be anything other than mediocre.For such a theme based around being human, you'd think there would be a focus on making the characters believable people with motivations you can understand and stories you can relate to. Unfortunately it does not do this. Almost every character is forgettable, I only remembered two of their names (the two leads). The two leads do have a fairly interesting relationship,...I can't say much because that's spoiler territory but they grow well together - my only gripe being the weird 'love interests' thing that seemed to be hinted at. Only Aico was an engaging protagonist. Not enough to make up for the lack of personality with everything else but she was a very good character. She comes across as a more gentle soul, but the show immediately shows that she has a strong will - something that keeps up throughout the entirety, as well as a lot of empathy and protection for others. Her arc is fairly small, she doesn't develop all that much as every choice she makes stays true to who her character is, she may seem like she believe one thing at some points but she does stay steadfast in her beliefs for what she truly wants and chooses to do.No time is given for any of the other characters really, we're given an exposition dump for a couple of their backstories (exposition dumps are another problem with this) but that's about it. We go on their journey with them, we see how they work well together as a team and how they all do care for each other - but it's just not enough to actually care about them. The main villain is a little bit too cartoony, they're set up fairly well but when they come to the spotlight it is a bit too dramatic, as if they're saying 'look I'm the villain' to really show that they're not a good guy, rather than having any build up to justify their actions.To understand the plot and what's going on you really do have to be paying full attention to the show. It's only 12 episodes so there are some scenes that are short but a major change occurs, if you weren't paying attention then you're just going to be lost. The latter half definitely picks up the pace, whereas the first half slogs on quite a bit with nothing much happening.Overall it was an enjoyable watch, it lost my interest in parts and the sad moments didn't elicit any reaction at all out of me due to this feeling of detachment I had towards the characters.

It's pretty dang well put together with some interesting questions and ideas presented. I just can't fathom why they added this one weird element to an otherwise high-stakes and interesting story.StoryGotta say I live and die with one element. If I ignore that element my general and story enjoyment jumps up by quite a bit. As a whole the story has some amazing progression and is very snappy and action packed. It just tosses you into everything and explains a little later, which...depending on the person can be good. In the beginning it is very alien and crazy but as the story progresses all the mysteries are naturally unraveled.CharactersThey're really fun. I can't stay I remembered any of the divers' names on the first watch through. However, I can recall each and memorable moments with them. They spend a lot of time in their diver suits due to the malignant matter. Everyone else is pretty solid and I could really get attached to them. Aiko especially is fun and full of life, I really enjoyed getting to be around her. She was honestly one of my favorite parts of the story, which considering it focuses on her means they did well. However, if you don't enjoy her too much it can make it a tad hard to follow her for as much as we do. Most other characters are decent, their backstories take a little to get to but many are well designed. Only downside is it is all highly interlocked so it may take a second watch through.SoundI mainly listen to op and ed, not really a good judge of VAs. I don't particularly like the op or ed. They're not bad just not something I think does the show any favors. The op is a mini story all on it's own which is really well told, being mainly visual, the op music itself feels oddly operatic and maybe a little surgical with a general hopeful sound. I think they need to balance the background music a little, it seems they just turn the voices sound up when bg music is there. Otherwise the sounds somewhat compete. Good music tho it's just not balanced with the voices well.General feelIt has a general feel of a deep dive mission through a dangerous alien world. Very fun if you like the world building. I loved the ride the show took me on it really is like a tour through the strange world. As I keep saying it's snappy so you'll have a fun time.Positives:- Solid CG and art- Solid world- Interesting questions and mysteries- Op is a mini-story (I suggest skipping visual til ep3, just makes it better)Negatives:- Occasional use of cliches (they're usually surface level)- It can be too much info scattered in some throwaway like-lines (eg: all this matter is bravo class, like 4 eps in explanation on matter classes and another 1 on what that entails)- Divers are like always in their suits that all look the same- One weird element that I can honestly rant about but won't depending on the person can be good.

The Opening was kind of catchy and I loved the accompanying visuals. The visuals themselves give the anime a nice almost retro style....The CG wasn't particularly bad either as in they made it blend pretty well with the 2D elements.

They\'re just too weird and grotesque for me. Not this one, though. I don\'t know how or why but I got hooked quite immediately and it was hard for me to look away. I loved the story and world they thrust me into. It was very bingeable and I finished it in a single day, a rarity for me in regards to shows.The characters were fantastic -- very human and very relatable -- and the pacing and story were interesting.

What little merit the series has is overshadowed by bloated filler that seems to serve no purpose than to try and add depth (and fail to do so spectacularly) to an anime about as deep as a puddle.It starts off relatively simple, with the main character being hinted to have special powers or something, but by episode 2 it\'s already unbearable. Tachibana is a weak main character and it takes her forever to do anything other than panic and ask questions. The rest of the cast can fit either in the ""Trope, the character"" or ""Cardboard Cutout"" categories;...no one has any memorable quotes, motives or goals, except maybe Kanzaki but his reveal comes so late it might as well be irrelevant. All this detailed information about the artificial organisms (a term which they throw out every few seconds), the ""matter"" (very inrtiguing name, almost as bold as naming your plot device ""plot device""), the internal squabble between the scientists is really only there to pad out the show. It\'s like they couldn\'t write decent characters or an interesting world for them to venture out in, so they turned to explaining every little detail that doesn\'t matter. Yet the one detail that does matter seems to be handwaved for a good chunk of the show; that is the true nature of Tachibana\'s body. It\'s not until near the end of the series when they casually drop the big twist, but by then I had forgotten what the hell was the point of it all. It\'s so easy to get lost with the show\'s awfully slow pace. Every time I watched an episode, I felt like I was an episode ahead (ep. 8 felt like ep. 9 and so on), like ""There\'s no way they can drag this out any longer, is there?"" and yet to my surprise the show just kept going and going.The art isn\'t anything to write home about either. Generous use of bad 3D CGI ruins even the average 2D art, but it\'s everyone\'s stiff animations that bother me. Not a single shot impressed me or took me by surprise, everything felt like I (and probably the art team) was going through the motions. Either the studio did not care and wanted to get this done as fast and as cheap as possible or they dumped it on one of their B Teams.This needed to be a movie, not a 12 episode series. There isn\'t nearly enough content here to warrant anything more than 3 or 4 episodes max. As it is, it\'s just not nearly good enough to be considered even average nor is it hillariously bad enough to laugh at its faults. Its writing is weak, but it plays it safe and since it never goes over the top, never tries anything different but sticks to a predictable and terribly executed plot it ends being a complete waste of time.The dub (original) was pretty bad too. Everyone sounds like worse versions of more famous actors and they keep misspronouncing the Japanese names. Maybe stuff like ""artificial organism"" and ""matter"" was the dub\'s fault too, the translation team should have handled the script with more liberty and creativity. As it stands, it\'s completely bland. Apparently they used everyone\'s first takes, but no amount of good acting could save this script. This didn\'t stop them from making a second dub with different actors, but... Seriously, why bother?Overall, not worth anyone\'s time.

It was created in '88 by the man who I believe created Big O. For some strange reason, it took damn near a decade to bring it from Japan to the US.The story is similar to many other Olympus outings: terrorists trying to bring down the Utopian society so that humanity doesn't become like a caged animal. Generally, this means destroying Gaia, which is the main goal of our two terrorists. The story's decent, and it picks and chooses parts...from the 1st and 2nd volumes of the Appleseed series to have in the film. Ultimately, the story satisfied me, so I have no complaints about that.My main complaint is with whoever they got to do the voice over work. My god, the V/Os for the English dub are awful. Seriously, everyone sounds like a stereotypical New Yorker, and if it's not that then its the fact that it all sounds like it was recorded in a tin can--echoey (is echoey a word?). A curse word is added to every sentence like a period, and this is also only in the English dub. I watched the movie once in both Japanese and English, and while both adaptations are fair, the original language is the one to watch (some things get cut from the American version, for whatever reason).The characters are roughly the same in the manga. The one I enjoy the most has to be Hitomi, who wasn't done any justice in the recent 04 movie. I don't know what it is, but all the bioroids act like humans instead of clones in both this and in the manga, a thing that the recent films just hasn't really touched on, at least not yet.All and all, I enjoyed this, but not as much as I expected. It's good to see where Appleseed originates, but don't dive into it with high hopes. If you can stand the ancient graphics and potentially deadly V/Os, then this could be a decent movie for you. from the 1st and 2nd volumes of the Appleseed series to have in the film.

The one I enjoy the most has to be Hitomi, who wasn't done any justice in the recent 04 movie. I don't know what it is, but all the bioroids act like humans instead of clones in both this and in the manga, a thing that the recent films just hasn't really touched on, at least not yet.All and all, I enjoyed this, but not as much as I expected. It's good to see where Appleseed originates, but don't dive into it with high hopes. If you can stand the ancient graphics and potentially deadly V/Os, then this could be a decent movie for you."", 'Appleseed is a work that seems to show up every now and then, after many of us have forgotten it, usually in the form of a reboot or remake. As it stands, the original 1988 anime is the best of the anime versions, so far, but it is not without its flaws.Appleseed is one of a minority of animated works that can lay claim to being too short. There\'s is just way too much going on for a single 1 hour film, but, to director Kazuyoshi Katayama\'s credit, he manages to keep the threads of storyline together enough to make this a largely enjoyable fare.One...thing that Appleseed, this 1988 version, does much better than the 2004 version, is moral ambiguity. This sci-fi is ripe with it. Earth is introduced to us having recently suffered catatrophe through World War III. Olympus, a protoype ""utopia"" of sorts, is the setting, where in step the Bioroids, genetically engineered beings, created by humans, to oversee society and prevent another near apocalyptic event from occuring. As with most political scenarios where control is vested in some people, there are others who want it. The Bioroids, while they do a decent job maintaining peace, are also in total political control of Olympus. This doesn\'t go over to well with certain humans, who view Olympus as a cage.One refreshing thing about this anime is the tag team duo of protagonists, Deunan, a very skilled female E.S.W.A.T (read; Special Ops) member, and her partner, the human on the inside, cyborg on the outside, Briareos. Deunan is thrust into the conflict of humans seeking to wrestle power from the Bioroids, and she follows her convictions to their conclusions. Whether or not she makes the right choice at the conclusion of the film is debatable, but it\'s one of the endearing features of the work.She shines here as a strong female lead, and her relationship with Briareos doesn\'t fall into a rushed, corny romance trap that we often expect of works like this.Another note; for an 80s anime, there is a surprising amount of women in positions of power here.This whole conflict that takes place is complicated with E.S.W.A.T mole(s) corraborating with the humans seeking power, a meddling prime minister, and the computer helping to run the whole show, all of these setting the stage for a solid sci-fi thriller.However, as I alluded to earlier, the one hour runtime just isn\'t enough. When you combine these subplots with the various, lengthy action sequences, it becomes apparent that plot development is given the fast track, often to the detriment of the work. Plot developments and devices are introduced almost haphazardly at times, and you\'re given little time to contemplate on the importance of one thing before another important one springs up. To this point, one major plot device, inolving the character Hitomi, who is, essentially, the key to everything, is severely mishandled. It\'s thrust into the film in mere seconds even though it is such a crucial point.The ending is a bit of a mess too, featuring a terribly cheesy Star Wars like apparition imparting words of wisdom. It\'s almost comical.That said, the Appleseed universe is a very compelling one because it takes the sci-fi genre and puts a new spin on it. The Bioroids are right to have grievances in that they are meant to serve humans, the humans are right to have grievances in that they have little political power, and so, you have a great setup here with no true good guys or bad guys. Sadly, the potential feels a bit wasted with the rushed nature, but the strong characters, particularly Deunan, and the compelling scenario and moral conflict largely allow Appleseed to be an enjoyable work.7/10 thing that Appleseed, this 1988 version, does much better than the 2004 version, is moral ambiguity.

', ""Straightforward and easy to understand solid plot. The art and animation is pure old school. The dub is good. After watching more modern anime, it sounds odd to hear so much cussing, but it adds to the flavor. Especially because combat units are generally pretty raw. I love the relationship between Briareos and Deunan. It's not developed as much as in the 2004 and 2008 movies, but the companionship and a sense of something more underneath the surface is still there. Deunan is drawn very cute and Briareos has a unique sense of style. Recommended for fans of cyberpunk and well told tales. "", ""Alright, I am the trash queen and the 80s animation style is one i love automatically. also, this has robots and cyberpunk stuff in it. so i really tried hard to find ways of loving this. and my god do i love this. my reviews tend to be primers for the anime so, yeh, here goes.*go watch the 2004 appleseed film to get an idea of who and what everyone and everything is... it actually explains what 'appleseed' is and has a lot of shining moments even if it is a little patchy*oh god the dubbing is awful (but a million times more entertaining than...the sub) (listen to the dvd commentary to find them talking about how the voice actors for this never even met), the animation uses really uninteresting angles and colours, and the music is kinda unmemorable and sedate. the co-main character has a bizarre and unsatisfying design choice and his voice is just so meh. also it shows you hardly any of the olympus city which is the thing which the film is focused on scrutinising. also the action is really low key and unimpressive. also this city in the future is basically a normal looking city which feels very very very very unimaginative. the main baddie is also boringly designed.right, so the way to approach the action in animes like this is to treat every moment as if it's meant to be awesome because the action is pretty frequent but short, which is actually a really good way to do a movie in my opinion. the action is adquate but just very low key. don't expect big things.so the point of this movie is to shine a light on the city that has risen out of the ruins of the world, which is considered the perfect society but do humans desire freedom too much to live peaceably with this place? it's this kind of schlocky sci-fi dys/utopian hi-concept philosophicalish side to it which i really enjoy because it's actually trying to say something.

Even at only 70 minutes it captures what the story is about very well and has all the characteristics of the great old school 80s anim&eacute; movies but with more depth than you usually find.

It looks basic so might put some of the newer anim&eacute; fans off, but to me this is a very special film. ', 'Before starting my adventure with ""Appleseed"" from 1988, I read some comments coming from various groups of people. Some of them praised this anime, but some were really critical towards it. Where lies the truth? After finishing watching it, I can say that it lies in the middle. ""Appleseed"" is in general a solid piece of Japanese animation, but it\'s nothing outstanding in any way. That made me think of this OVA movie as a model example of a nice mediocre show, combining both good and bad things, but without any of them visibly dominating over another. Down below, in this review containing very general...spoilers (mostly about the mystery element), I will explain my point of view by mentioning good as well as bad aspects of this show. All to elucidate why I consider it as an average, even though technically correct, piece of entertainment.The animation is alright. Consistent quality, good looking action sequences. Not sakuga by any means, but just solid enough to give justice to all dynamic and fast paced moments. More timid scenes, dedicated for static sequences, look also fine. Their quality is also stable throughout the movie. They are obviously less spectacular looking, due to their character, but still they fit in scenes they appear in.Appleseed\'s art style is one of things that are worth commending, albeit it might feel off to some kind of viewers. Let me explain: this movie was released in 1988, so it\'s obvious that its art style would be heavily inspired by trends present in the Japanese animation industry back in 1980s. That\'s why all designs give a strong vibe of that decade. For some people, like me, it will be a nice thing to see, but if someone is not a fan of such art style, then it can be something considered as a negative aspect of Appleseed\'s visuals.As much as art is filled to the brim with elements typical to 1980s, so is the music used in this anime. Synth tunes and vibrant sounds. Again, not all of viewers may like them. I found them personally as okay, even though they weren\'t delightful to listen to after a while. I feel their most important role to play in this movie was to grasp the atmosphere of ""movies about cops"" popular in the 1980s. I\'m not a fan of this genre, but I\'m familiar with it enough to not only notice many similarities between ""Appleseed"" and said movies, but also to praise succeeding in importing their spirit into an animated movie about, well, also cops, just from the future.I watched this OVA in its English dubbed version. While I usually stick to subbed versions of anime I watch, I decided to make an exception to this one and I must say I really enjoyed English dubbing in ""Appleseed"". From what I read and heard, the original Japanese voices are also done professionally. As expected from the cast of talented voice actors and the Japanese voice acting industry in general.Now then, if aforementioned aspects of this movie are either fine or at least above average, then why ""Mixed Feeling""? What I feel is the biggest con of this movie is its story, or rather the whole presentation of it. Viewers receive brief explanation about the lore of Appleseed, but like... it\'s too vague. It doesn\'t bring closer the world of this show to the viewers to understand it more; it makes it hard to care about anything happening both inside and outside the Olympus city; it doesn\'t provide even the basic elaboration on information regarding the social and political structure of the city (my main complaint here is not learning basically anything about who really is Athena, the person in charge of the city\'s affairs, and how she gained her position; she is just there, and that\'s it, end of details regarding her and her role\'s background). I can fully understand the limitations coming from a show\'s length, but I also feel in this case it was definitely possible to include a little bit more information about something as important as world building.When a particular part of the scenario and storytelling fails, there are also characters that can carry a show. Sadly, the characters in Appleseed present similar quality to the story elements I pointed out earlier. They are bland. We don\'t know much about them and don\'t learn a lot throughout the story, or rather don\'t learn enough to care about their fate or aspirations. Main characters, side characters... they are hollow. Not even their somewhat cool looking and distinctive designs help changing that. Heck, at some moment many viewers might root or simply worry more about the villains, because of how better they are written and how their role is different to either just be there in the story, standing like mannequins.All of that forms an image of anime that\'s perhaps neat to watch if you decide to give it a chance, but that\'s it. You won\'t miss a lot if you just pass on it and pick up something else. That\'s why I find ""Mixed Opinion"" as the perfect way to describe my feelings towards ""Appleseed"". Just as lukewarm water is neither hot nor cold, ""Appleseed"" from 1988 is neither good or bad.

The premise sounded cool enough, plus I don\'t mind older animes although I haven\'t seen that many, but this felt super bland.I struggled to sit through the whole thing because it simply did not keep me interested.TL;DR watch if you really like the premise and older anime hits your sweet spot, you should be entertained enough by something, if you want a decent story that keeps you engaged, don\'t bother.Story: 4/10I liked the premise, which was what got me interested, although the villain(s) were revealed quite...early on which felt too quick and left the middle to the end rather dull and little suspense. It got dull, which felt disappointing. The ending also felt a bit random but that may have been due to the fact I wasn\'t really paying attention after like 20 minutes in lol.Art: 6/10The animation is rough, but its also old so that\'s to be expected. I don\'t mind the roughness because of that, although if you don\'t really like the look of it going in the sometimes jumpy and awkward animations it won\'t do much for you.Sound: 4/10I\'m no sound expert but it felt like the same basic ""80\'s style action synthesizer"" played multiple times during any sort of suspense or action scene...didn\'t really add to the experience for me.Character: 4/10Some characters seemed interesting although never got fleshed out(and I know that is also because this is an OVA). A couple things were brought up that felt like never got addressed later or made an impact on the story(like Hitomi the Biodroid girl was shown to be a drunk I think?? But I also never understood WHY she was so important outside of the exposition by the government lady whatsherface...Athena.Enjoyment: 3/10I started to get bored at about 20 minutes in, not due to the pacing that generally seems to be slower for older animes but rather how nothing interesting was happening. It was just dull.Overall:Good premise but ended up rather dull...watch something else with a vaguely similar premise and there\'s a good chance you won\'t regret it. early on which felt too quick and left the middle to the end rather dull and little suspense.

The design is cool but nothing special in my eyes. The robot guy is cool as hell. Under the sheet of a old school 80s like anime.I did enjoy it, and it was nice too look at. However in comparison to the other titles, I think this one is the best. The CGI in the other films are horrid but at least here we get more of the same (in compassion to the franchise) but in old-school 2-D animation. And I very much prefer that.I cant say I hated it, but...I don't love it either. But that doesn't mean it's not worth your time. It's a nice bite sized OVA that you can extract some enjoyment out of. Especially for someone who adores the production of the time. I don't love it either. But that doesn't mean it's not worth your time. It's a nice bite sized OVA that you can extract some enjoyment out of. Especially for someone who adores the production of the time."", ""Appleseed is a good but not particularly memorable and short OVA about a dystopian police state, but one that has a strangely compelling subtext for what it is. The story, taken at face value, is very basic. However, it manages to have a little subtlety and moral ambiguity that makes it pretty interesting and a villain with a legitimate point. Overall, it’s easy to recommend this OVA, even if it’s nothing stellar.To get it out of the way, yes, the story is nothing to write home about and has been done many times before and better. It’s a typical buddy cop deal with Deunan, the...plucky young female cop, and Briareos, the hard-edged, in this case robotic or ‘biodroid,’ partner. They have a hard-ass boss, Athena, who I grew to like pretty well despite being really cruel at times, which was, I think, a sign of some decent writing. The plot revolves around a resistance movement against a mega corporation trying to take over Earth’s defence system.It’s a little convoluted, but the main villain, Calon, has a legitimate point. He is also a cop but turns coat because of his experiences with the unethical corporation trying to take over the planet. He is revealed as a traitor immediately, and the story uses this conceit very well to explore his thoughts, feelings, motivations, and inner struggle as he has to betray his friends and colleagues. While the corporation, I believe named Gaia, is not cartoonishly evil, they are benign and uncaring. They are also exceedingly cruel and unsympathetic to people's needs, as demonstrated with how callously they treated Calon when his wife died. Even Gaia's police force is full of, not evil, but cold bureacrats who simply follow orders. Calon is by contrast a highly morally-driven and broken man who thinks he's doing the right thing. It's a great little conflict. As said at the jump, it’s oddly engaging and fascinating, and I wish it was explored more, but a deep villain like this was not something I would’ve expected from Appleseed. I also liked how, in juxtaposition, Athena is your typical hardliner, quasi-authoritarian who just follows orders and has no regard for biodroid life or ethics despite being on the good team. All of this is really intriguing stuff; it’s only a shame the OVA is quite short, so it’s not explored that much to elevate the whole story beyond merely serviceable overall. Beyond this specific conflict, there's stuff like the funny hijinx with Briareos, Deunan and Hitomi being dumb, nothing compelling. Despite being very important, Sebastian does not steal his scenes compared to Calon and the overall plot is not great.The characters are, on the whole, solid, though not always very good. I liked Briareos (excellent design), Athena, and especially Calon, a surprisingly decent villain. On the other end of the spectrum, I found that the main character, Deunan, Hitomi, and even Sebastian, the other major villain, were on the dull side. It’s definitely a mixed bag. There are no characters who are outright annoying or ruin things, but it’s carried hard by the good characters. I will say that as a fan of buddy cop movies, Briareos stood out as a likable character who I did end up wanting to root for by the end. It was one of those things stepping back and being surprised how much I genuinely cared about this Astaroth 2P costume looking robot cop. The voice cast for this was pretty decent, not great, but the dub had some overlap with other 80s and 90s shlock I have watched, like Mad Bull. The range of Calon’s voice actor from this, to the Brooklyn accent of Mad Bull, is genuinely impressive. The sound overall is another thing that’s just okay at best.The comedy and character interactions range from alright to a bit cringe-worthy. I think the dub helps out here as the characters feel pretty realistic and have a bit of an edge to them, and it feels like a sci-fi version of New York or Chicago. So that’s an easy fit for everything there, and it’s less awkward. It’s too short to explore futuristic culture too much, but it’s okay.The visuals are good, but nothing stands out. It doesn’t look bad, considering it’s from 1988, but you can definitely tell the era it’s from, and it has a few pretty bad sequences. It does not look exactly theatrical; there is a very much made-for-TV quality standard going on here, and it does have a cheap finish in some areas. I did like the action. It's slow, but competent and has some fun set pieces. Nothing to drag it down; it looks fine, but I was surprised Gainax, of all people, made this. You would never know other than the story having some kinda out there ideas. The designs are also somewhat forgettable sci-fi fare. Briareos is cool, but the mechs are some of the most generic ones I’ve seen in an anime, like something Iron Man would’ve rejected as an early draft for his bulkier suits. Sebastian’s design and augmentations are somewhat cool, but that’s all. The final giant mech that resembles a squid a little bit is very underwhelming, honestly, and I pretty much rolled my eyes when it appeared like, that’s it? This was the big threat being built up all this time. Its stilted and low-budget animation was also pretty disappointing. Narratively it’s fine, it just did nothing for me visually.The length is a blessing and a curse. It definitely never overstays its welcome, making it easy to recommend. On the other hand, it could only get so far in just over an hour of screen time. Even then, it definitely could’ve been better with a more refined script and story or a higher budget. Considering the low budget, length, and release date, it’s a workman-like production.Overall, this is definitely a mixed bag, but still good. I was dithering on how much I liked it, but I came out of it engaged with the parts I liked. There’s plenty of bad and mediocre, but it’s also short enough that it’s easier to overlook. In short, if you just want a fun sci-fi buddy cop movie with some ideas that might appeal to you beyond that and mostly inoffensive anyway, you might as well check this out. plucky young female cop, and Briareos, the hard-edged, in this case robotic or ‘biodroid,’ partner. They have a hard-ass boss, Athena, who I grew to like pretty well despite being really cruel at times, which was, I think, a sign of some decent writing. The plot revolves around a resistance movement against a mega corporation trying to take over Earth’s defence system.It’s a little convoluted, but the main villain, Calon, has a legitimate point. He is also a cop but turns coat because of his experiences with the unethical corporation trying to take over the planet. He is revealed as a traitor immediately, and the story uses this conceit very well to explore his thoughts, feelings, motivations, and inner struggle as he has to betray his friends and colleagues. While the corporation, I believe named Gaia, is not cartoonishly evil, they are benign and uncaring. They are also exceedingly cruel and unsympathetic to people's needs, as demonstrated with how callously they treated Calon when his wife died. Even Gaia's police force is full of, not evil, but cold bureacrats who simply follow orders. Calon is by contrast a highly morally-driven and broken man who thinks he's doing the right thing. It's a great little conflict. As said at the jump, it’s oddly engaging and fascinating, and I wish it was explored more, but a deep villain like this was not something I would’ve expected from Appleseed. I also liked how, in juxtaposition, Athena is your typical hardliner, quasi-authoritarian who just follows orders and has no regard for biodroid life or ethics despite being on the good team. All of this is really intriguing stuff; it’s only a shame the OVA is quite short, so it’s not explored that much to elevate the whole story beyond merely serviceable overall. Beyond this specific conflict, there's stuff like the funny hijinx with Briareos, Deunan and Hitomi being dumb, nothing compelling. Despite being very important, Sebastian does not steal his scenes compared to Calon and the overall plot is not great.The characters are, on the whole, solid, though not always very good. I liked Briareos (excellent design), Athena, and especially Calon, a surprisingly decent villain. On the other end of the spectrum, I found that the main character, Deunan, Hitomi, and even Sebastian, the other major villain, were on the dull side. It’s definitely a mixed bag. There are no characters who are outright annoying or ruin things, but it’s carried hard by the good characters. I will say that as a fan of buddy cop movies, Briareos stood out as a likable character who I did end up wanting to root for by the end. It was one of those things stepping back and being surprised how much I genuinely cared about this Astaroth 2P costume looking robot cop. The voice cast for this was pretty decent, not great, but the dub had some overlap with other 80s and 90s shlock I have watched, like Mad Bull. The range of Calon’s voice actor from this, to the Brooklyn accent of Mad Bull, is genuinely impressive. The sound overall is another thing that’s just okay at best.The comedy and character interactions range from alright to a bit cringe-worthy. I think the dub helps out here as the characters feel pretty realistic and have a bit of an edge to them, and it feels like a sci-fi version of New York or Chicago. So that’s an easy fit for everything there, and it’s less awkward. It’s too short to explore futuristic culture too much, but it’s okay.The visuals are good, but nothing stands out. It doesn’t look bad, considering it’s from 1988, but you can definitely tell the era it’s from, and it has a few pretty bad sequences. It does not look exactly theatrical; there is a very much made-for-TV quality standard going on here, and it does have a cheap finish in some areas. I did like the action. It's slow, but competent and has some fun set pieces. Nothing to drag it down; it looks fine, but I was surprised Gainax, of all people, made this. You would never know other than the story having some kinda out there ideas. The designs are also somewhat forgettable sci-fi fare. Briareos is cool, but the mechs are some of the most generic ones I’ve seen in an anime, like something Iron Man would’ve rejected as an early draft for his bulkier suits. Sebastian’s design and augmentations are somewhat cool, but that’s all. The final giant mech that resembles a squid a little bit is very underwhelming, honestly, and I pretty much rolled my eyes when it appeared like, that’s it? This was the big threat being built up all this time. Its stilted and low-budget animation was also pretty disappointing. Narratively it’s fine, it just did nothing for me visually.The length is a blessing and a curse. It definitely never overstays its welcome, making it easy to recommend.

The Ova is well paced overall and never feels too rushed.  The animation does not look dated and holds up well.  Appleseed only has one real shortcoming, the story.

Manga Video promoted the hell out of this OAV circa 1995, and what a disappointment it was.  I'd only been watching anime for a couple of years at that point, and every new tape I bought felt like a revelation, something that immersed me and made me rewatch it dozens of times.  Until this one.  It's not that the magic of being a freshly-minted otaku had worn off by that point; this OAV is just that bland.It certainly doesn't look that way in trailers, since the one thing it has going...for it is its technically impressive action animation.

All the big action scenes are there, but everything inbetween gets rushed through in a rote and dull fashion, like it bored the staff as much as this viewer.  For example, a major part of the story is meant to be the two lead cops tracking down a terrorist, but their entire investigation is reduced to a brief montage of random shoot-outs in the middle.  The story is too impatient to get to the next action scene, and so almost all the characters are reduced to empty shells.The one character who fares better is the cop-turned-revolutionary who's one of the two main villains.  Many of his grievances against the biodroid-controlled city seem valid, and the dystopian future he's trying to prevent seems like a legitimate threat, to the extent that other characters' off-hand dismissal of these problems feel like a strawman argument.  Unfortunately, the OAV doesn't have time to delve into the moral grey areas here, as that would get in the way of the next robot shoot-out.  Even the action starts to feel unfocused towards the end, with one of the villains going on a rampage that has no dramatic weight, serves no obvious purpose, and ends with a whimper.

It doesn\'t contain any fantasy and Hayao Miyazaki isn\'t involved in the production anyhow. It\'s just a slice of life/drama/romance story, a hell of a good one too. Ocean Waves may be one of the most natural animes I\'ve seen. It doesn\'t throw in a load of super tragic drama or anything of that kind. It only tells the story of a group of teenagers as they walk the path to adulthood.The story is takes place in Kochi, Japan, a small town by the sea. Morisaku Taku...and Matsuno Yutaka are two ordinary high schoolers and best friends. In the middle of the semester a city girl named Muto Rikako transfers to Matsuno\'s class. As the class representative he has to show her around school and that\'s how they get know each other, soon enough Morisaku is introduced to her. Muto has quite a hard time getting into the class. She\'s talented at sports and studies and quickly becomes popular, but that changes as many of the girls get envious of her and she becomes known for being a snob.The art and animations are really good. No different from any other works from studio ghibli. If your fond of the typical 90s animations you will definitely like the art in this one. The characters looks typically ghibli, but the design is quite different. It doesn\'t ""re-use"" the same main characters as many ghibli movies seem to do. Not just only the way they look. The personalities are really different too. Morisaku is just the ordinary kind and honest guy, the one that is always there to help. Matsuno is the reliable best friend that\'s very respected by Morisaku. Muto is kind of spoiled and self-centered. She acts very tough though she\'s actually pretty sensitive. I think the characters develop great and I could really tell how they\'ve matured through time.The music was really good, very calm and fitting. It set the right mood. Voice acting is also very well done. The only thing I can complain about is the sound quality at times but it could have been fansub group\'s doing.I enjoyed this movie a lot. It\'s just a charming and relaxing story that will make you smile. It\'s not super romantic just very sweet at times. It\'s one of those stories that make you wish for the characters happiness.

The story moves very smoothly and the perspective of our young protagonist Taku is set lucid immediately, showing classic hero potential in challenging his school on a decision he finds unfair. He is rational, hard working and emotionally moral. He takes a sight of Rikako, a fiery, athletic beauty and childishly does not realise that he is mad about her, fine, however:-As a strong upholder of ROMANCE, Ocean Waves is not critical enough in delivering the heart wrenching moments which it clearly builds up for, as...the characters are endearing and well developed in emotional integrity.

It would be argued that this is not what the film or original story ever set about doing, however, one cannot help but feel bitter not seeing the climax of humanity's better emotions, in neither words or embrace.A friend of mine said that Studio Ghibli is practically a Japanese Disney, and with this in some area's I would wholly agree, though I have found at times all of their films to be incredibly mature and perhaps beyond the reach of younger audiences.

The team is performing well enough to stand on their own and keep the game leveled, but nobody is there to advance the score or awe the audience with their brilliance.

Occurrences that don't impact on the world as a whole.Ocean Waves is a story of similar impact; impacting only on three characters locked inside their own small little world. It's a story covering the journey towards adulthood of three high schoolers, where the friendship of two is damaged by the one thing besides hate that can destroy bonds - love.Often over-looked because the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Studio Ghibli and the director of many highly regarded Ghibli titles, had no role in the completion of the film, it's by far the most under-watched and under-rated of...the Ghibli films I've watched thus far. Ocean Waves was an attempt at giving the younger staff members of Ghibli a chance to shine - a chance to come from under the shadows of the bigger names - and shine they did, though not as brightly as they would've hoped.:: Story :: -- 8.5-9/10In a nutshell, Ocean Waves is a romance, featuring a love triangle, without any supernatural elements whatsoever being included. There are black comedy and depressing sections of the story, leading to the ending being somewhat unpredictable.Prior to a girl called Rikako transferring from Tokyo to a high school located in a small town by the sea, Taku and Yutaka shared a close friendship; one forged at the back-end of junior high when they were the only two in their school to persist in standing against the school's decision to cancel the school trip. From then onwards, despite being in different classes, the two remained close, inside and outside of school. But Rikako changed everything. Yutaka fell in love with her at first sight, starting with when he - as the class representative - showed her around the school. Yutaka also called Taku to the school on the same day, wanting to show the new girl to his best friend, and that's when their relationship started to become troubled; when Taku also became enchanted by her beauty.The story is a simple yet moving affair. It's almost certain to be hard-hitting for anyone who has developed feelings for someone a close friend also has feelings for. Watching Taku attempt to sustain a friendship whilst being pulled deeper and deeper into the selfish world of Rikako, it was difficult for me not to get pulled into the world of the characters. Even for those who can't relate to the struggles of the characters, like myself, it'd be an absorbing experience.The only real story negative is that it's too short, the film only lasting for around 70 minutes. Given that Ocean Waves was a 'youth of Ghilbli' project, with a small budget (which they ended up going over), it isn't shocking that one-third of the love triangle didn't get as much time as the other two-thirds. Likewise, it isn't a shock that the story ended right when it reached the good part; when the story reached its peak. But, viewed as it is, the story has enough quality to justify the 9/10 (rounded from 8.5) score I'm awarding it.:: Characterization :: - 8.5/10The main two characters (the two who get the most time - Taku and Rikako) are fleshed out well enough so that I was able to get an excellent understanding of their personalities. Taku is your typical nice guy, willing to help someone work through their problems without gaining anything in return, but he's also honest, being blunt where necessary. Rikako, on the other hand, is a spoilt child, blaming the break-up of her parents' marriage on her mother because she was forced to move away from Tokyo. Where as Taku shows consideration by thinking of the feelings of Yutaka, she thinks only of herself - lying to get money in order to return to Tokyo, deceiving her friend in an attempt to get her to go to Tokyo with her and many other things. But, as they say, opposites attract, and over the course of the story she starts to learn through experience.My only issue with Rikako is that, because of the short length of the film, nearly all of it focused on her being selfish. Not enough was shown of her other side, or of her growth into a a more mature person - one not locked inside her own little world. If the film had been twenty minutes longer, with some scenes added just before and after the ending, I feel it would've improved the experience.However, my main characterization issue doesn't lie with Rikako. The third part of the love triangle, Yutaka, quite simply didn't get anywhere near enough time for him to develop into more than a well-used plot device. Nearly all of the film focused on the developments of Taku and Rikako, Yutaka being excluded completely during the black comedy section in the middle. Yutaka being the friend of Taku and making him think twice about his feelings for Rikako made the story work, but it would've been more powerful if there had been three characters to care for rather than two.On the whole, the characterization is very good. The realism of Rikako's personality in particular is worth noting. But I can't quite give the characterization side a 9/10 score when there could've been added development - development which would've increased my enjoyment.:: Art / Animation :: - 8.5/10As you'd expect of a Ghibli title, Ocean Waves is pleasing visually. The animation flowed (though, with it being realistic, there wasn't any fast-paced action or the like) and there were no obvious over-budget issues that caught my eye. The only negative that springs to mind is the trademark Ghibli facial artwork, which is the same except in the cases of certain types of characters. Having watched a couple of Ghibli titles in quick succession, I've noticed how the faces are often identical. What highlighted this to me in the case of Ocean Waves was towards the end, when I noticed that one of the supporting female characters with her hair like Rikako looked just like her (I thought it was her at first.)To be fair, I'm probably nit-picking. What matters with regards to the faces is that the characters' emotions are conveyed, and the expression side had no issues whatsoever. When Rikako was pissed off and gave Taku the 'evil eye' feared by men worldwide, she looked convincing. When Taku lost his patience with Rikako because of her selfish ways, his feelings were etched on his face. Etc, etc. On the whole, the art impressed me, and I see no reason to mark a drama down because it had no action to be animated.:: Sound :: - 8/10The soundtrack has a good range of songs, ranging from depressing piano tracks to uplifting tracks, and the music fitted the mood well. After finishing the film, I couldn't recall an excellent piece I wanted to listen to over and over, but I did appreciate the soundtrack after downloading and listening to it away from the film, with no pretty images to distract me. There's music that sets the mood and music that's wonderful to listen to away from what it played alongside, and the Ocean Waves soundtrack is the former.As for the voice acting, I felt whilst watching that the voices fitted the characters well enough. Like in the case of the music, I didn't end the film with any of the voices stuck inside my brain, but I didn't end with any negative feelings about the acting.:: Overall :: - 8/10To sum it up, Ocean Waves is something for anyone who can handle anime without supernatural elements distancing its story from reality. It's a must watch for fans of romance with a realistic edge.Don't ignore it simply because of its unknown status compared to the other Ghibli titles. A lot of people go into anime to escape reality - to see something different - and I'm sure that has played a part in it being scored harshly compared to certain other Ghibli titles. It's more than worthy of a place in any Ghibli collection. Trust me when I say that Miyazaki not being involved doesn't make it any less of a film. the Ghibli films I've watched thus far. Ocean Waves was an attempt at giving the younger staff members of Ghibli a chance to shine - a chance to come from under the shadows of the bigger names - and shine they did, though not as brightly as they would've hoped.:: Story :: -- 8.5-9/10In a nutshell, Ocean Waves is a romance, featuring a love triangle, without any supernatural elements whatsoever being included. There are black comedy and depressing sections of the story, leading to the ending being somewhat unpredictable.Prior to a girl called Rikako transferring from Tokyo to a high school located in a small town by the sea, Taku and Yutaka shared a close friendship; one forged at the back-end of junior high when they were the only two in their school to persist in standing against the school's decision to cancel the school trip. From then onwards, despite being in different classes, the two remained close, inside and outside of school. But Rikako changed everything. Yutaka fell in love with her at first sight, starting with when he - as the class representative - showed her around the school. Yutaka also called Taku to the school on the same day, wanting to show the new girl to his best friend, and that's when their relationship started to become troubled; when Taku also became enchanted by her beauty.The story is a simple yet moving affair. It's almost certain to be hard-hitting for anyone who has developed feelings for someone a close friend also has feelings for. Watching Taku attempt to sustain a friendship whilst being pulled deeper and deeper into the selfish world of Rikako, it was difficult for me not to get pulled into the world of the characters. Even for those who can't relate to the struggles of the characters, like myself, it'd be an absorbing experience.The only real story negative is that it's too short, the film only lasting for around 70 minutes. Given that Ocean Waves was a 'youth of Ghilbli' project, with a small budget (which they ended up going over), it isn't shocking that one-third of the love triangle didn't get as much time as the other two-thirds. Likewise, it isn't a shock that the story ended right when it reached the good part; when the story reached its peak. But, viewed as it is, the story has enough quality to justify the 9/10 (rounded from 8.5) score I'm awarding it.:: Characterization :: - 8.5/10The main two characters (the two who get the most time - Taku and Rikako) are fleshed out well enough so that I was able to get an excellent understanding of their personalities. Taku is your typical nice guy, willing to help someone work through their problems without gaining anything in return, but he's also honest, being blunt where necessary. Rikako, on the other hand, is a spoilt child, blaming the break-up of her parents' marriage on her mother because she was forced to move away from Tokyo. Where as Taku shows consideration by thinking of the feelings of Yutaka, she thinks only of herself - lying to get money in order to return to Tokyo, deceiving her friend in an attempt to get her to go to Tokyo with her and many other things. But, as they say, opposites attract, and over the course of the story she starts to learn through experience.My only issue with Rikako is that, because of the short length of the film, nearly all of it focused on her being selfish. Not enough was shown of her other side, or of her growth into a a more mature person - one not locked inside her own little world. If the film had been twenty minutes longer, with some scenes added just before and after the ending, I feel it would've improved the experience.However, my main characterization issue doesn't lie with Rikako.

It can be very hard to understand the reason behind our own actions let alone know why others choose this or that path for themselves. What we do provides the best clues for explaining us, yet they are just the surface, little waves of the ocean that don’t necessarily reveal our deeper character and thoughts. There is always a distance between what we are and what we do. We cannot get rid of the occasional reflection that people’s behavior often appears silly, egocentric, and to be a bit harsh, meaningless. Nevertheless those tiny waves stay as the best source...of understanding human beings. Ocean Wave is about those waves. Although the original title means ""I can hear the Sea"" I think ""Ocean Waves""  better suits this anime.The anime does not have a straightforward plot, though it can be hardly called unique. It can seem hard to get into because what the movie tries to convey is a sort of sensibility rather than action. It is somewhat similar to 5 centimeters per second. It depicts lives in small contexts, casts light on everyday worries and dreams, instead of throwing a grand event at us. The story does not dive into deeper feelings that determine characters. It focuses on the small ripples on the surface. Relations happen under the surface. It has a soft relaxing atmosphere, a trait not only Ghibli works but many other Japanese anime and movies share. The ending is beautiful, with no plot twist, nothing glamorous, yet fairly heart-warming. Characters are realistically and beautifully depicted. The story is not fast-paced, it lets us stay with the heroes and understand them a bit, and while there, understand some of our own feelings as well.Ocean Wave is a Ghibli work, but one point must be mentioned. Ghibli movies share some common elements that make them typical in their category. Binge-watching is not recommended. But it is helpful to bear in mind that Ghibli productions stand worlds apart from the rest. They change over time. They grow, mature in some respects, and sometimes regress. For example, earlier Ghibli works have stronger and more active characters than later ones. Later works have somewhat repetitious characters, as if copied from the older ones. Nevertheless, their every work stands above from the majority of anime inundating the market with brainless battles, half-naked teenage girls, which give the impression that they’re specially tailored for unapologetic pedophiles fast approaching their midlife crisis.

I thought the general consensus that this was one of Ghibli\'s worst features would be an exaggeration, but that description is spot on. Usually I only do reviews of anime when I care enough to do a full analysis, but that isn\'t the case here. I\'m just disappointed enough to write a quick summary, especially after seeing a flurry of reviews claiming that this movie isn\'t as bad as other people seem to think.Even though I respect your opinion if you think that this movie is ""good"" or maybe even ""great"", having that thought after watching this movie is something that I find unfathomable....I think that Ocean Waves rightfully deserves the reputation it has and is one of the most aggravating film experiences that I\'ve had to sit through in a while.ART:Nothing to critique here; typical early Ghibli style and charm.SOUND:The score is forgettable at best and off-putting at worst. Some scenes were coupled with undeserved orchestral swells that made moments feel even more artificial or exasperating than they already were. Voice acting was good for main characters but occasionally spotty for the supporting cast.CHARACTER and STORY:Here we go. If you don\'t already know this movie\'s reputation, viewers tend to hate the female lead, Rikako. I had seen this trend before watching the movie and was fully prepared to disagree with or at least criticize that line of thinking. ""She can\'t be that bad,"" I thought. ""Surely some people just don\'t understand her motivations or are blowing her personality out of proportion. Right?""Boy was I wrong. Not only do I completely agree with this sentiment, but as of now, she is one of the most unlikable characters I have ever been forced to watch. I\'ve seen non-villains and villains alike in movies, people who are antagonistic scumbags that have committed atrocities and all kinds of abominable actions, yet they all seem more human than the self-centered, deceitful, underdeveloped Rikako. As the movie goes on, she only continues to grow more inhuman, irritating and repugnant.""But that\'s the point. This is a story of a girl tearing two best friends apart and the struggles of youth. That\'s why it\'s a drama.""Is that really the point though? Cause I don\'t think so, and it doesn\'t seem like the writers thought that either.Romance is also listed in the tags, and that seems to be what the story is shooting for, especially with how the movie ends...except that no one in their right mind would find this movie romantic, nor is the romance given proper development or a conclusion. In fact, the romance doesn\'t even really begin, it\'s just implied within the last minutes of the film. If you tried to tell me that this was a romance movie before I looked at its Wikipedia and MAL pages, I would\'ve laughed in your face.The story and ""romance"" in this movie consists of Rikako being a selfish, manipulative, uncaring asshole and two guys falling in love with her anyway. Her motivations for being an asshole are cliche (you could probably guess them without watching the movie) and never justified. We are given some superficial dialogue about why she turned out this way and then the movie expects us to somehow forgive her for being such a terrible character, even when none of the reasons for her actions are resolved or acknowledged in a meaningful manner.The two male leads are flat and one-dimensional. Not only do they have seemingly no reason to love her (besides the fact that she is attractive) but the movie doesn\'t even attempt for either of them to get close to her in any significant way. She uses Taku and then abandons him just as quickly. Yutaka tries to befriend her and fails miserably. This is somehow enough to make the friendship between Taku and Yutaka fall apart.The movie\'s third act is short and pointless. Taking a walk together is enough to fix Taku and Yutaka\'s friendship. A reunion at a bar suddenly makes all the character\'s reveal how they\'ve ""grown"" over their time in college, when really the only character that has developed in any way is an irrelevant girl that was barely in the movie. The rest of the them haven\'t changed at all. What\'s even more laughable is that after all the pain she\'s caused them, Taku realizes at the reunion that he still loves Rikako...for some reason (this is especially hilarious when the only memories that he can recall are of her being an asshole to him). What you\'re looking at is a movie where almost nothing happens, and what does happen is not justified or impactful in any stretch of the imagination. The melodrama is neither entertaining nor well-executed, and you will leave the movie wondering what the hell you\'re supposed to take away from this experience.CONCLUSION:A movie hasn\'t made me this upset in a long time. This is not a feel-good slice of life and it\'s also not a romance. It\'s a drama, and it handles that label with extreme laziness and ineptitude. Unlikable characters with nonexistent development. Meandering dialogue. No sense of direction. A rushed ending. I\'m not sure if this movie has any positive aspects. What I am sure of is that this movie barely scrapes over the hour mark and it almost feels like two.The premise is not inherently terrible. Watching a friendship deteriorate due to a manipulative person is a classic plot that could\'ve been handled well, but it doesn\'t even feel like the focus of this movie; it\'s just something that happens out of the blue toward the end of the second act. But the romance doesn\'t feel like the focus of this movie either. So what the hell is the focus of this movie anyway? Rikako being an asshole? Yeah, pretty much.

She’s a spoilt brat who complains about her life being so “sad” because her parents got a divorce and she had to move…Oh, boo hoo. And that she has no friends because she’s a snobby, whiney, manipulative, rude b*tch who makes fun of their accent and has absolutely no regard for anyone else but herself. She scabs money off of people instead of just getting a job, takes advantage of the main characters and is a huge hypocrite who purposely makes life hard for people who are...nice to her. Not to mention she makes other people do everything for her and has no gratitude whatsoever towards them. In fact, she’s just plain mean.When she gets confronted about her attitude (and deservingly so), she gets angry or doesn’t care. If she actually had a sad life then I would feel sorry for her but she doesn’t. At all. I’ve been through more than her in my teenage years (including a divorce and both parents remarrying) and I would still consider myself very lucky and privileged. The MC doesn’t deserve any of the sh*t he has to endure and he seems to be the most patient guy ever. Alone, he’s not a bad character but the fact that him and his buddy have a crush on a psycho b*tch makes me question their sanity. She doesn’t even have a chance at a redemption arc so you’re just left hating her forever wondering if she’s still a massive c**t as an adult.Maybe the movie just hasn’t aged well with divorce probably being much more taboo back then or maybe it's saying something about city kids idk, but I cannot stand her, even if she’s supposed to be like that. If you want to be severely frustrated/annoyed then go ahead and watch. However, if you’re looking to enjoy the aesthetic (cause I do love the animation) then you would be better off watching on mute with some nice music in the background lol. I don’t see how anyone can actually enjoy sitting through this torture unless you’re looking for a tutorial on how to get into a toxic relationship :) nice to her.

In fact, she’s just plain mean.When she gets confronted about her attitude (and deservingly so), she gets angry or doesn’t care. If she actually had a sad life then I would feel sorry for her but she doesn’t. At all. I’ve been through more than her in my teenage years (including a divorce and both parents remarrying) and I would still consider myself very lucky and privileged. The MC doesn’t deserve any of the sh*t he has to endure and he seems to be the most patient guy ever. Alone, he’s not a bad character but the fact that him and his buddy have a crush on a psycho b*tch makes me question their sanity. She doesn’t even have a chance at a redemption arc so you’re just left hating her forever wondering if she’s still a massive c**t as an adult.Maybe the movie just hasn’t aged well with divorce probably being much more taboo back then or maybe it's saying something about city kids idk, but I cannot stand her, even if she’s supposed to be like that. If you want to be severely frustrated/annoyed then go ahead and watch. However, if you’re looking to enjoy the aesthetic (cause I do love the animation) then you would be better off watching on mute with some nice music in the background lol. I don’t see how anyone can actually enjoy sitting through this torture unless you’re looking for a tutorial on how to get into a toxic relationship :)"", ""Ocean Waves is a rather obscure movie of the Studio Ghibli kanon. It is a made for TV movie with the younger generation of animators working at Ghibli at the time, so it really isn't surprising that it is little known. It is a departure from the norms of Studio Ghibli, not only because it doesn't involve Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata, but it also one of the movies more grounded in reality. So without the big talents that made the studio, where the movie stand? It's pretty good, but a far cry from Studio Ghibli at top form.The story is one of young adults...just a few years out of high school. This is funny to say because most of the movie is a flashback to high school. Majority of the movie is the protagonist Taku reflecting on his time in high school, specifically his relationship with the beautiful and volatile transfer student Rikako Muto, as well as his best friend, Yutaka. The movie shows Taku's high school life until his graduating year, then cuts forward to him revisiting his hometown a few years later for a class reunion a few years later.Being that majority of the film takes place in high school, as you can expect it is drama driven. Thankfully, it is not its not melodramatic. In fact, it has the same gentle touch Studio Ghibli is well known for. It is typical high school drama with a love triange, school gossip, and adolescent antics; but restrained rather than overblown. The dynamic between the characters works well, as we get a fairly good sense of their relationship, which honestly do feel believable. The also does a pretty good job conveying some of the frustration of the teenage years, most prominently in the way Rikako behaves because she was forced to move to the country-side as a result of her parents divorce. However, the story is too safe frankly; everything in it is commonly used in this kind of drama. While it isn't executed badly, it also isn't done with enough finesse or inspiration to truly make it stand out. The only part that really feels inspired is Taku's class reuinion, which makes up only the last fourth of the movie. The material is quite good, but ultimately feels a bit underwhelming because of how it is presented.On the technical-side of things, well, this is Studio Ghibli we're talking about. Even though this is a made for TV movie not a theatrical release, it still looks very good. The character designs have the usual warm Ghibli charm; being both fairly realistic and appropriately cartoony. Backgrounds are beautifully detailed, and the animation is smooth, certainly more fluid than necessary for this kind of story. The music is also very good, as one might expect. Wonderful orchestrated pieces which fit the tone of the movie nicely. All that said, the movie doesn't really impress. Just as with the story's execution, the overall direction is competent, but not amazing on any level. There are not any shots or scenes which grab you with the way they are captured on screen. It is obvious that the animators had skill, but perhaps lacking in cinematic chops. The movie looks and sounds good, but not exceptional.Ocean Waves is definitely not Studio Ghibli at its best, and honestly, it is not hard to see why the movie is overlooked. It has a good story, and good technical merits; it's just lacking in the inspiration that is present in most of the studio's works.

In a way those statements are true but this show isn't about any of that. I believe in its heart, this show is a love letter to youth and nostalgia. I think Yutaka set the tone early in the show when he said he'll remember the school did something wrong if they canceled the class trip, even 20 years after graduation.The peak of...the show was definitely the class reunion. Its nice to see everyone just get past all the dramatic nonsense of high school and just be more adult.Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot. I may not recommend it to anyone younger but for us older folks past college, I think this show is like eye candy down memory lane.PS: This show was the first Ghibli show to not be directed by Isao Takahata or Hayao Miyazaki and I gotta say the younger studs of Ghibli definitely have a very nice sense of fashion. The wardrobe of the characters seem like something I might definitely pick up next time I'm going thrift shopping lol. the show was definitely the class reunion.

I was captivated at the beginning, truly enjoying the odd relationship that formed between this sweet, pushover of a guy and this horrible, manipulative bitch. I liked that he didn\'t seem even remotely interested in her, and I was genuinely hoping for the slight sexual tension between him and his male best friend to flourish into something more, but alas... they both fell head over heels for the saucy minx. I was utterly shocked and frustrated when he pulled these seemingly lifelong feelings out of his ass in the end and turned the personality I thought I knew...into something much more impressionable and weak. The slap was SO WELL DESERVED and his actions at the movie\'s close completely undermine it.I only have two positive things to say: (1) I guess it shows the true influence of manipulation/shallowness and really highlights how a toxic person behaves. It\'s one of those movies that leaves you more disgusted and disappointed in the characters than happy and bubbly, but at least it gives a little bit of insight on how the world works. People get into unhealthy relationships all the time, and you kind of see the thought process of someone involved in a similar situation. ""She\'s pretty"" turns into ""I\'ll love her forever, no matter how self-centered, vile, and just plain cruel she is."" (2) The art is AMAZING. I could rewatch this movie (and probably will) a hundred times just to look at the intricate pastel frames of post-war Japan. It\'s truly soothing to the eye and its visuals definitely win it a few more points.I don\'t really have much else to say.

A girl from Tokyo named Rikako moves to the far smaller town of Kochi with her mother after her parents divorce. She creates quite a stir with her high grades, athletic prowess, and general distant attitude. Morisaki Taku gets caught up in her affairs when his friend, Yutaka, tells her all about him. The story isn't bad, but it's not anything special. It certainly isn't one of Studio Ghibli's more imaginative or interesting tales. The main problem with the story is that the ending is very trite.One of the big themes is divorce. Honestly, the fact that...the story comes from Taku's perspective really helps with this. Seeing him as an outsider piecing everything together is more effective at showing the subtle impact of divorce than Rikako's more personal perspective could. The problem with this theme is Rikako's reaction. She acts like a petulant child over the whole thing and, honestly, she's too old for this reaction I could understand it coming from someone who's thirteen or so, but she's supposed to be sixteen, seventeen when the main action takes place. She should have a better understanding of the situation than that. Maybe there are some people who react that immaturely to a divorce at that age, but it certainly doesn't make you feel sorry for her. The love triangle aspect is actually handled pretty well. The infatuation is played up very subtly and the characters react pretty realistically to it. They also avoid the whole melodrama problem that you frequently get from this sort of story.Morisaki Taku and Matsuno Yutaka are both pretty good characters. I especially like Taku's snarky personality and willingness to call Rikako out on her bollocks. You can probably guess that the problem is Rikako. As a character she's not very compelling. She's either acting like an anti-social snob, whining about the divorce or acting like a spoiled brat. I've already been over how she doesn't have the excuse of being young, so does she at least have the excuse of being in a bad situation? Not really. She's from an upper class family and her peers try to reach out to her several times only to receive the cold shoulder. Yes, moving is difficult but she doesn't even put in an effort to make friends or get to know people. As a result I just can't empathise with her.The art is great. The only problem I have with it is that, during a few scenes, the proportions go askew for no reason. These scenes usually involve someone getting punched or slapped. But that's a pretty minor complaint and the art is good aside from that one factor.The music and voice acting are both downplayed, but I honestly think that adds to the atmosphere and helps highlight the importance of the scenes that do showcase the music or voice acting. Very clever, Studio Ghibli.This is another anime with no yuri earning it a yuri factor of 1/10.My final rating for Ocean Waves is a solid 7/10.

It may not be optimistic and atmospheric like Miyazaki or symbolic and sad like Takahata, but in the process of being dwarfed by the famous Ghibli greats, it finds its own place. It’s bold in its honesty and simplicity, unafraid to diverge from the studio’s norm. Instead of a couple charming and heroic children, Ocean Waves is led by a couple confused and moody teenagers. Instead of a fantastical adventure determined by good and evil, they embark on an uneventful time lapse through young...adulthood determined by life’s events. It develops a relationship with both mature and immature complexities that often leave the viewer—That’s it, I can’t do it anymore. I need to address something. You know why this movie isn’t popular? Why it hasn’t become a late classic in the eyes of Ghibli fans? Because the, dude, the main man, the protagonist of Ocean Waves, is a goddamn SIMP. If you’ve seen this movie, you know what I’m talking about. Seriously, if you looked up “simp” on the urban dictionary, a picture of our hero would sit comfortably right next to the paragraph about how simps sacrifice their own integrity, both social and moral, to appease some girl they have a crush on. He doesn’t even know he’s simping until he realizes that everything that ever fell off the rails in his highschool life could be traced back to stupid decisions he made to accommodate some random girl that never gave him the time of day. He loans her money, goes on a freaking plane so that she doesn’t travel by herself after her friend bailed, lets her sleep in his hotel bed while he sleeps in the bathtub, deals with her daddy issues, and after all that, the one time he doesn’t simp, the time he lets her get bullied without intervening, his friend punches him in the FACE. Uh oh, guess you weren’t simping enough, buddy. She walks all over this dude like a ten-cent tatami mat and this movie has the gall to punish him in the end for NOT going out of his way to fight her battle? How about a little respect for his simpin, huh? He is literally a role model for every twitter and instagram simp out there, because eventually he gets the payoff. But at that point, is it even worth it?

It involves 2 old friends, and a girl that comes between them.Ocean Waves is the only high school drama from Ghibli. It doesn`t quite feel like the other real-world Ghibli movies (whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday), nor does it feel much like your run in the mill drama. For one, there aren`t any tear jerkers, which dramas swear by, and the cute-innocence of the typical pre-teen leads of Ghibli is also absent. To top it off, there isn`t much of a...climax either. With the story being completely focused on the relationship between the guys and the girl, there isn`t much room to depict daily routines so it misses the slice of life genre as well. In the end, the movie feels like a story your friend is telling you about an unusual, and complex relationship he had with a girl he met in high school. It`s not built like a romance comedy or a TV drama. Nothing in Ocean Waves is all that captivating. It never tries to tug at your heart strings with true-love romantic cheese, and in this way, it has its own unpretentious, grounded charm that sets itself apart from other Ghibli representations of love.The story follows the main character as he comes to understand an un-mannered, stuck up Tokyo girl who just transferred to his small town school. It`s not a boring story, but with the lack of a functional build-up/climax structure, it`s not easy to get into. Thankfully though, the characters are interesting enough to pick up the slack. The real draw of the story is learning about the aforementioned girl. The other two main characters, and the other minor characters as well, feel transparent enough. The way they showcase emotions like jealousy, infatuation (not love mind you), and frustration are usually on point, and its easy to feel for them, but they`re not very complicated, nor are they the focus of the movie. Muto, the Tokyo Girl, is the object of the film. She is fittingly complex, and the story develops around your, and the main character`s discoveries about her life and her personality.The first few minutes of the film sets the tone: the main character is reminiscing about Muto and his high school years, and he tells the viewer the story. You can`t come into this movie expecting a typical romantic comedy where boy meets girl, boy gets together with girl, boy and girl separate because of a conflict, which builds up to a climax where boy gets back with girl. Ocean Waves just doesn`t flow like that. It is an amusing, lighthearted movie nonetheless.I can think of an instance or two where the characters seemed a little bit corny, and over-expressive, but overall, it is more faithful to reality than a vast majority of Anime and TV dramas. If the lack of a meaty romance rife with love-drama doesn`t turn you off, there is plenty to like about Ocean Waves. It straddles the line between high school life, high school romance, and nostalgic slice of life. climax either.

It straddles the line between high school life, high school romance, and nostalgic slice of life.', 'Ocean Waves is a bit of an odd duck among the Ghibli pantheon. It’s by far one of the studio’s least watched properties, possibly it’s least well known entry of all. It’s the one Ghibli film to not receive a high-quality English dub with a cavalcade of A-list actors. It was a directed by a one-time director for the studio whose future output would range from very good to, well, Pupa. It certainly feels like a very different animal right from the get go, eschewing both the usual lush, lived-in Miyazaki feel and the usual stark, sharp-edged specificity of Isao Takahata’s work in favor of...a pale, washed-out aesthetic most reminiscent of the past sequences from Only Yesterday with the color saturation turned every further down. It’s a wispy, incidental coming-of-age romance, not so much lacking presence as keeping a low profile, a movie with humble ambitions and even humbler execution. It’s not the kind of production that screams “instant classic” or “underlooked gem”; it feels very much like the kind of insubstantial fluff that gets put out to pad the balance sheet, albeit with a decidedly more high-class air about itself than the usual slice-of-life show. And having now watched Ocean Waves myself, I can confirm that it’s only really worth that amount of consideration. It’s not an awful film, but it’s so light and insubstantial that it passes through you with barely a reaction, leaving no lasting impact in its wake.Set in the rural prefecture of Kochi, Japan, the story follows high school friends Morisake and Matsuno as a new transfer student arrives from Tokyo: Rikako, a beautiful girl who mostly keeps to herself and avoids interacting with the greater school ecosystem. This aloof attitude gets her labeled as stuck-up and arrogant, but Mastuno quickly develops a crush on her nevertheless. Morisake, meanwhile, is slower to warm up to her, but a series of chance meetings help him realize that her seemingly simple life is a lot more complicated and messy than it first appeared. There’s a constant thread of distrust of authority running throughout the film, as the school administrators and parents of the characters are painted as petty, often self-serving, and more concerned with reputation than their children’s well-being. In Rikako’s case, the pressure takes the form of a fractured family, with a father back in Tokyo and her mother moving to Kochi, with neither of those lives being the life she wants deep down. Yet she’s also been more influenced by that pressure than she realizes, being quick to anger and mistrust, even as Morisake becomes further embroiled in her personal life, sparking jealousy from Matsuno and rumors from the classmates. It’s an interesting angle, and if it was explored further, I think it would give Ocean Waves the sense of identity it’s sorely lacking.Sadly, the film as it exists doesn’t really have that much to say about bucking against authority in the rigid society of Japan, or how kids are pressured by their environments. In truth, it doesn’t have much of anything to say at all. It just sort of goes through the motions, walking through Morisake and Rikako’s developing relationship, hitting all the beats you expect it to hit, and then it’s over. At just barely over an hour’s runtime, Ocean Waves doesn’t have the time it needs to develop any of its observations into anything meaningful. There’s very little sense of structure either; moments come and go, story threads are abandoned just as it feels like they’re really getting going, climaxes just sort of fade into the next scene without any real resolution, and just when it looks like we’re gearing up for a big emotional confrontation that might give some meaning to the story, it jumps ahead to a “Let’s see how far we’ve come” epilogue that’s far too proportionally long in comparison to the rest of the movie. It could almost be its own third act with a little more fleshing out. And the animation is too simple and workmanlike to cover for it, lacking both Miyazaki’s stunning fluidity and Takahata’s incredible artistry. It does have some very good blocking and editing, which helps improve the overall visual punch with strong staging, but the world is just every generic washed-out watercolor “days of our youths” color palette imaginable.Perhaps all that could be forgiven if the romance itself was strong enough to carry the film, but sadly, while the main couple does have decent chemistry, it can only go so far. In fact, I think this film helped me pinpoint my one real consistent criticism of the Ghibli pantheon; I don’t think they write romance very well. Too many times, as with Ocean Waves, I feel like the main couple ends up getting together because that’s what’s “supposed” to happen with the lead guy and lead girl. Even when they do have actual chemistry, that sense of inevitability is really hard to shake. As a result, I feel like the Ghibli movies that handle romance the best- Spirited Away, Ponyo, and Porco Rosso, to just rattle off what comes to mind- are the movies that play the most directly into that emotionally driven spirit. They’re able to sidestep the problem of assumed love by having the central couple just obviously be really fucking good for each other, sailing on their incredible chemistry as the reason to get invested in their relationship. Ocean Waves, though, is aiming to be much more naturalistic, and as a result, it can’t escape the creeping sense that ultimately, the reason these two develop feelings for each other is because some stuffy studio head really believes in the undying power of the “boy meets girl” trope.Perhaps that won’t bother you; like I said, their chemistry is pretty good, all things considered. But it’s indicative of my entire overall apathy towards Ocean Waves. It’s not really good, it’s not really bad, it’s just there, not saying much and not accomplishing anything beyond existing as a sequence of color and light and sound. At the very least, it’s short enough that it never gets boring, and there are a handful of enjoyable moments to keep engagement up. But there’s no reason for anyone to seek out this movie. Only seek it out if, like me, you want to see every single Ghibli film, regardless of whether or not they appeal to you. Because all other Ghibli films, even those I’ve disliked, have more to offer than Ocean Waves. a pale, washed-out aesthetic most reminiscent of the past sequences from Only Yesterday with the color saturation turned every further down.

This aloof attitude gets her labeled as stuck-up and arrogant, but Mastuno quickly develops a crush on her nevertheless. Morisake, meanwhile, is slower to warm up to her, but a series of chance meetings help him realize that her seemingly simple life is a lot more complicated and messy than it first appeared. There’s a constant thread of distrust of authority running throughout the film, as the school administrators and parents of the characters are painted as petty, often self-serving, and more concerned with reputation than their children’s well-being. In Rikako’s case, the pressure takes the form of a fractured family, with a father back in Tokyo and her mother moving to Kochi, with neither of those lives being the life she wants deep down. Yet she’s also been more influenced by that pressure than she realizes, being quick to anger and mistrust, even as Morisake becomes further embroiled in her personal life, sparking jealousy from Matsuno and rumors from the classmates. It’s an interesting angle, and if it was explored further, I think it would give Ocean Waves the sense of identity it’s sorely lacking.Sadly, the film as it exists doesn’t really have that much to say about bucking against authority in the rigid society of Japan, or how kids are pressured by their environments. In truth, it doesn’t have much of anything to say at all. It just sort of goes through the motions, walking through Morisake and Rikako’s developing relationship, hitting all the beats you expect it to hit, and then it’s over. At just barely over an hour’s runtime, Ocean Waves doesn’t have the time it needs to develop any of its observations into anything meaningful. There’s very little sense of structure either; moments come and go, story threads are abandoned just as it feels like they’re really getting going, climaxes just sort of fade into the next scene without any real resolution, and just when it looks like we’re gearing up for a big emotional confrontation that might give some meaning to the story, it jumps ahead to a “Let’s see how far we’ve come” epilogue that’s far too proportionally long in comparison to the rest of the movie. It could almost be its own third act with a little more fleshing out. And the animation is too simple and workmanlike to cover for it, lacking both Miyazaki’s stunning fluidity and Takahata’s incredible artistry. It does have some very good blocking and editing, which helps improve the overall visual punch with strong staging, but the world is just every generic washed-out watercolor “days of our youths” color palette imaginable.Perhaps all that could be forgiven if the romance itself was strong enough to carry the film, but sadly, while the main couple does have decent chemistry, it can only go so far. In fact, I think this film helped me pinpoint my one real consistent criticism of the Ghibli pantheon; I don’t think they write romance very well. Too many times, as with Ocean Waves, I feel like the main couple ends up getting together because that’s what’s “supposed” to happen with the lead guy and lead girl. Even when they do have actual chemistry, that sense of inevitability is really hard to shake. As a result, I feel like the Ghibli movies that handle romance the best- Spirited Away, Ponyo, and Porco Rosso, to just rattle off what comes to mind- are the movies that play the most directly into that emotionally driven spirit. They’re able to sidestep the problem of assumed love by having the central couple just obviously be really fucking good for each other, sailing on their incredible chemistry as the reason to get invested in their relationship. Ocean Waves, though, is aiming to be much more naturalistic, and as a result, it can’t escape the creeping sense that ultimately, the reason these two develop feelings for each other is because some stuffy studio head really believes in the undying power of the “boy meets girl” trope.Perhaps that won’t bother you; like I said, their chemistry is pretty good, all things considered. But it’s indicative of my entire overall apathy towards Ocean Waves. It’s not really good, it’s not really bad, it’s just there, not saying much and not accomplishing anything beyond existing as a sequence of color and light and sound. At the very least, it’s short enough that it never gets boring, and there are a handful of enjoyable moments to keep engagement up. But there’s no reason for anyone to seek out this movie. Only seek it out if, like me, you want to see every single Ghibli film, regardless of whether or not they appeal to you. Because all other Ghibli films, even those I’ve disliked, have more to offer than Ocean Waves.', ""Umi ga Kikoeru is not your typical Ghibli film. The premise is very straightforward and its characters might rub you the wrong way. I believe that is what has thrown a lot of people off. But not enough people realize and appreciate the simplicity of this movie. Compared to romance you see in anime nowadays, in this movie we aren't forced down our throat what each character is feeling at every twist and turn. There aren't any crazy explosions and bgm that cue when the moment is just right. That is this film's charm. It perfectly captures the awkwardness of being an adolescent in love. "", ""A simple, nostalgic, and comforting film. Ocean Waves manages to portray a realistic high school experience and the (both desirable and not so desirable) things it entails. The characters are written in a way that makes them feel like actual high school students, each with their own flaws and imperfections. They experience new things together and support each other, but at the same time act childishly and get into overblown arguments. It is these elements that work together to convey the nostalgia of high school memories – the characters make mistakes, but are able to later look back fondly on the memories they've made. The...relaxing music and simplistic art style complement the movie's slow, laidback atmosphere. However, I will say that the film isn't necessarily romantic, nor does it include a huge obstacle that forces the characters to work together to overcome like many other romance anime. This movie isn't for everyone, but I personally really liked how realistic and nostalgic the film felt. relaxing music and simplistic art style complement the movie's slow, laidback atmosphere.

Rikako being a transfer student from Tokyo. Its a story of how Rikako impacts their life especially Taku in chaotic and dramatic ways. I didn\'t feel like there was a solid plot to it, its mostly documents their life from college to their graduation and ends at reunion with some random events taking place in between.Art-(10/10)Let me be honest, this movie is nothing without its art, its pure aesthetic even after 30 years so yes the art...and animation has actually passed the test of times. It has some great attention to details which some of the modern movies lack. well this is Ghibli, you cant expect any less. From sceneries to characters, its top class.Sound-(7/10)I don\'t have much to say about the sound to be honest, there was nothing bad about it neither there was anything exceptionally outstanding. it was perfect for the scenes and moods as far i remember. and voice actors really did their part, impeccable.character-(6/10)Personally i felt this move was centric around 2 characters, yea there was the 3rd but he wasn\'t the ""main"" main you know? Taku was too good to be real but at the same time he was decent character, so no complaints there. It was great to see him progress as person, moving to Tokyo as he graduated and holding no resentment against his friend. Rikako was a stand out character, you can say the movie revolved around her, a bit too much in my opinion. She played the character of self centered, spoiled and troublesome daughter perfectly. its a pity they didn\'t dive more into her character. As for the side characters, they don\'t really matter much in this movie, there was no attempt to bring them it which is quite understandable if you look at movie duration.overall-(7/10)I will recommend this to you if you have really nothing else to do or if you just wanna relax without thinking what\'s happening in the plot. Its not your typical Ghibli Movie, its really different compared to others, there\'s no fantasy element to it but slice of life, school drama with a pinch of romance. And a lots of beautiful aesthetic. Characters could be relatable if you had any problematic girl in your life XD, you might get bored or you might be in awe with the art style. Movie duration is perfect for a watch so you wont have to suffer for long. in my case I enjoyed it, its definitely better than the overall ratings it has on MAL.

Realistic, calming, and understandable. The characters are simple but likable, with each character\'s point of view touched upon at one point or another during the movie. The story had no particular twists or turns, just a matter of fact- ""this can happen to you"" type feel. I\'m personally not a huge fan of the soft, 90\'s animation style. The characters always seem fuzzy and not as expressive as I\'d like, which is why I gave it a 6/10. The OST was fitting for the storyline and allowed for nice visualization. Overall, it was good. ', ""After watching the anime I immediately went on MAL to rate the movie and I just could not believe the ratings for this show.Personally, I think Ocean Waves deserves more love and appreciation from its viewers. Yes, this anime does not have a complex love story to tell, it does not have those emotional, heart-warming, heart-wrenching scenes and it does not have the kind of romance that is popular in medias but that's what makes this show shine all the more. You rarely see this kind of anime where everything is calm and relaxing but enjoyable at the same time.I like how the personality of...each character is so relatable and also the portrayal of their growth in the last parts of the show.

I thought the bgm was going to be emotional but it turns out to be bubbly and playful.Overall this anime was a nice break from all those mainstream shows I watched.

What is painted as a realistic high school romance ends up being a collection of five or so drabbles which do little to advance its characters, themes, or overarching plot.  I kept waiting for the moment in which the two leads would finally share an emotional scene that delivered on the premise of the movie, but ended up with the best friend character just saying ""by the way, you guys have liked each other the whole time.""As a Ghibli film, the art and sound are expectedly good, but there aren\'t many...chances to really flex either aspect as no scene particularly calls for impressive sakuga or instrumentation.

I came into it expecting a love triangle romance, and instead walked out with a bitter taste of disappointment and confusion. The main character\'s love interest is a snobby, selfish, downright manipulative individual, yet the movie somehow manages to frame it as desirable to the main protagonist. Why would anyone find a person like that desirable, especially years after high school? Are the main protagonist\'s standards so low that he\'d settle for such a manipulative person?Instead of developing a stronger romantic bond between the main character and the love interest, Umi ga Kikoeru instead ham-fists an...impromptu escapade to Tokyo and calls it character development.

Although the movie is a product of its time period, it was likely made with a specific audience in mind, one that desires a run-of-the-mill romance plot with some kind of resolution at the end.

(For the shoujo fans, this ""focus"" explains how/ why Rikako fell in love with Taku)The fourth ""focus"" of the story. Taku and Rikako comes back and goes back to their normal relationship (Yall must not forget relationship =/= feelings cuz they\'d most likely already developed feelings for each other. It\'s not story that is badly written. It\'s usually how highschoolers are). Yutaka finds out about their trip to Tokyo and admits to Taku that he\'d already gotten rejected. Taku rushes to meet Rikako and tell her that she shouldn\'t have told Yutaku that they had stayed in the same hotel.Fifth ""focus"". About Rikako being isolated. Rikako gets in a confliction with her classmates. Taku was punched/slapped by Yutaka/Rikako cuz he\'d been just observing when Rikako was being (kinda) bullied.So, the final ""focus of the story is a class? reunion (more like the graduates of the same year as Taku and Yutaka reuniting). Basically whole bunch of nothing (JUST LIKE IN REAL LIFE). Taku and Rikako stares at each other and the story ends there.10/10 Everything flows smoothly.ART/SOUNDThis is a Ghibli film.10/10CHARACTERSPersonally, the characters almost seemed reminiscent to me. You can empathize with the characters.If yall mfs expected a tragic backstory, yall dumb af. This is a story about highschoolers.You mfs not finding problems with characters in other story and finding problems with this one is buffling to me.10/10ENJOYMENT10/10OVERALL10/10 cuz this is how a story about highschoolers should be. This is some real stuff lmao', 'The Ocean Waves seems to be a less enjoyed film from the Ghibli repertoire, and going in with that knowledge it certainly coloured my perspective but even with that I came out enjoying the movie because the director even though he lacked some clarity I think had his finger on the pulse of this sort of nostalgic feeling, romance that you look back on fondly.Romance in high school (in real life, and especially with Japanese culture considered) is ridiculous, and unnecessarily complex because at that age everyone has blind spots and I think this movie portrays that well.Now one reason, It seems people dislike this...movie is summed up as ""Rikako is a cunt."" I even went in expecting that and it was the complete opposite! The way she acts makes sense with the context of what she is going through. Which is primarily why I wrote this review, to dispel that belief a little.------------------------------------------Spoiler Free Conclusion------------------------------------------I give it a 7/10 overall. There are improvements that could be made by fleshing out some characters a bit more but I think it mostly succeeds in the story it aims to tell. You just might have to think about it a bit more to fully understand the dynamic. It certainly could have been made a bit more easily understandable and relatable.------------------------------------------[Spoilers Begin]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rikako\'s Issues------------------------------------------Rikako is going through a difficult time in her life.She was forced to move from the big city Tokyo to small town Kochi which meant a big lifestyle change in addition to losing her friends, changing schools etc...She then struggles to understand the dialect in Kochi and it hurts her ability to fit in; Which ends up being a problem that persists throughout her entire high school life.The reason she moved is because her parents had a messy divorce and even though she and her father were on the same side in the divorce he didn\'t fight to let her stay with him and keep her life intact. Furthermore, it is heavily implied he very quickly entered another relationship, and this may be the reason he chose to let her move with her mother.She simply feels betrayed by her family. Her Mother for uprooting her and her Father for not standing up for her. So, she lives alone from her Mother in Kochi. She also has no friends because she has a hard time fitting in.Being isolated like this makes it easy to lash out, especially as a teenager. Which explains most of her interactions.------------------------------------------Character Relationships------------------------------------------Then we have Morisaki who’s close friend Yutaka has a major crush on Rikako and out of loyalty to him he does his best not to make any moves on her even though he has seriously fallen for her (whether he realizes it or not).Morisaki ends up having to escort Rikako to Tokyo so Rikako can visit her Father whom she misses and planned to visit (by plane) without her mothers consent. This visit goes badly, and she does not stay with her Father that night and they end up staying together in a hotel. Rikako then confides her deeply personal (and painfully recent) history with Morisaki and he comforts her (sparingly, out of loyalty). Rikako tries to impress him the next day by showing off her old boyfriend but Morisaki calls her out on the stupidity of the situation and she agrees it was stupid.After this point it\'s clear Rikako likes Morisaki, probably due to his level head and for being able to call her out on her stupid attempt to impress him. He also is somebody she trusts and is one of the only people to have been kind to her in Kochi. I think she also know he likes her back too at this point.That makes it even more frustrating when he refuses to reciprocate out of continued loyalty to Matsuno. So now she just feels worse, she is so close to somebody but cannot reach out to them. She probably feels even more isolated, maybe humiliated even for sharing her life and having a vulnerable moment with him.Then Matsuno confesses to her. I think it\'s clear now why she acts harshly to this.She knows that he is the reason Morisaki is steering clear of her, and so when he confesses to her she tells him, she hates him and Kochi and everyone from here.Then Matsuno tells this to Morisaki and he gets incredibly angry at Rikako for doing this to his friend and he storms away to talk to her. They have a big public fight at school, and he yells at her basically defending himself (from the rumours about sleeping together in Tokyo) and his friend from her words. She slaps him and he slaps her back then she tells him before leaving ""You\'re such a loyal friend! Satisfied?""------------------------------------------Final School Scene------------------------------------------Then everything explodes once more soon after. Rikako isolates herself further not participating in school events and such. Which results in her getting ganged up on by the other girls for not helping in the school festival events.Morisaki witnesses this and afterwards tells her sarcastically that she was impressive standing up to them and making one of them cry.This hurts and angers Rikako because from her perspective he should understand why it is so difficult for her, and that she likes him. So, she slaps him (again) and runs off crying.Matsuno sees Rikako running away crying and finds Morisaki who he asks what happened. Morisaki says she got scolded by her classmates and she stood up to them. He gets angry that Morisaki didn\'t step in for her and punches him to the floor.Matsuno did this because (as explained later) he realized at that moment that Morisaki has been holding back on his behalf, and in a moment of anger and frustration at himself for not realizing this, he punches him.Morisaki is left feeling confused Rikako’s reaction, (because he fails to see she likes him) and further confused at Matsuno’s reaction of sudden anger.At their age we are all so focused on ourselves and can\'t see beyond that. Every character had blind spots. (Rikako’s being that she should have realized lashing out would not improve her situation, as hard as it is to stop. And she could have been more direct.)------------------------------------------Conclusion of Film / Theme------------------------------------------In the end Morisaki and Rikako meet up in Tokyo after the class reunion and likely end up together. At this point they have both grown up and can see the faults of the past clearly.There is also a small theme of how it\'s so difficult to go through life when your world is so small, and you lack perspective.A classmate that didn\'t like Rikako in high school commented at the reunion""It\'s kind of like changing seats. When you are little and must sit next to someone you hate, you do not even want to go to school. The problem is your world is too small. If you have something other than school, like piano lessons, people you dislike aren\'t a problem.""It just shows how differently you act when you\'re older and you realize the world is bigger than just what you see, and how little some things matter. It is a pretty surface level observation, but it is applicable to how people treat each other and make a big deal of rumours and such during that period of their lives.As I said it\'s a bit of a shallow observation so I think it could have been implemented a bit better but perhaps that\'s partly the translations fault.------------------------------------------Final Score & Thoughts------------------------------------------In conclusion, I give this film a 7/10 which is above the average 6.67/10 it has currently (which is rare for me). I think there is a lot of room to make this more easily relatable and understandable without analyzing it so deeply. I also think Morisaki’s character could have been fleshed out a bit more to support why he chooses to be so loyal or why he cannot see that she likes him. There is just something missing to make this truly stand out from the typical unrequited love story.As far as the score it blended well with the film and didn’t draw too much attention to itself and the art is pretty typical 90s style and is well animated. Although, I think the animation is a bit lacking in the Ghibli magic department, expressing characters through their body language is important and it is lacking in this movie.Throwaway, but memorable scenes that show how a character moves are great and there was in fact a short tennis scene of Rikako that portrayed her as an otherwise confident girl but that was pretty much all we had and it again lacked that magic that really made her feel human. movie is summed up as ""Rikako is a cunt.""

First off the animation and soundtrack are particularly beautifully done, simple, but it matches the atmosphere and weight of the story - very light. The plot is where this film can be seen as poorly done or strangely memorable, and I am coming down on the latter of the options. I myself have never really been one for coming of age tales, and this movie didn\'t change that fact, due to it almost being an pseudo coming of age / romance story. Characters don\'t go through life changing arcs as they mature, nor is there a heavy...romantic overtone, or even undertone for that matter in the majority of the movie. Ocean Waves almost creates it\'s own sort of genre which I will call the ""personal story"" due to the story feeling mundane, but realistic, as it would be for the viewer\'s life experiences. So from the point of view that you are witnessing a very realistic depiction of a younger man\'s life, the story and characters may not be your absolute favourite, but it is immensely satisfying after you watch it. My only gripes being that it wasn\'t longer and having had more light shined on some of the side characters who were sort of made relevant at the end. romantic overtone, or even undertone for that matter in the majority of the movie.

The Ocean Waves is such an anime. Directed by Tomomi Mochizuki (Ranma ½ S1 and episode director of various romance anime) he seemed to be the right choice.This is a very simple anime with it not trying to do anything more than it has to. The story follows Taku Morisaki during his high school days with his friend Yutaka until a Tokyo girl transfers into school. Thus, in true anime fashion creates various incidents between the three and how this Tokyo girl changes Taku.No this romance anime isn’t going to...bring any tears or have anything truly worth building up, but a smooth story, good animation, and capturing human emotion is Ocean Waves’ strong points. This is definitely an anime for an older audience to understand the mature nature of the it’s story and characters. What happens in high school? What matters? How fragile is a relationship? These are just some of the topics hit in The Ocean Waves.Keeping it short, like the anime, while this is not the most exciting thing to come out of the Ghibli studio, it still is something worth noting. It is closer to compare the mature nature of Gauche the Cellist and combine with elements of Kimagure Orange Road. The Ocean Waves is something not to be overlooked, but also not anything breathtaking. bring any tears or have anything truly worth building up, but a smooth story, good animation, and capturing human emotion is Ocean Waves’ strong points.

The Ocean Waves is something not to be overlooked, but also not anything breathtaking.', '“Come back when you’re in the top 100!But I’m at 89 already!”The aesthetic of this film is extremely crisp. Everything from the beautiful animation (as to be expected from Ghibli, even if it’s one of their b-teams) to the elegant soundtrack, filled with flowing flutes and playful keyboard sections. The colors are all soothing to the eye, and the outfits are SPECTACULAR and honestly probably nail most of the film’s aesthetic down to what it became. Even the framing does some unique techniques, using a white border to frame a smaller screen of the animation from time to time. All of these aspects come together...to give off a comforting “slice-of-life” feeling that you don’t find that often in current day media.The main characters, Taku and Rikako, are also both pretty fantastic. Rikako is very dense, and has too many layers for Taku to really understand her on a decent level, and doesn’t really get a grasp of what he was clueless on until he’s an adult. Taku is very straight to the point and scarce, and doesn’t exactly look into the deeper issues he faces, instead going more off of the face value of it.These characters clash, and it should be more memorable, but unfortunately it’s not. Ocean Waves feels like it’s missing substance at times when it tries to introduce further drama into this relationship. These characters are great, but the plot is a bit too nonsensical and sloppy to embody them.Ocean Waves is most comparable to a late night drive for me. Sure, it’s enjoyable in the present, but how much of this experience will you really remember? Maybe a couple standout things, but both deliver a similar promise: to relax the mind and unwind a bit while partaking in both. Even after just finishing it, I can only remember the few great things about this film, but the melodramatic, and almost mindless plot become distracting as the film comes to a close.Once you realize you only have about 10 minutes, you say to yourself “Really? That’s all? I was feeling comfortable where I was at, but now I’m being thrown off with little conclusion to walk away with?” While the film does have a decent ending, it just feels weakened from how little it did to build up to this state. I think another 15 minutes detailing more info on Taku and Rikako’s interactions would have made this feel a bit more worthwhile.Otherwise, a pretty enjoyable experience I suppose. It had some small editing issues here and there, but they’re small enough to be forgivable. It’s aesthetic is strong enough to get through the film by just taking in how gorgeous some parts of it look. Perfect is too much, but calling it unique feels more proper.

Unfortunately it is also missing Ghibli's fantastic story telling and charm.We follow Taku Morisaki a pretty normal small town highschool guy. Everything is normal until the big town and down right b**ch Rikako Muto transfers to school. She pretty much avoids everyone and does nothing to fit in or hardly speaks to anyone. They...take a school trip to hawaii where Muto speaks to Taku and asks him for money right away which he very stupidly gives to her along with his friend who is just as stupid.Later we find out this money is being used to let Muto go to Tokyo to see her father and she wants to drag her new friend along regardless of how her friend feels about it. The friend calls Taku who shows up to try and stop her only to end up taking the friends place and head to Tokyo with a girl he has hardly spoken to. They proceed to have a bad time n the trip and return home and end up fighting which includes them both hitting each other. You can clearly see how this is a blossoming romance. . . . .Taku seems like a decent guy and why he falls for a selfish girl that treats everyone like trash is a mystery me even going as far as to apply for collage in Tokyo to go and look for her.For me Muto ruins this movie and its a real shame as it looks very nice for a 1993 release and i was really hoping to find a hidden gem here but it just wasn't to be thankfully it is short so its not a bad watch if you want some decent 90s animation and a story that while has a awful lead isn't bad enough to ruin your day. If you want to watch it to tick off your Ghibli check list then by all means watch it and move on.

The plot was pretty bland and the final resolution was pretty unsatisfactory. The characters were not your typical protagonists, but the development of their characters didn’t really happen until the last 15 minutes of the movie. There were several points in the story where you think you know the characters and what will happen, but then later the characters act unexpectedly, and for reasons that simply you could not tell. That was a little confusing, but the mood of this movie is alright. The realism is refreshing, and I liked how friendship was a stronger...theme than romance.

It's kind of a scattered here and there though and at times the story doesn't feel like it's there at all, which isn't something you want your movie's story to do...very meh.Art/Visuals:C'mon, it's a Studio Ghibli movie, OF COURSE IT'S GONNA LOOK NICE!

Basically, all the other characters are fine except Rikako, can't stand her.Overall:While I don't ADORE this movie to no end a very few select people do, I don't despise it like most do. It's not a perfect movie, but it ain't the worst thing in the world either. It's just a shame that this movie came out like this because I feel like with a bit more time, rewriting, and money, we could've had a FANTASTIC movie. But as it is...it's ok. I really just wanted to see how...BL thing would get and it didn't go anywhere, that's just me expecting too much.I guess if you're into dramas, Ghibli movies, or you just wanna kill some time, go for it."", ""Ocean Waves was the first Studio Ghibli movie to not be directed by Miyazaki or Takahata and is not your standard Ghibli fare; it lacks the imaginative fantasy of the former and the emotional gravity of the latter, instead opting for a more nuanced and reflective experience over its brief 72 minute runtime.The story begins with Taku taking a flight back to his hometown to attend his high school reunion and proceeds to reflect on his final year when he befriended Yutaka and first met Rikako, a girl who has relocated from Tokyo and takes an immediate disliking to her new surroundings. What follows is...a series of flashbacks narrated by Taku of his encounters with her.Despite the high production qualities which one would expect of a Ghibli film, Ocean Waves is severely lacking in plot and character development. Although Taku is the main protagonist and narrator for the film, he has very little characterisation and acts almost as a passive observer in his own life, whilst Rikako is someone who immediately comes across as manipulative and unpleasant with some of her earlier interactions. Rikako also appears at a glance to be the only one with some kind of arc; we learn why she is the way she is, but this doesn't excuse her treatment of the other characters, and the sympathy that we are meant to feel is inherently expected and not genuinely earned.The plot is simply a sequence of events that can be described as boy-meets-girl, friend-falls-in-love-with-girl, girl-rejects-friend, boy-is-forced-along-on-a-trip-to-Tokyo and... I think you get the general idea. Things happen and then nothing follows. Everything feels contrived, even the ending - and considering the conflict between the protagonists the ending feels almost ridiculous in its sudden realisation. Taku is supposed to be spending his flight reflecting but never has any sudden revelations or epiphanies; he simply explains the events that happened and that's it.Yet despite the obvious issues with the film, I can't help but think about its charm; this is a slow, quiet, thoughtful movie. This isn't a lost Ghibli classic at all, but it has a certain charm. In life all we can do is look back passively at the events that took place, we cannot change them but that's not where our stories end. Maybe that is the true purpose of this film (probably not, but it won't stop me from watching it again). a series of flashbacks narrated by Taku of his encounters with her.Despite the high production qualities which one would expect of a Ghibli film, Ocean Waves is severely lacking in plot and character development.

Instead of being directed by Hayao Miyazaki it was directed by Tomomi Mochizuki as it was developed by the younger staff to make it cheaply and quickly but in good quality. The story takes place in a small sea town called Kochi and features two best friends called Taku Morisaki and Yutaka Matsuno who get caught up in the arrival of the new female transfer student from Tokyo called Rikako Muto, from there friendship is challenged by love. I would say the...story flowed really well, it seemed very natural and it wasn't trying to be overly dramatic, it did keep me interested and I found the characters made up for that - Taku Morsaki, the main character, was very likable and interesting as he seemed hardworking, helpful and with a good head of his shoulders when it comes to responsibility. The other two characters such as his best friend Yutaka Matsuno were interesting but I felt there could of been more to be shown from his character, I would say the most interesting of all would be other character Rikako Muto, she seems spoiled and immature but throughout the story you can begin to see the reasons why. I like how each character begins to grow and mature throughout the journey.I would say the animation was very good, it is 90's animation but for that I'm very fond of and the animation is done very well, the colours are gentle and the characters and environments seem very natural. I would say the music was very good, it set the tone for the movie in that it is soft and gentle. The voice acting I found was very good, each matched the character and their personality very well.I would recommend to watch if you like slice of life, drama, and romance. I think if you liked the other Studio Ghibli movies such as Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart then this is worth having a go. I did find it very enjoyable and relaxing to watch, it wasn't trying to force anything and it allowed you to draw up your own ideas and conclusion throughout the movie. story flowed really well, it seemed very natural and it wasn't trying to be overly dramatic, it did keep me interested and I found the characters made up for that - Taku Morsaki, the main character, was very likable and interesting as he seemed hardworking, helpful and with a good head of his shoulders when it comes to responsibility.

Rikako is selfish, as she painfully tries to work through her parents divorce. Taku, understandably, wavers between getting fed up with her and sympathizing with her. He's a naturally kind person, but that kindness will only go so far. In youth, sometimes it's hard to understand or see other people's perceptions because you're so caught up in your own feelings. I think Ocean Waves captures this perfectly.The movie's plot is essentially high school drama, but watching how these characters deal...with the drama was interesting, unexpected and realistic. At times, you hate these characters and at other times, you understand them. I think the films provides a realistic portray of teenagers.It's not a masterpiece, but I don't think it's as terrible as some say either. Ocean Waves is about how in our youth, we get so caught up in things and at the time, they seem justifiable. Looking back, they seem like nothing. It provides a space for nostalgia, and captures the fun in getting caught up in the moment; even if two people are completely uncompatiable at the time. with the drama was interesting, unexpected and realistic.

And once we grow up, we can revisit those feelings and realise what motivated the way we behaved when we were younger.

It has a really nice slice-of-life quality to it without feeling too slow or lagging....However the message of the film is extremely weak and feels like a heteronormative slap in the face.Art: 8/10Well now I know where all the lofi people get their art from.

Yutaka is a boring supporting character. Taku is a great main character who obviously has developed his own morals and sense of what is right and wrong while still sometimes acting like a teenage boy.

This is a Studio Ghibli made movie that I had almost never heard of before. But just the other day I came across a list of must watched anime movies which had this one in it. I told myself, ""Ok that\'s kinda odd. What is this one about? Is it really any good?"" And gave it a blind watch. Here are some thoughts.The first few minutes of the clip hit me hard with visually pleasing art. No, there\'s no dazzle in it like...most of today\'s anime. It\'s the old school realistic sketchwork kinda vibe, which I probably like better. The character design, the body proportion, the objects are realistic and drawn beautifully. So it instantly got my attention.The setting wasn\'t too bad either. It\'s college romance. It\'s nothing special. The story is nothing that will stay in your mind forever. But you know, if the anime delivers well and just does what it tries it do properly, then a mediocre story isn\'t a big obstacle. And that\'s exactly what it did. It doesn\'t try too hard to stand out. It just tells the story in a pleasant way.By far the best part if the movie was it\'s characters. They are realistic and you feel easily connected with them. They act their age for a change. Some of the viewers may not like the main heroine, but I thought she acted like a normal girl. Sometimes a touch of realism and elegance can go a long way to make a mediocre setting into a good one. And to top it off, the ending was masterful.Overall, it\'s not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. But I will confidently say that it is a good romantic movie that does what it should do very well. Watch it with a calm mind, try to connect with the characters (which should come naturally tho), and you will like it.MAL score - 6.79Personal score - 8 most of today\'s anime.

Ocean Waves is not conventionally imaginative, it more so a simple story about the journey of a boy falling in love with a girl from Tokyo. There's no extreme conflict or anything out of the ordinary that pops out in the movie; it is the definition of the slice of life genre. However, despite what Studio Ghibli is known for, it has found the perfect balance between plot, characters, and music that makes an impact on their audience. This is impact is...simple none the less, and that's what's makes it so memorable. It is natural and essentially, it is the most tangible and realistic movie we have where we can experience what's it like to be part of the amazing world of Studio Ghibli.Doing small research, Ocean Waves is the only movie that does not have an English Dub. I think it was a good decision to not push for a dub because other Ghibli films take place in the world of fantasy, so regardless of the language, it will still relate the same meaning to all. As for Ocean Waves, leaving it to the original is the best move because it adds to the realistic component that the movie portrays.Overall, Ocean Waves is definitely a piece that leaves a hint of nostalgia regardless of one's age. Given that the plot is a man reflecting on his life back in time, it is the music components and especially the art style that help enhance our feelings of nostalgia. The watercolor-like art style is consistent with the Ghibli, but it is the soft color components that Ghibli doesn't usually use that bring out our feelings of longing, jealousy of the past, and wanting to go back to those moments of youth. Recently, many hype Ocean Waves up now for the aesthetics, but honestly, I personally feel like it should be acclaimed for more than simply that, but rather it is the movie helps us go back to where we were most happy. simple none the less, and that's what's makes it so memorable.

I think it was a good decision to not push for a dub because other Ghibli films take place in the world of fantasy, so regardless of the language, it will still relate the same meaning to all. As for Ocean Waves, leaving it to the original is the best move because it adds to the realistic component that the movie portrays.Overall, Ocean Waves is definitely a piece that leaves a hint of nostalgia regardless of one's age. Given that the plot is a man reflecting on his life back in time, it is the music components and especially the art style that help enhance our feelings of nostalgia. The watercolor-like art style is consistent with the Ghibli, but it is the soft color components that Ghibli doesn't usually use that bring out our feelings of longing, jealousy of the past, and wanting to go back to those moments of youth.

Still, I've never seen an outright bad Ghibli film, and this doesn't break that streak. It's a refreshing coming-of-age story set against the picturesque backdrop of a seaside town.Like Takahata's masterful Only Yesterday, Ocean Waves features characters reflecting on their school experiences and the way they shaped them as adults. However, Ocean Waves features college-aged characters reflecting on high school experiences, so everything is much more recent and compact. At the heart of the story, and what hurts it the most, is an ill-defined and...somewhat unnecessary love triangle between the protagonist, his best friend, and a beautiful but complicated transfer student. The main reason why Ocean Waves doesn't make much of an impact is that it doesn't develop its core characters sufficiently; Matsuno's entire character in particular, as well as his relationship to the two protagonists, is left woefully undeveloped. Partway through the story, the focus shifts to the growing pains of young adulthood and the confusing pangs of first love, which completely sideline both Matsuno and the initial premise.Protagonists Morisaki and Muto are very believable as high school students, and often crass or emotionally clumsy in ways that feel real. Many people reviewing this film have voiced their dislike for the female lead, not realizing that her unstable and manipulative nature is clearly borne from her family situation. Teenagers act out in sometimes callous or destructive ways, and the juvenile fighting and bickering of Ocean Waves is true to the high school experience. Regardless, it never really feels like we fully get to know any of these characters, perhaps because they're still fresh out of school when the story takes place, so there hasn't been much time for growth.However, like most Ghibli films, it has a heartfelt and somewhat melancholy resolution. Few films zero in on the way that your world, and the people you see every day in high school, can completely change after graduation day. Whatever seemed of vital importance back then is a trifle now, and the people who you once swore eternal allegiance to are now distant, living their own lives in other cities. The film's refreshing rural setting and often stunning seaside backgrounds, along with its nostalgic early-nineties fashion choices, make this an eminently likable movie, if not an extremely memorable one. somewhat unnecessary love triangle between the protagonist, his best friend, and a beautiful but complicated transfer student.

The two male protagonists act really irrational at times, especially the main one (forgot his name, the one without glasses), and while I could forgive them if the girl of their interest was the most perfect person or extraordinarily beautiful, that was certainly not the case. Although she was constantly being described as being the most beautiful and standing out a whole bunch academically, her design was super generic and she didn't get to prove any of her supposedly qualities to the audience.On top of it, which was actually the...most infuriating aspect of this watch, her personality was absolute trash: selfish, harsh, mean, exploitative, manipulative, narcissistic, the list goes on. Which made it even more incomprehensible when the main character finally admitted to himself that he had actually fallen for her. I legit was sighing loudly at the screen and made a big ol' facepalm.So no, this movie was not enjoyable to watch from a romance point of view, it was more frustrating to see everyone just do what the main girl wanted. I guess the most understandable people in the whole movie were the girl bullies/female classmates, because honestly, as bad as this sounds, they had a fair point in being angry at the main girl.Overall, the art of course was beautiful (as expected from Studio Ghibli) and I guess the story at least had good pacing and the usual nice visuals. I do understand now though why I had never heard of this movie before. most infuriating aspect of this watch, her personality was absolute trash: selfish, harsh, mean, exploitative, manipulative, narcissistic, the list goes on.

In the beginning of the movie i was like “omg ya, literally he’s in love with him” and the more i watched the more i felt like ya he is totally not interested in rikaku. I felt like that all the way up until the infamous slap scene.firstly good on him on slapping her back and wow!!! the tension of that one scene alone was able to get my attention back for the whole movie. maybe i...mistake passion for love but since that scene i was like, “ya no rikaku is in love with him”. I’m not sure why taku went down to speak to her after she said those cruel words to yutaka, that kinda confirmed the gay unrequited love theory and honestly maybe (definitely) that would’ve been more interesting but i don’t hate this story. I still don’t understand why yutaka punched taku like what? you punched him (and the ghousted him) cause he was holding back lmfao whatever. I think he did the right think and rikaku literally handles herself like the bad bitch she is. music was aight, artstyle was sexy and classic and i felt entertained.extra* rikaku’s character lol. at the beginning i hated her cause it felt like she was using taku, then i liked her a lot and she seemed semi-sweet then she got boring at the end. like when they met at the **SPOILER** end at the train station it was like okay do something now, kiss him don’t just stand there and smile, what happened to all your fire??? ya but that was just my added note mistake passion for love but since that scene i was like, “ya no rikaku is in love with him”.

Even just as a movie, it sucks.There is no plot with every character being both shallow and stupid. We get a little background on our main character Taku and his best friend Yutaka (who he seems to have a little crush on) then jump to when the new girl Rikako transfers to school. Both friends develop a crush on her, but Yutaka hides his feelings until the very end of the movie. He...basically becomes a supporting character for Taku and Rikako\'s ""romance"" instead of a much needed source of conflict. Rikako is the absolute worst. She\'s a manipulative, lying, self absorbed child and Taku lets her walk all over him. She starts by borrowing money from Taku under the guise that she lost hers. This is no small amount of money mind you, this is $300. What does Rikako use the money for? Buying plane tickets for her and her friend to go to Tokyo to visit her father. Her friend Yumi is caught just as off guard as Taku who ends up volunteering to take her place. In Tokyo after leaving Taku in the lobby so Rikako can talk to her father, she ends up using Taku to make her ex boyfriend jealous after telling Taku he was saving her from a situation. When they get back from their impromptu trip, Rikako treats Taku like dirt but somehow gets mad and slaps Taku. Thankfully, the best part of the movie is a second later when Taku slaps her right back. Because of this, Taku looks the other way when some girls are confronting Rikako about not doing anything and skipping for their dance performance. Yutaka finally makes his reappearance just to tell Taku he\'s wrong for not helping and punches him in the face. They don\'t talk from then, passed graduation, and into their first year of college but for some reason Yutaka picks Taku up from the airport many years later for the high school reunion. Rikako doesn\'t show up (of course) but Taku realizes he\'s madly in love with her when he sees her on the train platform the next day. All of these characters are terrible and stupid with Rikako being the worst one as you can see. I have no idea what the writers were thinking if they were trying to make any semblance of a real teenage romance.The technical aspects about the movie were fine. The animation was good in thr usual Ghibli style. Being a 90s anime movie it has the signature grittyness of the time. Backgrounds are hand drawn but stand out from the rest of the scene, especially in establishing shots. The music is serviceable. It adds nothing to this nothing movie but at least isn\'t bad.I didn\'t not enjoy Ocean Waves whatsoever. Terrible characters, no plot, mediocre music and animation, honestly some of Studio Ghibli\'s worst work. It seems like the usual company powerhouses didn\'t work on this film and it really shows.

However, I must say the art is just 11/10 if you are into the older anime vibe you will love this part. It shines so much, I would recommend watching this just to appreciate the animation, also watch it on a big screen like tv if possible. Before I forget, the soundtrack is the perfect fit for the animation. Both elements go hand in hand so well tgh it just brings so much more to the show. Lastly not forgetting...the harmonic, voice acting, on point great film loved it. If I have one criticism it would be, the show left me feeling nostalgic abt my sch days and v single.

The plot is very simple and plain, no real development and no big events happening which kind of makes you wonder what the whole point is. Personally, I didn't find any deep meaning to it.

There's many of those around, and some manage to stand out. Sadly, I don't think Ghibli fully worked its magic here.We grow to understand and relate to the characters to some extent throughout the movie, but even at just over an hour in length, it still feels dragged out without much progress being made.The art, however, is charming, and the music is adecuate to such a slow-paced movie.I still would not recommend this one other than for completionist reasons, as there are many better alternatives to slow-paced rural...japan stories out there. japan stories out there."", 'Oh my god this movie infatuated me; I don\'t normally write reviews on MAL but I feel like I have a fair bit to say on this.Firstly, the animation. It\'s not as visually incredible as Ghibli\'s other works (e.g. Only Yesterday and My Neighbour Totoro came out before and take place in a similar style but have slightly nicer backdrops), and this is because with this film, Studio Ghibli let it be animated almost entirely by young new animators, which in my opinion I think is great because it gives them fantastic experience early on in their careers without hurting the animation too badly, since...I still think it looks great. Moments like the scene with Taku and Yutaka wistfully looking at the sea from the pier is one of my favourite parts of the film. The entire vibe and aesthetic of moments like this and in general the whole movie is part of the reason I like this film so much, which takes me on to my next point.A big theme of this film is definitely nostalgia, and is portrayed through the high school setting and protagonists and that is added to in recent years from the 90s nostalgic anime aesthetic. As a teenage high schooler myself though, I find this film to be more relatable than nostalgic; almost as if I\'d probably make the exact same decisions as Taku does in the film.Speaking of Taku, now on to the characters. This is most people\'s problem with the film as they find Taku and Yutaka boring and Rikako being unlikeable. I personally have no problem with this as all 3 feel like they\'d be real characters. Most people in life don\'t have complicated problems like Rikako does and everyone knows a girl like her. However I do acknowledge and also admit that I think the film would\'ve been better if the relationship between Taku and Yutaka was explored a bit more. They have very good chemistry and it is hinted at very heavily throughout the movie that they may have feelings for each other which is why I wish the ending was a bit more open ended with some possibility of a relationship between Taku and Yutaka. Either that or adding a few more scenes with Rikako acting more positively toward Taku, since near the end he reminisces over his time with Rikako while thinking about her and all  of it is her being negative toward him; it\'s almost comical. Then again, I do suppose in real life end up falling for no clear reason and Rikako probably feels that Taku is the only one who somewhat understood her problems, which is why she was willing to go to Tokyo to find him. Furthermore, many high school relationships are a bit like this since teenagers like Rikako are yet to mature and realise the world doesn\'t revolve around their problems. It all adds to the realism and relatability of the film in my opinion.But that\'s pretty much my only problem with it. The story is simple but works wonderfully. It\'s not trying to be something grand or super deep, it\'s just a laid back high school love story between 3 people. The score also reflects it perfectly of the mood of the film and the quiet sea side town that it is set in, being calming and nostalgic. One leitmotif from the main theme of the movie ""If I could be the Ocean"" is repeated often times throughout the film which perhaps reflects the repetitive but nostalgic high school life and the melancholy life of the town Kochi.To finish off the review, I\'ll recap on the film\'s main theme: Nostalgia. It looks back to a time where the smallest school melodramas meant the end of the world. Even at the reunion scene at the end you can see people laughing at the things they used to worry about. Even if they were not all always happy and sometimes turbulent, it was still nevertheless a simpler time when their only concern was what others thought of them. This turbulence in the characters teenage years may even reflect the name of the film: Ocean Waves; how life flows back so simply and forth like the waves of an ocean. All in all, Studio Ghibli\'s most underrated film for sure. I still think it looks great.

If you like nostalgia you’ll probably like it, and even if you don’t, it’s short, so it isn’t a time sink.Story [6]In theory this is a good story about romance and the coming of age of three high school students, it’s slow paced, but that isn’t a problem; what is a problem are the characters: in a movie with these themes they should carry the story, and while they are good enough to make the movie somewhat enjoyable, they aren’t good enough to make it truly good.Art [8]The animation is fluid and generally very good. Also very...good is the art style: its nineties look and feel is part of the appeal.Sound [8]The soundtrack is very good at portraying the character’s feelings and at setting the mood for what is happening on screen.Characters [6]The characters are the main downfall of this movie: if they are taken one by one they aren’t easy to relate to, but they aren’t badly written; what really is a problem is the lack of chemistry between the male and female lead which makes it hard to believe in the romance that the movie builds up to.Enjoyment [9]Even though this film is far from perfect, I very much enjoy it: at the time of writing this review I’ve seen it three times already.What really sells this movie to me is the feeling of nostalgia that it gives off: maybe it’s because it’s one of the first anime I’ve ever seen, but it’s greatly helped by the art style and by the soundtrack. good is the art style: its nineties look and feel is part of the appeal.Sound [8]The soundtrack is very good at portraying the character’s feelings and at setting the mood for what is happening on screen.Characters [6]The characters are the main downfall of this movie: if they are taken one by one they aren’t easy to relate to, but they aren’t badly written; what really is a problem is the lack of chemistry between the male and female lead which makes it hard to believe in the romance that the movie builds up to.Enjoyment [9]Even though this film is far from perfect, I very much enjoy it: at the time of writing this review I’ve seen it three times already.What really sells this movie to me is the feeling of nostalgia that it gives off: maybe it’s because it’s one of the first anime I’ve ever seen, but it’s greatly helped by the art style and by the soundtrack.', ""This movie garnered a lot of attention and traction in recent years due to the resemblance of Taku Morisaki and Jungkook BTS, so I'm not going to pretend that I watched it not because of this reason. I think I watched this film with a particularly open minded view, I knew that the senior directors didn't contribute, I knew that it has pretty mediocre reviews and so I didn't expect much.It's natural to be disappointed. Honestly it was really hard to watch because I did not like Rikako very much !! Seriously. I mean perhaps this trope of characters is like a ~thing~ and seen...as like normal or something, but I just couldn't with her. Taku on the other hand, was a gem ! I found myself really liking him instantly because of his curious and hopeless naïveté that really shows his youth and innocence.There's also a lot of talk about this film lowkey portraying queer characters, notably the friendship turned complicated acquaintance between Taku and Yutaka. It was interesting because I find that a lot of the inner monologues hinted at something more than friendship, but take what you will !I recommend this film for people who enjoy nothing but tranquil vibes and retro animation and visuals because this film was very beautiful in that aspect. Not much happens so if you're more into character diagnosis and exploration than plot, this is very much for you. as like normal or something, but I just couldn't with her.

The most underrated Ghibli film BY FAR-- maybe even the most underrated Japanese anime movie out there. Ocean Waves exemplifies this sense of melancholic nostalgia, harkening back to halfway-fuzzy memories of a youth filled with regrets and wishes and friendships and love, all of those teenage histrionics flooding back into your mind s you suddenly realize-- oh, so that's why that was.It's a realistic melodrama with no need to be anything but...live-action, but the gorgeous art style and Ghibli-standard animation is a vital part of why the movie succeeds so powerfully. The top-notch soundtrack, probably one of Ghibli's all-time best, flitters away with a nice electronic glow that keeps a faint smile on your lips throughout the story. The aesthetics of youth, is what I'd call all of this. Tears falling while laughing.Morisaki is ostensibly the protagonist, and the entire movie is his own reflections, but it's clear as day that the spotlight is on Muto, one real tough, real complicated girl even when the position she plays in the movie SHOULD be a generic unobtainable-object-of-affection type that these kinds of movies usually take. She's got an incredible character arc, a really strong personality that's conflicted and contradictory and never quite reconciled, someone so interesting that the final scene that SHOULD have been trite ends up just grabbing you in even more.Obviously, we can pretty directly compare Ocean Waves to its two-years-earlier predecessor, Only Yesterday. Both movies are nostalgic portraits of youth as reflected on by characters that are older, but still young enough that they're going through their own youthful pitfalls. Luckily, Ocean Waves acts as a companion piece rather than a redundancy by channeling specifically those overdramatic world-changing moments of high school that don't actually end up mattering. Both of them have many similar themes, but I can love them both (albeit not equally; Only Yesterday is way better).The final note I'll leave off on here is just the number of times I sighed while watching this movie, especially during the Tokyo trip scenes. Sighs of empathy, sighs of exasperation, sighs of reflections on my own life in the time since high school... an entire genre of sighs all at this one movie. There should be a scientific meter relating to how much a movie makes you sigh. live-action, but the gorgeous art style and Ghibli-standard animation is a vital part of why the movie succeeds so powerfully.

It is very unfair to rate the movie based on Current Standards in terms of animation, detailing, etc afterall there is a massive difference of 27 years.Moreover there is nothing special about the story - Plain Romance Drama. But does this make this anime bad? I don't think so. Infact I liked the simplicity of the story.Another thing that I really appreciate about this movie is the fact that here the female main character is not strong, naive & idealistic - a trend clearly visible in every other Studio Ghibli movie released after this movie. The inherent behavioural flaws of the main...characters make this movie more realistic than others.The artwork is pretty great considering the era. Sure the character designs (like character faces) are same in other Ghibli movies but those were the ones released after this. The direction is simple & effective. Nothing complicated is tried in storytelling which is appreciated. The sound effects were good too. characters make this movie more realistic than others.The artwork is pretty great considering the era.

Nothing. Chick moves to school, is an absolute snob, standoff b*tch and then complains, wondering “why don’t I have any friends, woe is me, it’s so not fair.” With this, after mocking his accent, she takes advantage of the protagonist by lying about losing her money so she can ask him for his after having learned he probably has enough because he was working. Get this- she was even dishonest and used the god d*mn money to buy a f*cking plane ticket to Tokyo, deceiving her only friend who...chickens out forcing the protagonist to tag along with her out of pity. Her father is kind enough to get him a hotel room! Not that it mattered because c*nt ass whore fell asleep on his bed drunk forcing him to sleep in the bathtub after having dragged him all the f*cling way out there. Then, first thing in the morning, she kicks him out to go show off to her ex from highschool. Peachy. You then learn that the movies explanation for why she is the way she is is because of a nasty divorce. And yeah, that does suck, been there done that, but good lord what a lazy, underwhelming and underdeveloped excuse for such a despicable character.This is only halfway through the movie. It gets worse, but you get it.Now you may be thinking, “well, highschool kids are real jerks. This must have some story or message that allows the watcher to gain a larger understanding of a story that expresses a part of human nature.” - or something like that. There must be a bigger meaning here?Well, maybe there was. But holy sh*t, there was absolutely nothing to show it. None of the characters got developed in the slightest. The protagonist kept taking her abuse, she kept abusing, and the protagonists best friend kept fawning over her. There was absolutely no change. Even though she was absolutely AWFUL to the protagonist and his friend, they fell for her anyways. Even though they had hardly any pleasant history, the protagonist claims he was “always crazy for her” with absolutely no elaboration. Why???? Did her slapping u turn u on?? Nothing. Nothing. When he half-opacity reminisces about their history together all of it was her being a complete b*tch, because that is all she ever was on screen. Truly ironic.I think the reason I am only so upset about this is because I LOVE studio Ghibli and this is really a let down. Though, of course, they managed to pull through with beautiful animation. Nice, soft, pastel post-war Japan. Aesthetically pleasing, sure. But even the art doesn’t particularly stand out among other Ghibli movies, so I am unsure of whether this should actually score it points.I’m conclusion: don’t waste your time. go watch from up on poppy hill or the wind rises instead, lol. at least those have a discernible message, an actual plot, and won’t make you rip your hair out in frustration. chickens out forcing the protagonist to tag along with her out of pity.

The late eighties/early nineties realistic depictions of Japan are amazing. If you liked the style of Only Yesterday, trade the countryside for Tokyo and you have a sense of what this film is.Everyone\'s main complaint is obvious. There is NO romance in what is supposed to be a romantic drama. Honestly if I had gone into this movie with just that expectation, I would have been horribly disappointed. It makes narratively no sense with what is happening. Would have been a 4/10 at best.However. I had heard someone say this was Ghibli\'s unofficial ""gay...movie"". Didn\'t really know what to make of that until I actually sat down with that predisposition and watched the movie. If you watch (or hopefully rewatch if you did not like the movie/gave it a low score because of the previously mentioned complaint) please consider the following.*Spoilers*If Taku\'s character is only interested Rikako for the entire film, it does indeed make no narrative sense and the ending is jarring beyond repair. My opinion is that Taku is so infatuated with Yutaka during the high school portion of the narrative, that he completely ignores Rikako trying to get his interest or reciprocation. Taku\'s emotions are mute around Rikako but are lively around Yutaka. If there\'s one scene that sold me on this, it\'s when Taku tells Yutaka that he doesn\'t care about the rumors spreading about him and Rikako around the school. Immediately afterwards he finds out that Rikako rejected and insulted Yutaka, which resulted in him failing several exams. The second Taku hears this he goes and confronts Rikako and the two exchange slaps. During this scene he uses the rumors going around as justification for his anger. A minute ago, he had said he didn\'t care. If Taku is actually in love with Yutaka, everything in the scene (and the rest of the film for that matter) makes sense. He cannot exactly tell Rikako he is angry because she insulted Yutaka and hurt his chances at his preferred university without making it obvious that he has feelings for him.The conclusion. I finished this movie with the takeaway that Taku is bisexual and is so focused on Yutaka that he does not reciprocate any of Rikako\'s attention. After years gone by, he begins to realize what all her actions signified. He also seems to come to peace with the fact that Yutaka will not return any of his feelings. The movie ends with him starting a relationship with Rikako as he has likely come to value and idolize the time they shared in high school. This interpretation jumped the whole movie to an 8/10 for me. To be honest, I related to Taku\'s character more than nearly any other I can think off the top of my head in the last few years of anime watching.Or maybe I am just crazy, and this movie actually sucks. It might fail completely as a romantic drama and Taku is just a loser and an idiot. I\'ll let you be the judge. movie"".

I\'ll let you be the judge.', ""İt was the most ridicilous movie ive ever watchedLet me explain myself:İt is a love movie without love.There was no love between Taku and Rikako that even Yutaka is closer than Rikako to be a partner to TakuThey were not couple,they were not even friends.Taku just put up with her for his friends's sake.Taku and Rikako shouted out each other and had fight they didn't even sit and chat properly throughout the movie.Sooo You cant just tell me that he actually fell in love with her inside his heart but didnt realise it until the end.İt is so foolish. "", ""Rikako is a petty arrogant child who treats both Taku with very little consideration, yet the viewers are supposed to believe there's a love going on and the moments they spend together were happy, despite Rikako's gaslighting, insults, manipulation and obvious contempt. It bothers me how our two protagonists hate each other, but the movie tries to trick you into believing the opposite, but to no avail.89% on Rotten Tomatoes and 73 critic score on metacritic. WHY?!Any romantic anime recommendations are appreciated. I need something to wash away the bad taste Umi ga Kikoeru left in my mouth. ""]"

I was not disappointed. It was nice to see our 22/7 girls again and the three new members also gave me a very positive feeling. Without any (ridiculous) messages from the ""wall"", it is even more enjoyable in my opinion. I really suggest everyone who has already watched 22/7, to watch this little OVA. You will enjoy it for sure!In summary I can only say:The OVA is definitely too short.Let\'s hope for a second season!', '22/7: 8＋3 =?Obviously the answer is 11 right?

This time there are finally eleven of our idols (2+2+7)!As a big fan of the main series 22/7, I was more than happy to finally see this OVA.

Meeting new friends and having fun together. A small Christmas party can of course not be missed and the new three members are invited to take part as well. There is skepticism at the beginning for sure: How will the three new members do? Will it change the wonderful harmony of the other eight? But after the initial skepticism, it can be realized that the three belong perfectly. They harmonize perfectly.A new 22/7 has been born!CHARACTERS:The main focus is on the three new members: Mikami, Yuuki and Tsubomi. They are the ""hidden gems"" (did not debut with the other eight members). All three are highly motivated to become idols and did their best to get accepted in 22/7. They were already good friends before joining 22/7. Their dream came true.Mikami is a soft, ""my pace"", yet a polite and elegant girl.

There is surely no boring time with her around.Tsubomi is carefree, fun-loving and always up for anything. She loves taking pictures, eat everything and can sleep anywhere. Always a happy girl.Unfortunately, the OVA is a little too short to know more about them. There are so many things unknown about three idols but hopefully one day we will learn more about them!ART:The art style is the same as the main part.

The three new members made it perfectly and with the stage performance it was just astonishing!Idol music in general should spread a good mood and joy among its fans, 22/7 songs certainly succeeded in that way.ENJOYMENT:As mentioned at the beginning, I was really longing for this OVA. I was not disappointed. It was nice to see our 22/7 girls again and the three new members also gave me a very positive feeling. Without any (ridiculous) messages from the ""wall"", it is even more enjoyable in my opinion. I really suggest everyone who has already watched 22/7, to watch this little OVA. You will enjoy it for sure!In summary I can only say:The OVA is definitely too short.Let\'s hope for a second season!', '22/7: 8＋3 =?Obviously the answer is 11 right?

This time there are finally eleven of our idols (2+2+7)!As a big fan of the main series 22/7, I was more than happy to finally see this OVA.

The three missing members of 22/7 are finally introduced now, they have the...will to become great idols as well.Since after their last appearance on the stage was just before Christmas, it is like a little Christmas present for our 8 girls. Meeting new friends and having fun together. A small Christmas party can of course not be missed and the new three members are invited to take part as well. There is skepticism at the beginning for sure: How will the three new members do? Will it change the wonderful harmony of the other eight? But after the initial skepticism, it can be realized that the three belong perfectly. They harmonize perfectly.A new 22/7 has been born!CHARACTERS:The main focus is on the three new members: Mikami, Yuuki and Tsubomi. They are the ""hidden gems"" (did not debut with the other eight members). All three are highly motivated to become idols and did their best to get accepted in 22/7. They were already good friends before joining 22/7. Their dream came true.Mikami is a soft, ""my pace"", yet a polite and elegant girl. She masters the Japanese dance since she came for a dancing family.Yuuki our energetic and sporty girl who loves playing football. Just being around her means so much fun already. There is surely no boring time with her around.Tsubomi is carefree, fun-loving and always up for anything. She loves taking pictures, eat everything and can sleep anywhere. Always a happy girl.Unfortunately, the OVA is a little too short to know more about them. There are so many things unknown about three idols but hopefully one day we will learn more about them!ART:The art style is the same as the main part.

She masters the Japanese dance since she came for a dancing family.Yuuki our energetic and sporty girl who loves playing football. Just being around her means so much fun already. There is surely no boring time with her around.Tsubomi is carefree, fun-loving and always up for anything. She loves taking pictures, eat everything and can sleep anywhere. Always a happy girl.Unfortunately, the OVA is a little too short to know more about them. There are so many things unknown about three idols but hopefully one day we will learn more about them!ART:The art style is the same as the main part. The girls are portrayed sweetly and cute, as it is often the case in idol anime. Watching their great perfomance is just beautiful.SOUND:Listening to the OP ""Muzui"" after such a long time is just great. The lyrics are very deep and it makes you thinking about it.Wow, wow wow.

The three new members made it perfectly and with the stage performance it was just astonishing!Idol music in general should spread a good mood and joy among its fans, 22/7 songs certainly succeeded in that way.ENJOYMENT:As mentioned at the beginning, I was really longing for this OVA. I was not disappointed. It was nice to see our 22/7 girls again and the three new members also gave me a very positive feeling. Without any (ridiculous) messages from the ""wall"", it is even more enjoyable in my opinion. I really suggest everyone who has already watched 22/7, to watch this little OVA.

This time there are finally eleven of our idols (2+2+7)!As a big fan of the main series 22/7, I was more than happy to finally see this OVA.

Meeting new friends and having fun together. A small Christmas party can of course not be missed and the new three members are invited to take part as well.

They were already good friends before joining 22/7. Their dream came true.Mikami is a soft, ""my pace"", yet a polite and elegant girl.

And...I've gotta say, the latter season is just as funny as the former early this year, if not a tad bit better, with more characters, some insane moments that still warrant some laughs here and there, and definitely went out with a bang (because at the time of this review, the series had already caught on and further compared to the manga source).Assuming that you have watched Season 1 (which you should), Tiramisu Zwei continues on the pursuit that is between...the rivaries of brothers Tiramisu's Subaru Ichinose and the People of Metus's Isuzu, along with the estrange of their father, whom for some reason, has come to witness the fight against brothers (while opening unnecessary porn and censored  ads in disguise for battle plans). Not to mention that now that Subaru's Durandal got a major upgrade that is Neo Durandal which is faster and better in every way, and Isuzu with the make of Subaru Beyond as means to defeat his brother, expect even more wacky stuff to take place for absolutely no reason whatsoever. And I still love it.Major characters make their comeback, so new ones are just probably Subaru and Isuzu's dad and the commander of Metus, Cadillac, which aims to rebel against convention and go for the same reason that Isuzu hated Earth to begin with: to escape legalism. Not the best minded characters, but for it being a mindless parody, what's not to like about them?Similar to Season 1, the same production staff under Gonzo for Tiramisu comes back again to make art and animation that is still consistent but minimalistic that is well-known with the series, and it's totally understandable for it being a short time of binge-watch, since it doesn't have to sacrifice a lot in accomplishing whatever means they have to do. The music department is the same story, just with another new great sounding OP and the new version of Season 1's ED (which includes commentary).For a parody of its aforementioned genres, Gonzo does a good job despite the low score and waning interest after the disinterest that was Season 1. Season 2 brings new life into the series, and much from it, still gives a good impression for what it is.

And I still love it.Major characters make their comeback, so new ones are just probably Subaru and Isuzu's dad and the commander of Metus, Cadillac, which aims to rebel against convention and go for the same reason that Isuzu hated Earth to begin with: to escape legalism. Not the best minded characters, but for it being a mindless parody, what's not to like about them?Similar to Season 1, the same production staff under Gonzo for Tiramisu comes back again to make art and animation that is still consistent but minimalistic that is well-known with the series, and it's totally understandable for it being a short time of binge-watch, since it doesn't have to sacrifice a lot in accomplishing whatever means they have to do. The music department is the same story, just with another new great sounding OP and the new version of Season 1's ED (which includes commentary).For a parody of its aforementioned genres, Gonzo does a good job despite the low score and waning interest after the disinterest that was Season 1. Season 2 brings new life into the series, and much from it, still gives a good impression for what it is.

It trades in some of its more completely absurdist elements for humour and bathos related more directly to its sci-fi setting and meta. While the first season does not really involve itself with a ""plot"", just keeping the basic trappings over essentially every Gundam plotline in existence; the second season begins to lampoon the climax of these now predictable plots tropes. This is a marked improvement in my book since it now gets more of its laughs from parody instead of just outright absurdity.Admittedly, some of the plain stupid elements do also grow...on you. For one, the  fact that all the characters are named after car brands continues to get funnier to more you notice it. It does not have anything to do with its setting but its consistency and arbitrary nature do make it funny. Overall, not much has changed from the review I gave for its first season.
