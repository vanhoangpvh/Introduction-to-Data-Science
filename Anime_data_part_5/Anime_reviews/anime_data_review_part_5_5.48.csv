Puso Ni Comi: Okawari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41634/Puso_Ni_Comi__Okawari,"[""Since no one has written a review yet, I'll have the pleasure to be the first and I'll keep it quite short.I had a lot o fun watching this and it has been a while in terms of anime, specially as I grow older and get tired of certain things.The main reason being that I played PSO2, like, A LOT and the development of the story brings you to the aspects of the game in a very fun and enjoyable way. I also loved the art and the OP even though they were nothing from the new world (pun intended). This anime, for the...most part, depicts the experience of playing the real PSO2 but with a bunch of anime cliches. Nevertheless, even if you didn't play any PSO2 in your life (or any game of the PSO saga for the most part) you can still watch this and enjoy it to some extent (I guess?). Since the episodes are short and they treat separate aspects of playing the game IRL the story development is practically non-existent. There's, however, some small character developments here and there so the plot is not 100% empty. The point being that there is a sense of cohesion from the first to the last episode, even though you could probably watch them separately and wouldn't notice much difference.In short, I might be pretty biased towards liking things related to PSO, since the Blue Burst saga is my favorite game ever. Notwithstanding that, I believe that this was totally worth the watch and an enjoyable experience. I think that this could be the case for other PSO players that like anime and are looking for some short, non-deep-brain-breaking, fun stuff. most part, depicts the experience of playing the real PSO2 but with a bunch of anime cliches.

Project A-Ko 4: Final,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1298/Project_A-Ko_4__Final,"['This is an improvement over the previous OVA for two reasons.1) There is at least some crazy superhuman kung-fu and cartoon violence.2) Kei, introduced in the previous OVA, goes from being a cookie-cutter bishonen love interest into a strangely passive lust-mannequin who loves him some porn. This makes for actual comedy when all the girls fight over him like a piece of meat.Beyond that, it needs less of C-Ko whining and more of Mari doing hundred crack girlslap. ', 'Listen, I can\'t give this lower than a three stars on account of it being Project A-ko, but this is a big step down from the first three because of its responsibility to ""conclude"" the series (there are two more after this but they appear to be spinoff-sequels), and its inability to actually do so.Yeah, the thing is hilarious, and the animation got an upgrade for sure. As usual, a bunch of disparate plot threads converge into one wacky, nonsense-filled action extravaganza in the finale, but this time, the connecting points are very weak and at least one subplot ends up being a dead end...with no resolution. Plus, the lessons learned from the previous movie (""Gay is the Way"") are not only forgotten, but retroactively erased, as the male love interest from the last movie is brought back with A-ko and B-ko still fighting for his affections despite everything... And then C-ko\'s growing discontentment being a literal rehash.But hey, we didn\'t exactly come this far into Project A-ko because the plot was good, right? It once again gets gay as A-ko and B-ko realize they\'ve forgotten their true reason for fighting, which is over our ditzy space princess, and it kind of works better as a metanarrative this time because of the way C-ko has been increasingly sidelined since her starring role in the first one. It\'s just... BIZARRE that they\'d redo half of the plot of the original, even if this time involves a mecha A-ko robot fighting against a fleet that interrupted a hasty wedding ceremony being held at a high school gymnasium.Very little in anime will ever top the Assembly of the Public Worker Defense Force gag, but I really wish this one had a little bit more time to bake before it came out. with no resolution.

It’s got plot threads that go nowhere, multiple fake-out endings and twists, and the girls continue to obsess over a guy who couldn’t care less.Even compared to the other three, whose stories are unrealistic to say the least, the way the plot develops in this OVA is pretty out there. I got the impression that the writers came up with 3 or 4 different storylines and tried to brainstorm a way to tie them all together before the episode ended. I say “tried” because they...weren’t successful; some of the plot threads just abruptly end — they attempted to turn them into gags but the punchlines fall flat. And the ending (the final one we get after the fake-outs) doesn’t make much sense.Similar to the previous OVA, in “4” the main characters tend to act out of character at times, usually with the purpose of delivering a joke that just doesn’t work. There are a few new minor characters introduced in this episode, and they don’t get much screen time and aren’t developed well. Also, although this is the last entry in the main series, the main characters have received little to no development (but I guess that’s normal for a show like this). We do get a little bit of development for the teacher, Miss Ayumi, though.The animation and art are on par with the rest of the episodes, as is the voice acting, so nothing to note there. The ending theme, “Sayonara no Signal,” is a rearranged version of the melody of the movie’s ending, “Follow Your Dream,” with completely different lyrics in Japanese. The background music is decent.Regarding objectionable content, this OVA has a few scenes with nudity, particularly one with a sex act being performed. There are some upskirt shots, which is normal for this series, and there is at least one crude joke in the dialogue. The violence is cartoonish. There are also some flashing lights here and there, so you may want to be careful when watching this if you are photosensitive.Overall, if you have watched “Project A-Ko” 1 through 3, you might as well watch “Project A-Ko 4” to finish the series, even though the conclusion is lacking in many aspects and won’t give you any closure. I wouldn’t recommend watching this OVA otherwise. weren’t successful; some of the plot threads just abruptly end — they attempted to turn them into gags but the punchlines fall flat.

Rail Wars!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23309/Rail_Wars,"[""(At Studio Passione, a meeting between the director and the animators)Director: Okay. Thank you for coming on such short notice. I just wanted to discuss some minor changes that I thought would be appropriate.[Animator A and B both nodded their heads and said, “Okay.”]Director [smiling]: Great! Okay. Animator A, you are charge of animating most scenes involving Haruka Koumi, right?Animator A [nodding]: That is correct....Director: Okay. That’s good. [Glancing at his clipboard.] I noticed that her breast sizes were a size ‘D’. I don’t like it, could you increase it to a size ‘F’?Animator A [looking shocked]: What? Why? isn’t that a bit too big?Director: Hm. What do you mean? There’s no such thing as ‘too big’.  Only ‘too small’. And, also, add more jiggle physics.Animator A [still stocked]: What? Are you kidding me? But, this character already has a lot of jiggle scenes.Director: I understand. I’m not asking you to add more jiggle scenes, I’m asking you to add more bounce, more jiggle physics, because she’s clumsy and tends to be naked most of the time. I want the animation design to be fluid, polished and smooth. If the viewer will not remember her sweet, kind and gentle personality, then they will remember her nice flowing and bouncing breasts. I want the viewers to be awe by her large bosoms, especially when she's running!Animator A [sighing]: Fine. But, this is going to take a lot of work.Director: That’s fine by me. As, for Animator B, you know what to do?Animator B [nodding]: Of course. Increase the breast size for Aoi Sakurai from size ‘C’ to ‘E’.  And add more jiggle physics, because every viewer is watching for beautiful flowing breasts.Director: Exactly! Now, get to work.–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(A meeting with the director and the script writers)Director: Okay, folks. We don’t have much time. We are losing viewers at the moment and I’ve got an idea to get more viewers, and to make the story more interesting.Writer A: So, what is it?Director: This story has no need for a deep, complex plot. That will turn off the viewer. [He sighs.] It needs to be predicable, it needs to have lots of typical cliches and fanservice, and it needs to have fillers. That's what this anime needs and there are four things that we must do: 1) add a idol episode, 2) make the girls wear lots of swimsuits and bath towels, 3) have the clothes of the girls torn, ripped or wet, and 4) have one nipple scene. With this set-up, everyone will tune in and watch this series.Writer A [hesitating]: But, isn’t this series about trains, kick-ass action, and conspiracies?Director [shrugging]: Well, yeah. To some extent. But, recently idols have been all the rage, and remember you can never go wrong with 'the plot'.Writer A: I guess, however, won’t the viewer be expecting lots of trains and action?Director [sighing]: If I had to put the story in percentages, then 50% is about 'that plot’ and ass, 30% is kick-ass action, 15% is about romantic subplots, and 5% is talking and looking at trains. Look, you must remember, this anime isn't serious or 'deep' and complex, it's just a bunch railway security force members stopping bad guys from doing bad things, with lots of 'plot' action and ass shots.Writer A: Won’t the viewers be disappointed about this?Director: Not really. Because, they’ll be 'watching it for the plot’. It's always the 'plot'!Writer A [sighing]: Okay. If you say so.Director: Oh, I know so.The End Director: Okay. That’s good.

This show has thus-far been the most uninspired, lazy, and forgettable pulp I’ve ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Not a single OUNCE of effort was put into this butchering of a somewhat promising and unique concept, and while the show thinks it can distract the audience from its laughable “plot” (if you can even call it that) and its worthless, pathetic, cardboard-cutout characters with absurdly excessive fanservice, they aren’t fooling me. It\'s unbelievably stupid, it\'s misogynistic, it\'s cliche, it\'s rushed, it\'s... Y\'know what? Let’s just go ahead and delve...into what is likely hands-down the worst anime of the season, Rail Wars.Synopsis: Four teenagers begin working for a railway station. Hijinks ensue.…That is literally it.The synopsis of Rail Wars on MAL is extremely misleading mostly because it implies that this show has a plot: It doesn’t. There is NO exposition. I’m not exaggerating; there is none what so ever at any point. This show is literally a montage of random, unrelated incidents that the protagonists have to fix and/or get themselves out of. There is no coherency or consistency to be found (unless you count constant fanservice as “consistency""). This is a show that tries to pass itself off as “mindless entertainment”. There’s one problem though: It’s not entertaining! The writers have no idea how to give the random scenarios they come up with any suspense at all! There are no action scenes what so ever (excluding 10 seconds in episode 1), there is no reason to care about the generic characters, and there is simply no energy or excitement to be found. You can literally feel how rushed and passionless the development of the anime really was. In fact, they make an effort to AVOID fast paced and exciting scenes! In episode 3, this show has the audacity to make us sit through some of the most boring and pointless dialogue I’ve ever seen as it builds up to what was shaping up to be a good fight scene (albeit the buildup is painfully slow). Just as the fight was about to start, the shot becomes a still frame and we cut to after the fight is already over. If that doesn’t prove that the animators don’t give a shit, then I don’t know what will; what an absolute slap in the face.Perhaps the biggest joke of all is that some of these episodic scenarios aren’t even related to trains! I mean… really?! This show was advertised as some sort of action-shounen based around railways, which could have been cool, but all we got was random fanservice and nothing to hold it together. In fact, there is literally no reason for this story to be related to trains at all; whether it’s diffusing a bomb or stopping a dangerous intruder at a music concert, literally any other setting would have worked just as bloody well. The “writers” (if this garbage can legally be considered writing) just jotted down as many generic scenarios as they could think of and made each episode consist of a one of those scenarios. I could have written this show at the age of 8. It really is that stupid, random, and simplistic. Not ONE thing about the show’s “plot” was done even remotely right. It is a complete, unbridled disaster.The characters are just the icing on the cake to this amazingly repugnant arrangement. The only thing I can say about them is that they fucking exist (unlike the plot). The MC doesn’t have a spec, and I mean not a SPEC of originality to him. The driving force of the ""plot"" is that he wants to be a train conductor. Too bad I don\'t know a goddamn thing about him and therefore I don\'t care what the hell happens to him. The MC’s harem is just as generic as he is; there’s one red headed chick who sort of has a personality, but it’s completely stereotypical. I guess having a generic personality is better than not having one at all, which is the case with the rest of the cast. Rail Wars left me scrambling so hard to find positive aspects that a 2-dimesional character is considered a highlight of the show. I think that says it all right there.In conclusion, Rail Wars is a disgrace. They took a unique concept with potential and loaded it with clichés through the addition of highschoolers and a big-breasted harem. Throw in the absurd writing and piss-poor choice of direction and you have yourself, dare I say, a trainwreck!*Pause for laughter at obvious joke that I didn’t have the willpower to resist making…This is just a humiliation to the anime industry and to fiction in general. Everyone responsible for this monstrosity should be ashamed of themselves, because I’m certainly ashamed. I cannot fathom a single, solitary reason for ANYONE to EVER watch this show. It’s not good for action, it’s not good for comedy, it’s not good for mindless entertainment, it’s not good for ANYTHING. Other than fanservice, this show has nothing to offer (and you could pick thousands of other superior anime if you really want fanservice). The music is decent I suppose, and that is the only thing that separates Rail Wars from a 1/10. Needless to say, I not only wouldn’t recommend this garbage to anyone, but I also wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. It is honestly the most worthless and contemptible anime I’ve ever seen. into what is likely hands-down the worst anime of the season, Rail Wars.Synopsis: Four teenagers begin working for a railway station.

Did I enjoy this anime? hell yes it was 20minutes a week where I could turn my brain off and relax a typical harem anime no major drama or plot. Fans of other harem anime will most likely enjoy this show as well if you don't like harem don't watch it. of a story with each episode mostly consisting of  light hearted comedic moments some fan service and then an action scene before wrapping everything up in 20minutes and maybe throwing in some facts about trains every now and then.The sound was mostly forgettable but not awful the OP and ED being the only two stand out tracks in my opinion Art seemed mostly average no problems .Ok so overall is this anime ground breaking? no of course not its generic as hell with generic characters and average art and sound.

The series is about a bland protagonist who works as an employee of the government run railway system. He and his harem of bouncing G cup babes must fight against the evil forces of capitalist extremists that wish to privatize the Japanese Railroads using terrorist tactics. This show is like a soft core porn that was written and directed by Vladimir Lenin while he was high on mushrooms!Plot and characters: 2/10Rail Wars takes place in an alternate world where the only major difference seems to be that the Japanese railroads are still owned by...the government. The entire theme of Rail Wars besides Echii nonsense of course, is the question of government vs. private ownership and when it is better for one vs. the other to control a certain sector like transportation or healthcare. This is a highly relevant and interesting topic that needs to be discussed. Unfortunately, Rail Wars does a REALLY poor job of tackling this complex subject matter. Rail Wars enters the territory of sublime idiocy from the word go! The first episode shows a ridiculous training sequence with our young cadets performing tasks that are completely irrelevant to being a modern railroad worker like firing guns, jujitsu, and shoveling coal. This isn\'t 1859! Shoveling coal and fighting off train robbers shouldn\'t be the big parts of the training! The characters are little developed beyond following tired anime cliches. The 4 main characters are as follows: You have the Tsundere who hates men, the wooden and shallow harem male, the ditzy girl with huge boobs, and the best friend who exists to support the main character. The pacing of the plot is also terrible! As a personal note, I actually know a little about government run railways through experience and how awesome they are. I\'ve spent 3 weeks vacation in Moscow and St. Petersberg and 4 weeks vacation in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Hong Kong. These government run trains and subways are cheap, efficient, and overall excellent! In the US, trains between cities are pretty much non-existent as of in 2014 and only about 5 of our cities have mass transport of any kind. This includes: Boston, New York, DC, Chicago, San Francisco, and that\'s really about it. Forgive me if I missed one. If you don\'t have a car, you can\'t comfortably live in most of the US. This is a real bitch because gas isn\'t cheap and neither is properly maintaining a car. Now, does this topic really need an anime devoted to it? NO! Especially not one as as awful as Rail Wars!Art: 5/10The CG is not really that impressive, but the tits are fairly nice at least.Soundtrack: 2/10The soundtrack is forgettable and doesn\'t really make me emotionally engaged. I don\'t feel pumped up, sad, or gleeful. It is just background noise. If there is one thing an essentially communist anime series should have, it is fucking kickass music! If this series had hired the Red Army Choir to sing socialist classics like ""Cossacks"" Polyushka Polye"", and ""Smuglianka"" it would have made this pile of shit anime worth while for that reason alone. That is how awesome far left music should be!Overall: 2/10Although it has decent art and animation due to somehow landing a large budget, this series fails in every other category. It is a shameless echii series that attempts to deliver a socialist message with horrible writing and terrible execution. I\'m fairly left leaning, and I HATED HATED HATED this anime! I can\'t imagine how much I would hate it if I was a conservative! My head would probably have exploded and I would be unable to write this review. the government.

I\'ve spent 3 weeks vacation in Moscow and St. Petersberg and 4 weeks vacation in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Hong Kong. These government run trains and subways are cheap, efficient, and overall excellent! In the US, trains between cities are pretty much non-existent as of in 2014 and only about 5 of our cities have mass transport of any kind. This includes: Boston, New York, DC, Chicago, San Francisco, and that\'s really about it. Forgive me if I missed one. If you don\'t have a car, you can\'t comfortably live in most of the US. This is a real bitch because gas isn\'t cheap and neither is properly maintaining a car. Now, does this topic really need an anime devoted to it? NO! Especially not one as as awful as Rail Wars!Art: 5/10The CG is not really that impressive, but the tits are fairly nice at least.Soundtrack: 2/10The soundtrack is forgettable and doesn\'t really make me emotionally engaged. I don\'t feel pumped up, sad, or gleeful. It is just background noise. If there is one thing an essentially communist anime series should have, it is fucking kickass music! If this series had hired the Red Army Choir to sing socialist classics like ""Cossacks"" Polyushka Polye"", and ""Smuglianka"" it would have made this pile of shit anime worth while for that reason alone. That is how awesome far left music should be!Overall: 2/10Although it has decent art and animation due to somehow landing a large budget, this series fails in every other category. It is a shameless echii series that attempts to deliver a socialist message with horrible writing and terrible execution. I\'m fairly left leaning, and I HATED HATED HATED this anime! I can\'t imagine how much I would hate it if I was a conservative! My head would probably have exploded and I would be unable to write this review.', 'Rail Wars! is a confusing show. It is an ecchi harem  with the primary gimmick being that it supplies the viewer with plenty of train facts.There is no progression to this story. Although it is a harem, there are only two moments in the series that could be considered ""plot development between characters"" in which two different girls\' announce to the screen that they have feelings for Naoto, our main character. However, while both of these girls may have revealed their feelings (to no one in the story), the only effect this has on the story is the addition of blushing throughout the...otherwise ordinary moments this show is chock full of.The only notable plot progression throughout the series is the very arbitrary promotion of Naoto from ""kid who works for train station"" to ""kid who leads other kids who work for train station"" which has no actual importance on the series as he is bossed around enough by his incredibly tsundere teammate that his title is meaningless. Aside from this tidbit of progress, nothing resembling a plot will occur for the rest of the series. You may be thinking, ""well, that\'s okay. I\'m just in it for the fan service anyway"" and this is where I will have to stop you. Unless you, along with the writers of this show, are deeply infatuated with girls removing their pantyhose in a two-shot still frame every few episodes, you will be very hard pressed to find yourself satisfied in any way.Much to my surprise, Rail Wars falls extremely short in the fan service department. Given that this is an ecchi harem show with no plot whatsoever, no character development, no relationships, and terrible animation you would think that we would at least get some Grade A boobies in our faces every few minutes, and although literally every female character with any significance has an obnoxiously large chest, we are left with pantyhose removal every few episodes and the occasional heavily-veiled changing room scene. If sexual tension is all you need, don\'t continue watching after episode two, where we get our one and only moment of actual tension which last about a minute and produces microscopic amounts of embarassment between the two characters involved. (Of course this is assuming that girls taking off their pantyhose doesn\'t completely captivate you, because the writers REALLY just eat that stuff up. When that still-frame passed and Sakurai\'s legs turned from darkish tan to light peach I knew my world had changed forever)If you\'re still thinking ""I\'m just in it for the trains!"" you are still not safe from the disappointment. Two or three times per episode, as a different 3D model of a train scrolls across your screen, Naoto will read to you the first ten sentences that wikipedia has to offer about that specific model of train. This interaction will then abruptly end and the show will continue normally, although occasionally a female character will comment on Naoto\'s obsession with trains which will result in the cheerful laughter of his teammates while the camera pans away to a fade, and we can escape from the tedium of Rail Wars! for just a moment.Probably the only interesting aspect of Rail Wars! is the immense responsibility that these junior train cadets in training have, as they are equipped with pistols put in charge of defending the lives of thousands from a multitude of train-hating terrorists. While this may sound entertaining, I assure you that any conflict or action will take place in the final minute of the episode and be portrayed through a still-frame of a bad guy getting kicked by Sakurai. The ability of the junior train cadets to absorb minutes worth of tasering to the neck - completely unscathed - is notably comical yet also ruins any hope for the plot to actually start moving.There is very little left to say about Rail Wars! If you are looking for 4 hours of large-breasted characters doing mundane things, poorly animated CG trains, 2 minutes of unfulfilling ecchi, half a dozen still-frames of action, and a small pamphlet\'s worth of information on trains, then Rail Wars! is the show for you. Otherwise, you should consider looking elsewhere. otherwise ordinary moments this show is chock full of.The only notable plot progression throughout the series is the very arbitrary promotion of Naoto from ""kid who works for train station"" to ""kid who leads other kids who work for train station"" which has no actual importance on the series as he is bossed around enough by his incredibly tsundere teammate that his title is meaningless.

Otherwise, you should consider looking elsewhere.', ""In reality, trains are actually fascinating inventions with great enterprise and a means of transportation. But put that into anime form under the title ‘Rail Wars’ and you’ll get a pseudo-harem anime where you wonder what this show is really about. Is it really about trains? Sort of. Are the characters completely devoid of interest? Somewhat. Is this show memorable for what ultimately tried to achieve? Hell no.Based on the light novel of the same name, Rail Wars apparently takes place in some alternate version of Japan. The only difference is that the setting involves a railway system that has yet to be privatized....Then, enter main protagonist Naoto Takayama, a big fan of trains who originally wanted to be a driver. Now the kid is part of the Fourth Guard Squad. What he doesn’t know is that he is also gaining a harem. I think at one point, one of the characters mentions “You're a lucky guy for being surrounded by cute girls, Takayama.”The series’ story is almost laughable and for all the wrongs reasons. In fact, there is barely any plot to speak of and with what little it has often seems to make fun of itself. However, the series takes itself somewhat seriously rather than acting as a parody. The most evident problem involves the one dimensional plot with little agenda by pandering on the harem-esque trope. The main protagonist Naoto is the main butt monkey as he is labeled a pervert by the female protagonists. Panty shots are prevalent throughout the show and almost present in every episode. It seems that the goal of the series is try to get Naoto to succumb to his inner desires. However, being the persistent young healthy boy that he is, Naoto resists his lusts most of the time. Then again, the show tries to highlight the female characters to a point where it becomes preposterous.Regarding most of the other characters, none of them really stand out. Forget characterization, the main focus on them seems to be their sex appeal and non-sensational personalities. The list includes the tsundere (Aoi), the beauty (Haruka), the mischief (Nana), the idol (Noa), the childhood friend (Mari) and the muscle head (Sho). Get the picture now? It’s sad to say but Naoto is perhaps the most normal protagonist. At the very core, he is a kind young man with a decent knowledge train models and types. He is neither a Gary Stu nor sidekick but plays the role of a leader on the team. One should realize that his motivations are often for the safety of the public as he puts others before himself. And from this, girls seems to fall head over heel for him where almost every main girl with a name isn’t safe. Other characters also play their roles with knowledge about the trains and machinations. Yet, the show does a sloppy job at exposition. The writing is lifeless despite the mechanics explained. No clever background stories. Instead, you get awfully timed scenarios including cliffhangers and predictable outcomes. Some episodes also makes little sense with saturated misunderstandings that will make you face palm.Some people might also see this as an action flick. Perhaps the first episode highlights this bit with Aoi’s debut and her impressions. There’s some properly timed action scenes with firearms and fighting techniques. But really, that’s about it. If Michael Bay was to direct this series, maybe the show could be a bit appealing with jaw-breaking action scenes. However, the show only occasionally adapts this fashion as most of it is covered by its cliché-riddled ideas. The comedy also makes diehard attempt to make the audience laugh but fails with the usual shenanigans. As the show likes to take risks with trivia and facts, there are occasionally moments that can evoke interest. Some episodes have a thrillerish feeling such as stopping a terrorist bomb. However, the series tries far too hard when this ploy becomes the focus.  Dialogues are also cheesy with less emphasis on the premise but more potential relationship developments. Unfortunately, Naoto is dense as a rock despite the obvious hints that the various girls drops throughout the show. Whether it’s genuine or not, Naoto’s love life is like a train-wreck as he isn’t committed about getting a girlfriend. Perhaps he is in love with trains…Visuals wise, the show only has a few moments when you’ll have eyes glued to the screen. Unfortunately, those glorious moments are short lived by its poor timing. I’m not talking about the action scenarios but the overall execution tied in with the story. Similarly, characters sends a poor message with their professional attires. The girls wear short skirts while the guys lack appeal. Naoto’s face is what I would describe as the Average Joe; the plain guy. Also, expect tons of fan service whether it’s the inevitable beach episode or the lascivious camera angles. Perhaps the only other thing I can give praise to the artwork would be the technology as the backgrounds are solid. The trains doesn’t look very impressive but is faithful to the designs.Soundtrack isn’t impressive but at the same time doesn’t kill the show completely. Character voice mannerism are dense with Naoto’s dull personality making little impact for interest. However, the girls does have a diversity of voice mannerisms. The most evident is Aoi and Haruka as they compete for their love. As result of this, expect nothing more than annoying chit chat. On the more technical side, background music and OST is sufficient enough to be acceptable. The biggest reward for perhaps every episode is the ED song for its delivery. It’s sad to say but the ED song alone dwarfs the story of this show with its recreational imagery. The OP song also has some catchy beats to accompany the premise.By the time you finish reading this review, you’re probably thinking about refraining yourself to watch this show. And to be honest, that should be the right decision to take. This little harem-esque adventure is saturated with fan service, characterless framework, and a plot that jumps all over the place. There are times when one might wonder if the show is about trains at all. Sure, there are some info dumps and mechanics but this may all be quickly forgotten by the message the show is really trying to send. Instead of learning about trains, you’ll be distracted in the same way Naoto is with his lady friends. In retrospect, Rail Wars destroys itself by derailing the premise and leads it to become….a train wreck.

In retrospect, Rail Wars destroys itself by derailing the premise and leads it to become….a train wreck."", ""Rail Wars has much to offer anyone who is interested in the Japanese way of life surrounding Public Transportation Systems and as an added result can provide some history about the industrialization of the country. It is an average anime that is surprisingly entertaining with some flaws of course.  Nevertheless here's my review, continue to read and see if this show is for you.Story: 6/10From what is clear by the synopsis, one can probably tell they're not going to get an epic or an incredibly heart throbbing romance out of this show. You do however get a satisfying slice-of-life feel from it as...each episode takes you along a specific story arc, with an occasional arc spanning a couple of episodes. This being said a couple of cliffhangers may stand in your way, but not in the dramatic sort of sense. That being said there is no grand conclusion, it's a casual story for people who are looking for an anime to get them past a depressing Key based anime that left a gap in their soul. If this has happened, you know what I'm talking about.Art: 7/10As the title would suggest, there is a lot of trains in this show, and with a show that has so much emphasis on trains the animators and artist did a good job on providing extraordinary detail on all mechanical entities within this show.  Along with this is near flawless integration of 2D and 3D animation.  The show was also fond of creating some weird angles for character interaction, this is mainly due to the ecchi elements that are present within the show, which can be more distracting than pleasing.Sound: 8/10There is not too much that an anime can mess up with sound.  As for this one I'm sure there are plenty of trains locally available to get good sound in for this show, and the malfunctions and action that comes with it plays well too.  Some dialogue is not synced with animation.  As for the soundtrack we see very good OP and ED, as well as fitting music to accompany the shows current mood.Characters: 8/10The protagonist of the show is a slightly fanatical foamer that clearly has a lot of knowledge about trains.  Other from this fact his dreams and motives are normal, which are good for a viewer to relate to. For the more fanatical side of our protagonist, we have a group of fairly normal friends to accompany him, that react a way most 'normal' people would with a foamer. The slice-of-life elements of the show also provide good character development for most characters and springs some interesting romance as well. Likewise their are some very predictable characters that one may wish were more developed.Personal Enjoyment: 9/10I like this show! Although I imagine there are many people that would have a hard time trying to keep interested if they're not at all  interested in Public Systems or Criminal Justice. Even if a viewer did hold such interests, it is still possible they would not be satisfied with what was offered. each episode takes you along a specific story arc, with an occasional arc spanning a couple of episodes.

Main heroin, named Takayama Naoto, is a girl, that always wanted to drive trains, so she didn\'t cared about anything else in her life and her education level stayed in kindergarten. Fortunately she passed high school and got admitted to Japan Rail School, where she met new friends:Ojou-sama Titties, Police Titties, Boss Titties, Osananajimi Titties and Captain Titties. There was also Iwaizumi Shou, the only male character from main cast.Unfortunately Naoto was born with powerful titties magnet...instead of brain, which makes a lot of trouble for main cast as at least once per episode some titties flies toward main heroine.Story: 3/10I rated story so low because it\'s too logical, and i only watch anime to make my brain empty. Seriously if you only want some stupid recreation, better go watch Code Geass or other Death Note, the story is definitely too complicated, and behind every corner there are enemies, and they are bad, and you never know when titties starts to fall on Naoto.Art: 6/10Titties are nicely animated, they move up and down and they sometimes fall on heroine, or get grabbed. if only there would be more titties, i would give 10/10Sound: 7/10Sound is good, music isn\'t memoriable, but it goes good with the show.  Every pair of titties has it\'s own sound effect that\'s goes from ""pom"" to ""boing""Characters 3/10Unfortunately titties wasn\'t very distinctive of each other, they looked almost the same, that\'s why rate i so lowEnjoyment 5/10As i said story was too complicated and it was hard to understand everything.Overall 5/10I would like to recommend that anime to people that likes complicated PLOT. Ah, i would forgot, but there are also some trains. instead of brain, which makes a lot of trouble for main cast as at least once per episode some titties flies toward main heroine.Story: 3/10I rated story so low because it\'s too logical, and i only watch anime to make my brain empty.

Ah, i would forgot, but there are also some trains.', 'Ok, so another summer anime has just ended, so no more fucking around and just present my ratings for each of this anime\'s category:Pathetic 1.Story- there isn\'t any, in spite of what its genre states, each of this anime genre applies each one of the characters, also the plot where it\'s an alternate world where Japan\'s railway system isn\'t privatize and was treated by people who would like to privatize it, didn\'t really fan out, rather this anime\'s story plot was pretty random to say the least. Also, the title ""Rail Wars"" was simply too misleading since one would expect that there where two entities...who would be battling to control Japan\'s public railway system, now if I were Takumi Toyoda (the one who wrote this anime/novel/manga) such scenario where two entities who were battling to control or buy Japan\'s National Railways, then such plot would have been great.Mediocre 5.Art- since it was pretty much your usual art which has some resemblance with ""Chu-2.""Good 7.Sound- the rating is for the closing theme that I like.Dreadful 2.Character- ok so there isn\'t any ecchi for them pierros to howl for, but since I\'d said that this anime genre doesn\'t apply to the anime as a whole, rather it applies to each character, so let\'s start with some of the main characters:Naoto Takayama- if we\'re talking about harem in this anime/manga, it would be him and it was pretty obvious as to why, though, he is a heroic guy who is very dedicated doesn\'t do much justice for him, co\'z he still plays this very annoying character who doesn\'t know what to do with his harem. Also it was quite disappointing co\'z everything was placed on him even-though some of the weight could have been shared with Sho. One reason why this category deserve a 2.Aoi Sakurai - if we\'re talking about adventure and ecchi in this anime/manga, it would be her, since she serves as this bitch who can\'t seem to sit still and always wanting some action, also her figure is somewhat of every guys fantasy.Haruka Kōmi - if we\'re talking about romance in this anime/manga it would be her since she does play this girl with brains but now brawn who is in love with Naoto and someone who is willing to be the martyr.Shō Iwaizumi - if we\'re talking about action, you only need him, however I\'m a bit disappointed that his more like a support than being one of the main characters, also, it\'s kind ironic that he wasn\'t given a share of the harem where his character has potential of having one, frankly his character was a waste which is another reason why I gave this category a 2.Nana Iida, Mari Sasshō, Hitomi Gonō and Noa Kashima- well....they are the slice of life.You know, I would never understand this anime/manga/ novel writer Takumi Toyoda as to why he still stick to the notion that teen boppers would do the job of grown ups, in fact I hate the idea that them character are still in high school working a kind of job that an adult would do, perhaps it won\'t matter if this anime has an additional seinen genre, co\'z the character here should be young adults ( probably somewhere between 19 - 22) instead of high-schooler, which is the main reason why I give this category a 2.Fair 6.Enjoyment- Ok, so I admit, this anime did entertained me up to episode 11 and episode 12 is a disappointment.Poor 3.Overall- the poor usuage of the characters where they should be young adults instead of high-schooler, the plotless story that seemingly pretty random would prove to be a poor combination, so I really can\'t blame those majority who have made a review before me that gave this anime a low score. Besides, it really does deserve a low score, also, the anime itself was more like a documentary of Japan\'s Train history than anything else, beside who gives a shit about those trains? In my opinion such informative documentary  should\'ve been saved for the ""Discovery Channel"" or the ""History Channel,"" and not in this anime/ manga.Btw, here is a train joke, How does a train conductor drink beer and fart?Ans: They Chung-aa, Chung-aa afterwards they Proot! Proooooot!!!!!! who would be battling to control Japan\'s public railway system, now if I were Takumi Toyoda (the one who wrote this anime/novel/manga) such scenario where two entities who were battling to control or buy Japan\'s National Railways, then such plot would have been great.Mediocre 5.Art- since it was pretty much your usual art which has some resemblance with ""Chu-2.""Good 7.Sound- the rating is for the closing theme that I like.Dreadful 2.Character- ok so there isn\'t any ecchi for them pierros to howl for, but since I\'d said that this anime genre doesn\'t apply to the anime as a whole, rather it applies to each character, so let\'s start with some of the main characters:Naoto Takayama- if we\'re talking about harem in this anime/manga, it would be him and it was pretty obvious as to why, though, he is a heroic guy who is very dedicated doesn\'t do much justice for him, co\'z he still plays this very annoying character who doesn\'t know what to do with his harem.

One reason why this category deserve a 2.Aoi Sakurai - if we\'re talking about adventure and ecchi in this anime/manga, it would be her, since she serves as this bitch who can\'t seem to sit still and always wanting some action, also her figure is somewhat of every guys fantasy.Haruka Kōmi - if we\'re talking about romance in this anime/manga it would be her since she does play this girl with brains but now brawn who is in love with Naoto and someone who is willing to be the martyr.Shō Iwaizumi - if we\'re talking about action, you only need him, however I\'m a bit disappointed that his more like a support than being one of the main characters, also, it\'s kind ironic that he wasn\'t given a share of the harem where his character has potential of having one, frankly his character was a waste which is another reason why I gave this category a 2.Nana Iida, Mari Sasshō, Hitomi Gonō and Noa Kashima- well....they are the slice of life.You know, I would never understand this anime/manga/ novel writer Takumi Toyoda as to why he still stick to the notion that teen boppers would do the job of grown ups, in fact I hate the idea that them character are still in high school working a kind of job that an adult would do, perhaps it won\'t matter if this anime has an additional seinen genre, co\'z the character here should be young adults ( probably somewhere between 19 - 22) instead of high-schooler, which is the main reason why I give this category a 2.Fair 6.Enjoyment- Ok, so I admit, this anime did entertained me up to episode 11 and episode 12 is a disappointment.Poor 3.Overall- the poor usuage of the characters where they should be young adults instead of high-schooler, the plotless story that seemingly pretty random would prove to be a poor combination, so I really can\'t blame those majority who have made a review before me that gave this anime a low score. Besides, it really does deserve a low score, also, the anime itself was more like a documentary of Japan\'s Train history than anything else, beside who gives a shit about those trains? In my opinion such informative documentary  should\'ve been saved for the ""Discovery Channel"" or the ""History Channel,"" and not in this anime/ manga.Btw, here is a train joke, How does a train conductor drink beer and fart?Ans: They Chung-aa, Chung-aa afterwards they Proot! Proooooot!!!!!!', ""Not bad. Definitely is unique. I couldn't think of many related titles.StoryDoes not have a plotline that flows through the whole series. Individual arcs. Overall they're average. Arcs are straightforward with no complex side plots or whatever.Kind of a harem, but not in the way a harem works. If you get over the fact that the protagonist meets a lot of pretty girls, then its not a harem at all.However, I think it would be great as a romance with an good ending.ArtFluid characters, lots of still backgrounds. This is modern animation. It looks good by making the viewer's focus the best part. It...looks good and that's what counts. But other than that it's nothing spectacular. OP and ED look nice but also have lots of still shots. They go well with the music though.SoundI don't remember a lot about the background music, which probably means it was either not very noticeable or memorable. The OP and ED songs are really good though.CharacterAverage characters with some differences. Little to none backstory. Characters are not too complex for watching while multitasking. But still entertaining.EnjoymentEntertaining and kind of interesting at some parts, yet kind of dull at some parts. Very interesting at one part though...  It could just be that I wanted to see some things that were still airing over this though.OverallFine (6/10)I wasn't expecting much, but it was a little better than I thought it would be. I might recommend this as something to watch if there's nothing that is more entertaining than this to watch. I said its not very interesting but that may be an understatement, as few things could possibly seem interesting to me. This show makes nice light-viewing material. looks good and that's what counts.

Naoto Takayama and the gang are trained to become securities by doing physical training and learning how to operate trains.In going to see this anime, I have no expectations because from the first 3 episodes, they show us fanservice like skirt blown by the wind to reveal panties, man accidentally landing on a woman with his hands grabbing her boobs. If I see another of such thing happening, I would snap.Basically my expectations will be determined by the trailer and the first few...episodes. The anime studio Passione hasn\'t been making any good anime, so far from what I have researched, Passione made the anime ""Haitai Nanafa"" which was not well received so I thought that Passione might stand out from the crowd but sadly this wasn\'t the case with this anime.This anime was directed by Yoshifumi Sueda who hasn\'t worked on any anime so I assume it is his first directorial job on an anime with a big name.Let me explain how this show goes about.10% trains and90% fanserviceThis anime is supposed to be about trains. However, this anime focuses more on the fanservice and it bothers me the most. The comedy was weak, there wasn\'t any memorable moments in this anime. Even the action was predictable. An action is supposed to build tension however with bland characters and a bland story, it just comes off as boring and predictable.The scene where the gang have to protect the prince was the most boring and predictable scene I have seen in this anime. Reusing the peeping tom cliché.ART (3):The animation as I thought was dull and cheap. But at least the characters are decently drawn. The problem with the animation is that there is inconsistency like in one scene, they wear gloves while in other scene, they don\'t wear gloves.SOUND (3):The opening and ending songs were forgettable. The in-music when they use action was like detective songs used in the 1970s.CHARACTER (2):How are the characters? Let\'s find out. The characters range from bland to annoying.Naoto Takayama: HAHA! Oh boy I can\'t stop laughing. Anyway his character is so generic and bland.  He couldn\'t defend himself. The only thing I remembered is that his character resembles like Mark Wahlberg from the Happening by saying ""What? No! I didn\'t"". And for a minute I laughed.Sakurai Aoi: She may be badass but she is mean to Naoto just because of one mishap. She is just annoying and obnoxious. I never felt a connection between Sakurai and Takayama because they never established that in the first few episodes.Haruka Koumi: What can I say? She may have better grades but she is defenseless and have no personality other than to arouse Naoto Takayama.Shou Iwaizumi: At least he is badass and decent. It is sad that he has not enough screen time compared to the others.The rest of the characters are bland and forgettable.CONCLUSION (2):I will just sum up like this.Hollow characters + Forced fanservice = Rail WarsThat\'s all I have to say. I already expected this anime to be terrible from the beginning. It\'s a 2/10.The show should have these characters\' license revoked before this anime started. episodes.

I already expected this anime to be terrible from the beginning. It\'s a 2/10.The show should have these characters\' license revoked before this anime started.', 'When I first saw the name ""Rail Wars"", I was thinking some futuristic style anime with fighting, action, lasers, cyber space settings, and all that! Luckily I ended up half right. There is fighting, action, and a cyber space animation paired up with the ending theme. But overall, it\'s an anime about trains and the troubles that come with the job of working with them. No laser shooting, space ship having, mecha fights for my rather active imagination this time around.Let\'s jump right in.STORY:The story\'s about following our main character, Takayama Naoto, who wants to be a train driver. He went through a boot camp...setting of which was breezed through a bit but showed key points to the training, made three friends along the way, and with a stroke of luck after graduation is reunited with said three friends as trainees in the Public Security Force.After that, we get episodes involving some back story on everyone, interesting knowledge about trains, and renegade policemen-national security situations!! That\'s right! There\'s catching purse snatchers, bomb disposal, saving your friend\'s friend from drug dealers, gunplay, self-defense and hand to hand combat, VIP transport and protection-All of this, wrapped up in a competitive-harem bow.As you can see, it\'s a pretty simple story. But the story\'s strong points is how they go about the elements I listed, all the way to an ending that will make all who liked the anime, expect another season.Some anime tend to teach us, the viewers, about its underlying or main theme. Chemistry here, games there, but over here it\'s trains. And it\'s presented the knowledge in a nice, natural, and comfortable pace. I never really knew about trains and their history or the measures that are taken to make sure both the trains and the passengers safety paired with the training necessary to support both the trains and the order on and off the trains, until watching the anime. It gave me something I\'ll remember if I ever hear about trains or take an actual train ride. Granted it doesn\'t get you ready to help the crew if something\'s wrong, so don\'t expect to be some train savior after watching the anime; it wasn\'t meant to make you that. It just gave those who didn\'t know about trains a refreshing and new view of them and the things the people who work on the trains have to deal with.ART:The first thing I thought about the art is how the characters designs, especially the faces, reminds me of SAO (Sword Art Online). But it takes SAO\'s detail to the naughty bits of women that appeared in subtle ways in SAO, and exaggerates them a whole heap on most of the female characters in Rail Wars. You\'ll get big round breasts, butts, and legs that can reflect light depending on if the scenes in the anime wants to express fanservice, and sometimes flesh seemingly at bursting point through clothing.You may also like the attention to the environment. Whether in the city, through Japan\'s mountainous areas or when going across bridges. All that you\'d usually enjoy when looking out a window of a train, is all here for your viewing pleasure.They say trains are a mans romance, and I found that to be true by watching this anime and playing a video game that involved a train segment. The drawback however, is that I felt they could have shown me the inner workings of the relevant trains more often. And so my immersion into the world of trains that the anime displayed suffered a little because the characters would often talk about the workings and make of the train but sometimes not have enough segments showing me these features the train has.There were two drawbacks in the opening animation.The first is that at some point the opening  tried to display trains and scenes or segments of the characters in the anime at the same time. And that worked as well as some of you may have expected: the trains and the ground they occupied annoyingly blocked out or covered the scenes and segments that I think hinted the characters personalities in the background. You know how an opening theme is supposed to show you what you\'ll expect? Well thanks to the opening I expected trains; you can be sure of that, but barely anything else when the trains were showcased! And it\'s not like the trains over throw or outshine the characters, or gave off vibes like ""at the end of the day,it\'s all about the trains"". It was a just poor design choice of that part of the anime opening. They could have either eliminated the ground the trains ran along, or made both the ground and trains outlined or transparent until the scenes of the characters were finished.The second drawback of the opening, is that they showed clips or pictures of random places on and off the train station. Some of the places they showed, weren\'t really visited anytime during the anime. I feel they could have toned down these, and made use of showing off the characters more. However it did give me a good sense of the environment of a train station, so it\'s got an up and a downside.But aside from those parts of the opening, the rest of the opening was very engaging and did great in displaying what the characters and environment were like most of the time.Another part that I might consider a drawback is how sometimes the action and stunts (be it acrobatics and combat) were exaggerated too much and space where everything was happening seemed to expand or detach away from the characters. But I figured this was meant to show that the anime is""over the top"", funny, makes room for the characters to do their action scenes, has fanservice, and to inform the viewer what the character(s) will be capable of during the anime.It has some 3DCGi, but it\'s rarely shown with the animated characters, and is only saved for when looking at the train from the outside as it travels and such. So it didn\'t stop me from enjoying the animations.Overall the art and animation will give you a lot to enjoy. Just know that quality for both varies to set the mood, show relevance, or to give the fan service an edge.SOUND:Aside from the man works the speakers of just about every single train or station in most episodes who sounds weird, out-of-place, and sometimes not even like he\'s speaking through a speaker: everyone\'s voice actors fit the characters well enough. I don\'t know whether the person who worked the speakers was one of those automated voices, but he sounded bad and could have been replaced by someone with a better voice or made him fix his voice. They could have added more sound effects before, during, and after he spoke to make it sound like man was part of the intercom system and not like he was a narrator or sitting in the same room as you.I don\'t feel there was any concerning drawbacks in the voice acting, nor any praises to be sang. I would have liked if it could have had more realism based on what was happening or had happened to the bodies of characters (like falling down because of being jumped off of or fell upon and getting into fights), but no real issues. In the end I think that\'s always been up to preference, as I know not all anime will stop to make the sounds real people would make in similar situations and not everyone will criticize or even look for the realism in an anime.The OP and ED theme really sets the anime\'s tone to me. Both are filled with a sense of preparation for battle, struggle and longing, all in a sense of ""this is how the world is"" and ""it\'s up to us to keep everyone safe"", and I love that! Especially in a modern-day time! It makes me feel like this anime could have been the mecha, futuristic, war and battle ridden world that I assumed it was by the name! But I never said I was disappointed by what it was or wasn\'t, and it\'s still a nice choice for the anime.CHARACTERS:What we have is our standard harem setup, a surprisingly tough and reliable bro, and a mentor who starts to favor the main character almost as much as the harem members. A drawback I want to bring up first, is that you may find some of the harem candidates falling for the main character too quickly or taking interest in him for the littlest things. But since it\'s 12 episodes long, I guess the anime had to be fit all this love for the main character in sooner before later, as to make for cute and valid scenes throughout the anime.Now to get into what I thought about the main character:The main character had a child like fondness of trains and that appealed to me because I felt I could relate to him in terms of the things I like. No matter how much certain characters thought he went overboard or told him to shut up, he would always have something nice to say about the trains as well as the characters who got annoyed by his honesty sometimes.His drawback is you may dislike how often he comes off as weak, and yet powered up in certain situations with no reason except to look cool, get opinions of him improved, or with explanations like, ""I have a friend who toughened me up and they will never forgive me if that\'s all I could take"". Characters like this are made to seem like they\'re improving as people as the anime goes on, so I can put up with him being weak for a while. Other than the drawback, I still found him to be a great person, way ahead of his time mentally, as he would often put the public\'s safety and comfort before himself.Now for the main and extra harem members:First up is Aoi Sakurai. She\'s the very aggressive type of tsundere who has a very bad and close-minded view of just about all men, and constantly hits and yells at the main character over accidents and the smallest of things. I cannot stand these kinds of tsundere characters! Even if her aggression, mean streak, and hitting of the main character tones down the more she hears his thoughts about certain matters or sees him in action during certain situations(casual and serious). Ultimately replacing this hate and poor opinion of the main character with teasing to get his attention or embarrassed love taps. She was so annoying at the beginning of the anime that her good looks and fanservice wouldn\'t have been enough to keep my opinion of her dropping for the rest of the anime.But like I said, it gets toned down to acceptable levels. She gets a lot less annoying and a lot hotter and cuter, just in time to pay attention to her back story and withheld feelings for the main character. I began to like her and think better of her, so don\'t peg me as someone who hates tsundere characters in the reviews I make. It\'s just I can only take so much of a harem member whooping the main character\'s butt, until it gets played out and annoying.Next is Haruka Kōmi, the big breasted intellectual who\'s very gentle and can be competitive in the harem sometimes. She can also be take-charge in regard to serious situations or when she\'s the most helpful. I\'m not going to dig too deep into her as it\'ll spoil how she became a member of the harem. So I\'ll just say that it might annoy you(the viewer) at how frail she comes off sometimes and less likely to say what\'s on her mind. Especially when compared to the other members. She\'s the real ""damsel in distress"" type who\'s both resourceful and needs saving.Next two characters bring the ""standard harem"" bit i said before, home.First is the childhood friend who not only has a normal frame compared to EVERY member in the harem, but also has an edge over everyone else since she knows the most about the main character. She had a bit of a noble, ""I\'m not too worried about how I measure up to the other girls"", demeanor to her. And I liked that about her.Second is the pop idol who is revealed to be the most predatory and bold of all the harem members. She would have a tone that challenged the other members to make her stop clinging to the main character, and it would be a pleasant surprise to see her pop in after her introductory episode.Now that I got the harem out of the way, the last character I\'ll talk to you about is the muscle headed character that had a great sense of honor, impressive strength and reliability (except for that one time...), and who ate a lot. He also appeared to be smart and have insight on certain things, for some reason was spared from Aoi Sakurai\'s hatred of men early in the anime, and was a fun guy to watch. You may find me a smudge forgettable, passing him off as the ox character who was there to round out and support the main cast, but I found him to be a great addition.Everyone else, you should watch the anime to get to know about.ENJOYMENT:The parts I enjoyed about the anime, was the fanservice, action, over the top climaxes of action movies, learning about trains, and the harem.While development and relationships of characters seem rushed, I felt it was because everyone needed to get closer to each other to make the rest of the episodes that followed more valid and possibly setup for a season two. That\'s just how I feel though. I don\'t know if there will be another season, but here\'s hoping.It\'s highly rewatchable, and is a worth while experience.If you don\'t like over-the-top and exaggerated action, acrobatics, and fanservice, you probably won\'t like the anime as much as I did. So keep this mind.For the rest of us, we\'ll rewatch and probably even talk among ourselves as fans expecting more to come. Because we\'re suckers for action, butts and boobies, and the usual harem setup with fun interactions among both the characters and harem members.OVERALL:Now to close the review so you can see the anime for yourself.I give Rail Wars!:An 7 out of 10.It is a good anime. A good buy and worthy of support for either more anime like it, or to show that you\'re a hopeful for a sequel.It started out as a light novel that now has 9 books, a manga adaptation, and it almost had a game for the PSP Vita. I don\'t know about you but a game of this anime sounds like it would have been refreshing and fun to look into, had it not been delayed for some reason . So be sure to let the makers of the anime know that they made a good anime, and be on the look out for a possible video game.Until then, let\'s meet up at a review of another anime! setting of which was breezed through a bit but showed key points to the training, made three friends along the way, and with a stroke of luck after graduation is reunited with said three friends as trainees in the Public Security Force.After that, we get episodes involving some back story on everyone, interesting knowledge about trains, and renegade policemen-national security situations!!

She gets a lot less annoying and a lot hotter and cuter, just in time to pay attention to her back story and withheld feelings for the main character. I began to like her and think better of her, so don\'t peg me as someone who hates tsundere characters in the reviews I make. It\'s just I can only take so much of a harem member whooping the main character\'s butt, until it gets played out and annoying.Next is Haruka Kōmi, the big breasted intellectual who\'s very gentle and can be competitive in the harem sometimes. She can also be take-charge in regard to serious situations or when she\'s the most helpful. I\'m not going to dig too deep into her as it\'ll spoil how she became a member of the harem. So I\'ll just say that it might annoy you(the viewer) at how frail she comes off sometimes and less likely to say what\'s on her mind. Especially when compared to the other members. She\'s the real ""damsel in distress"" type who\'s both resourceful and needs saving.Next two characters bring the ""standard harem"" bit i said before, home.First is the childhood friend who not only has a normal frame compared to EVERY member in the harem, but also has an edge over everyone else since she knows the most about the main character. She had a bit of a noble, ""I\'m not too worried about how I measure up to the other girls"", demeanor to her. And I liked that about her.Second is the pop idol who is revealed to be the most predatory and bold of all the harem members. She would have a tone that challenged the other members to make her stop clinging to the main character, and it would be a pleasant surprise to see her pop in after her introductory episode.Now that I got the harem out of the way, the last character I\'ll talk to you about is the muscle headed character that had a great sense of honor, impressive strength and reliability (except for that one time...), and who ate a lot. He also appeared to be smart and have insight on certain things, for some reason was spared from Aoi Sakurai\'s hatred of men early in the anime, and was a fun guy to watch. You may find me a smudge forgettable, passing him off as the ox character who was there to round out and support the main cast, but I found him to be a great addition.Everyone else, you should watch the anime to get to know about.ENJOYMENT:The parts I enjoyed about the anime, was the fanservice, action, over the top climaxes of action movies, learning about trains, and the harem.While development and relationships of characters seem rushed, I felt it was because everyone needed to get closer to each other to make the rest of the episodes that followed more valid and possibly setup for a season two. That\'s just how I feel though. I don\'t know if there will be another season, but here\'s hoping.It\'s highly rewatchable, and is a worth while experience.If you don\'t like over-the-top and exaggerated action, acrobatics, and fanservice, you probably won\'t like the anime as much as I did. So keep this mind.For the rest of us, we\'ll rewatch and probably even talk among ourselves as fans expecting more to come. Because we\'re suckers for action, butts and boobies, and the usual harem setup with fun interactions among both the characters and harem members.OVERALL:Now to close the review so you can see the anime for yourself.I give Rail Wars!:An 7 out of 10.It is a good anime. A good buy and worthy of support for either more anime like it, or to show that you\'re a hopeful for a sequel.It started out as a light novel that now has 9 books, a manga adaptation, and it almost had a game for the PSP Vita. I don\'t know about you but a game of this anime sounds like it would have been refreshing and fun to look into, had it not been delayed for some reason . So be sure to let the makers of the anime know that they made a good anime, and be on the look out for a possible video game.Until then, let\'s meet up at a review of another anime!', ""DIRTY RAIL WARS REVIEW:MINDSET:HAREM. ENOUGH SAID.SYNOPSIS:After that holy shift opening, Generic Harem Lead has the natural ability to lead all of the chicks to fall in love in him like some sort Whores Masturbator because of his good heart while its completely bounded by Your ordinary Harem ending, like, why can't it should've been a Hentai in the first place with the whole group banging each other excluding his one male friend? And the reason why this review exists? F**king Holden and its all about trains. Obvious Fact.REVIEW:Hearing the word Harem, I pretty much see mass clones of the same thing over and over again,...of course, there are those who put a bit more effort into the writing such as Oreshura's Misuzu, Shuffle,  just play it up in a completely different perspective (deconstruction) like School Days, or the most enjoyable of all those types of Harem... Harem Hentai obviously, since I give it a wooden medal for the best consistency.And if You really hate Harems, and You know this repeated trend very well and are pretty much not willing to watch any at the moment, then You can predict my entire review, and leave some positive feed back that I didn’t waste precious minutes of Your life span. Go off, shoo, so You can other things in life such as baking a self-detonating cake or something.So if You really want to know, yes, all characters are a complete one dimensional stereotypical Archetpye who simply blorb out an Otaku's fantasy. Like the useless whore, the tsundere, the quiet girl, the forever alone comic relief, the unseen father etc. So there is noting much to talk about in those realms either.... Unless if You think these are actual complex characters (in that case I'll shoot you for taking those drugs) and You know, the development is very minimal to none, so all what You'll remember from the girl team were there cute faces and boob proportions. No, there zero characters who are worthy enough to be in this review.Sure Harems have the horrible tendency to mass clone themselves especially that where in the 2010's, but something that I do kind of appreciate at what so many of these Harem are doing (and what there actually best at) is there surprisingly good  consistency. You see, the show knows what it wants to be, and really sticks to it without derailing. Do You wannabe see softcore porn? Check! Would You like to see a bunch of girls? Check! Are the boob jokes finally making You laugh? Check! Sure its easy to write those kinds of stories,  but considering the material the writers have to work with and how its supposed to be portrayed, then You can see why it should deserve some redeeming bronze just for that. This one is just no exception, except You know, it has trains! And Its like trying to make its some sort of marketing scheme to mix Thomas the Tank engine look more BA with he's new pimping design, and how a lot chicks ride on that long, long travelling rod of his...However such one good trait ricochets back like too many other harems, and that’s because it is very, very, VERY boring to watch the same thing over and over again. There is also a lack of story or any interesting character to appeal the audience, sure it would be OK if it really was just a bunch of people doing “Stuff” and there is actually nothing profoundly or noticeably wrong with rail wars because it achieved what it was trying to do ever since the first episode.What is there to say about the Animation? All what I remember were a bunch boobs and panty shots. Its budget is clearly mediocre, and the colours are bright. Animation is very consistent.If there is anything I would clap at the music, it would be the OP and ED song making the whole show sound (not look) like a cool action show that I would give a higher score for.LEGACY:You watch it, You forget it like any Harem that was cloned. It makes a good tactic for killing time, or to simply use it as some sort of video material. People watch it, they forget it....SCORES:4/10 – Very Self-Aware, but very boring. There’s not even an “Actual Plot” in harems.4/10 – ARCHETYPES.5/10 – Mediocre Budgeted Animation6/10 – Cool OP and ED bro.3/10 – This show lacks any value or entertainment, since I gotten bored of the Harem formula ages ago.FINALE: 4/10.... maybe that was too kind, but whatever. of course, there are those who put a bit more effort into the writing such as Oreshura's Misuzu, Shuffle,  just play it up in a completely different perspective (deconstruction) like School Days, or the most enjoyable of all those types of Harem...

As I thought it\'s quite interesting to see a series with unique main theme, I took this series. It turned out quite wrong if you want to come and see a train in this series.As I previously mentioned above, it\'s a train series. It came with a good premise but deviating plot. The series follows Takayama Naoto, a boy who wants to be a train driver. But, he couldn\'t do that and instead, he entered as a trainee in the Railways Security Force. There he met some of his harem.The story is quite...amusing, but it\'s boring. It\'s amusing because of the offer of the girls\' action there in resolving problem on train security. It\'s boring because repetitive usage of same plot in every arc/episode. In almost every episodes, we got some problem. Then as the main character, Takayama used what his best to solved the problem, but it didn\'t help. Then the harem came to rescue. It always used the same recipe.One of the reason why I took this series other than the deviating theme is the character design. I really love the character design, the budget really comes in a good way. It is probably the best character design in Summer 2014. But, it\'s a let down to see the animation didn\'t come as great as the design. Sometime, you might find a silence and staring character without doing anything for one or two seconds. It\'s quite disappointing. Otherwise, I love the 3D animation to be used on the train movement.The OP and ED is quite nice, I like them especially ED. Probably they\'re the outstanding parts on this series. The soundtrack they are used isn\'t that good but it\'s not bad either. At least, it sounds quite matched with the story flow.Character is another good part in this series, as it\'s harem series. The girls side are really good, you might find yourself in one of their fans. The boys, too bad they didn\'t come out as good as the girls. Sometimes, you might find the boys are annoying, as they (or maybe only Takayama) wouldn\'t do anything notable other than charmed the girls in unnatural way and the girls somehow fell for it. Another note is there is almost no character development, especially on the main characters.I\'m quite enjoyed with this series as this series come in a amazing design. But, sometimes I\'m annoyed with the bad reaction to the situation ahead of characters and how the girls fall for Takayama\'s action. Well, it\'s a harem series after all.Rail Wars! come as a quite fair series with outstanding art and good character, but too bad the story didn\'t come as good as the other parts. This series is for the one who come for the story, but stay for the girls. For the closing, a great quote to follow this series is maybe the one from Bill Gates, ""If you can\'t make it good, at least make it look good.""Thanks for your time to read this review. amusing, but it\'s boring.

The trainwreck of this summer!Okay, sorry, everybody already heard that pun but I just had to use it here. Now that this is out of the way, I think that I should start with my real review.First of all, I think that I should mention that I'm quite interested in trains, so I actually had high hopes after I heard the title and the premise of this series. Sadly, all my hopes were crushed after the third episode.Story: 2/10If I'm really honest, this show is nothing for people who are interested in good stories. It's not even really good for people who...are solely interested in “plot”, given that even the “plot” was ridiculously bad. Obviously the story consists mostly (at least 90%) of “cabooses”, which is why my rating has become so low, since I've obviously been expecting something different. If you read the synopsis of this show here on MAL, you can read something about an extremist group called “RJ” plotting to privatize the railways. My sole question is: where are the extremists?? Throughout the show there were some people who tried to attack the railways, or an idol who promoted the Japanese Railways, but the extremists were never mentioned as such. This is the first out of a lot of disappointments.Besides, even the little elements of story in this series (which had basically the length of one episode), were quite unrealistic as well. As a railway fan, I really must emphasize on the lack of realism in quite a few episodes. Given that all the characters were 17 years old and had neither a license for guns nor a train driver license... Why in the name of hell were they allowed to carry guns with them?As well some of the characters acted in a quite imbecile way. By all means of respect... Who on earth would be paranoid enough in order to believe in assassinating cats?Art: 2/10Ah, the animation of Rail Wars!... That's where the true trainwreck starts.First of all – I really do feel sorry for the animation studio (Passione), given that this was their first bigger project. Still, it is really mentionable that the amount of animation errors is so high that it's almost ridiculous. I won't point out all the errors one by one, you should check for yourself how inconstant the animation of the series is.And even the size of the cabooses (which were probably important for the producers) changed during(!) all episodes.There's nothing more to comment here, let's just say that the animation is one of the worse parts of this show.Sound: 4/10To be honest, the OP and the ED were fairly nice, in particular the rather funky ED somehow fit the show. Still, they're not outstanding in any particular way.  As well the voice actors were in general acceptable, even though all the other sound effects were rather dull.Character: 2/10I'm pretty sure that I've never seen as  many cliches used in an anime as here.First of all, we've got Takayama, our stereotypical, dull and boring MC. Maybe it's because he is as dull and stupid as I used to be, but according to me he is one of the most boring and hateful harem leads ever. His sheer denseness is outstanding even in comparison to other harem leads.Then we have Aoi. Your generic redhead-tsundere. My opinion about Aoi probably isn't really neutral (because of my rather negative stance against that character type), but I still consider her one of the worse tsunderes, given how bluntly she tries to ruin a lot of things, in particular during the earlier episodes of this series.The next mentionable character is Haruka, who is at least a little more interesting because of the little yandere-side of her character. Still, she can be also seen as a quite dull character.And the last (but definitely not the least) character of the “Fourth Vigilance Squad” is Iwaizumi, the only character I liked at least a bit, simply because he usually tries to do something productive. Still, his appearances are way too seldom throughout the whole series.All the other characters of Takayama's harem aren't outstanding as well, so there's nothing special to brag about either.Enjoyment: 1.5/10As a railway fan, I really had my hopes high for this show. Perhaps that's why my rating is so harsh, but I just cannot ignore the sheer amount of logical errors throughout the whole series (as mentioned above): Simply because of this very fact I wasn't able to enjoy this show at all. Seriously though, 17 year-olds carrying guns (and trying to kill each other with them because of a misunderstanding), running away from cats and being officially allowed to drive a train without a license? That's surely not what I did expect from this show.Overall: 3/10Obviously my expectations for this show were far too high. But even when I try to look on this show from a different angle, I can only see a dull, boring ecchi harem show with nothing particular to remember.tl;dr this show is good for you if you are interested into cabooses whose size changes minutely, otherwise you should turn away. are solely interested in “plot”, given that even the “plot” was ridiculously bad.

Because I like trains a lot. I'm a huge nerd who wastes their time reading train schedules and learning about engines. So, I wanted to see trains. I got fanservice. I like hot girls, not gonna lie. But I dislike animes without plot. This anime didn't have plot.My geeky needs are not met and I will cry.The opening was very nice though. I liked that "", 'I\'m not sure where to begin with this...show. I can\'t analyze it from the beginning so let\'s look at it from the end. SO IN OTHER WORDS, THIS SHOW IS NOW CALLED CABOOSE WARS!On a more serious note, those looking for a serious show with a great story, interesting characters, and an overall good time, just stop right now...This show...can be summarized by fan-service.Let\'s start with breaking down the specifics.Story: (3 of 10): Let\'s look at the synopsis above, now back to this. (wants to make an old spice reference, but holds it in). The synopsis is partially right. This is about...the story of Takayama, who wishes to go and become an employee of the JNR system (a train driver to be exact). After that, we get to witness several episodes of nothing but fan-service and animated sequences that serve no other purpose than to give you a butt to look at. There a few moments when the story seems to focus more on his life only to later be covered up by some sort of fan-service or harem activity.Art: (6 of 10): I can at least say that the animation did have good looking fan-service xD when it would be there. However, the art is like most animes as it uses that same basic anime look. (What I consider unique is something like NGNL\'s insane color usage or Nichijou\'s character designs and slightly flat color usage). The animation that went into trains seem to be fine however I have noticed that some instances of the animation were done lazily. An example would be when one of the trains was a still image and only the background moved.Sound: (5 of 10): I will say that the sound work was not terrible either. I haven\'t been on enough trains to recognize the sounds of them like one of their characters, but I have enough experience to say that they matched well enough. Voice work was fine had no issues with the voice cast.Character: (3 of 10): I\'m just going to mention Aoi here. From the beginning she was the ""Anti-male"" trope that made several of us cringe (why is that still a character type)...unfortunately, that personality fell apart quicker than a bullet train (Ask Takayama about that speed). What personalities several characters have begin to fall apart like another certain anime I remember reviewing (Don\'t ask about Infinite Stratos 2). This was all due to creating the harem that Takayama gains.Enjoyment: (6 of 10): I will give this show some props for having a few interesting scenes throughout the series itself. There was some action that did keep me interested enough to help me watch this. However, this story was hard for me to finish due to its lack of enjoyment. Honestly, I spent more time making fun of the fact that it was more about cabooses and less about trains.Overall: (5 of 10): I\'m giving this a mediocre rating (5). I can\'t seem to justify giving this show anything higher. It was not utterly terrible, but it was no where near decent or ""fair"" as MAL calls it.Recommend watching?: Not really...unless you want an idea of a low-end animation for comparison in future reviews. the story of Takayama, who wishes to go and become an employee of the JNR system (a train driver to be exact).

Anyone who actually bothers to research something would have understood that this series was going to have harem influence and the lead designers of the characters, same as the one who handled Witchblade, should also have told most people that a focus on T&A would be fundamental.Where things really came out of the left field though was execution. From what I hear, the light novels are significantly more action packed and actually...relevant to the plot. Apparently there was a bit of an argument between the anime director and the novelist and as such the anime is nothing...like the novels, or so I've heard.This makes a great deal of sense though because this anime has no point to it. It's not quite a harem comedy, because there really is not THAT much fanservice and quite a few episodes put humor on the backburner. It's setup to be about a different way of thinking of railway management, and about some kind of war against terrorism on trains or something along those lines. The title and first episode both imply such. This all but gets dropped completely though, so much so that sometimes I wondered if I was just watching a series of OVAs and actually missing out on the real series.Seriously episodes are just random action movie cliches mixed in with some ecchi elements. This wouldn't be so bad if the series had a budget of any real kind, but instead frames look terribly half-assed, with often times wonky proportions and faces, and even worse: there's little attention to detail. Pay close attention to any episode and you will see what I mean. The designers straight up ignore or forget about basic levels of space and realism. A character could be sitting on one side of a table next to Aoi, and then in the next frame be on the other side of the table or standing up, all during a steady consistent conversation. Trains can sometimes be not much taller than a human in one scene, and then so huge it would take multiple people standing on one another to reach its top in another scene. This sense of QUALITY was actually probably the funniest thing about the show.As far as the sound score goes, it's got a good set of voice actors and I actually quite enjoyed the soundtrack. The OP and ED are both catchy and there's a few songs in particular that play during episodes that I found upbeat and enjoyable. The character designs are also great. I never thought I would find outfits like the ones they wear as appealing as I do now, though them being unrealistically tight helps for sure. The faces and base designs are excellent, but as I said the actual low budget and lack of well drawn frames somewhat ruins the potential of these designs.What's truly strange about Rail Wars is how enjoyable it actually is though. Despite basically being bad objectively in nearly every single way, I always found myself coming back for more and it was a consistently enjoyable series throughout. It's the kind of show you watch weekly without much expectation; you just kick back, relax, and enjoy the ride. When the show did try to take itself a bit more seriously and focus on trains, it was both informative, interesting, and sometimes quite exciting. As a whole the series seemed to start to better understand the direction it wanted to take toward the end, so it's a huge shame that most of it felt like filler OVAs. That and the low budget kind of spoils scenes that could be downright incredible in say an anime film.The cast is also a bit baffling. Aoi, the main girl, is a tsundere that had she not had beautiful red hair and a huge ass, would be extremely unlikable. Simply put, she's a terrible person. She's violent, irrational, prone to illogical and sporadic actions, and belittles the protagonist for little reason. As a self proclaimed hater of men, she runs around asserting herself in ways that are laughably stupid. It's as though the writers tried so hard to make an alpha female that they ruined any sense of realism that could have been here. In her extremely tight skirt and stockings she manages to do superhuman motions and actions to take out thugs on a daily basis. It's an anime and not one that takes itself super seriously so I can forgive such things, but things like this also ruin any sense of suspense or realism that she show was trying to go for. I can't have someone explaining to me how cool reallife trains are and how dangerous terrorists are just to have an arrogant and rude red-headed girl run around soloing waves of people without taking a scratch.  There are even scenes of her purposefully making things harder for her friends. She really is the weakest link to the show.There is also Iwaizumi. If I got his name wrong, it should be obvious why. This is the token harem protagonist's friend. He's a happy-go-lucky active dude who seems to have little real sexual drive and as such can just run around laughing, smiling, and eating food. There are episodes where he is just straightup not in it, as though the writers actually forgot he existed. He gets no real time to shine especially because his one gimmick, his strength, is outmatched by Aoi who also shares this gimmick. He's not unlikable, but he's also not all that likable just because he has little real presence. It's a shame too because as the only other guy in the series he is pretty important to balance the cringe worthy harem elements the show throws around.The protagonist is actually pretty likable. Usually we all hate these beta harem protagonists, but this one has his motivations and facts straight. He loves trains and dreams of being a conductor. He works hard at his job, is pretty easy going, and has a big heart. I can see actual reason why the girls around him take a liking to him and he's consistently nice to everyone around him, without really being all that naive, except of course when it comes to the feelings people have for him. He's stupidly naive to such things and it comes across as awful writing too. Multiple times in the series the cast of women will actually fight over him verbally...right in front of him. How dense can you be? It always leads to nothing too. He might blush or shrug, but that's it. It's such shitty writing that it makes you want to facepalm.Literally every girl in the series seems to fawn over this man within minutes too. There could have been such better ways to go about this.All in all the concept of this series was wonderful and deserved a hell of a lot better treatment than what we got. All Rail Wars made me want to do was brush up on my Japanese and give the novels a try, because the anime sure did fail to live up to its base premise. like the novels, or so I've heard.This makes a great deal of sense though because this anime has no point to it. It's not quite a harem comedy, because there really is not THAT much fanservice and quite a few episodes put humor on the backburner. It's setup to be about a different way of thinking of railway management, and about some kind of war against terrorism on trains or something along those lines. The title and first episode both imply such. This all but gets dropped completely though, so much so that sometimes I wondered if I was just watching a series of OVAs and actually missing out on the real series.Seriously episodes are just random action movie cliches mixed in with some ecchi elements. This wouldn't be so bad if the series had a budget of any real kind, but instead frames look terribly half-assed, with often times wonky proportions and faces, and even worse: there's little attention to detail.

Or not.I found Rail Wars through a gif of a model train running into a woman's breasts. No joke. And if I had to describe Rail Wars, that's the gist of what I would say. Rail Wars is, pun intended, a train wreck, with a ton of boobs (and butt and legs).Overall: 2Rail Wars! is bad. The only things decent about the anime is art and sound, and neither are all that great. Characters are just 2D cardboard cutouts. There was no creativity in story. While the short arc formula worked for the anime, it didn't help it. Rail...Wars! is not interesting, cool, or funny. There is no way I could recommend this anime to anyone.Story: 3Rail Wars!, on the surface, is an anime about a boy who loves trains, and wants to be an engineer. Simple enough. But then once you get into the story, there is hardly any train driving. What a shame. To make it worse, he's thrown into a job in security for Japanese National Railways, the public train system in Japan. To make it even worse, nearly every character introduced is a hot girl.There's the problem. Rail Wars is an ecchi harem anime, intermingled with trains. The story is a jumbled mess. A wannabe engineer in a security job, who practically turns all of JNR into his harem, with side plots that are never dealt with. Again, just a train wreck.Art: 7Probably where RW! excels the most, but even then, it's not fantastic. Thankfully, there are a lot of trains in Rail Wars! (who'd've thunk it?). The scenes with the trains actually driving are really well animated. I mean, watching the way the wheels just... wheel... just cool. I don't know how accurate it all is, but it looks right to me!Outside of the trains, however, art isn't that great. While the fight scenes are cool, there isn't anything special about the animation. I noticed, especially later in the anime, lots of mistakes in animation. Mouths not moving when a character talks, characters looking 'melty'.Sound: 7Train sounds are pretty good, I guess. They sound very trainy.OP and ED are both really cool, a little too cool for Rail Wars! if you ask me. But nevertheless, they're very well done songs.Character: 2In Rail Wars!, either you're the MC, you're in love with him, or you just don't matter. Not to mention, all of the characters are blatant and bland archetypes. An oblivious male lead, a large-breasted gentle lady that he doesn't remember, a tsundere who likes to hit people, and the aniki cool strong guy. Others include: Childhood friend, superfamous idol, semi-airhead, and cold, distant team leader.Not to mention there is no major character development, and they ignore Iwaizumi, the aforementioned aniki, unless his brute strength is needed. I mean, they even address that he's completely ignored in the anime...Enjoyment: 2I did not like Rail Wars. It was boring, unfunny, and lame.

Interesting story, new topic, very nice art, characthers progressing fairly well, the right ammount and balance of a good story and seduction. Sadly, from episode 4 henceforth it was just pointless ecchi just to fill the episodes. Nothing new, the...art was sloppy, linear and boring ""story"" and a waste of money to produce. If it were to have this end, might as well stopped releasing episodes like this.Another anime bites the dust.

Because this is the first anime that I\'ve given a lower score to, I wanted to write a review as to why. So with that being said, here\'s my very first short and simple review on MAL.First off, one of the major things that turned me away was the characters and the sheer amount of ""fanservice"". You never really get to know the characters, they\'re just supposed to be taken as is with their personalities....Fanservice, please don\'t get me wrong, is great when it\'s utilized in moderation and in animes that you want to watch for those things. Not so much in an anime about trains.I\'m not really a big train fangirl, but I thought it would be cool to learn about trains and especially in the fictional world this anime creates with its non-privatized railway system. That part really got me excited when I first heard about it. However, it hardly, if ever, went into much detail about the actual railway system and non-privatization. Which was to say fairly disappointing.Story (2/10):You mean there\'s a story? I\'m kidding. The premise for the plot is promising, but the actual story is stagnant. There\'s no progress at all, and it\'s just similar situations after one another with a cliche love triangle (pentagon??).Art (4/10):Despite the many many many animation errors, I couldn\'t really complain about the art. They did their best, but it wasn\'t stunning in any way. The OP animation kinda looked weird for me, but that may be me.Sound (7/10):Saved by the sound. I thought the OP and ED were pretty nice actually. Plus the BGM in some scenes really were appropriate and good. Nothing superb, but I liked it to say the least.Character (5/10):Eh. Eh. Eh. Most of the characters seemed to just be there simply for the sake of creating situations and fanservice. There was hardly any depth to them and I felt like they weren\'t very memorable since the only things I can really remember is whenever Takayama accidentally touched their breasts (countless times). However for some characters, you can tell a lot went into them, such as Takayama and Iida. They made the anime a bit more tolerable and it seemed they drove the story forward.Enjoyment (5/10):Well, it was good enough for me to get through all 12 episodes, so I can\'t necessarily say I hated it. It was worth trying out despite everything. All in all, it has it\'s good moments, but in the end it was really missing something vital for me to actually enjoy it.

The anime wasn\'t just about trains but about the main character and side characters trying to make their dreams come true and thus I binge watched it.The art at first look amazed me.

The opening and end songs were catchy and matched the scenes.There was some clear character development throughout the anime.

Trains is not a theme you would often think to use as a central plot device outside of Thomas the Tank Engine. And that this most certainly is not.Story: There is very little, to no overarching plot. If you had to pin one down, it would simply be 'Life Working for the Japan National Railway's Public Safety Force'. Each episode has its own plot, with a few two episode Min-arcs. There is not much in the way of progression for the story, but enough happens each episode to usually be at...least a little engaging. The worst part about the stpry is that the jumps that it takes at points, sometimes skipping frankly important or interesting parts that you think would be a focus, can be jarring.Art: Art is par for the course. The way the trains look certainly is quite nice on the eyes, having some unique designs and interesting color themes, my favorite certainly being the 'Mini-train Engine' that you see in the opening title, shown in more detail later in the series.

Can't vouch on the authenticity, but it was certainly interesting.Character: Not much is done on building the characters up at the start. The personalities of the Characters are not very deep, each with at most one or two notes to them. The females in the story feel a tad too fan-servicy at times in both design and personalities. You can tell that the character designs for the main females were made for sex appeal. It can get a tad distracting when a tense moment is ruined by the camera briefly panning past a character like the busty Haruka at Chest level just to give you a nice clear look at her 'bounce'.Enjoyment: It was by far not the best I've ever watched, but it was certainly enjoyable, and much better than I was initially thinking. Not warranting a re-watch in my opinion, but I'm glad I took the time to watch it through in its entirety and did not simply drop it after an episode or two.Overall: Worth your while if you find that your current anime-watching well has run dry.

My first impression was that this was another school life anime with cliché characters, however when i watched the first few episodes i got really into it, as it had amazing plots every episode and also it shows how much the characters are devoted to railway security. The plots in every episode are moderately paced which is a good thing as you do not want rush over the entire plot with the audience confused (*cough*Tokyo Ghoul*cough*). Furthermore the backgrounds of the characters were quite interesting because it...reflected their personalities, for example Aoi is quite defensive and violent as her father was a cop and Naoto is kind and always puts the pedestrians first because when he was little he was saved by a train conductor. Also, this particular anime caught my attention because of the opening sound track and also the ending sound track, both opening and ending soundtracks had different genres because it went well with the amazing art. The art style was quite modern and it made it look more appealing and also the art made the characters more distinguished throughout the series. However this anime also has its downfall which is that the anime turned into a harem half way through and they only started developing the relationship between the girls and Naoto. Also they discard out a main character Shō Iwaizumi, the writer does not develop his relationship with his team mates, however the writer does make him a active and optimistic person, so he isn't the perverted bestfriend cliche. I hope this gets a season two as i enjoyed watching it. reflected their personalities, for example Aoi is quite defensive and violent as her father was a cop and Naoto is kind and always puts the pedestrians first because when he was little he was saved by a train conductor. Also, this particular anime caught my attention because of the opening sound track and also the ending sound track, both opening and ending soundtracks had different genres because it went well with the amazing art. The art style was quite modern and it made it look more appealing and also the art made the characters more distinguished throughout the series.

Ive read many reviews and it seems peoples opinions are a little misplaced and ill get to why later.Story:5/10Cause you know this is a great story with a lot of ""plot"". Really it\'s about trains, not much plot there. The romance has no progression, and almost seems pointless. But what harem has romance progression? Because of no plot or direction in the story, the series had an episodic feeling that wasn\'t exactly terrible.Characters: 7/10First off i would like to...say the MC is beyond boring as hell. I question how he got a harem in the first place. The girls aren\'t bad per say just, uninteresting. Some how i feel as though the feelings of the girls were forced.Sound: 7/10The OP wasn\'t to bad, but the ED sounded atrocious. As for the ost, nothing stuck out to me, however that doesn\'t mean it was bad.Enjoyment: 8/10Although the story was is mediocre, i found this to be enjoyable, meaning Rail Wars fulfilled its duty.Overall/Final thoughts: 7/10Honestly after reading multiple reviews, and all say the same thing. Yes we understand this anime doesn\'t have a story or plot however it\'s to be expected from a harem/ecchi anime. Really if you don\'t like tits and ass, or cliché ecchi moments, steer clear of this.

They make models, build functional mini-railways, study the history, even listen to the sounds of classic trains for days gone by. They\'re an odd but admirable group. I, on the other hand, am an Anime enthusiast. Anime has something for everyone. And with ""Rail Wars"", they now have a go-to title for the train nuts.Coming from the relatively obscure studio Passione, ""Rail Wars"" is a charming little 12-episode series that dives into Japan\'s rail system, in an alternate universe where they are still nationalized instead of privately run. What starts off as a fairly mundane...story about a teenage boy who dreams of being a train driver, quickly turns into a mild action piece involving terrorists, kidnappers, drug deals, stalkers, urgent organ deliveries, international intrigue, and burglars dressed as luchador wrestlers. You seriously never know what situation is up ahead next for our intrepid band of cookie-cutter protagonists.Speaking of which, the main characters are much of the same you\'ve seen in Anime again and again. Our primary MC is Takayama, an optimistic, good-natured, kid working hard to achieve his dream. He is joined by Koumi, a sweet, smart, and adorable girl doing her best to keep up and living with breasts that are bigger than her head. Meat headed Iwaizumi, who serves as the ditzy strong man type who\'s concerns are eating and exercise. And Sakurai. The tsundere-ist tsundere that ever lived. Together, they make up a group of stereotypical Anime characters, but they actually do start to grow on you a bit.With a series like this, art is going to be secondary to the trains themselves which are mostly CG done and have enough emphasis put on them to make it train oriented, but not drive away the average viewer. But, not only did they add a bunch of action sequences, they also went heavy on the fan service like a man eating prison food goes heavy on ketchup. The alternate title of this show should\'ve been ""Boob Collision!""  All the girls have heavy chests and when they\'re not half-dressed, or feigning interest in our primary MC, they\'re blushing as his face somehow ends up mushed against their breasts in comical and somewhat pointless fashion.This may be one of the most oddly generic and yet unique shows I have ever seen. I must admit that I did enjoy it for what it was. It brought a little smile to my face each time and the occasional thrill the way one is thrilled by a conflict in a Disney film. You know the good guys  are gonna win, but the journey to the resolution is interesting enough to keep you watching. Hardly binge-worthy, but a good, casual viewing experience that must be enjoyed with subtitles (available ONLY in Japanese). Overall, a strong 6/10. Check it out.

LOVED the train/railway info drops, majority of characters were cool, REALLY nice fan service, cute ladies, LOVED the romance feel in the show, and the overall feel of the anime was chill and fun to me. Story was simple, literally about jobs at the JNR (Japanese National Railways). I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, even though the story isn\'t super crazy and intricate or anything and that there were tiny hiccups in the art/animation every once-in-a-while. I would...definitely put this on to watch or to do things around the house while it\'s being played in the background. Just a simple clear-cut type of anime to not be taken too seriously. definitely put this on to watch or to do things around the house while it\'s being played in the background.

There\'s barely action and good moments to enjoy and remember.The story is about a high school boy called Naoto Takayama who wants to drive trains, but before he gets inside an engine he must pass a training along other characters. The training is in the security team helping people and watching thiefs.The training makes sense but as the story advances less and less action we see and the dull situations are more present. Naoto is clumsy and he shows...no sign to be getting better, his friends are as boring as him, especially Aoi Sakurai whom is a happy-trigger and never tells Naoto of her feelings for him.The only good momento of the show is when the group has to take a tissue to the city, for an emergency situation aboard an old maintenance wagon, on their way to the city they\'ll have a lot of technical problems. After 6 episodes I had to leave this because I was tired of watching nothing. But if you want to see good train designs and a lot of fanservice this is your anime. no sign to be getting better, his friends are as boring as him, especially Aoi Sakurai whom is a happy-trigger and never tells Naoto of her feelings for him.The only good momento of the show is when the group has to take a tissue to the city, for an emergency situation aboard an old maintenance wagon, on their way to the city they\'ll have a lot of technical problems.

Let\'s begin with the title, ""Rail Wars""..Now you\'re probably thinking this is some shit about having wars on the train tracks maybe? Because that\'s what it\'s implying. But wait when you watch this anime what the fuck is happening? Where are the wars between trains? Instead this anime is about a retarded fuck trying to become a train driver? WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE TITLE ""RAIL WARS""? The...creator of this anime was just like ""HEY, I\'VE GOT AN IDEA. LET\'S MAKE A SHIT ANIME ABOUT A FUCKHEAD WANTING TO BE A TRAIN DRIVER THAT HAS NO LINK TO THE TITLE LET""S JUST ADD FUCKING BOOBS AND PANTIES TO MAKE PEOPLE WATCH THIS SHIT LIKE EVERYONE ONLY WATCHES ANIME FOR THE BOOBS ANYWAY, FUCK YEAH GOING TO BE RICH WITH THEM DEFINITIONS ON BOOBS WOOOOOO CASH MONEY SWAG"" and so on.The characters are fucking amazing just look at these big boobed bastards showing off the chest. So I\'d like to spend my time going thoroughly through what each character is about I will also provide nicknames to what they actually do in the anime.First of all the ""MAIN"" Naoto Takayama also known as, ""Weak Cunt needs help from girls""THIS IS THE BEST LEAD EVER, He\'s one of the most dense fuckhead that has been introduced in ALL OF ANIME PRODUCTION. Who am I kidding pretty much every boy in every anime is dense as fuck. He wants to be a train driver? This anime show knows how to say ""FUCK YOUR DREAM YOU LITTLE CUNT!"" Look at him the idiot JUST CAN\'T EVEN. Overall this is by far the best Male character in the anime.Aoi Sakurai also known as, ""Tomboy with a cunt""Acts like a cunt, but is secretly in love with Naoto that fuckhead? Like what the fuck you TSUNDERE CUNT. She is by far the most fucked character I have ever seen in my life. In all the fucking episodes she hugs Naoto Takayama like a hentai cunt orgasming every fucking where. Overall she\'s just a red head retard that is stronger than the MAIN CHARACTER? And she likes to be called ""NICE"" in a fucking gay ass looking dress cloth thing.Haruka Koumi also known as, ""Big Cow Tits""WHY THE FUCK DID YOUR DRAW HER WITH MASSIVE BOOBS? Overall it\'s just boobs, boobs, boobs and more boobs.And last but the very least Sho Iwaizumi also known as, ""I wish I had more lines""THIS CUNT DOES NOTHING IN THE ANIME HE IS LIKE AN EXTRA IN THE BACKGROUND ALL HE EVER WANTS IS TO EAT WHAT A USELESS CUNT, WHAT THE FUCK DOES HE DO WHEN HE\'S NOT IN THE SCENES? Probably jerking off to Haruka Koumi the big fat cow tits girl.Overall he should have gotten more lines if there are 4 main leads but he\'s like an excluded faggot.Overall this anime is a piece of shit, Please just come watch Glasslip.

Thanks for reading this review about Rail Wars hope you never watch this shit again.', ""There seems to be a lot of hate for this anime, and the other reviews almost make me wonder if I saw the same show as everyone else, because I got a completely different impression from this anime than they did.  In my opinion, Rail Wars is better than everyone makes it out to be, but I'll admit you absolutely will not enjoy it if you go into it with the wrong expectations.Rail Wars is not an ecchi harem anime.  Let me repeat that.  It is not an ecchi harem anime.  There's a minor harem subplot and some brief nudity, but...this is really more a light adventure show, something akin to a police drama.  You don't even have to be a fan of trains to enjoy Rail Wars, as long as you understand what it is.I'll admit, it didn't grab me right from the beginning, but with every episode I watched, I found myself liking it more and more.Story: 7The show is about a team of interns in a railroad security force.  The majority of the episodes deal with the kinds of adventures you might expect, such as bomb threats, terrorists, runaway trains, even a couple of kidnappings.  Nothing particularly original, but again, if you know what to expect, you can enjoy it anyways.  It's fairly episodic.  There's the occasional 2-parter, but there really isn't much of a seasonal story arc.I have to score it an extra 2 points for the emergency run in Episodes 8 and 9.  It's like a cross between the movie Speed and the mine cart chase scene from Temple of Doom.  Great excitement and adventure here, and you really see the team shine as they work together to overcome every obstacle that gets in their way.My only complaint is that the last episode is anticlimactic.  After all the exciting and adventurous episodes preceding it, an episode where nothing happens isn't how I want the show to end.  Still, at least it doesn't leave it with an unsatisfying ending, or worse, a cliffhanger.Art: 6Pretty standard for modern anime.  As you might expect, the trains are CG, but fortunately they don't overdo it.  In too many shows like this, the CG stands out too much, but here it's more subtle, used appropriately for the sleek and graceful movement of the trains.Sound: 5The opening and closing themes are fine.  The voice acting is all right, with good choices of voice actors for the various characters.  The rest of the sounds just mostly get out of the way and let you concentrate on the story, which is all I ask in a show like this.Characters: 6The characters are stereotypical, yet likable.  The core group consists of the quick-thinking and good-natured hero; the feisty and tough man-hater; the brilliant beauty; and the gung-ho, enthusiastic tough guy.Individually, they're not all that interesting.  Put them together, however, and you've got a team that can handle any problem, no matter how big.  Not only that, but they're fun to watch, though perhaps not as entertaining as in shows that are less adventurous and more humorous.Enjoyment: 6A fun watch, with some great adventurous moments mixed with just enough humor to keep it from getting melodramatic.  One thing irritates me, however.  The team doesn't often get due recognition for their deeds.  These guys deserve a dozen medals, a parade in their honor, and maybe a holiday named after them, but half the time they instead get a minor reprimand for not following protocol.  Whatever happened to thinking outside the box?Seriously, the one time they received a light punishment for their deeds, I tried my hardest to figure out what exactly they did to deserve it, but as far as I could tell, they not only did everything right, but saved a train full of passengers in the process.Overall: 6Worth watching, but not one you'll put at the top of your favorites list. this is really more a light adventure show, something akin to a police drama.  You don't even have to be a fan of trains to enjoy Rail Wars, as long as you understand what it is.I'll admit, it didn't grab me right from the beginning, but with every episode I watched, I found myself liking it more and more.Story: 7The show is about a team of interns in a railroad security force.  The majority of the episodes deal with the kinds of adventures you might expect, such as bomb threats, terrorists, runaway trains, even a couple of kidnappings.  Nothing particularly original, but again, if you know what to expect, you can enjoy it anyways.  It's fairly episodic.  There's the occasional 2-parter, but there really isn't much of a seasonal story arc.I have to score it an extra 2 points for the emergency run in Episodes 8 and 9.  It's like a cross between the movie Speed and the mine cart chase scene from Temple of Doom.  Great excitement and adventure here, and you really see the team shine as they work together to overcome every obstacle that gets in their way.My only complaint is that the last episode is anticlimactic.  After all the exciting and adventurous episodes preceding it, an episode where nothing happens isn't how I want the show to end.  Still, at least it doesn't leave it with an unsatisfying ending, or worse, a cliffhanger.Art: 6Pretty standard for modern anime.  As you might expect, the trains are CG, but fortunately they don't overdo it.  In too many shows like this, the CG stands out too much, but here it's more subtle, used appropriately for the sleek and graceful movement of the trains.Sound: 5The opening and closing themes are fine.  The voice acting is all right, with good choices of voice actors for the various characters.  The rest of the sounds just mostly get out of the way and let you concentrate on the story, which is all I ask in a show like this.Characters: 6The characters are stereotypical, yet likable.  The core group consists of the quick-thinking and good-natured hero; the feisty and tough man-hater; the brilliant beauty; and the gung-ho, enthusiastic tough guy.Individually, they're not all that interesting.  Put them together, however, and you've got a team that can handle any problem, no matter how big.  Not only that, but they're fun to watch, though perhaps not as entertaining as in shows that are less adventurous and more humorous.Enjoyment: 6A fun watch, with some great adventurous moments mixed with just enough humor to keep it from getting melodramatic.  One thing irritates me, however.  The team doesn't often get due recognition for their deeds.  These guys deserve a dozen medals, a parade in their honor, and maybe a holiday named after them, but half the time they instead get a minor reprimand for not following protocol.  Whatever happened to thinking outside the box?Seriously, the one time they received a light punishment for their deeds, I tried my hardest to figure out what exactly they did to deserve it, but as far as I could tell, they not only did everything right, but saved a train full of passengers in the process.Overall: 6Worth watching, but not one you'll put at the top of your favorites list."", 'When I first saw this show I thought it would be terrible, it looked very average and the reviews were terrible, but this show took me on a ride I didn\'t expect(pun intended). I\'ll be the first to admit that this show is rather average,I just wanted to write this review because I don\'t think it deserves all the hate these other reviews give it.First I\'d like to start with something I see a lot of in these reviews, the fact that is has no ""plot"". this  criticism I think for a TV/anime is stupid. An overarching plot is something that...not every show needs. look at shows like Avatar or cowboy bebop, these shows have entire parts where its in the style of ""episode of the week"" where every episode is its own disconnected story, and while they do connect to the overall story, these shows ran for longer than Rail, if they wanted to stay interesting they needed some kind of theme, Rail doesn\'t. Avatar does turn into a regular plot towards the middle and on but it worked for the start. And cowboy bebop stays with this until the final two episodes which you could argue that they are either the buildup of the series or just another disconnected adventure. A plot is not something that is as important as you would think. Each episode can hold on its own and in the case of Rail, they keep you interested and entertained.Second character development. Its seems that everyone thinks that this show has no charterer development, which if true, can be devastating to a show. Having the characters acting the same forever and making the same mistakes is very frustrating and if you\'ve seen older Shounen-jump you can probably relate.  But this show does have character development. Yeah its pretty bare bones but I\'m not arguing that this sow is amazing, I\'m just saying is not terrible and at least slightly above average. For example, Aoi at the beginning hates the MC, she thinks hes annoying and kinda a bitch, but by the end, she respects him, his choices and the person he is, as well as a little romantic interest. Now the rate of which this happens is a little fast and this show is plenty cliche with its romance so it\'s not perfect, but again, NOT TERRIBLE.  I give 5/10 Aoi\'s for being cute AF.Third, the soundtrack. Honestly didn\'t think it was that bad, It reminded me a lot of Death Note with that piano and kinda got me hype a bit at times, but nothing much really to say here. I give 6/10 piano-man\'s.Now I think what really matters in a show is how much you enjoy it. I try to stay unbiased and critical when It comes to media and criticizing it, but every now and then a show comes along that I just can help but fucking love. This show is one of those. for a show about trains it manages to keep me interested, terrified, laughing and horny all at once. I\'m not saying this show is secretly good but I just cant help but like this show, its manages to take TRAINS and make them HYPE as FUCK . Now MAL doesn\'t allow spoilers in their reviews but episodes 8 and 9 are awesome and actually somewhat innovative. Overall I give it 6/10 hype beast\'s.I hope I could help You understand my point of view with this show, I\'m more of a talker than a writer really and as always I am open to discussion.

Maybe it's just me who wants to see Naoto pursue his dream as a locomotive engineer, being a train enthusiast myself.If you...also want a bit of harem/ecchi element, give this a watch, although there isn't too much. also want a bit of harem/ecchi element, give this a watch, although there isn't too much."", 'Before reviewing this show, I want to go over the significance of the Japanese Railroad Transportation System to the lives of the Japanese. The train is the most commonly used means of transportation for commuting by Japanese students and company workers. In International comparison, the Japanese are generally heavy users of trains and public transportations. Train riders also tend to have the longest commute time. The survey also revealed that the Japanese spend more time commuting than either other East Asians, Europeans and North Americans. When comparing the happiness vs unhappiness of the different commuters, the train commuters are the only ones who have unhappiness...outweigh happiness regarding the way they are commuting. Finally, the survey reveals that a majority of train commuters find the trains to always be very crowded.The next thing I want to cover is the question: who cares about trains in Japan? Apart from otaku who focus on anime, Akihabara, and electronics, there are ""Densha otaku"" or ""train nerds."" There are currently 36 types of Densha otaku with interests ranging from walking around the station to the lunchboxes sold on the train. Another interesting fact brought up by the article is that there are female only carriages offered on the metro in many cities (keep this in mind for the review) to prevent gropers from having their way in packed trains.I am finally going to go over what I liked and disliked about this anime. Based on what I mentioned previously, the show has so much material to make a potentially interesting story. However, it never seems to use all these materials. The author of the light novel that this anime is adapted from actually has experience with writing children books with stories revolving around trains before writing light novels for young adults. The author, Takumi Toyoda, is now currently working on an animated show called ""Train Hero"" and still publishing more volumes of his Rail Wars light novel series (currently there are 16 volumes). I never read the light novel series and so don\'t know how much of the story and ideas were lost in adaptation. After watching this show, I am still unsure what demographic the show is trying to target. The show\'s main character, Naoto Takayama, is a character who is already a big train fan instead of a character who becomes a train fan as the story progresses. This will make it more difficult for people who never thought much about trains to get interested in the story when it revolves on the technical aspects of the train. This also leads me to think that the show is intended for the Densha otaku since there\'s never any analogies or animated diagrams to help explain the technical aspects; thus leaving an audience unfamiliar with the technicality hanging. However, there is also the harem aspect of the show where the harem ecchi moments seem to always fall in the middle of the technical aspects to pull in the sexual interests of the audience; almost making it seem that it is trying to hold the attention of the non-Densha otaku audience and increase its viewership. Don\'t watch this show from start to end with the expectation that you will become more knowledgeable about trains without looking through information outside of the show. Also, don\'t expect to be constantly entertained from start to end. The harem aspects always seem to ruin the flow of the show and take up too much valuable time that can be used for character and plot development with train knowledge impartment to non-Densha otaku. In the end, the only reason why I consider this show to be good is that it made me fascinated with the Japanese  Railway Transportation System and how it impacts the lives of the Japanese people in the real world. To me, the show wasn\'t totally a waste of time.Outside of review, this show poses an interesting challenge of developing a good story that blends train knowledge with advancing the plot while keeping the audience interested. I think the show can still be a Harem but with the harem-moments minimized or made subtle so that it doesn\'t affect the flow of the show and allow for more interesting ideas to be developed. Since Aoi Sakurai (one of the harem girls) is interested in punishing sexual harassers she can have a character arc leading to an interest in the female only carriages that I mentioned previously. Mari Sassho (Naoto\'s childhood friend and one of the harem girls) works as a train station waitress and so can have an arc revolving around the lunchboxes sold on the train. The show shouldn\'t have all the female main characters fall in love with the male main protagonist but instead should have at the most two females have subtle feelings for the character that only the audience can notice. The show should diversify the functionalities of the other characters so that most of their actions can teach the audience of the technicalities of the railway system as well as its influence on the commuters. The show should also include characters that are regular commuters and have no job function in the railway system to allow for the audience to relate to the characters with their experiences of being a train passenger.  Finally, Noata can still have fundamental knowledge and interest in trains and being an engineer but the story should allow these fundamentals to be developed. All of this may have been accounted for in the light novel, so I am now interested in reading it. outweigh happiness regarding the way they are commuting.

Its one part slice of life, one part high school drama, some mild police style action and all ecchi harem. The plot of each arc is basically the cast going on a train trip, something going wrong either by criminals or nature, and then the cast trying to resolve what ever is wrong with the train, all while dealing with which one of the females in the cast lust but not making a move on our main character, while accidentally following breast first into our main character's face. And oh yeah trivia about Japanese trains. Honestly...even while the show does have actions moment they are not really that exciting as you are pretty certain that the characters aren't going to fail. Not bad but also not really rememberable.Art: 5The art style is your run of the mill big eyed moe designs. The main character, Takayama, is your basic bland standard black haired blank slate harem protagonist.  Luckily the rest of the supporting cast have more unique designs. Where the art stands out in this show is the detail given to the trains which since this is a train based anime it should. Oh and you get your classic ecchi female fan service shots which are pretty tame.Sound: 6The voice acting is serviceable but nothing really stands out. The sound effects are pretty good but their is an episode that revolves around the sounds trains make but again I don't think their is enough amazing sound work to warrant it. The last episode (12) does have serious issue with matching the audio with the character's lips movements which is weird since it's an issue that isn't present in the rest of the series.Characters: 4Unfortunately the character while MOSTLY having unique designs are your common character tropes that border on being stereotypes. Like said earlier Takayama is your bland ecchi protagonist with his only unique trait is he likes trains. Then are your other common tropes of Sakuri being your Tsundere tomboy, Haruka being your moe princess type, and Iwaizumi being your muscle head who like to eat a lot. All their characters play their parts and don't seem to have any development outside of their determined tropes.Enjoyment: 5All in all there isn't much to make me love Rail Wars, but not a lot to make me dislike it either. The enjoyment I got out of this was the fact their was a train-based anime and I like trains.Overall: 5With 5s in Story, Art, and Enjoyment and a 6 in Sound, and 4 in Characters. This series averages out to a 5 for me. A bland anime with a concept that I feel could be better if it wasn't blended with ecchi harem genre.

This series averages out to a 5 for me. A bland anime with a concept that I feel could be better if it wasn't blended with ecchi harem genre.

The second guy, the guy not looked at, the guy surrounded by more and more girls that show him no interest whatsoever. This guy has it hard and is going to suffer from this harem disguising itself as a rail anime.The rail side is always there but honestly, it's just a side feature for a load of thirsty girls doting on a guy who shows his vulnerabilities.The show also seems to make this guy a high school graduate who wants to be a driver the most unlucky guy ever to exist...and must cost them money whilst also being somehow so knowledgeable people with huge experience, qualified engineers and such know nothing against this guy.The art looks good for its age and it sounds fine.Characters have some personality outside of being constantly thirsty but they are full of holes.

I highlight ""progress"" because the show has no direction so it doesn\'t technically progress anywhere except through time itself.First off let me just say that the art is superb. It\'s not an ugly anime by any stretch of the imagination, but unfortunately that is this shows only redeeming feature. I continued to watch the show primarily because I was labouring (and it was something of a labour to watch this) under...the impression that a show that is this unique that is also this pretty must have something behind it. That was a misnomer.The show is a service to/for train watcher\'s, as well as Japan\'s world famous national rail system overall, it\'s also an action quasi-police/detective show, but it\'s also got an underlying harem plot, it has characters with cookie cutter backgrounds and traits that it tries to make life-like with half-baked incomplete back stories which it stops elaborating on half way through to force some ecchi down your throat. It\'s an absolute cluster-fuck of ideas all of which all fall short or make absolutely no sense contextually. Why are we suddenly seeing full blown oppai complete with uncensored nipples over and over again by episode 10? I don\'t know, I thought this was a show about trains; and yet here we are.The show *tries* with a narrative, we follow some recruits trying to find employment within the national rail service system. Each character has a different goal in mind, one wants to be security, another a driver, one is just following the protagonist as a child hood love interest and another is a child-hood friend working in the system as a waitress (even though she\'s quite clearly got a career as a sound engineer). By the end of the show we have 4 trainees with a couple weeks experience under their belt helping old ladies find their way through train stations escorting royalty which are being hunted by assassins. At this point you have to wonder whether the show was really developed for the memes. Because it\'s completely off-the-rails.It\'s a certifiable train wreck.Do you see it? Do you see what I did there?*sigh* Someone help me. the impression that a show that is this unique that is also this pretty must have something behind it.

I watched this in Jan 2024.I saw the Gigguk Rail Wars abridged parody at the time (the one with the Keyori rap, 2014 I think?). I was convinced by that to not watch it.I have, in the subsequent ten years, finally become the spectrum train enthusiast that I apparently was always meant to be. Yes I failed out of engineering and graduated with another technical degree, how could you tell?My love for tomboys and spectrum women that know what they want and have the eerie ability to memorize facts about obscure engineering things has not changed.Yes, this has fanservice and titty groping/accidental...motorboating and there's an episode where the stereotypical housewife girlfriend route literally gets shoulder charged and her shirt rips off.  No, it doesn't make much sense.^ Congratulations, that's my short summary of this show. ^I am not a train expert, but I know enough about regenerative braking, electroresistive braking, cog systems for getting up hills, mechanical linkage vs airbrakes, gas turbines vs pure diesels vs electrics, etc. and I didn't have any obvious problems with the episodes. The train physics _largely_ makes sense, although the tunnel+organ transplant episodes were massively exaggerated for entertainment, but their speed was artificially high anyway.The harem trope is overdone IMO, and nobody gets laid or killed in this show, so you can tell it was made before 2015's era of Slime/Overlord/etc. where bad guys actually start dying. Yes, it's based on a light novel, no I don't read light novels, and the animation studio definitely took liberties with some of the physics, the girls, the situations, etc. but it's basically danmachi+highschool of the dead levels of fanservice.I was going to give this a 7, until there's a fix for an AC unit by replacing the fan belt with a stocking temporarily and keeping a breaker closed with chopsticks. I've listened to 10+ years of Car Talk and I can tell you that those temporary fixes actually work.Here's my grading rubric for this show:6/10 for animation execution - besides some screwups with variable chest size, some faces not being right, Haruka's child hair going from brown to pink to brown to pink to brown in the cat tuna confined to their house episode, it's fine.7/10 for tomboys, trains and physics/engineering knowledge being important to the plot, character and tone of the show8/10 for replacing the AC fan belt with a stocking and actually giving a crap about trains motorboating and there's an episode where the stereotypical housewife girlfriend route literally gets shoulder charged and her shirt rips off.

It was fun to watch an anime following the perspective of a train otaku, lol.All in all, not much to say about Rail Wars! I'm glad it was short because it was kind of boring to watch, despite it having 12 episodes. I finished this anime in 4 days, 3 episodes each because I'm not really fond of an action-based anime with no real storyline, and I'm not really a huge fan of fanservice, but if you are, there are plenty of them on each episode. The fanservice on...this anime really stole the spotlight, but the protagonist's mindset is something that you can respect and learn from; the act of selflessness, an element of shounen which the MC should have. I enjoyed watching this when I was younger, not too much now though.6.2/10 this anime really stole the spotlight, but the protagonist's mindset is something that you can respect and learn from; the act of selflessness, an element of shounen which the MC should have.

Let me give an example... A breaker keeps tripping in one of the episodes so there solution is to hold it in the on position... WHAT!!! Do they not know how a breaker works? And if you don't, holding the breaker in the on position will do nothing, the breaker will still trip even though its stuck in the on position. This is constant, you will face palm at least 5 times an episode with the...flat out ignorance displayed by all the characters. But i digress, I know some people don,t mind this kind of thing so hopefully they can enjoy the show for what it is, which is an ecchi harem. flat out ignorance displayed by all the characters.

Samurai Giants,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9916/Samurai_Giants,"[""Samurai Giants: The show featuring Nagahama Tadao fresh off Kyojin no Hoshi leading a staff roll that could make any one's mouth water with expectation including Ishiguro Noboru, Osamu Dezaki, Yoshiyuki Tomino, and a young Hayao Miyazaki on deck, theres no end to what a viewer could expect, and never once did Samurai Giants ever disappoint.Its worth mentioning here before i delve into the content how I even ended up watching some random baseball anime from the early 70's with less than 200 completed members in the first place.  The truth is, I had been recommended Touch by some friends, and I...decided that it would be worth understanding the tropes of baseball anime which Adachi's work would play off of, and Samurai Giants is the first major production following the towering Kyojin no Hoshi.Looking at Samurai Giants from the surface, it seems exactly what you might expect from a show attempting to live in the shadow of a trend setter baseball show about a star pitcher, following its own pitcher: Banba Ban.  Banba is introduced as a reckless and emotional highschooler known to throw punches first and pitch so wildly his batting opponents cant help but shiver in their boots.  Banba is a man who hates bullies, and this sets the stage for his incredible character arc to maturation as a person, a player, and a pitcher.A show about a pitcher is always going to focus on the pitch itself, and Samurai Giant's take on the pitching mind game is to pit the most creative monsters against each other.  Each of Banba's takes on ways to throw a ball to psych out the sharpest batters out there is unique and entertaining and each plays well to Banba's wild nature, while all of his rivals never shy away from his insanity.  From a trope perspective, Samurai Giant's path to live in Kyojin no Hoshi's shadow is through Banba's wild pitching, and the growth of Banba as a player along the way.Visually, man, this show looks great.  Even ignoring the remaster quality increase, this show uses constantly engaging frame composition and a color palette that never fails to say something about the scene.  The staff never seems to shy away from using what ever color suits the moment and that works as a strength all the way.  The OP and ED's are largely made of clips from the show but the music performance is endlessly catchy.At the end of the day, Ive found yet another untranslated show the wider western anime audience is missing out on and I hope to see this show get the fan release it honestly deserves. decided that it would be worth understanding the tropes of baseball anime which Adachi's work would play off of, and Samurai Giants is the first major production following the towering Kyojin no Hoshi.Looking at Samurai Giants from the surface, it seems exactly what you might expect from a show attempting to live in the shadow of a trend setter baseball show about a star pitcher, following its own pitcher: Banba Ban.

This is because it is my favorite studio and I am crazy enough to see it all.Second point to highlight, since this work is not so accessible, I ended up watching it without subtitles, which is why this review is based on my mere interpretation, since I do not have any understanding of the dialogues.Regarding the anime, it\'s nice to know that the beginning of this journey is...a spokon. The idea of \u200b\u200bseeing a spokon made it easier to start this journey, and everything was easy until it started. The plot focuses on a boy who is a baseball player on his high school team, he is a good hitter but as a pitcher he lacks complete control. He is recruited by a professional team and the story develops from that point.It has several positive points, starting with the mention of concepts that are still valid in current baseball spokon. Concepts such as the three-dimensional strike zone were already used at this time, which shows that the work has a great understanding of the sport. Another point is that the characters, both the protagonist and the rivals, used their daily life experiences to improve their pitches or their swings when hitting. An example of this would be the protagonist using his experience as a fisherman to invent pitches with different heights simulating that he is standing on the same waves of the sea.The negative is that although he has a good understanding of the sport, he does not show complete games or let the other members of the team show off. Everything is focused on the protagonist and the matches are reduced to a mere inning so that the protagonist can show off. The work has a big loop that makes its protagonist look a little tantrum. This loop consists of the protagonist developing a new pitch, the batter cannot hit the ball, at the end of the game the rival batter goes and trains in a barbaric way and in the next game he manages to hit the protagonist\'s magic ball, which generates He becomes depressed and retires (in the middle of the game) to try to invent a new pitch since the last one is of no use to him because it was already hit. Instead of increasing his repertoire of pitches, he tried to be a One Trick Pony with a difficult pitch to hit.This refers to the sports issue, because history also has its flaws. You don\'t need subtitles to understand that the actions of this anime bordered on criminality. It is incredible how many ways they could find to seriously injure a minor in an official match. It is noted that in the 70\'s they did not know the concept of ""Security"".In conclusion, although we are looking at one of those historical animes, since it was one of the firsts spokon anime in history, it is not worth visiting. Finding it with subtitles in the Roman alphabet is already a challenge, and seeing it without subtitles is crazy. Please love yourselves and don\'t be like me. a spokon.

There's some new girl introduced but I didn't see the relevance at all maybe she would have been the...2nd protagonist for story development  but no.Like I really don't get it, they become friends and i thought there would be a deeper story for her and a boy she's interested in. There's a lot that happens but theres no closure for any of it.It's a coming of age movie but with a lot  random plot holes missing in the story. If those holes weren't there I would give this a 10. Also you would know which holes I'm talking about if you watch the movie.Art: 9/10I literally love love the art. I hate tacky anime with rainbow colored hair and like the cutesy type animation for example like mayo chiki. it's very basic art with black hair and brown eyes. It gives off a studio ghibli vibe. people might think I'm crazy but I prefer an old art style looking animation than modern looking animesound: 7/10It was okay nothing outstandingthere was cliche music you hear every movie like this so there nothing worthy to mention.ALSO this is a KOREAN animated movie it might feel strange at first hearing a language you're not used to listening all the time but you get used to it.Enjoyment: 8/10it was a cute movie to watch especially shipping the main and her love interest and learning more about her and seeing her grow as a person.overall 8/10I didn't like the holes as i mentioned before but I mostly think this was a good moviei recommend this if you want to watching something a little different 2nd protagonist for story development  but no.Like I really don't get it, they become friends and i thought there would be a deeper story for her and a boy she's interested in.

You will probably like this if you enjoy the more subdued Ghibli films, such as Only Yesterday and especially Ocean Waves, as this film has some similar motifs to that one (I won\'t say which, both so as not to spoil Ocean Waves for anyone who hasn\'t seen it, and also to let those who have seen it go through the fun of spotting the similar motifs themselves). The art style is definitely Ghibli inspired too, and I really liked it. I watched it because I wanted to experience some Korean animation, and it\'s set in...1970\'s South Korea, a period I\'m interested in (the era of economic growth and the Park Chung-hee regime), and I was glad they showed some cultural aspects of that era too. Overall, this film is cute and comfy, but don\'t get me wrong, it\'s not simply junk food—it has some fine emotional depth and the main characters are good. If you\'re into fiction that explores the ""extraordinary in the ordinary"" like me, definitely check it out. 1970\'s South Korea, a period I\'m interested in (the era of economic growth and the Park Chung-hee regime), and I was glad they showed some cultural aspects of that era too.

This is especially important for conveying the atmosphere of a small Korean town of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The backgrounds are very detailed - right down to the cracks in the old wood frames, peeling plaster and stains on the walls. The visual baton is complemented by sound - Korean music of the late 1970s (I guess the ballad ""Blue Days"" performed by Kim Man Su), picked up by references to films popular with Korean teenage girls of those times (snotty ""Love Story"" for the...rustic main character and aesthetically decadent ""Elvira Madigan"" for her vainly pompous beauty friend) and series featuring pop references like Linda Carter`s Wonder Woman`s spin-transformation. The narration, in its pursuit of realism, echoes the art - the film is full of everyday mini-scenes, reviving the era of South Korea, when it was just on the verge of its technological ascension. Authors of this ascension are depicted as a friend of the heroine and his uncle - enthusiastic techies stubbornly moving towards their goal (""...there are no special mountains under the sky. Any one can be conquered, climbing step by step""). The heroine herself, reciting this verse, does not believe in it and is in search of herself, striving to find a place in life where she can leave her mark (like that imaginary dinosaur to which the name deceptively refers). She prefers Robert Frost - she stepped on ""The Road Not Taken"", with its eternal doubts, regrets about any choice and missed opportunities. The ""idea"" of the film is reminiscent of Kondo Yoshifumi`s ""Whisper of the Heart"" (there is even a reference to gems that can be found in the rock), but the narrative itself is as prosaic as possible and devoid of fairy-tale elements, however filled with a variety of cultural references and an immersive retro atmosphere that is hardly whether the cinema could achieve. rustic main character and aesthetically decadent ""Elvira Madigan"" for her vainly pompous beauty friend) and series featuring pop references like Linda Carter`s Wonder Woman`s spin-transformation.

Sasurai no Taiyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3819/Sasurai_no_Taiyou,"['Comparing with the recent anime trends, which is flooded with anime witb average, unhappy or frustrated protagonists that gets teleported to worlds where their discontents are magically solved and life suddenly is exciting, anime/manga from the 70\'s often feature protagonists that come from below (often poverty) and that have to face and overcome critical adversities by themselves. They usually show an inspiring strength to endure the often exceedingly unfair and blood-boiling situations they are put into, and sincere courage to face difficulties. You see such examples in anime like Ashita no Joe, Attack No.1 and Candy Candy.Sasurai no Taiyou follows this trend as well, featuring...the tale of a girl who, being switched from her rich birth family as a baby, ends up living in a very poor house, and the story develops between her dream to become a songstress and the many hardships she faces in her life, which more often than not comes from her plain lack of money. Her ""rival"", and antagonist, Miki, who is the other switched baby, often uses her family\'s wealth and influence to bribe her way into success, while Nozomi has to face every sort of realistic difficulty.This is an anime that develops a quite grounded story, with most events being authentic and engaging. While the focus is on Nozomi\'s late-teen professional, family and romantic life, there\'s also, in parallel, the underlying plot of the babies having been switched at birth, which you know was the secret scheme of a nurse that sometimes appears and influences the episodes - but this story stays unsolved and it keeps you in anticipation of its eventual resolution throughout the anime. And, of course, add to all of this a bit of a musical subplot, being Nozomi a songstress-to-be.If you liked any of the other 70\'s anime I mentioned before, it\'s very likely you will like this one as well. You\'ll see many similarities here and there. I recommend giving this anime a chance if you like any of the themes I mentioned, or a different type of main character and story that\'s becoming more unusual by the day. the tale of a girl who, being switched from her rich birth family as a baby, ends up living in a very poor house, and the story develops between her dream to become a songstress and the many hardships she faces in her life, which more often than not comes from her plain lack of money.

What do we have here? Another obscure anime show from 1971 by Mushi Production. The same people that brought us many of Ozamu Tezuka\'s anime adaptations and Ashita No Joe?Why yes it is! Sasurai No Taiyou (Also known as Wandering Sun) is an anime show released in the early 70s made by Mushi Production. It\'s based off the manga of the same name by Keisuke Fujikawa, who was also involved in the anime industry as he worked on multiple anime shows in the 70s such as Mazinger Z and Cutey Honey.Like before, there\'s not much is known about this anime outside of...japan since not that many people talk about this.So what could this anime be all about? Let\'s find out:First off, the story is the most interesting and the best part of the anime:It tells the story of two girls named ""Nozomi"" and ""Miki"" who were born from two different families. One is a rich family and the other is a very poor one who lived in the slums of the city. However, one individual by the name of ""Michiko Nohara"" secretly switched the two babies from each family due to a very personal grudge.17 years later, Nozomi, now being transfered to the same school as Miki, finally met each others without noticing that they were switched from each of their families. Miki would treat her like crap due to coming from a very poor family and of course being a rich girl she is, while Nozomi tries to get to know better with her without holding any grudge againts her.And yet the one thing that both girls share is a dream to become a singer. So while Miki would do anything she can to become a very popular singer just to make Nozomi miserable, Nozomi would strive and do anything she can to become a singer. Going from bars, to taking a tour and helping others in needs.It\'s a story of hardships and tribulations of both girls striving to become a singer while not knowing the fact that they were switched from each family by one individual.And man, this story is very interesting! What i love about this story is that not only it tells a very interesting story and episodes of where theses girls trying to become singers, but also highlighting the darkside of the music industry and how becoming a singer is not as glamorous as it sounds.You get to see how Nozomi would be treated when she\'s involved in many situations. Whether it would be singing in any bars, working at a composer\'s house to get to learn to be a singer, going to tours without the composer\'s permission and among others.As the series goes on, things gets pretty dark and serious when awful things happens to Nozomi. Whether it would be her Father\'s serious injuries that he got from the Yakuza or how Fanny tries to hide her from his true identity.As it goes on, the story starts to get pretty serious and sad as noticed in many episodes.The same thing can be said about the characters themselves. You got two main characters of the show, Nozomi Mine and Miki Koda.Nozomi is a character that i truly admire. Despite coming from a poor family and despite being treated like crap by Miki and despite having many blocks that she has to get through, she does anything she can to become a singer, without giving up on it. From her personality to her looks and the history surrounding her, she\'s the one who stands out from the others in this anime.Miki on the other hand, serve as Nozomi\'s rival. She\'s the reason why Nozomi tries to be careful with her since Miki is not the type of character who would be expected to be nice to others. She always bickers at her and treat her like garbage to the point of doing anything she can to ruin her life and carreer.Both theses two characters are the reason that drive the story to continue to get interesting as it shows a huge rivalry between theses two in a way that it can get quite shocking and interesting as well.As for the rest of the characters, you have some that serve a purpouse to the story. Such as Fanni/Hisashi who would try to hide his identity from Nozomi about who he really is outside of being a friend to her. And also, you have Isao Egawa, the composer, who at first he only cares about Miki since he takes music lessons with her, but does deeply care about Nozomi\'s carreer as a singer.While others like Nozomi\'s uncle, Kumagoro, would serve as a supporting character who would do anything he can to help out Nozomi whenever she needs it.Each characters are also very interesting and also another factor why the story is great.The sound is good, too. You have many great musical scores and songs that are played through out the show. Kokoro no Uta is another beautiful song that was worth hearing it multiple times.Same thing the voice acting, they are great and do give life to the characters\' voices. This includes the singer Junko Fujiyama as the voice of Nozomi. Who despite sounding pretty old for a very young character, does a nice job portraying the character the way it wants to be.But not all things comes off as great. There are a few flaws that can get pretty distracting.First off, you have the sound effects. Now, i get what they are trying to do with the sound effects. They are trying to give more life and suspense to certain scenes to make it stand out from what it wants to show. But i feel that there are some minor scenes that don\'t even need the sound effects to be played out all the time. Like for example, when someone finds out something fishy about a certain thing.But by far, the biggest problem with this show is of course the animation itself.*Sigh* Now, don\'t get me wrong, there\'s nothing wrong with Nozomi and some other characters\' designs. They look fine as they are. But for some reason, the budget for the animation is waaaaaay too limited. And as a result, you\'re gonna get a few moments where the animation starts to act weird on it\'s own. Like when there\'s an extreme close up to Kumagoro, or how the camera shakes for no apparent reason, or how some of the people\'s character designs look very ugly and weird even by 70s standards.Of course i know that i should not expect anything marvelous about the animation since it was made in 1971. The budget is very limited and the technology just isn\'t that advanced. But they could, however, take some time to fix them. But instead, it feels very rushed and mediocre that i couldn\'t give this anime as much higher rating than it deserved.But yeah, even with thoses two issues i had with this anime while having an experience with it, overall, i loved the anime.The story is outstanding, the characters are great, the sound is great (Although mishandled) and the music is absolutely great as well.And for a anime that tackles on the Music industry for the first time in history, it was a nice piece of history to learn about it. I think this might be the first one to do so. Which would later become a plot point for many music animes like Creamy Mami, Wake Up, Girls! and Love Live!.It\'s also worth noting that the storyboard for this anime is done by Yoshiyuki Tomino. The man behind Mobile Suit Gundam and many other mecha shows that came after it. So it\'s very interesting to see how this anime turned out to be and it\'s almost great.So, it\'s not an perfect score to get, but i will give it an 8 out of 10. Aside from the mediocre animation and some weird uses of sound effects, i had a great time watching this one as well.The anime\'s already subbed by OldCastle fansubs. So i\'d say you\'ll just have to torrent or watch it somewhere that has the subs for Sasurai No Taiyou like Gogoanime.But yeah, give this anime a shot. It\'s a wonderful and tragic show that i will not forget until the end of time.Anyway, that\'s my review of Sasurai No Taiyou (Or Wandering Sun as it\'s called). I\'m José Diogo and i\'ll see you on the other side. ^^ japan since not that many people talk about this.So what could this anime be all about?

Soukou Kihei Votoms: Case;Irvine,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8248/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms__Case_Irvine,"[""Case;Irvine is a stand-alone spinoff from the mainline Votoms storyline, being one of the only entries in the franchise that truly has a self-contained plot. But is it any good?The story of Case;Irvine is fairly simple and straightforward, drawing on several facets of the known Votoms world like the recent war, barely underground arena battling, and the acid rain seen in Woodo. There's not exactly enough time to tell a truly original or groundbreaking story, but a lot of background explanation can be skipped because the viewer is likely aware of the setting. This allows just enough time for the characters and arcs to work,...even if there's a lack of depth or real originality.Where Case;Irvine shines is in it's surprising animation. The votoms franchise swapped to CGI mechs in 2007's pailsen files with pretty bad results, though later entries were more acceptable. Case;Irvine goes back to regularly animated mechs with pretty decent results, giving us some of the best AT action in the entire franchise, even if the scale and duration remain limited. I don't know why this entry got special treatment, but i'm happy the AT action got at least one good non-CGI representation in the modern era.Overall Case;Irvine is a short story that'll work for fans of the franchise, but it doesn't offer much else. Released shortly before Votoms Finder it appears as though the creators were trying to find out if a full spinoff was possible, but Case;Irvine will likely go down in history as an expected but decent entry in a very weird franchise. even if there's a lack of depth or real originality.Where Case;Irvine shines is in it's surprising animation.

On one hand it really made the fanservice shine, on the other hand it draws out the comedy scenesThe comedy in this anime was reeeally great too. Can't count how many times I laughed in this show.As it's a collection of short stories in short episodes this anime doesn't have that much story and the characters also just feel like an element for the show. There is some slight character development tho but most of the time they have their personality and stick to it.There's also one character...that's highlighted pretty much in op and ed but didn't get much screen time at all, which is a bit disappointing.Overall it's a great show you'll definitely enjoy watching and as it's not that long too you can watch it anytime I think that's highlighted pretty much in op and ed but didn't get much screen time at all, which is a bit disappointing.Overall it's a great show you'll definitely enjoy watching and as it's not that long too you can watch it anytime I think"", ""Before I watched the first episode of Tenjina Senpai (Magical Sempai), a little voice told me it would be a very comical experience. From the character interactions and premise itself, this show felt like one that was based off of memes and satirical humor. Is Magical Sempai really a meme or something much deeper than meets the eye?With 12 half length episodes, Magical Sempai runs a trend of adapting storytelling in the form of humorous skits. Every episode contains various segments that connects the overall themes of the show. At the heart is the Magic Club, run by titular character Sempai. Joining him is a...young boy going by the name “Assistant”. Make no mistake, it seems that the author didn’t really want to identify our main leads by actual names. However, that’s not a significant problem. What you should be concerned about is how an anime about magic performances can be translated into entertainment.For starters, you should never take this anime seriously as the show itself seems to be very self-aware. The first episode deals with the activities of the Magic Club. To be fair, Sempai is actually skilled but when faced with an audience, she suffers from stage fright and ends up embarrassing herself. There’s an immense amount of jokes that pokes fun of her stage fright at every chance it gets. These usually ends up with various innuendos and adult humor. Ecchi is a common sight as there’s panty shots in almost every episode. Sempai gets tied up often by her own performances and becomes a main source of fan service. Hell, it seems the anime even loves to put Sempai in sexy outfits ranging from gym clothes to Chinese dresses. If you came for fan service, you're going to be pleased.Despite being the main characters, we do meet a few others ranging from Sister (the Magic Club advisor), Madara-chan (Chemistry club president), Saki-chan and her overweight brother, Masashi. Their purpose in the show is mostly to amplify the comedy with their various personalities. Most of them somehow gets involved in one way or another with the Magic Club. Saki-chan is also a target for fan service once you see how much she is advertised. With this ridiculous cast of characters, you really should just sit back and watch this with an bucket of popcorn. We’re not going to see much character development. The anime’s goal is to entertain in the most straightforward way possible. It uses its skits that focuses on daily activities at school, mostly associated with the Magic Club.I’m not a big fan of magic although this show actually focuses some of its screen time to explain the various tricks and performances. Most of this is explained by Sempai in a casual style while inserting its gimmicky humor. There’s actually a decent amount of magic performances such as card tricks, spoon-bending techniques, the box illusion, pulling pigeons out of hats, etc. If you’re familiar with magic, you’ve probably heard or seen most of them before. When translated into this anime, it becomes more of a meme with how silly it turns out to be.It’s not a full length anime but having a show like this is no less than some popcorn entertainment. Every episode contains enough skits to entertain while poking fun of the characters’ personalities. Sempai is the poster girl who also becomes the main source of jokes in the show. Whether you like her character isn’t all that important. In essence, you’re going to just have to take what Magical Sempai throws at you.

If you enjoy shows that aren\'t serious and you don\'t mind cheap jokes and forced ecchi-ness, then this anime might be for you.Sempai is a magician wannabe who fails at every trick she attempts. Each failure results in embarrassment with erotic innuendos. The jokes are lowbrow. Even Assistant-kun\'s reactions show the same sentiments within the show; no one tries to mask the cheapness of it all. There are parts of this show that made me laugh and I very much wanted to like it a lot, (especially because I really enjoyed Aho Girl), but alas, the...humour and characters both miss the mark.Given that the episodes are short (about 12 mins), it\'s an easy watch to pass time. Actually, each episode is further divided into parts, which appeals to my short attention span. Each ""story"" is around 4 minutes, so this is a show to have on hand when you don\'t have long lengths of time to spare.Takeaway: An anime to watch when you need a short comic break.

The animation is nice...to look at and occasionally can be a little pretty. The music is just kinda goofy.

I don\'t understand how this anime got even remotely positive reviews when there are actually fun ecchi anime out there like Monster Musume.Literally every joke is the same, I\'m not exaggerating. Senpai tries a magic trick, senpai fails and gets into a lewd situation. That\'s the entire anime....There is no overall narrative, nor is there any reason to watch this over better things.

Fair criticism of Tejina-senpai must come in how the fanservice is actually being delivered and, to a degree of lesser importance, whether or not the comedy is effective. It is there that I take issue with this anime’s lukewarm at best approach to eroticism and a repetitive punchline that wears itself thin as the episodes progress.The gist of Tejina-senpai is that Tejina has a sexy body that through failed magical acts is exposed to the gaze of the viewer. But this anime goes out of it’s way to ensure that the...entirety of Tejina's body is censored. There is always a random object magically obstructing nudity and even at one point milktoast MC kun’s hand excitedly waving over her chest to ensure the viewer cannot see. This may seem like a pedantic criticism only uttered by degenerates of the highest order, of which I am one, but if you are watching this anime primarily for the fanservice it can feel like a slap in the face to be teased with the full picture only to get a snapshot and wonder about the possibilities. Sometimes censorship can be forgiven with a distinct artstyle that is well defined enough to encourage the viewer to use their own creative imagination, but the artstyle of this anime is very generic, far from that of Dagashi Karashi where the designs of the characters are utterly gorgeous even without ever being exposed. Such is not the case in Tejina senpai where the attractiveness of the characters is limited to the proportion of their bodies. Censorship may also be forgiven if the fanservice is delivered in creative ways and the characters engage in some form of intimacy - Kiss x Sis would be the pinnacle of this. Tejina senpai obviously doesn't deliver in that way.Just as damning as the censorship is the fanservice rarely being animated. We are often given vertical panning still shots of characters in a variety of skimpy costumes that are no different from what can be found on deviantart. I mean I can scroll up and down on a downloaded artwork and get the same effect. A huge part of the appeal of watching fanservice in anime as opposed to a comic is that we can see these drawings come to life. Tejina senpai fails to follow through with the added oomph that ecchi anime should promise.To say the males are underwhelming is an understatement. The main guy whose name I don't care about looks like the most average of average joes and his best friend is obese. I understand that the point of having average guys being surrounded by attractive women is to sympathize with the viewer, but this is to the sacrifice of those who prefer their ecchi narratives to have guys with some defining feature other than niceness to make their harem feel somewhat realistic.I’ve seen some commenters compare the comedy in this anime to Konosuba, primarily due to the commonality of a failed magician who thinks they're better than they actually are and the strong fanservice. The obvious difference is that Konosuba functions as a parody of rpg gaming and isekai narratives that are all the rage in seasonal anime today, whereas the only basis for the jokes in Tejina senpai is to set up the fanservice. We are privy to the same gags that harp on the same punchline over and over again that you either laugh at or not with no need to think about how they were constructed. Though it can be unfair to compare a short to a fully supported TV series, the difference in between how the two execute their comedy is still relevant.It is not imperative for an ecchi show to have nudity. and it's not that important for an ecchi show to even be funny. But you better bring the heat in terms of fanservice if literally everything else is lacking and Tejina senpai just doesn't do that enough to satiate the degenerate consumer of all things ecchi. What could have been something great that improves upon the source material, like an anime should purport to do, instead is a run of the mil ecchi that can be found pretty much everywhere on a dartboard of the genre. entirety of Tejina's body is censored.

In the west, this type of series is good for memes and trashing on and that's about it. In Japan, this anime is actually extremely popular and is really the type of stuff that many otaku are into. It's ecchi, it's silly, it's an overall good time. Will you get some really deep and substantive plot that you need to tune in each week to learn more about? No. And if you are looking for that, you're in the wrong place. Tejina senpai is...a good way to wind down and relax on a Wednesday morning/Tuesday night and to get some good dirty laughs. The series has tonnes of Ecchi moments involving Senpai and the guy MC and that's what makes it such a big draw in Japan. Sexually repressed society + Ecchi anime, match made in heaven.As for the review breakdown:Art:10, really love the characters designs and proportions ;)Sound: it's a SOL so no real test to this, but everything is nice and clear.Character: I love the MC and Senpai's interactions as well as the chem club leader who reminds me of the third wheel from Senko SanEnjoyment:10, again, this is not for everyone, but for me, if I enjoy a show, it's an easy 9 or 10 and since I really enjoy and consistently watch the series, this gets a 10.Overall: If you like ecchi humour, fanservice, big anime tiddies and a good laugh, this is for you. If you are too uptight and not into that type of stuff, you won't enjoy this.

I really liked it.The series is chock full of ecchi comedy as one would expect. The side characters are all interesting as well and are also interesting to watch on their own as well. The assistant is definitely the best character for me tho, the dude is hilarious as the straightman.I know this anime isn't meant to be taken seriously, but I wish they would have dug a bit deeper into Tejina's character. She's hilarious and has a goofy personality, but honestly I wish they showed her in some serious scenes at least. It does feel like a...facade that she puts up so it would have been interesting to see what goes on behind the scenes in her mind.They show her as being this alone girl in school that has no friends, but never explored it in any meaningful way. This seems to be a recurring theme in this anime too. Madara's character is never explored either. This show is full of potential to be honest.However most of the potential seems to be lost to make space for the ecchi. Don't get me wrong, the ecchi fan service is fucking FANTASTIC. But I somehow got used to it overtime. The chemistry between that of Tejiwara and the Assistant works really well however only because of the ecchi component.As per the character design, I'm not a fan of the insanely mega sized body type myself, but I'd be lying if I said I hated it. The assistant looks pretty dull and boring, but makes up for it with his personality for sure.One peculiar detail that I wasn't able to get over was Tejina's eyes. I appreciate the different looking design, but I felt it looks a bit off and as a result, I feel like she wasn't able to express that much expression with them. This is some SUPER nitpicky shit, but I liked the different style of eye drawing in this, so I wish they did it a bit better.The intro is very nice and fun to watch too. Really good music too. It's a bop to listen to.Overall, I really wanted more from this anime. I love what I got sure, but I wish they'd explored the characters more. Tejina is a great character and I can't help but root for her too. The series is filled with really good ecchi moments too that are definitely worth a re-watch too.

Ecchi, genuine magic tricks, some pretty amusing ‘inversions of expectations’ for the sake of comedy... it was all really quite fun; and, unlike most 12 minute/“half-time” shows, the whole ‘4-coma’ pseudo-presentation really suited the show.I honestly didn’t regret watching a single episode. Amazing show. ... Hard to rate, though. ... I mean, ‘for what it is, it’s beyond my expectations’—but I didn’t expect much from it to begin with, ya know? Well... I think that kind of “Expectation-Setup” is part of a show’s foundation, so even if “less effort” was...put into the whole Product, the delivery of ‘that expectation’ was easily a 7/10, if I’m being objective (I’m giving it 8/10 because it delivered on exactly what it suggested from the very start, and it never diverged from that or “under delivered” - I mean, even if the ‘complete package’ isn’t any kind of Masterpiece, Tejina-Senpai was VERY CLEAR about what it was “gunning for” from the very start—in that sense, it went well and beyond what it was prefacing and expecting itself to be. Honestly, that doesn’t happen often, does it?...Our standards may usually be higher for most ‘general’ shows in anime, but... we are often disappointed, right? So then, if a show gives us a ‘projection’ of exactly what it intends to deliver, ... does it matter that the standard is ‘lower than the norm’? I mean, be realistic with me for a second: most projects don’t have the cash or sponsorship (or, heck, the time... sadly) to make a Masterpiece; and most that try just fail due to time-restraints or Politics (just look at this season’s Assassins Pride...), or just ‘underestimating the work involved to synergies multiple teams of people together unto a single project involving many unaffiliated parties’, etc. It’s a big focal point for the community every season, because we all so-desperately want the best for our “Holy Medium” that we are emotionally invested in the outcomes of each and every show that “we believe in” every season.Tejina-Senpai isn’t a masterpiece. Tejina-Senpai isn’t even a ‘classic’—however, Tejina-Senpai perfectly delivers on exactly:-What the studio proclaimed-What the script-writing suggested-What the animation delivered-What the “magic tricks and procedures” delivers-and, (what the voice actors delivered, plus) What the sponsors and investors, as well as directors and other politically-significant staff (cough Assassins Pride project-disaster) manages to ‘mutually negotiate’.Many things went exceptionally well with the production of Tejina-Senpai, and it’s incredible that everything went soooo perfectly!

As an ecchi, the main jokes revolve around Sempai finding herself in compromising positions such as getting tied up; having her clothes get damaged; or in one instance, forgetting to bring clothes to dress into as part of one of her street performances. That kind of humor gets really old because of how predicatble it can be. Going onto animation, it's average. Honestly because of the many pantyshots and boob bouncing, it almost becomes bland as it happens in nearly every episode.The opening and ending themes are decent as is the voice acting. There is a small number...of characters in the series with each varying in terms of how they are played. The Assistant is generic and mostly serves as the stand-in for the audience observing Sempai's misadventures. He is the straight man of the relationship, but at the same time, I found myself slightly disliking him because of the fact that he makes it clear often that he is largely interested in Sempai for her breasts and her other attributes. The sixth episode in particular has him take advantage of hypnotism to get Sempai to do whatever he wanted. A really shallow guy that is.Sempai is funny with her stage fright, but this also tends to get in the way. She is greatly passionate about magic, which isn't bad...but whenever she tries to recruit new members to the club, she comes off as annoying. Especially because there is no sign of her getting over her stage fright. It is something that continually gets in the way of progress. I understand that's a part of the joke -- she performs better when she isn't in front of anyone else -- but it quickly stops being funny quickly.Saki is a big-breasted gyaru girl who does street performances. From the looks of it, she seems that she'll be set up as a rival of Sempai's. There's nothing to her aside from the fact that she has a disturbing crush on her obese little brother. Just her practically foaming from the mouth when thinking about her brother is unsettling. Then there is Sempai's older sister...Sister....who is an airhead who loves to tease her little sister and offers to be the Magic Club's advisor (she's mdoerately a good character), and Madara who is the club president of the Chemistry Club who takes a disliking for Sempai to the point that she loathed having the scientific tricks she does be equated to the stage magic that Sempai does. For the most part, all the characters are defined by one trait no more, no less.Overall, Magical Sempai is a slightly below average series that if you love ecchi humor, I'm positive you'll have a good time with this one. Each episode is comprised of small segments that run for 12 minutes, so it's not too much of a burden to watch. But know that you are getting exactly what you'd of characters in the series with each varying in terms of how they are played. The Assistant is generic and mostly serves as the stand-in for the audience observing Sempai's misadventures. He is the straight man of the relationship, but at the same time, I found myself slightly disliking him because of the fact that he makes it clear often that he is largely interested in Sempai for her breasts and her other attributes.

But know that you are getting exactly what you'd"", ""Magical Sempai, is the other short-form anime for this summer season of anime. Again, I went in with limited expectations, considering the fact that it was short form. I actually preferred this anime to Sounan Desu Ka, because this felt more like a comic relief anime than anything else. It did a decent job of not taking itself too seriously, or trying to be more than it really was.Story: Well, Sounan Desu Ka actually had more of a story than this, albeit, not much more. Magical Sempai has a school magic club, which is struggling, due to a lack of students being interested in joining...the club. Eventually Assistant Kun, and two others later, join the school magic club, and this show follows the events that take place in the club. They come in the forms of mini-stories, which there were generally 4 or 5 of them in each episode.Art: Now, I give the art a pretty high mark, because, again, I think they did a good job of recognizing what kind of anime they were making, and worked to their advantages. It also helps that Magical Sempai is definitely a waifu. They did a good job of expressing Magical Sempais hopefullness, and Assistant Kuns dismay on a regular basis. They had a healthy mix of actual character art, and cute chibby characters and UwU faces. Again, they didn't take themselves too seriously.Sound: The OP was nice, I didn't notice anything lacking in terms of voice acting or sound effects.Characters: Despite the fact that Magical Sempai, and Assistant Kun were never actually formally introduced with their actual names, the characters were fairly charming. The dynamic between Assistant Kun and Sempai were great, and the added dynamics later, between Saki and her brother, made for some entertaining episodes.Enjoyment: To be fair, who doesn't enjoy a good sexual innuendo? This anime is full of them, and paired with the constant Ecchi/Fan Service, it was fairly enjoyable to watch. That's not to mention, that Magical Sempai, is absolutely out of her mind, and there were several situations I found myself laughing at.Overall: I give it a 7/10. Again, I find short-form animes hard to judge, because I personally, don't consider them real animes. It's hard to judge something that intentionally doesn't really have much of a story, or any depth. So, my rating here comes strictly based on how much I enjoyed watching the show week to week. the club.

The characters are good and have some hilarious scene’s. although it has its funny moments, it doesn’t keep up in story.Story – 4Is there one? Really? Not really, it’s more of a bunch of characters being chucked into weird situations that ends with some mildly sexual joke.Art – 7I like it. the art style is pretty nice and the character reactions are hilarious, built on a multiple shorts per episode basis, it has a nice sort of brake from long stories.Sound – 6I like the OP and ED, the background...music isn’t anything special, but the OP and ED are very happy and shows that the series is an over the top comedy.Characters – 6I like the sort of character ark of senpai, but it doesn’t feel very complete.Senpai is your clumsy, unaware main girl that tries to convince her assistant to help her in her magic tricks that obviously end horribly.Assistant is a good main male character, with a sort of laid back, but thoughtful personality. It’s fun to see his interactions with Senpai.The side characters are pretty good, but are pretty plain. The characters may be plain, but they have very good chemistry.Overall – 6Overall, it’s not bad, it’s a nice story about magic.

If you are looking for highbrow comedy, a visual thriller or a heartfelt story on the level of Clanned you will not get it. This show is about ecchi comedy and it absolutely nails it. It is focused around a highschool girl and her desire to form a magic club with her new friend aptly named assistant....This leads to many various comedic shenanigans which combined with the short run time of only 12 minutes gives the show a fast pace feel in regards to the comedy as  the quick scene segments means that most of the comedy is physical or situational rather than referential or call backs like many other anime. Shows like this often get a lot of unjust criticism for pandering to the lowest common denominator but in the case of this show it manages to pull it off well with good character writing and interactions ensuring that the comedy works rather than just lots of pointless ecchi scenes strung together. Overall every time I watched it I really enjoyed it but as this review states it is down to taste if you like Ecchi comedy or comedy similar to konosuba then I would recommenced trying it as I think you would probably enjoy it. If you don't like the darkness comedic elements in Konosuba then I don't think this show is for you. Overall I would give it a 6 for the story but a solid 10/10 for how much I actually enjoyed the anime averaging out as an 8/10 which I feel is fair for this anime as you will either enjoy it immensely or it is not in your taste.

So, was it good? Well, let's hop on and find out!Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryMagical Sempai follows the adventures, or rather, misadventures of the titular character and her group of friends as they practice their magic tricks and attempt to become true stage magicians. Well, at least Sempai does, Assistant just there to make sure she doesn't get hurt while Masashi and Saki...just want to practice street performances. Anyway, this show largely episodic in nature; there are a few plotlines that last a few episodes, but nothing that can compose a true overarching narrative.Comedy is this show's meat and potatoes, with Sempai trying and, regularly failing, to perform magic, with her Assistant normally rushing in to bail her out of trouble. While the comedy in and of itself is fine, the lack of a deeper emotional component might turn viewers. I mean, there are episodes that imply there's something between Sempai and Assistant but these moments are overshadowed by longer, more consistent periods of comedy and ecchi content.And speaking of ecchi content, this show has ecchi to spare. Whether's scenes of panties or Sempai's surprisingly endowed chest, there's plenty of sex appeal in this show. At one point, Assistant says that, for all of Sempai's ineptitude, she's fairly attractive.Magical Sempai is a show for the fans of ecchi comedies, so if you're a fan, you're likely to enjoy this show. Otherwise, you may want to watch something else. (6/10)CharactersSempai is one of the funniest characters of the year. I got really attached to her because of her ineptitude, silliness and resolve to become a stage magician despite her lack of talent with stage magic. Even when her tricks backfire, Sempai never stops trying to be better and that's something I can admire. She's a character you can both laugh at and feel sorry for at the same time. Thankfully, her Assistant is always there to save her whenever something goes wrong. Sure, he often complains that he has to look after such a helpless girl, but deep down, Assistant would never abandon her in her time of need. I think I would have enjoyed the show a bit more if it had advanced their relationship beyond just… sempai and assistant.Despite the small size of the supporting cast, the characters manage to be fairly entertaining. There's Saki, the aspiring street performance with an obsession with her brother, Masashi, Saki's brother who goes along with her sister's antics, and Madara, who is just like Sempai but with science instead of magic. We also get some fine comedy thanks to Sempai's big sister, who enjoys putting Sempai in ridiculous situations. (7/10)ArtFor a show with a 12-minute run per episode, its visual quality is actually kind of impressive. Sure, it looks cheap sometimes but does fit into the show's quirky and hilarious nature. Also, it seems like a huge portion of the budget went into the fanservice moments. Seriously, the show never stops reminding us how big Sempai's breasts are or how curvy her body is. If there's one thing Assistant likes about her, it's her physical attractiveness. (8/10)SoundMagical Sempai has a fantastic opener. It's easily one of the best things about this show. Praise should also be given to the two leading actors. Kaede Hondo is a fine actress with huge comedic talent. I don't think there could have been a better choice to play the titular character. Despite being a newcomer, Aoi Ichikawa did a fine job as the Assistant. The two leads have excellent chemistry with one another and I don't think I would have enjoyed the show as much as I did without their talent. (8/10)OverallMagical Sempai is a fine show. Sure, it's no masterpiece and the narrative progression could use a bit of work, but you can totally appreciate it for its comedy and fanservice elements. It can get a bit repetitive sometimes, but it finishes on a strong note and I definitely recommend it to fans of ecchi comedies. (7/10) just want to practice street performances.

She gets put into weird positions that expose her panties; her clothes will be ripped off (in one case, pops); her boobs are constantly being shown, etc. I don\'t care about fan service, and all that, but when it\'s all you rely on for comedic value, it is really annoying.

Sometimes that's all it takes to make a show worth the admission.Magical Senpai is a short comedy series with even shorter runtime of about ten-twelve minutes each. Synopsis looks dry as heck but I gave this one a chance one lazy afternoon and taken back how much I enjoyed it. Slapstick in anime can be an acquired taste and through the years, I began to appreciate it. Too many shows inject too much 'message' or 'progressive' elements to them and while they can be well-meaning sometimes, shows especially comedy are first and foremost made to,...ya know...entertain. Magical Senpai knows what it is and it doesn't care for doing much else. An underling gets dragged by a lunatic sexy senpai to her obsession with magic tricks and shit happens. Simple and effective. Most of my enjoyment comes to the sheer audacity, kinkiness, and sometimes wholesome antics and interaction between the two leads and the other characters and with a limited cast, it did it best with its twelve-minute bursts. The show's story is like gum; flavorful, arguably disposable, but damn right I'll take one any day.Nothing particularly interesting about its art and character designs whatsoever but the epomynous lead was quite distinct in my opinion. Animation was ok. Music however was great as its both OP and ED were bangers, but more so on the ED.Characters are fine and not really unique. The whole 'magical trick show' theme does get some merit. The lead however is just a lovable, determined idiot and most fun i had was just how the people around her react to her raunchy failures and whatever misfortunes that come down to her and the others.To sum up my feelings, the show does nothing noteworthy in terms of storytelling or anything groundbreaking but what it does was to give gags that jumpstart giggles that harms no one but its cast. It is ecchi, so expect some rising boners or so.

The characters themselves adhere very closely to their tropes- e.g. cluelessly lewd girl, a girl obsessed with her brother for some reason- and it makes for fairly predictable storytelling.The main character- by the way, why don't he and senpai have names?- has some nuance to him; he's not a classic pervert or deadpan MC, and he shows a little bit of promise now and again. He does succumb to the usual... stray glance... but his long-suffering attitude and reluctant care for...senpai does add somewhat to the story, and I think this aspect was pretty well-written especially considering the style of the show is that of multiple skits being put into already short episodes.Regarding sound and art- they're about what you'd expect for an ecchi. The art style is decent until the ecchi kicks in, and suddenly the entire animation budget looks like it's being spent like water in comparison. The sound doesn't detract from the show, but it's mild and forgettable (in my opinion! I don't know much about music).Personally, I couldn't finish the show. If you're the type to invest in story, characters and arcs like me... well, you probably wouldn't start this anime to begin with. But for a lighthearted, low-investment anime with gratuitous shots *peppered* through twelve twelve-minute episodes, it's pretty okay. senpai does add somewhat to the story, and I think this aspect was pretty well-written especially considering the style of the show is that of multiple skits being put into already short episodes.Regarding sound and art- they're about what you'd expect for an ecchi.

This isn’t the story of her overcoming her stage fright or anything of the sort, rather that’s just the justification given for why every trick she attempts ends horribly to amusing effect. There are very few characters in this anime, and the two main characters aren’t even named, simply...being referred to as Senpai and Assistant throughout. The cast overall is incredibly flat, with absolutely no character or relationship development. They also have very little depth, basically just fitting into the narrow slots needed for the sake of the comedic scenes.Still, despite all that, the anime is pretty enjoyable. Senpai is really likable in that she’s really passionate about magic so she keeps sticking with magic despite constantly screwing up, but she’s also really innocent and kind of stupid so she keeps making the same mistakes again and again. She always starts out unjustifiable arrogant but then ends up in a panicked often crying state after she screws up. Other characters are kind of mean to her sometimes, usually because she does something that results in her deserving it, but more so than that it kind of feels like she’s bullying herself, which is kind of hilarious and also kind of cute. Assistant is a good balance to her, in that he calls her out on all her nonsense which makes him work well as a tsukommi, but despite that sticks with her and the club. A core part of why he stays is likely because he finds her hot, but that just makes the circumstances even funnier.In addition to Senpai the magician and her Assistant, the rest of the cast includes a scientist, a street performer who does stuff like balloon art and ventriloquism, and a psychoanalyst. However, only the scientist and street performer are actually competent at what they do, with the psychoanalyst being just as incompetent as Senpai. This gives the the comedy some variety which allows the show to be entertaining even though it’s just a steady stream of comedy. The explanations by the scientist and street performer were also somewhat interesting, which further helped with pacing. It was kind of disappointing though that there wasn’t a competent magician to explain the magic though, as this is a series mainly about magic, but it is what it is.In addition I would also like to note that the anime is structured perfectly for what it’s going for. There are twelve episodes, but each is only half length. In addition, each of those is composed of a series, around five or so, of separate segments. There is some continuity at times, such as when they go to the beach and there are multiple linked segments there, but for the most part each segment is completely disconnected from the others. As such, it can focus solely on the comedy without even attempting to be anything more, and because of it’s fast paced short burst format, that works really well.The art and animation are also pretty solid. The character designs aren’t super unique, but they’re used well. The animation is also full of visual humor and in general the art is pretty nice to look at. The OP and ED are both also a lot of fun both in terms of the songs and the visuals, even if they are pretty standard. The soundtrack isn’t particularly memorable. being referred to as Senpai and Assistant throughout. The cast overall is incredibly flat, with absolutely no character or relationship development.

I understand that in 12 episodes of 15 minutes each it is very difficult to make a well-articulated plot, but I don't understand why a person should watch an anime full of comic gags already seen (in other series and repeated in the episodes). The characters don't even seem interested in the main plot, generating a feeling similar to that which certain actors generate when they play a film reluctantly. The idea of explaining magic tricks is nice, but I think the way in which the explanations...have been attempted is totally wrong, both because they are hasty and because the characters themselves don't seem interested. Tell me, what's the point of explaining things that don't affect history? I'll tell you: nothing. One of those series that you forget the next day; if it wasn't short, I would have definitely dropped it. have been attempted is totally wrong, both because they are hasty and because the characters themselves don't seem interested.

The only thing you have to decide is what color hair to give each generic girl; and figure out what the T is going to be in your show.In this case, “Let’s make them spies”The only problem is to come up with a justification for why there must be cute girls doing the Thing in question. And in this case apparently, wars became too bloody and so now spies do all the fighting- and this show seems to think spies are the same exact thing as assassins… Somehow I...doubt wars are ever going to be fought by a bunch of teenage girls playing rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets stuck carrying the backpack on a mission, but I digress…This anime puts a group of cute girls, all who are apparently war orphans, into a nice Edwardian house to be trained for a supposedly ‘Impossible Mission’ by Klaus, a longhaired bishounen who claims to be the world’s greatest spy, and who is constantly making abstract paintings with blood red colors…But what starts out as Cute Girls Doing Spy Things in a classroom quickly turns into a competition between Klaus and Lily; the more outspoken girl, to see which one of them can take the other out. This turns into a lesson where he tasks the girls with making him ‘surrender’, setting up a students-need-to-beat-teacher challenge that some are comparing to Assassination Classroom. Well that was unexpected. It works pretty well to keep you interested, but there are a few problems.First, we only really get to know two of the characters: Klaus and Lily, while all the rest of the girls are just cardboard cutouts who dress in their own signature style. It relies way too heavily on exposition; having characters talk about what they just tried to do and reveal their sneaky attempts with dialogue rather than showing them actually fighting- which would require much more animation than this has. It also means it has this Scooby Doo tendency to reveal all secrets to the enemy the moment BEFORE he’s defeated, which just made me laugh out loud.The show cashes in all its chips on the Impossible Mission pretty quickly, suggesting it will have an arc style of storytelling- which is fine. But it doesn’t justify having so many characters, each who are supposed to have a Unique Talent. It seems we will find out what each girl’s talent is- mostly through exposition in each future mission featuring all the girls working together as a team- which for some reason has been given the name Lamplight. It's a kind of formulaic type of storytelling that will restrict this anime's ability to make a lasting impression- but then again it could pull another surprise move to keep you guessing, hard to tell right now.Since this is a Preliminary Review and it’s early, I’d say anyone might like it, it just depends on your taste. I find it very enjoyable, in spite of its weaknesses. I am wishing for more characterization and a lot better world-building than it has; but it’s fun and cute and the dialogue is not bad.

The first three episodes basically doomed it, and even though the second half was comparatively better, my interest had already waned too much. It had the makings for a decent series, but the adaptation of the first volume of the light novel (first seven episodes) was just baffling, because they showed all their cards in Episode 3, and they did flashbacks for character development after the supposed climax, which felt so out of place. Without this poor structure in the first arc, I would definitely have enjoyed...it more, but here we are.The show revolves around a spy group called Team Lamplight, a group of seven (?) girls, and their teacher, Klaus. At first, they seemed like a disoriented bunch of fools not knowing what to do, and at the outset, the plot was revolving around the girls attempting to kill Klaus, which in the end, really went nowhere, and got repetitive very quickly. The spy missions themselves weren’t all that great either, especially in the first half. They were just simple and extremely contrived short missions with irrelevant villains that just were there to get killed. It also relies way too heavily or plot twists and shock value, which is not the best formula. It lacks an identity, it’s not funny like Spy X Family, and it certainly isn’t Assassination Classroom either, so what is it really? I don’t know if I have an answer.The characters were all very gimmicky, and lacked real personality or growth in general. I can barely remember all their names to be honest. A lot of them felt overly sexualized, and it felt like being horny was their only attribute. A little perverseness doesn’t doom a show at all, but for this show, it really obstructed the plot and character development. It just feels like extremely lazy writing, when the writer ran out of ideas, so maybe they thought a bit of fan service will satisfy the viewers instead. I suppose some of them got better in the second half, but it’s just faint praise, really.The animation and designs are alright, not anything special, but not bad either. As for the music, the soundtrack wasn’t all that special, but the OP and EDs were probably one of the more well done and creative aspects in the entire show.Overall, while having an acceptable second half, the first arc’s structure just killed it entirely in my opinion. It showed its hand way too early, simple as that. Even so, the writing in general was not great, to put it lightly, and relied too much on shock value and fan service to keep the audience engaged. With better pacing, this show could have been a little better, but not by much. Even the stacked cast of voice actors couldn’t save this.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. The pacing and direction of this show were just awful.Even if you take out the adaptation aspect, it’s painfully obvious that the show breezes over important details and omits content. On top of that, the studio made the decision...to adapt side story volumes which feel like filler in the middle of the show instead of adapting the main story properly. They feel out of place as they take place prior to the events of the end of volume 1, and they also don’t match the tone of the story. Those 2-3 episodes just felt really off and I don’t understand the choice.They did start to improve things in the second half of the show when they faithfully adapted volume 2, but by that time I’d totally lost interest in the anime and couldn’t really bring myself to care. It’s really a shame because this is a solid light novel story that’s basically cute girls doing cute things with a spy thriller/military backdrop, but the anime fails to capture any of that magic. Instead it feels like a generic soulless cash-grab that might do well enough to sell a few risqué waifu figures, but I can’t imagine it did well enough to really justify the means.The art style is good, animation is ok for the most part. The direction is very bad as I mentioned the pacing is awful and the show expects us to care about characters without giving them proper attention and care.I’d advise against watching the anime and just suggest you to check out the LN series. If you are at all interested in the world of Spyroom that is the ideal manner of consumption because this anime is simply not it.Spyroom gets 4 out of 10 to adapt side story volumes which feel like filler in the middle of the show instead of adapting the main story properly.

If you are at all interested in the world of Spyroom that is the ideal manner of consumption because this anime is simply not it.Spyroom gets 4 out of 10', 'Assassination Classroom: Cute Girls Doing Cute Things ver., that is nowhere close to being an exact replication, none at all.Well, what a time, and what a place that we call ourselves as anime veterans to watch botched/butchered adaptations come to life, with the most recent curse of a red flag being the Winter 2021 anime sequel to The Promised Neverland, which can be dictated as ""speedrunning to the max"". And 2 years later, we\'re seeing this with novelist Takemachi\'s Spy Kyoushitsu a.k.a Spy Clasroom (or just simply called Spy Room). The obvious reference is as what Gigguk would mention this as the ""re-skinned Assassination Classroom"",...with a touch of Princess Principal in-between...only except that this time, the speedrunning is done in complete reverse, of a slow and awfully stretched out 12-episode series that is the epitome of ""When is the next progression going to come soon?"".I\'ve heard LN readers praise the priginal source material to high regard, but it\'s very clear that when this is converted to the anime adaptation, the quote of ""all hell broke loose"" can easily justify why the show sucks in all levels. But still, I can\'t help but notice the obvious similarities between this show and Princess Principal (with a hint of Spy X Family as well on the story plot front) with the fictional analogue setting of a war-ravaged nation that splits into two: the defining good vs. evil trope, which in Spy Room\'s case, is between the ""Light"" and ""Darkness"". To quote the existence of one such group, it\'s the war of spies that\'s fought with information and trickery, and that\'s where the spy team Inferno comes in with its leader: Klaus, codename Bonfire, nicknamed (or rather self-proclaimed) ""the Greatest Spy in the World"". But as prominent as Inferno could be, it was met with valiant deaths of great sacrifices, leaving the 20-year-old on his own devices as the only remaining surviving member. Down but not out, the re-establishment of the next Inferno replacement team to take on the ""Impossible Missions"" that have a relatively high chance of failure with no room for error. The issue: girls who are dropouts from their relative spy schools whence they came from, and being a spy, time is of the essence to train these dropouts to match his level of spy expertise, all in a short frame of time.Introducing the girls of the washout Lamplight team:- Lily, codename: Flower Garden. Specialty: Using poison to inflict her enemies while having special immunity. Her reasoning to become a spy is one of adoration and ""giving back to the community"" after being saved by one after surviving a poison gas attack. Being recognised by Klaus for her observation and community skills, she is designated to be Lamplight\'s team leader.- Grete, codename: Daughter Dearest. Speciality: Disguise. The daughter of a politician but forced out for her family for familial reasons, and with a disfiguring birthmark that will have people criticize of her being ugly, all of these have not stopped her reasoning to become a spy. Although she has an excellent brain, she has a deep-rooted distaste for men, which overtime, her interest in Klaus changing her tone in how he views her not as a romantic interest, but one as of family.- Sybilla, codename: Pandemonium. Speciality: Stealing and athleticism. Her childhood was not the brightest, due to being born into a gangster family, which she and her younger siblings were forced to help in gang activities. She has a strong sense of justice and wanted to be a spy to protect her younger siblings, to create a world where children won\'t be exploited, with motivation being one of a spy\'s unsung strength.- Sara, codename: Meadow. Speciality: Rearing animals. She is a timid but kind-hearted girl who tends to add ""ssu"" at the end of her words. Her becoming a spy to support her family and not out of patriotism, she can be seen as the background character that prefers to be behind the scenes supporting the Lamplight girls, which she is more comfortable with in her element.- Erna, codename: Fool. Speciality: Predicting misforutunate accidents. The illusive 8th and youngest member of Lamplight, the 14-year-old that is cursed with bad luck, which causes accidents to happen to people around her and makes her the perfect assassin, though it means she cannot get close to anybody. The actual reason: being born into an aristocratic family and losing her parents in a tragic mansion fire, she\'s been plagued with misfortune as a way to atone for her survivor\'s guilt, though she isn\'t the point of cause or attraction.The girls that are not covered extensively in the anime:- Monika, codename: Glint. The most talented of Lamplight, being able to think on her two feet of last-minute decisions.- Thea, codename: Dreamspeaker. The oldest and most attractive member of Lamplight, she is good with negotiations.- Annette, codename: Forgetter. The one who is good with engineering, her becoming a spy is just natural progression thanks to her special skills.Sorry, if you have to refer to the CGDCT element in this show, it would be ""Cute Girls Doing Cunning (Spy-like) Tasks"", because that\'s exactly how Spy Room rolls its Spy x Family theme of an ultra-capable teacher that contrary to his skills, sucks at teaching, because everything to Klaus is intuitive and instinctual with the usual spy-like capabilities of his exceptional performance that fools no one. Nevertheless, the group of dropout girls thrown into the lurch of the Heat Haze Palace mansion where they\'ll be holing themselves under Klaus\'s tutelage, are diversified at best, though for the better or worse, it\'s up to the viewer to manage expectations met and not.I don\'t know what it is with studio Feel\'s in-house director Keiichiro Kawaguchi, everything that he gets his opportunity to be involved in, ends in pure disaster. Just look at the shows of the past few years that suffered in his hands: Summer 2018\'s anime adaptation of the Island VN, and most recently, the 2020-2021 dual-reboot shows of Higurashi: Gou and Sotsu. He used to be very good in his directorial roles in the shows of the early 2000s, from 2007\'s Hayate no Gotoku! a.k.a Hayate the Combat Butler to 2011-2012\'s Sket Dance!. Heck,he even directed 2011\'s Mayo Chiki and 2012\'s OniAi!, so it\'s a clear indication that this is a director who knows his craft. The fact that he\'s supported by scriptwriter-cum-series composer Shinichi Inotsume, who dug his hands on shows like Spring 2018\'s Persona 5 the Animation, Winter 2019\'s Egao no Daika and the most recent being the awful 2021-2022 show of Platinum End, the cards were set on being played into the wrong hands at the point of the anime\'s production, and the result is what we\'re seeing with the show this season of a clearly botched adaptation of the LN, splicing filler episodes targeting at character development, which is decent to say the least. Never mind studio Feel\'s somewhat decent production, this feels like a mistake for the rom-com focused studio to be assigned to something that feels way above over their head, not since Spring 2018\'s Hinamatsuri has the studio done an almost entirely action-focused anime. It just does not look right at all.The OST is kinda of a mixed bag though. The Re:Zero music artiste duo nonoc and Konomi Suzuki are back, though the OP song ""Tomoshibi"" is a rather ""dancing to the tune"" beats of addiction and the ED song ""Secret Code""...just being a low-key, mediocre song that is really forgettable to say the least.From one of the most anticipated shows of the season, to a picture-perfect squandering of a missed opportunity of the original source material\'s adaptation trying to reflect what made it so interesting in the first place. The LN (and even the manga adaptation) is definitely the way to go, and the anime...is only but a footnote in history to claim one such medal: the botched/butchered adaptation of disgrace.What an epic fail of a massive disappointment. with a touch of Princess Principal in-between...only except that this time, the speedrunning is done in complete reverse, of a slow and awfully stretched out 12-episode series that is the epitome of ""When is the next progression going to come soon?"".I\'ve heard LN readers praise the priginal source material to high regard, but it\'s very clear that when this is converted to the anime adaptation, the quote of ""all hell broke loose"" can easily justify why the show sucks in all levels. But still, I can\'t help but notice the obvious similarities between this show and Princess Principal (with a hint of Spy X Family as well on the story plot front) with the fictional analogue setting of a war-ravaged nation that splits into two: the defining good vs. evil trope, which in Spy Room\'s case, is between the ""Light"" and ""Darkness"". To quote the existence of one such group, it\'s the war of spies that\'s fought with information and trickery, and that\'s where the spy team Inferno comes in with its leader: Klaus, codename Bonfire, nicknamed (or rather self-proclaimed) ""the Greatest Spy in the World"". But as prominent as Inferno could be, it was met with valiant deaths of great sacrifices, leaving the 20-year-old on his own devices as the only remaining surviving member. Down but not out, the re-establishment of the next Inferno replacement team to take on the ""Impossible Missions"" that have a relatively high chance of failure with no room for error. The issue: girls who are dropouts from their relative spy schools whence they came from, and being a spy, time is of the essence to train these dropouts to match his level of spy expertise, all in a short frame of time.Introducing the girls of the washout Lamplight team:- Lily, codename: Flower Garden. Specialty: Using poison to inflict her enemies while having special immunity. Her reasoning to become a spy is one of adoration and ""giving back to the community"" after being saved by one after surviving a poison gas attack. Being recognised by Klaus for her observation and community skills, she is designated to be Lamplight\'s team leader.- Grete, codename: Daughter Dearest. Speciality: Disguise. The daughter of a politician but forced out for her family for familial reasons, and with a disfiguring birthmark that will have people criticize of her being ugly, all of these have not stopped her reasoning to become a spy. Although she has an excellent brain, she has a deep-rooted distaste for men, which overtime, her interest in Klaus changing her tone in how he views her not as a romantic interest, but one as of family.- Sybilla, codename: Pandemonium. Speciality: Stealing and athleticism. Her childhood was not the brightest, due to being born into a gangster family, which she and her younger siblings were forced to help in gang activities. She has a strong sense of justice and wanted to be a spy to protect her younger siblings, to create a world where children won\'t be exploited, with motivation being one of a spy\'s unsung strength.- Sara, codename: Meadow. Speciality: Rearing animals. She is a timid but kind-hearted girl who tends to add ""ssu"" at the end of her words. Her becoming a spy to support her family and not out of patriotism, she can be seen as the background character that prefers to be behind the scenes supporting the Lamplight girls, which she is more comfortable with in her element.- Erna, codename: Fool. Speciality: Predicting misforutunate accidents. The illusive 8th and youngest member of Lamplight, the 14-year-old that is cursed with bad luck, which causes accidents to happen to people around her and makes her the perfect assassin, though it means she cannot get close to anybody. The actual reason: being born into an aristocratic family and losing her parents in a tragic mansion fire, she\'s been plagued with misfortune as a way to atone for her survivor\'s guilt, though she isn\'t the point of cause or attraction.The girls that are not covered extensively in the anime:- Monika, codename: Glint. The most talented of Lamplight, being able to think on her two feet of last-minute decisions.- Thea, codename: Dreamspeaker. The oldest and most attractive member of Lamplight, she is good with negotiations.- Annette, codename: Forgetter. The one who is good with engineering, her becoming a spy is just natural progression thanks to her special skills.Sorry, if you have to refer to the CGDCT element in this show, it would be ""Cute Girls Doing Cunning (Spy-like) Tasks"", because that\'s exactly how Spy Room rolls its Spy x Family theme of an ultra-capable teacher that contrary to his skills, sucks at teaching, because everything to Klaus is intuitive and instinctual with the usual spy-like capabilities of his exceptional performance that fools no one. Nevertheless, the group of dropout girls thrown into the lurch of the Heat Haze Palace mansion where they\'ll be holing themselves under Klaus\'s tutelage, are diversified at best, though for the better or worse, it\'s up to the viewer to manage expectations met and not.I don\'t know what it is with studio Feel\'s in-house director Keiichiro Kawaguchi, everything that he gets his opportunity to be involved in, ends in pure disaster. Just look at the shows of the past few years that suffered in his hands: Summer 2018\'s anime adaptation of the Island VN, and most recently, the 2020-2021 dual-reboot shows of Higurashi: Gou and Sotsu. He used to be very good in his directorial roles in the shows of the early 2000s, from 2007\'s Hayate no Gotoku! a.k.a Hayate the Combat Butler to 2011-2012\'s Sket Dance!. Heck,he even directed 2011\'s Mayo Chiki and 2012\'s OniAi!, so it\'s a clear indication that this is a director who knows his craft. The fact that he\'s supported by scriptwriter-cum-series composer Shinichi Inotsume, who dug his hands on shows like Spring 2018\'s Persona 5 the Animation, Winter 2019\'s Egao no Daika and the most recent being the awful 2021-2022 show of Platinum End, the cards were set on being played into the wrong hands at the point of the anime\'s production, and the result is what we\'re seeing with the show this season of a clearly botched adaptation of the LN, splicing filler episodes targeting at character development, which is decent to say the least. Never mind studio Feel\'s somewhat decent production, this feels like a mistake for the rom-com focused studio to be assigned to something that feels way above over their head, not since Spring 2018\'s Hinamatsuri has the studio done an almost entirely action-focused anime. It just does not look right at all.The OST is kinda of a mixed bag though. The Re:Zero music artiste duo nonoc and Konomi Suzuki are back, though the OP song ""Tomoshibi"" is a rather ""dancing to the tune"" beats of addiction and the ED song ""Secret Code""...just being a low-key, mediocre song that is really forgettable to say the least.From one of the most anticipated shows of the season, to a picture-perfect squandering of a missed opportunity of the original source material\'s adaptation trying to reflect what made it so interesting in the first place.

The high-stakes first arc is particularly engrossing, but the fun cast of characters makes even the mid-season filler episodes quite watchable.The show feels solid from start to finish because it never overreaches: we were promised cute girls learning how to be spies, and we got exactly that. It\'s spy fiction as light action comedy rather than military thriller, but it still delivers reasonably clever spy-like twists: gadgets, disguises, shadowy figures, double- and triple-crosses, assorted brinkmanship.The tone is well balanced because, again, it doesn\'t overreach. The girls...are cute and silly, and the deadpan teacher complements them perfectly; the spy missions are exciting, even when the stakes are low; and the tragic backstories, when they come up, give the story a bit of heart without wallowing in sadness. Overall, it\'s about as cozy as spy fiction gets.The season is actually fairly well paced: three main characters, including the teacher, are well developed, and what I called the filler episodes typically focus on developing one side character each, largely through enjoyable albeit low-stakes action and comedy. The voice acting is charming, the animation is serviceable, and the subtitles are acceptable.I remember once slogging through an episode of some romantic comedy I won\'t name, trying to force myself to enjoy it. I gave up eventually and put on \'My First Girlfriend Is a Gal\', of all things, a less than beloved franchise. My relief was immediate and overwhelming, because finally I was watching a show that actually tries to deliver on the core appeal of its genre. I feel the same way about \'Spy Classroom\' now. It\'s a minor, quiet success. It doesn\'t shout at you. It\'s not trying to seem important. It doesn\'t even demand your full attention in every scene. But if you find yourself slogging through the latest ""revolutionary achievement for the medium,"" consider a simple story about cute spy girls instead. are cute and silly, and the deadpan teacher complements them perfectly; the spy missions are exciting, even when the stakes are low; and the tragic backstories, when they come up, give the story a bit of heart without wallowing in sadness.

My impression of this show had been changing even before I started watching it. First off, I fell in love with the character design. Then I saw a clip on Reddit, which made me believe this would be an ecchi. My opinion changed during the show as well. But having watched few episodes I abandoned the anime for a week. When I picked it up my opinion changed again, and I can definitely say that the 3 episode rule doesn\'t work here.The first 3 episodes represent the first 3 episodes, not the whole show....Here we have the post war world where, for some reason, the most efficient weapon is spies. This is quite the world building you can get as an anime only. No further explanations, no depiction of culture differences between those 2 nations, aside from the fact that one of the countries looks like German. In this country several spies were recruited to carry out so-called Mission Impossible ( got the reference? ). And the name of that mission stems from a sole failed attempt to accomplish it. On top of that, the lineup is composed of washouts, who should be trained specifically for that mission.The student cast of 7 girls at this point is pretty forgettable. It will be a miracle if you remember at least one of the girls. Their teacher is your typical taciturn, lacking of social skills, but extremely op mc with a trauma in the past. The only memorable thing about him is author\'s attempts to show how cool he is, but in reality it feels totally ludicrous. He can\'t explain how to use lock picks, nor design a proper curriculum. He isn\'t cut out to train them, but nevertheless the mission is still due. During this mission some awkward twists happen out of nowhere i.g. actually, there weren\'t seven but eight girl, or their HQ was bugged but, of course, our mc had known this from the beginning and took the respective measures.At this point many viewers call it a day and drop the show. But the anime makes a turnaround and slightly changes in the details. In the first episodes it had grim atmosphere that the girls would die during the mission. But now it turns into a lighthearted episodic slice of life with with espionage aspect akin to Spy x Family. And this is a real game changer. Every episode dedicated to one girl, mc\'s properties that were irksome and ridiculous before are fit for the comedic vibe now. There is no need to come up with a compelling story, slapstick style of writing does its job pretty well. Maybe it\'s not perfect, but it significantly better than the first 3 episodes. But there is a catch I\'ll talk about later.Unfortunately, the good part doesn\'t last too long. If I understood correctly, the first three episodes is the adaptation of the first volume, the next four are the adaptation of mini stories, and the rest belongs to the second volume. The latest episodes have the same issues that the early: stupid twists, boring characters that appears during this arc, and lack of character development comparing to the SoL episodes. In addition, there is a romantic sub plot that feels out of line and is executed pretty clumsy. I don\'t believe I\'m saying this, but I would definitely prefer the studio to rewrite the script and simply make SoL show with spies.I can\'t decide what is worse: the plot or the technical aspect. The word anime originates from animation. Therefore, I can hardly call it anime, because there are not much animation. Most of the time when some action happens, aside from walking and talking, there is either powerpoint level of ""animation"" or the camera slightly moves aside and you can see only a background and hear noises of the activity. The action-packed opening scene from the first episodes repeats later in the third one. And the worst adapted episodes, of course, are SoL episodes. Maybe they decided to adapt the side stories to save the budget and still have the whole one cour. Meanwhile, the show has 5 or 6 different endings and sometimes doesn\'t insert OP and/or ED to shorten the amount of frames to draw. It simply doesn\'t line up. The ost is forgettable except the main theme.Without doubt it is definitely a bad anime, which were saved exclusively by those four SoL episodes. It is, for sure, impossible to recommend.

Elna and Claus was supposed to be the main dig, but the anime cut their backstory digging so much.So, the novel works really well because v1 only had 2 named character. Here, they also used bug and ""actually 8"" gig.Manga, unlike the anime and novel, used hidden camera instead and had nice characters digging in the training arcs. It\'s clear there are 8 students, but the change from bug to camera gives all the chars chance to tell their backstory. (here, Elna\'s was less digged tho)Personally... yeah, the anime did dirty. It feels...like how Isekai Nonbiri Nouka gave us spoiler right off the bat.studio feel, you gave us two great seasons of oregairu giving suspense and urge to not stop watching, you guys must\'ve known what\'s good and what\'s bad in adapting LN.Why are you even playing speedrun...Kadokawa pushed this so hard that they forgot what\'s important is the anime and not the famous VAs?

Picture this, a spy themed anime that has multiple unique and different characters each with their own talents and abilities.  A boss that holds them all together whilst training them to be the best in their unique fields rather than conforming them to regular spy training activities.  And now picture them all going on an ""impossible mission"" that takes maybe 10 min in one episode.  That pretty much sums up this whole anime.I thought that this anime was going to be really interesting from the first episode, they had a mysterious spy boss who had a past shrouded in...blood and mystery, and multiple uniquely talented girl spy\'s that each had different personalities.  The intent to train up these girls to be his new team was all this boss had on his mind, however, the pacing of the anime ruined it.  To be honest the 2 episode should be episode 8 or even 10, and the 3rd episode should be 11th or even just the finale.The first episode is not too bad as most ""new"" anime tend to quickly greet you to the most important characters in the first episode and make up a reason they get together, or at least you get a foreshadowing of them being together.  But episode 2 is when things get bad and confusing, we see them doing training routines for an ""impossible mission"" which is suppose to be a mission that only God-tier spy\'s could achieve with a low success rate.  Yet somehow they achieve this mission in episode 3.....    Let that sink in....   Literally the 3rd episode in, is the finale.So what might you ask comes next?  I mean it has to be a full season right?  Well, the rest of the episodes all skip back to the very beginning when they first arrived with their boss.  ""What?? You mean to tell me that the anime just gives you a finale in episode 3, and then turns back time to do the training???""   Yes...  Yes it does...  No new mission, no new challenge, not even all together interesting content.  Just the group, every episode, trying to kill their boss.   ""Well, it can\'t be that bad, I mean they are trying to at least accomplish that right?  I mean they have to be getting better at it?""         WRONG...        Its the same old troupe every episode after the early bust.  Anime starts, were greeted with the group of girls either making a plan, or reminiscing over a failed plan and then plan a new one, the whole episode they get ready, and then they fail.  Over... and over...  and..  well you get the point.Honestly, for the art style and fight scenes, I have to give credit where credit is due.  The visuals look good, the audio is clear and likable, the voice acting is very good.  But there really isn\'t enough of any of these categories that warrants this any higher than a solid.4/10I tried to keep going with this anime, and I may come back to it after it is finished to see if I missed anything cool in the later episodes.

To be honest the 2 episode should be episode 8 or even 10, and the 3rd episode should be 11th or even just the finale.The first episode is not too bad as most ""new"" anime tend to quickly greet you to the most important characters in the first episode and make up a reason they get together, or at least you get a foreshadowing of them being together.  But episode 2 is when things get bad and confusing, we see them doing training routines for an ""impossible mission"" which is suppose to be a mission that only God-tier spy\'s could achieve with a low success rate.  Yet somehow they achieve this mission in episode 3.....    Let that sink in....   Literally the 3rd episode in, is the finale.So what might you ask comes next?  I mean it has to be a full season right?  Well, the rest of the episodes all skip back to the very beginning when they first arrived with their boss.  ""What?? You mean to tell me that the anime just gives you a finale in episode 3, and then turns back time to do the training???""   Yes...  Yes it does...  No new mission, no new challenge, not even all together interesting content.  Just the group, every episode, trying to kill their boss.   ""Well, it can\'t be that bad, I mean they are trying to at least accomplish that right?  I mean they have to be getting better at it?""         WRONG...        Its the same old troupe every episode after the early bust.  Anime starts, were greeted with the group of girls either making a plan, or reminiscing over a failed plan and then plan a new one, the whole episode they get ready, and then they fail.  Over... and over...  and..  well you get the point.Honestly, for the art style and fight scenes, I have to give credit where credit is due.  The visuals look good, the audio is clear and likable, the voice acting is very good.  But there really isn\'t enough of any of these categories that warrants this any higher than a solid.4/10I tried to keep going with this anime, and I may come back to it after it is finished to see if I missed anything cool in the later episodes.  But for now, it is nothing but a large waste of time and money, I feel bad for the author, producer, and studio who thought this was going to be good.Hopefully this helps.', 'In my opinion,there are two types of storytelling that can truly irritate audiences: Either the authors(or anime production teams) have no clue what they are doing, or they try to tell the story in the way they aren\'t capable of and, predictably, it fail miserably. In the case of spy classroom, It reach both of the ""irritation standards"" in one single work. Which is kind of impressive (but in the wrong way).From the beginning of the story, you can already see that the production team have lost their direction. First they try to convince you that this is a serious story about spy girls saving...the world. But on the second half of first episode where the plot twist comes out , the story suddenly changes its tone and turns into a goofy comedy(Maybe it\'s because even the crew understood all the plot twist are either illogical or just straight out stupid). After that, the show just keep on trapping In this atrocious cycle (trying to tell you that this is a serious spy action anime -> change their mind and start making comedy ->second attempt on "" spy action""-> fail again and turn into complete chaos). And even if you look closely on ""spy thriller"" and ""slice of life( a little bit of love) comedy"" part individually, Both of them are still terribly written. None of the spy trickeries shown in this anime are convincing. And each girl\'s unique ability doesn\'t make the story interesting, but more like an excuse when author doesn\'t know how to continue the story. Sometimes the production team don\'t even bother to explain what\'s happening on the screen, letting the audience just awkwardly sit there and think ""what the hell is going on "". And don\'t let me start with the comedy sequence, which I think is the worst part of spy classroom. Everything they do is just so cringe, it makes a 24-minute episode feel like one hour. Not to mention that all these ""trainings""( if you think saving bakery from closure and cooking competition can be called training) and romance storyline can\'t let you understand more about the character. Instead, it only makes the story become more boring. All these desperate attempts only turn spy classroom into an absolute trainwreck.Some people might think this review is way too negative.but the truth is that there is nothing positive I can say about spy classroom (character design and visual style are mid but far from good). In the end, I think whoever wants to learn how to write a screenplay should watch this show, as it shows all the mistakes you shouldn\'t make. Though I wouldn\'t say spy classroom is the worst anime this year(It\'s only the first season this year ), watching it is still just like torture.

They’re sent to a secret location to study under the (self-proclaimed) worlds greatest spy in order to complete an impossible mission. Unfortunately, their tutor maybe the worlds greatest spy, but he sucks at teaching, and they only have a month to prepare themselves for the mission that will very likely get them killed, so they're in trouble.I actually really liked the first episode. A spy who's good at everything yet cannot explain how he’s so good makes for a funny teacher, and I found his deadpan conversations with his students charming. The other character I really liked was Lily. She’s bubbly and a bit dizzy on the surface, but underneath she's very resource and cunning. The show fully cements how potentially threatening she is. It’s a very good episode with a good conclusion and I really enjoyed it.Unfortunately, she's the only one out of the seven moé spies who gets any sort of character development. The other six might as well be shadow clones because I couldn’t tell you a thing about them apart from maybe their appearances. It doesn’t help that the next three episodes are all over the place structurally. There’s a lot of time hopping between the girls training at the mansion and them in action on the impossible mission, and it sometimes gets really confusing. In fact, the impossible mission is over by episode three. The show just rushes through it like it doesn’t even matter. I thought this was going to be a season long endeavour? But it’s not, and by the end it didn’t feel like a very important mission at all. Now there’s nine episodes left… and the fourth is a flashback to them training for the mission we’ve already seen them complete…This anime also has the same problem with other mystery/spy/detective light novel anime adaptations where the solution to problems are usually ass-pulled at the last minute in a “I knew you’d do that” moment that the show did not set up or establish beforehand for the audience to cotton on too. Though admittedly it’s not as egregious as The Detective is Already Dead, or Classroom of the Elite. I have heard that this not a problem with the actual light novel, but just being honest, I’m never going to read them. I don’t read books for nerds. I watch anime.If you want to see a good example of what I’m talking about, Bungou Stray Dogs is airing right now and that mixes supernatural powers into its detective/mystery formula which makes it even more impressive when it comes to how they present their scenarios to the audience.Actually, if there is one thing I can say in Spy Classrooms favour, it’s restraint on not adding supernatural elementals into it’s narrative makes the ass-pulls a bit easier to swallow. The only one who breaks this rule is a spy girl who literally has the power of… being unlucky, which basically means she can do whatever the plot needs of her, which is a shame.The animation is nothing special. It looks like a light novel adaptation, and it is a light novel adaptation. I don’t hate it, but I don’t love it. Honestly that’s just how I feel about Spy Classroom. None of the girls are particular interesting and the show is carried by Klaus and Lily. The art is so-so, and the story is typically bound to the light novel story arc structure which means bits of context from the book are probably cut for episode length purposes.If this season wasn’t so packed with good shows I’d probably would’ve kept going for a couple more episodes. I don’t think it’s too bad. If you’re interested or already watching it, go for it. Enjoy it.

I\'m not saying that pacing is the only issue with this, far from it, but it\'s the first thing that\'s apparent while watching. I did watch it while it aired which made the pacing feel worse as I had to wait a week just to find out it was another filler episode instead of finally getting back to the plot. This might not have been so bad if they had done the character introductions before the first major arc of the show, but no, the...whole plot-twist of there actually being 8 girls instead of 7 was apparently more important. The real kicker is that even if they had switched the order around, I still probably wouldn\'t have noticed that one of the characters was missing until the reveal, that\'s how forgettable everyone is. Even now, thinking back, I only really remember three of the girls that well, the main one, the one who senses misfortune, and the one who is impossibly good at disguising herself. If being so bland that I forget everything about them once the show is over was actually an advanced spy tactic, then I guess it worked on me.The one week break where this show didn\'t air because of whatever difficulties were going on in production was honestly a welcome breather. I should have used that as an excuse to stop watching but stupidly I thought it would get better as soon as the flashback part of the show was over. Considering the flashbacks take up around half the show, it\'s my fault for choosing to stick with it. The first two episodes of the next mission almost fooled me into believing that the show was getting better again, however this illusion was soon shattered once the show pulled the most random plot-twist ever and a bunch of other stupid explanations for certain events which felt completely nonsensical. I can\'t even remember whether it was properly set-up, although if it was in an early episode I can be forgiven for not remembering a minor detail about something I watched a month prior. God knows I\'m not going to re-watch it, that\'s for sure. Some of these ""spy skills"" are just straight up superpowers, like if superhumans are supposed to exist in this universe just say so, I should have an idea of what\'s within the realm of possibility before the show pulls random magic on me.Of course the show had to end with an end-credit scene cliffhanger (also the last episode is another flashback episode because whoever structured this show doesn\'t understand what a climax is). Honestly, I could not care less about this cliffhanger at all, mainly due to me not remembering anything about the character the cliffhanger was centered around anyway. I have no connection to any of these characters, the show lacks any soul that would make me care if what\'s her name is in danger or if someone else happens to be secretly evil. If they ever make a second season I won\'t be watching it, maybe I\'ll read the synopsis if I ever get curious for some reason. So overall this show is like if Spy X Family and Assassination Classroom had a child, except without any of the charm or competency of its parents. whole plot-twist of there actually being 8 girls instead of 7 was apparently more important.

Actually, it\'s more like Love Live with dark palette + The Transporter.The show centers around (initially) seven girls that, after succeeding at their spy classes, are placed into a mansion in order to fully graduate. The leader of them attends by the name of Lily. There, they meet their teacher, called Klaus. He is an experienced spy and has a dark past, that gets explored later.The story gets wings after they receive an ""Impossible Mission"" in hands. Which consists of getting information from enemy ground. The...issue is that we didn\'t have a proper time to parse the difficulty of said mission, what makes it looks easier than it was actually supposed to be. By the way, the enemy had an attractive leader, they should\'ve left her alive to generate some more waifu material, but anyways...One point that really stands out is how Spy Room hid the 8th member (Erna) masterfully. Her sudden appearance is not an ex machina; she was there all along logically. And serves as an important weapon somewhere in the plot. It was outstanding to me.However, there aren\'t just action moments. We have some slice of life sometimes, which deviates from the theme, but it gives some time to identify its members better, so I give it a pass. Thea and Lily dynamic creates some funny moments, like it did in the most recent episode. I just feel that there are a lot of characters and a short time to deal will all of them. I mean, let the idols have their spot once in a while.Klaus was a small issue to me. Mostly due to the fact that he is Steven Seagal in anime version. Or better stating, he reminds me a lot of Jason Statham in the Transporter or any other movie he did where he was a badass guy with a mean face. Except that here Klaus doesn\'t make expressions most of the time. There was one episode that he detached a tire with an acrobatic movement, and later in the same ep he dodged bullets and deflected them with a chain around him. It may sound awesome, but without proper background of his past life it just looks funny. I am actually expecting him to defuse a bomb with an anchor at this point.The action scenes do its work well. The dynamic doesn\'t bother me at all. Just keep in mind all the girls here have plot armor, which was basically said when Lily mentioned she didn\'t want anyone to get hurt. But this is a golden rule in shounen, so is not such a big issue to me. Is just that the sense of danger lessens significantly.In overall, this anime is ""okay"".

The first 3 episode had me hooked, expecting to see this team of misfits and outcasts become close friends, learning new skills and techniques to ultimately undertake and ""Impossible Mission"", which are known for having high death rates, and are essentially impossible. What you expect the anime to do, is show them learning the skills, and then over the course of the 12 episodes, show them getting closer and trusting eachother, then in the finale episode, show them undertaking the ""impossible Mission"". What does the anime actually do?Well, it has...the Impossible Mission take place in episode 3... Ok then, then surely it will have multiple arcs right? Maybe have them undertake multiple ""Impossible Missions"" or other missions that require the team to work together right?... Wrong.So far, (episode 5 at time of writing) Episode 4 and 5 take place somewhere between episode 2-3 and are just CGDCT with some ""spy"" stuff sprinkled in. It\'s completely irrelevant though because we have already seen the conclusion, and unless they are doing this and then do another arc, its a complete waste of time. Its just tons of fanservice and irrelevant things that honestly don\'t add anything to the story, because as already stated, WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE PAYOFF.Also, there is a character Erna, who is supposedly the groups secret weapon because the house was bugged, so the group act like she doesn\'t exist, to fool the people listening to think the group is actually 1 person less then there is. But, the last 2 episode have EVERYONE interacting with her, and talking to her, mentioning her... It completely contradicts what was said in EP 3.Now, I haven\'t read the LN, so I don\'t know if this is how it played out in that, or if they cut tons of content from the LN and speedran to the ending, then just put all this after it purely to make it a 12 ep season. It easily could have just been a movie, or a 3 episode anime, because, so far, the first 3 episodes are the only relevant episodes.However... If you enjoy CGDCT and some ""spy"" like stuff, this is probably for you. The show isn\'t ""bad"" by any means, its more the brainless idea to air the finale before the main substance of the story. the Impossible Mission take place in episode 3...

While I still do like the anime and I'm excited for a new villain to be introduced, we don't get to know the characters apart from flower blossom well before the impossible mission. I'm putting my trust in the producers that they have a new way to spin the story so that we'll be able to learn more about the characters but it's pretty much guaranteed that the way we'll find out is nothing like in the manga. I'm especially...concerned about how they'll handle a particular character.

Spy Classroom is about how warfare was exchanged for espionage in a fictional war. There exists a type of assignment known as an ""impossible mission"" which can often be seen as potentially life-threatening.We follow the spy Klaus who was previously a member of a spy group called Inferno. But things did not go well. He is tasked with taking seven flunkies and one of their first tasks is trying to capture him.The show is structured weirdly. The first half of the anime is the girls preparing to embark on their ""impossible mission"" with the other half being the building...up to them entering enemy territory. In some ways, it makes sense because the show actually introduces a character who was behind the scenes from the beginning. But by doing so, the show is not something that can easily be digested.Despite it being a show about spies, it can actually get boring even with the stakes because you know the characters will be fine due to foregone conclusion. That also goes into the girls\' attempts at getting the drop on Klaus but he always turns the tables on him.Seriously not since Talentless Nana have I seen something so contrived. Klaus does so many acts, it begs the question if he is even human. That whole ""he is a great spy"" can only go so far as an excuse until you have to accept that the show works in his favor.As for the other characters, aside from Lily, the other girls are underdeveloped or could be summed up with the ""ability"" they wield. The first half of the anime has them gearing up for the mission but not really interacting outside of trying to catch Klaus.

But by doing so, the show is not something that can easily be digested.Despite it being a show about spies, it can actually get boring even with the stakes because you know the characters will be fine due to foregone conclusion. That also goes into the girls\' attempts at getting the drop on Klaus but he always turns the tables on him.Seriously not since Talentless Nana have I seen something so contrived. Klaus does so many acts, it begs the question if he is even human.

Ensuite l'histoire est intéréssente bien que la plupart des missions n'étaient pas vraiment sensationnelle. Et pour finir les musiques, franchement les musiques sont incroyable surtout les musiques de fin déjà comparer aux autres animes il y en a plusieurs et en plus de ca elles sont toutes good vibes et elles sont très cool. "", '*Spoiler Warning**Author\'s Note: After nearly 4 months, I\'m finally caught up on writing reviews as this was the last show I completed before I went all in on completing this before watching/finishing any other anime. Man, what a ride has it been...*Spy Classroom was an anime I was genuinely excited for when I saw the teasers. It looked like a promising show of 7 cute anime girls with unique skills coming together to do spy stuff. I was anticipating it to be something like Spy X Family but more so in the vein of a traditional spy story. While the actual story itself was...alright, the presentation and execution of the story was abysmal. I know it\'s adapted from a light novel which I haven\'t read, but I\'d highly doubt that they executed the story in that way too. It has what honestly should\'ve been the final arc up first and goes back and forth between flashbacks (mostly devoted to the character\'s backstories) and present story depending on the episode, with the actual final arc being the next big mission which we only see one team\'s perspective on. While the season does end on an interesting cliffhanger, the telling of the actual story was a jumbled and made it frustrating to watch. Even more frustrating: we only ever really learn about half the cast and learn their backstories while the other half are essentially sidelined. Additionally, some of the ""twists"" are kind of sudden and seem pretty much shoehorned into the story for shock value. The first time was actually impressive and was done well, but after that? It felt forced. Spy Classroom has an interesting and cool story to tell and I liked the post WW1 setting (at least that\'s what I think it is), I think it\'s an under-examined timeframe in history that examines the shift in war from weapons to information. It\'s a shame its poor execution nearly derailed it because it had great potential.The anime does shine in its production value. The animation was pretty good and the fight scenes were well done. The art style is also very high quality and there were always plenty of beautiful background shots. The character design was also very well done and I\'d have to tip my hat to the animators on this. In terms of quality, I\'d dare say that it puts it in contention with the likes of AOT, Demon Slayer and Weathering With You. I\'m serious the anime *looks* that good. However I do actually have one complaint about the production value and it\'s with the voice actors. I watched the anime subbed since there\'s no dub (as far as I know at least and there wasn\'t a dubbed option when I watched it as it was coming out). Now as much as I liked them and thought they did a fine job, a lot of them had similar sounding voices (this is actually pointed out in the anime too). Now you could generally tell who was talking and there were some girls who had deeper or higher pitched voices but for the most part it\'d be kind of hard to tell who was talking if you weren\'t paying attention to the screen.The music in Spy Classroom was adequate. I did like the intro, ""Tomoshibi"". It was generally upbeat and very much suited for an action anime and it had the visuals to back it up well. As far as the outros go, Spy Classroom seemed to have half-heartedly taken a page out of Chainsaw Man\'s book and mostly had a new outro every episode which was focused on the specific girl the episode was about. There is a ""main"" outro called ""Secret Code"" and I thought it was alright. It had a somewhat somber, mysterious tone and it showed off each of the girl\'s respective skills as they\'re presumably out spying on a city. 4 of the girls got their own outro song: Erna, Sara, Sibylla and Grete. I preferred Sara\'s song the best as it was a catchy, upbeat song which is usually my music preference. Though I did enjoy the other three songs as well.The cluttered mess of the plot begins with introducing the setting\'s lore (which is actually well done): a decade after a destructive, WW1 type conflict between the Din Republic (the good guys) and Galgad Empire (the bad guys), the battlefield has shifted away from conventional warfare into a war of information and spies. Klaus, the best spy in the Din Republic and the sole survivor of the infamous spy team ""Inferno"", is given an ""impossible mission"" to retrieve a deadly bio weapon being manufactured in the heart of the Galgad Empire. Impossible Missions are essentially suicide missions given their low rate of success. So how does Kalus approach this? Well he picks 7 cute girls who are spy academy washouts, misfits and failures, but they do have heart!The plot then shifts to our mc(?) Lilly, who is granted a ""conditional graduation"" as she is assigned to Klaus\'s team. She arrives at a castle-like mansion in the countryside fashionably late due to her goofy and clumsy disposition where she meets 6 other girls sitting around wondering what they\'re doing. Klaus then reveals himself and announces that he has assembled this motley crew dubbed ""Lamplight"" for the specific task of completing the impossible mission. The girls are all pretty much convinced they\'re being sent to their deaths but Klaus vows to ""teach"" them. Klaus takes them through some basic spy maneuvers (like picking a lock) but he ends up being a really sucky teacher. He is shown to be extraordinarily skilled as a spy, but never takes the time to explain what he\'s doing or make an actual effort to teach the girls. Rather he just quickly demonstrates what he wants them to do and leaves them to struggle as he makes some abstract art in his room (which is literally just red paint splashed across a canvas). Despite some cute slice of life stuff that happens as the girls get to know each other, Lilly eventually comes to the conclusion that they\'re pretty much goners as Klaus hasn\'t taught them a single thing. Klaus spends some time with Lilly as they have a soft date around the town. Lilly pulls an impressive trap when they take a small row boat out on a lake and stuns him with nerve gas that she is resistant to due to her body\'s unique physiology where she\'s resistant to poisons (we also hear her catchphrase which is a little cringey). We then get her backstory where she was the sole survivor of a village that got gassed during the Great War and her exposure to the gas made her immune to all known forms of poison. She then decided to put her newfound ability to good use and become a spy to help people. After that revelation, Klaus commends Lilly for taking such an initiative and reveals that he had chained Lilly to the boat as it was sinking, revealing it was actually him who outsmarted her. After they get themselves out of the situation, Klaus makes Lilly the team leader of Lamplight and Klaus assures the team that he won\'t let them die on his watch. In order to ""properly teach"" them, Klaus orders the girls to successfully take him down, setting up an Assassination Classroom style scenario where the students must defeat the teacher.Lamplight gets to work and tries many times to ambush Klaus (including bum-rushing him in the shower, which was a hilarious scene), but manages to fend off each of their attempts with ease out of his Jedi-like reflexes or pure plot armor. With Lamplight\'s ambushes going nowhere, they decide to look into Klaus\'s background to see if they can exploit a weakness. We also get the exact details of this ""impossible mission"" in which Lamplight will be tasked with retrieving a bioweapon called ""Abyss Doll"", which Klaus\'s former team Inferno had died trying to steal it back. Klaus then tells his backstory to the girls and his reasons for accepting the mission which was to avenge Inferno. Lamplight infiltrates into the Galgad Empire to ascertain the location of the Abyss Doll and find it to be at this place called Endry Lab. The girls have a night out before their big mission and Klaus arrives fashionably late to find them all passed out. Klaus then has a flashback to his Inferno days where if someone sleeps in front of you, it\'s a sign of ultimate trust warming his icy and aloof heart. Klaus privately affirms he\'ll get them all back alive and he and the girls commence their infiltration.They infiltrate the complex just fine at first until they run into Gudio, who is Klaus\'s former mentor and revealed to be a traitor. He additionally sold out Inferno to the Galgad Empire that resulted in the death of the rest of the team. Guido then admits that he (somehow) had Lamplight\'s HQ bugged so they already knew their plans in advance. Lamplight takes on Guido, but are knocked out one by one despite their best efforts as Gudio is just as good as Klaus. Lilly then pulls out her own JoJo reference card and reveals that she already knew that there was a traitor and unveils her surprise: an 8th member of Lamplight who is a lolli (Lilly later nicknames her Lolli-chan which is hilarious). She jumps out of the case Lilly was carrying and stabs Gudio, wounding him. I will say that this reveal was well done and surprising, and the anime does show Klaus\'s plan to conceal Erna and as it turns out she has been in the background in several scenes, but obscured or out of focus. Klaus arrives with the Abyss Doll and hands it off to Lamplight as he covers their retreat and takes on Gudio. Klaus eventually defeats his old mentor. Before Klaus can take him back to the Din Republic, Klaus is shot at by an unknown sniper, but Guido takes the bullet for him and dies. The team makes it back to the Din Republic with Klaus holding a small funeral service for the fallen members of Inferno. The girls then finally successfully get the drop on Klaus and tie him up, declaring victory as they surround him with their weapons drawn. The girls then reveal their wish to stay together to do missions with Klaus rather than return to their old academies, which Klaus gratefully accepts. Klaus keeps the challenge ongoing as he declares they haven\'t defeated him yet as he breaks out of his restraints with ease.The next several episodes are mostly flashback episodes that look back on Lamplight\'s activities prior to their first impossible mission. They focus on Erna, Sybila and Sara with one general team episode of all the girls trying to take down Klaus.In Erna\'s episode, Erna\'s special power is revealed to be bad luck which makes accidents happen around people. Her own bad luck had rubbed off on her which held her back during her academy days, and as a result she is usually distant from everyone. Erna resolves to prove to herself that she is a capable spy and orchestrates a plan to take down Klaus. She hangs out with Klaus and leads him through the town. Her bad luck causes multiple accidents that would normally be close calls, but Klaus is able to ridiculously brush it off as if it were nothing. Klaus then reveals he knows how Erna\'s power actually works and that she purposefully puts herself in dangerous situations out of survivor\'s guilt for surviving a fire that killed her family. As Klaus and Erna have their heart to heart, they are kidnapped by a band of thugs though Klaus determines that they were hired by the other Lamplight members. The other Lamplight members arrive and help Klaus defeat the thugs. Klaus then promises Erna they will deal with whatever misfortune comes their way in what was a wholesome scene, and Erna finally feels that she has a home for the first time in a long time.In the general team episode, Lamplight decides to each try on their own to take down Klaus, but each attempt fails miserably. The highlight of this episode was that Thea convinced Lilly to put on a maid outfit in order to try to seduce Klaus. Klaus looked more confused than anything and Lilly ended up running off in embarrassment. Lilly then suggests another team effort and Grete observes that Klaus always has his meals alone. The team tails Klaus around town and determines that he\'s allergic to beef, shrimp, and dairy. The team then cooks him a meal containing those three ingredients and convince Klaus to eat it. Klaus eats the meal and reveals that he wasn\'t actually allergic to these ingredients and essentially made the girls cook him a meal (sly move, gotta tip my hat to him there). We do get to find out that Klaus is only 20 years old, so not much older than the rest of Lamplight (the oldest members are Thea and Grete, who\'re both 18. Annette and Erna are the youngest at 14). Klaus is pleased that Lamplight\'s members are bonding together, but is somberly reminded of his days with Inferno.In Sybila\'s episode, after a plan involving Lilly being an unwitting suicide chili bomber fails, Sybilia decides to take on Klaus alone. Sybila\'s ""power"" so to speak is that she\'s the brawler/gunslinger of the team. Her grand plan is to steal a classified document that Klaus is set to pick up. We also get her backstory in which she grew up as an orphan with her two siblings and became a spy to help support them and other orphans. Sybila is unable to steal Klaus\'s bag, but observes and encounters a girl named Fine who tries to steal from Klaus. Seeing some of herself in the child, Sybila is initially sympathetic until she gets her own bag stolen. Klaus then reveals to Sybilia that the real reason he\'s out and about is to try to track down a criminal who\'s been running a crime ring of orphans. Sybilia then helps Klaus on his mission and they eventually track down and apprehend the criminal and break up the crime ring. After having their heart to heart, the two spend the day together, with Sybilia trolling Klaus that they looked like a couple. Klaus trolls her back and makes her call him ""darling"" (he is a chad and a savage, there\'s no denying that). Sybilia then awkwardly offers to share a meal with Klaus, which he accepts and suspiciously steps away when Sybilia opens the box, only to reveal that she herself got pranked by Lilly. Sybilia confronts Lilly about the bomb and she trolls her, implying that Sybilia has a crush on Klaus. As Sybila angrily chases after Lilly, Klaus happily observers the chaos and is proud that the girls are capable of deceiving each other.In Sara\'s episode, it becomes apparent that Lamplight\'s repeated attacks have caused the mansion to fall into a state of disrepair, though none of them actually want to do chores to fix up the place. Sara, whose special ability is communication with animals, reveals her motivations for becoming a spy which is to earn money for her struggling family. However, she has so far struggled in her training as a spy. As such she feels she\'s only useful as a handyman and has secretly been repairing the mansion at night. After she runs into Klaus one night, Klaus determines that she\'s been the one fixing up the mansion all by herself. Though Klaus notes that this is unfair, Sara explains she doesn\'t want to bother her teammates and explains her inferiority complex. As such, Klaus challenges the rest of Lamplight to a contest with various challenges of repairing the mansion. Though Klaus easily defeats them in every contest, they do manage to put up a good effort in the final challenge of cleaning the windows. Sara skillfully employs her animals to help ferry them water. Ultimately, Sara\'s endeavor is successful and the team agrees to take the state of the mansion more seriously. Klaus and Sara have their own heart to heart, in which she realizes that the challenges were meant to show her own worth. The episode does end on a funny note: Sara has been trying to train a new puppy but it has a habit of biting people. It bites Klaus, who tries to brush it off, but we can clearly hear that he\'s in pain which is a rarity. We also get an interesting story development in which Klaus is informed that the sniper that killed Gudio was likely from Serpent, The Galgad Empire\'s top spy team.The final 5 episodes are a bit of a mix between the second impossible mission and getting to know Grete. After fending off multiple takedown attempts from Lamplight, Grete, whose specialty is disguises, takes the approach of trying to rizz up Klaus. She serves him tea privately, flirts with him, and tries to put him in high sexual tension scenarios (aka, walking in on her after she gets out of the shower, which Klaus himself seems to be momentarily stunned by (and calls her beautiful).Klaus is then given a second impossible mission which is track down and eliminate the Galgan Empire\'s top assassin named ""Corpse"", which his calling card making each of his victim\'s deaths appear to be suicides. Before going off on that mission, he is tasked with hunting down an enemy spy and takes Lilly with him. Grete then pieces together a masterplan to finally takedown Klaus. During a pursuit through an alleyway, Lilly is injured and Klaus apprehends the spy. When Klaus returns, Lilly stabs him with a poisoned needle, claiming that she asked him to. Klaus then realized that Grete disguised herself as Klaus and told Lilly to stab him when he returned so that Lilly wouldn\'t sell Lamplight out to Klaus (which she has done several times during the show and is partly the reason why the attempts fail). Lamplight then surrounds Klaus and Grete holds him at gunpoint, declaring victory. For a moment, it seems like not even Klaus will be able to get out of this one, but he does and takes down Lamplight with ease. As Klaus tires himself out as he takes on more missions, Grete convinces Klaus to start letting them help out more and he eventually relents when he learns that Grete had been writing Klaus\'s mission reports for him. Klaus also deduces that Grete has feelings for him (though that was obvious from the get go and the dude\'s social skills are something to be desired). Klaus then agrees to allow Lamplight to accompany him on his mission to take down Corpse, announcing he\'ll take the strongest 4 members. Grete also confesses her feelings for Klaus, but he agrees to wait to tell her how he feels (even though it\'s pretty safe to assume he has no romantic interest in her). Lilly and Sibyila worry they won\'t get picked and try to poison Klaus as a means of proving themselves, but Klaus dupes them into drinking their own poison. He ends up enlisting the help of Lilly, Sybilia, Grete and Sara as the ""primary team"".Klaus has Lilly, Grete and Sybilia pose as new part-time maids for Uwe Appel, an important political figure in the Din Republic, in order to protect him from Corpse while Sara runs surveillance. Klaus occasionally checks in with them. Appel turns out to be paranoid of assassinations and has a rather unpleasant personality, with him having this tick where he\'s against anything he sees as ""wasteful"". We then get to learn about Grete\'s backstory in which she is actually from a rather prestigious political family, but seems to have some sort of trauma as she gets sick around men with the exception of Klaus. Sybilia, growing tired of Appel\'s antics, sneaks into his office to find some potential blackmail material but finds out he\'s squeaky clean and an honest man (What do you know? An honest politician!). He even refuses to eat certain nutritious foods which have caused health problems for him.  Appel catches Sybila in the act and seems like he\'s trying to decide how to fire her (either verbally or with his rifle), but then realizes that Sybilia is the one who helped take down the orphan crime ring earlier in the anime. Appel opts to forgive Sybila but decides he wants to fire Lilly and Grete but Sybilia throws herself on the sword and offers to be his driver which he accepts. Corpse then attempts to assassinate Appel but misses. Klaus suddenly arrives and pursues Corpse with Lilly and Sybilia.Corpse manages to evade Lamplight. Despite this, Appel tries to live his life as normal. Olivia, the head maid, becomes increasingly suspicious of the girls. First she confronts Grete about not mingling with the guests during a part in which she avoids punishment by telling a partial lie in how she\'s in love with another man which Olivia relates to. She then notes to Appel how calm the girls are during the attempts on Appel\'s life, particularly after the second assassination attempt. However, Grete gets her to back off as Olivia herself has also been relatively calm as well. This is the part where the series introduces a whole bunch of twists which I think are ridiculous and shoehorned. Lilly, Sybilia and Sara then begin to suspect that there\'s more to the plan and confront Grete, in which she owns up that she had disguised herself as Corpse and faked the assassination attempts in order to flush out the real Corpse (Which I\'m not sure how that worked out, as far as I remember Grete was actually on screen during the assassination attempts but I may be wrong here). Olivia then enters the room, overhearing Grete\'s confession and reveals herself to be in league with Corpse. She attempts to kill them by using grenades, but the girls survive using their quick wit and skills. Lilly suggests calling Klaus for assistance but Grete reveals she was posing as Klaus as well (how?) and that he was with the other team taking on Corpse. This suggests that they weren\'t the ""primary team"" after all, but the girls resolve to handle Olivia on their own. During this episode she is also somehow able to emulate his voice perfectly, which I don\'t get how that works either.The girls battle Olivia, but she is able to beat them. We then get Olivia\'s backstory in which she was initially a consort of some sorts to a man that Corpse had killed. Corpse was about to kill her as well but she begged for her life and asked to be trained as his apprentice, and the two started a romantic relationship as well to the envy of Grete. Olivia confronts Grete on the rooftop and has her dead to rights, but successfully pulls off her trap in which she gets Appel to shoot Olivia, disarming her. Grete then reveals another secret: a disfiguring birthmark which she had used her disguise skills to hide. Klaus then arrives with a detained Corpse and Olivia loses her will to fight and surrenders. Klaus commends Grete on her dedication to hiding her birthmark and the two have a little date after the mission that Lilly sets up. At the end of the date, Klaus confirms that he doesn\'t view Grete romantically (because he\'s emo), but instead wants familial love and sees Grete and the rest of Lamplight as part of his family. He then asks Grete to reveal her birthmark to him again and he calls her beautiful, making Grete cry tears of joy. This was a truly wholesome and heartwarming scene and it definitely sends a powerful message. Without a doubt, this particular moment was one of the highpoints in the whole anime.In the final episode, which takes place in a weird timeline where some of it is before the Corpse mission and some of it is after it. Grete decides to buy a special meat pie for Lamplight and remembers that it was one of Klaus\'s favorite spots in town. However she finds that the establishment has been closed down because the baker has been pressured by a company called Mannheim Food Corporation who have been trying to get him to sell them the meat pie recipe. Realizing how important the bakery is to Klaus, she enlists the help of Lamplight to save the bakery. The plan is to con the president of the company by selling them a fake recipe. Lilly poses as the baker\'s granddaughter and ""proves"" the recipe is legit to the president. The president pays for the recipe, but then has the bright idea of pulling a gun on Lilly, who knocks him out using her gas. Following the Corpse mission, Grete takes Klaus and her team out to the bakery where they are restarting operations as the baker has taken on an apprentice. Grete and Klaus then return to the mansion later where Lilly worryingly tells them that the other team, (Thea, Monika, Anette and Erna), hasn\'t returned.The final scene of the anime is in a dark hotel room, with Thea watching over a sleeping Anette and Erna with Monika holding Thea at gun point, asking her if she is going to betray Lamplight. Thus ending on an interesting cliff hanger.Alright, now time for our spy girls!Lilly (Codename: ""Flower Garden\'\' : While she is adorable and I very much enjoy her airhead type personality, I do question her capabilities as a team leader and a spy. It kind of makes sense why she struggled in the academy. Her clumsiness aside, she has ratted out her teammate\'s takedown plans to Klaus multiple times by accepting his food bribes. Though Klaus might\'ve fended off the attacks anyway (since he has literal plot armor and Jedi senses), Lilly telling him the plans undoubtedly helped. Grete actually made it a point to manipulate her into thinking Klaus wanted to be stabbed when she took the lead on trying to defeat him. Lilly certainly has an enjoyable personality and has good chemistry with the rest of the cast and has a sympathetic backstory, but she\'s not the most competent spy and I do wonder just how she remains as Lamplight\'s leader, especially since Grete proves herself as a skilled strategist in the second half of the anime. I do suspect she may have a crush on Klaus (evidenced by the shower attack as she was blushing while avoiding looking at Klaus who was fully nude, she always sells out her teammates for him, and was super embarrassed during her maid outfit attempt to seduce him). Now granted I think all the girls have some form of attraction to Klaus, I\'m not sure if they\'re going to choose to go down that route. Lilly also seemed like she was supposed to be the main protagonist of the show, and while she\'s undoubtedly a central figure and I\'ll never be against the anime spending time on side characters, she\'s often just another +1 in the group. She also really didn\'t get her own episode, though you can make the case that the first episode technically was. I do wonder if it\'s something we\'ll get in future content. I do think her codename is very fitting and I love the lily flower in her hair, but her catchphrase: ""I\'m code name Flower Garden--and it\'s time to bloom out of control"" is kind of cringey. I rolled my eyes when I heard that the first time. She also didn\'t really experience a whole lot of character growth.Grete (Codename: ""Daughter Dearest""): I liked her character! Initially I thought she was going to be a side character but the second half of the anime really puts a lot of focus on her. She proves to be a very capable strategist and her takedown attempt on Klaus nearly worked. She may not be the strongest member of Lamplight, but her disguise skills come in handy multiple times throughout the story (even in some BS moments). She is undoubtedly smart and really contributed to Olivia\'s defeat in the final arc. I do think she would make a better fit as leader of Lamplight and I wonder if it\'ll ultimately go down that way. Her backstory isn\'t really touched upon but it does imply she has some sort of traumatic experience with men, given that she\'s only able to be around Klaus. She does have feelings for him and her confession scene, along with Klaus\'s rejection, was truly a beautiful and heartwarming moment. Her catchphrase: """"I\'m code name Daughter Dearest--now let\'s fill this time with laughter and tears"" isn\'t the worst I\'ve heard, but it\'s kind of mid. By far, Grete had the most meaningful amount of character growth out of anyone and I think she\'ll be one to watch going forward.Sybilia (Codename: ""Pandemonium""):  She was cool character and I liked her. She\'s the brawler/gunslinger of the group and like the Lilly and Grete (and the rest of the girls really), she has a sympathetic backstory and wholesome motivation for being a spy. She is kind of a hot-head and somewhat butts head with Lilly and the others from time to time, but she is a funny and enjoyable character. She has a lot of great one liners and when she gets flustered its adorable. I do think she has the coolest codename. Her catchphrase: ""I\'m code name Pandemonium--and it\'s time I cleaned you out!"" isn\'t the worst either but again I\'ve heard better. Out of everyone else\'s catchphrase, it\'s probably the best.Sara (Codename: ""Meadow""). I liked her character. I thought she was wholesome and nice. She certainly has a heart of gold and I found it adorable that she\'s an animal lover, especially her little puppy. She also gets some meaningful character growth as she finally gets some self-confidence in her and realizes she can be a capable member of Lamplight. We also get to see just how helpful her abilities are as it comes through for Lamplight on multiple occasions. Her backstory is probably the least tragic, as nobody in her family died or abandoned her (that we know of). Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Meadow--and it\'s time to run circles around them!"" is average.Erna (Codename: ""Fool""): Her introduction was certainly a surprise and she did make a pretty solid impression on me throughout the show. I did find it interesting that she was a ""hidden character"", and not even any of the promotional material featured her. They did a good job keeping her character under wraps. She technically doesn\'t have any real power but seems to habitually bring bad luck to everyone around her (except Klaus who is clearly playing on creative mode). She is a wholesome character and has a tragic backstory. She is also the token Lolli of the show, though something about her appearance reminds me of the girl from the ring. She does get some meaningful character growth similar to Sara in that she finally realizes her self-worth and begins to befriend the other Lamplight members. Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Fool--and it\'s time to kill with everything!"" is kind of creepy and foreboding, which I\'ll give credit to!Thea (Codename: ""Dreamspeaker"") : Other than the fact that she gives off some dominatrix vibes and is very attractive, we get to learn very little about her character, which I was disappointed in. She seemed like an interesting character and strikes me as one of the more ""mature"" members of Lamplight. As such she\'s the ""seduction"" expert of the group. I hope we get to learn more about her in future content. Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Dreamspeaker--and it\'s time to lure them to their ruin."" is pretty cool and she does have an interesting codename that I think suits her very well from the little we see of her. The final scene in the last episode seems to imply something is going on with her as Monika asked her if she was going to betray Lamplight, so I guess we\'ll have to wait and see what her deal is.Annette (Codename: ""Forgetter\'\'): She\'s one character I was really hoping to learn about, particularly since she happens to remind me of DDLC character named Natsuki who she shares a striking resemblance with (aside from the eyepatch and different colored eyes). She seems to be the demolition expert and is usually pretty wild. But we know next to nothing about her. She also talks very casually and in slang, which sets her apart from the rest of the group. I was disappointed that she didn\'t really get too much screen time but it does seem like Season 2 will explore her character. Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Forgetter--and it\'s time to put it all together yo \'\' doesn\'t really make a whole lot of sense to me and I wish it was a little more explosive sounding.Monika (Codename: ""Glint""): Also another character who seemed pretty interesting, and who I was interested in learning more about partially because her name is the same as another DDLC character who is also named Monika. She seems to have a rather cold and aggressive disposition like Sybilia, but not as vocal. Her specialty is some kind of special mirror use. Her catchphrase: ""I\'m code name Glint--now, let\'s harbor love for as long as we can."" is kind of lame and I don\'t know what exactly she\'s trying to reference here, but again we have next to no knowledge on her character. She does seem to suspect Thea is going to betray Lamplight so we\'ll see what happens there.Klaus: This dude has plot armor up the wazoo. Other than his fight with Guido, he rarely suffers a blow. I understand that he\'s the best of the best and was trained that way, but his feats are ridiculously superhuman and he gets out of way too many situations when Lamplight has his back to the wall. It\'s purely plot convenience that the girls haven\'t defeated him yet as he says ""How much longer should I play along in this game?"" before he gets out of whatever situation and turns the tables. Other than his outings with various members of Lamplight which are undoubtedly helpful to their own personal growth and shows that Klaus does indeed value them, his whole teaching style is ""trial by fire"" and he never actually teaches the girls anything skills wise. Instead he lets them figure it out for themselves, which is fine in some instances but he\'s supposed to train them to take on the hardest possible missions and from what we\'re shown during the ""training"" moments, it\'s purely plot armor that Lamplight survived their first mission.Guido: He was an impressive adversary and is the only character so far that was ever a match for Klaus and probably would\'ve won had Erna not stabbed him. They never got into his reasoning why he decided to switch sides which I feel like is a pretty big thing to leave out and we mostly learn about him through Klaus\'s background and man was a harsh teacher. Ultimately he did have a good bond with Klaus and made him into the spy he is today, so he clearly is an effective teacher despite his harsh methods. I feel like he could\'ve been a good long-term adversary for Lamplight to deal with but his debut is cut rather short as he\'s sniped.Olivia: I thought she made for a good main villain and served as a good foil to Grete\'s character. She is certainly a ruthless and cunning adversary and if it wasn\'t for Grete\'s skillful planning, she would\'ve completed her mission of assassinating Appel. She folds Lilly and Sybilia (probably Lamplight\'s strongest member) like lawn chairs and had Grete dead to rights. Though I did come to suspect that she was in league with Corpse, it was kind of obvious. Still, I enjoyed her as a villain.Spy Classroom was an anime that looked promising and I personally had high hopes for, but I was generally disappointed in it. It chose to tell its story in an out of order sequence of events and relied heavily on flashbacks and plot twists. It\'s like they tried to be like Attack on Titan through their use of getting to a certain event and then backtracking to explain how it happened (which I wasn\'t even a fan of AOT telling their story like that but I digress), but they couldn\'t match the level of writing necessary and it seemed like the anime didn\'t know what was the story it was trying to tell. While the first couple of plot twists were impressively done and caught me off-guard, after a while it got to be where it really felt like things were happening solely because the plot demanded.The story of Spy Classroom itself was decent. It had some cool action scenes and wholesome, slice of life moments and the characters were generally enjoyable. The biggest thing that holds this anime back is its execution, it was something to be desired. I also didn\'t mind them spending some time with the side characters and allowing them to have some character growth themselves, but the only characters who really experienced any form of character development were Klaus, Grete, Sara and Erna. We did get Sybilia\'s backstory but she remains roughly the same character. Ditto for Lilly. Meanwhile Annette, Monika and Thea were largely sidelined in the story. It\'s a big cast and there\'s only some much limelight to go around, but they should\'ve taken an all or one approach, but I imagine their stories will be explored in future content.Now Season 2 of this anime is premiering next month. I\'ll give it a watch but I can\'t say I have particularly high hopes for the anime improving. I hope I\'m wrong and hope that the producers learned their lesson and will stick to a more consistent way of telling the story and not use their current approach. The anime has a cool set up, interesting characters and it least seems like it has a general idea of what it wants to do, but the direction is all over the place.All in all, there\'s some things that are certainly enjoyable in this anime, but it has just as much going against it as it does going for it thanks to shoehorned and forced plot twists and a sloppy way of storytelling. It has potential to be good and the producers can certainly turn it around and it remains to be seen if they\'ll take the lessons they learned from Season 1 or not. alright, the presentation and execution of the story was abysmal. I know it\'s adapted from a light novel which I haven\'t read, but I\'d highly doubt that they executed the story in that way too. It has what honestly should\'ve been the final arc up first and goes back and forth between flashbacks (mostly devoted to the character\'s backstories) and present story depending on the episode, with the actual final arc being the next big mission which we only see one team\'s perspective on. While the season does end on an interesting cliffhanger, the telling of the actual story was a jumbled and made it frustrating to watch. Even more frustrating: we only ever really learn about half the cast and learn their backstories while the other half are essentially sidelined. Additionally, some of the ""twists"" are kind of sudden and seem pretty much shoehorned into the story for shock value. The first time was actually impressive and was done well, but after that? It felt forced. Spy Classroom has an interesting and cool story to tell and I liked the post WW1 setting (at least that\'s what I think it is), I think it\'s an under-examined timeframe in history that examines the shift in war from weapons to information. It\'s a shame its poor execution nearly derailed it because it had great potential.The anime does shine in its production value. The animation was pretty good and the fight scenes were well done. The art style is also very high quality and there were always plenty of beautiful background shots. The character design was also very well done and I\'d have to tip my hat to the animators on this. In terms of quality, I\'d dare say that it puts it in contention with the likes of AOT, Demon Slayer and Weathering With You. I\'m serious the anime *looks* that good. However I do actually have one complaint about the production value and it\'s with the voice actors. I watched the anime subbed since there\'s no dub (as far as I know at least and there wasn\'t a dubbed option when I watched it as it was coming out). Now as much as I liked them and thought they did a fine job, a lot of them had similar sounding voices (this is actually pointed out in the anime too). Now you could generally tell who was talking and there were some girls who had deeper or higher pitched voices but for the most part it\'d be kind of hard to tell who was talking if you weren\'t paying attention to the screen.The music in Spy Classroom was adequate. I did like the intro, ""Tomoshibi"". It was generally upbeat and very much suited for an action anime and it had the visuals to back it up well. As far as the outros go, Spy Classroom seemed to have half-heartedly taken a page out of Chainsaw Man\'s book and mostly had a new outro every episode which was focused on the specific girl the episode was about. There is a ""main"" outro called ""Secret Code"" and I thought it was alright. It had a somewhat somber, mysterious tone and it showed off each of the girl\'s respective skills as they\'re presumably out spying on a city. 4 of the girls got their own outro song: Erna, Sara, Sibylla and Grete. I preferred Sara\'s song the best as it was a catchy, upbeat song which is usually my music preference. Though I did enjoy the other three songs as well.The cluttered mess of the plot begins with introducing the setting\'s lore (which is actually well done): a decade after a destructive, WW1 type conflict between the Din Republic (the good guys) and Galgad Empire (the bad guys), the battlefield has shifted away from conventional warfare into a war of information and spies. Klaus, the best spy in the Din Republic and the sole survivor of the infamous spy team ""Inferno"", is given an ""impossible mission"" to retrieve a deadly bio weapon being manufactured in the heart of the Galgad Empire. Impossible Missions are essentially suicide missions given their low rate of success. So how does Kalus approach this? Well he picks 7 cute girls who are spy academy washouts, misfits and failures, but they do have heart!The plot then shifts to our mc(?) Lilly, who is granted a ""conditional graduation"" as she is assigned to Klaus\'s team. She arrives at a castle-like mansion in the countryside fashionably late due to her goofy and clumsy disposition where she meets 6 other girls sitting around wondering what they\'re doing. Klaus then reveals himself and announces that he has assembled this motley crew dubbed ""Lamplight"" for the specific task of completing the impossible mission. The girls are all pretty much convinced they\'re being sent to their deaths but Klaus vows to ""teach"" them. Klaus takes them through some basic spy maneuvers (like picking a lock) but he ends up being a really sucky teacher. He is shown to be extraordinarily skilled as a spy, but never takes the time to explain what he\'s doing or make an actual effort to teach the girls. Rather he just quickly demonstrates what he wants them to do and leaves them to struggle as he makes some abstract art in his room (which is literally just red paint splashed across a canvas). Despite some cute slice of life stuff that happens as the girls get to know each other, Lilly eventually comes to the conclusion that they\'re pretty much goners as Klaus hasn\'t taught them a single thing. Klaus spends some time with Lilly as they have a soft date around the town. Lilly pulls an impressive trap when they take a small row boat out on a lake and stuns him with nerve gas that she is resistant to due to her body\'s unique physiology where she\'s resistant to poisons (we also hear her catchphrase which is a little cringey). We then get her backstory where she was the sole survivor of a village that got gassed during the Great War and her exposure to the gas made her immune to all known forms of poison. She then decided to put her newfound ability to good use and become a spy to help people. After that revelation, Klaus commends Lilly for taking such an initiative and reveals that he had chained Lilly to the boat as it was sinking, revealing it was actually him who outsmarted her. After they get themselves out of the situation, Klaus makes Lilly the team leader of Lamplight and Klaus assures the team that he won\'t let them die on his watch. In order to ""properly teach"" them, Klaus orders the girls to successfully take him down, setting up an Assassination Classroom style scenario where the students must defeat the teacher.Lamplight gets to work and tries many times to ambush Klaus (including bum-rushing him in the shower, which was a hilarious scene), but manages to fend off each of their attempts with ease out of his Jedi-like reflexes or pure plot armor. With Lamplight\'s ambushes going nowhere, they decide to look into Klaus\'s background to see if they can exploit a weakness. We also get the exact details of this ""impossible mission"" in which Lamplight will be tasked with retrieving a bioweapon called ""Abyss Doll"", which Klaus\'s former team Inferno had died trying to steal it back. Klaus then tells his backstory to the girls and his reasons for accepting the mission which was to avenge Inferno. Lamplight infiltrates into the Galgad Empire to ascertain the location of the Abyss Doll and find it to be at this place called Endry Lab. The girls have a night out before their big mission and Klaus arrives fashionably late to find them all passed out. Klaus then has a flashback to his Inferno days where if someone sleeps in front of you, it\'s a sign of ultimate trust warming his icy and aloof heart. Klaus privately affirms he\'ll get them all back alive and he and the girls commence their infiltration.They infiltrate the complex just fine at first until they run into Gudio, who is Klaus\'s former mentor and revealed to be a traitor. He additionally sold out Inferno to the Galgad Empire that resulted in the death of the rest of the team. Guido then admits that he (somehow) had Lamplight\'s HQ bugged so they already knew their plans in advance. Lamplight takes on Guido, but are knocked out one by one despite their best efforts as Gudio is just as good as Klaus. Lilly then pulls out her own JoJo reference card and reveals that she already knew that there was a traitor and unveils her surprise: an 8th member of Lamplight who is a lolli (Lilly later nicknames her Lolli-chan which is hilarious). She jumps out of the case Lilly was carrying and stabs Gudio, wounding him. I will say that this reveal was well done and surprising, and the anime does show Klaus\'s plan to conceal Erna and as it turns out she has been in the background in several scenes, but obscured or out of focus. Klaus arrives with the Abyss Doll and hands it off to Lamplight as he covers their retreat and takes on Gudio. Klaus eventually defeats his old mentor. Before Klaus can take him back to the Din Republic, Klaus is shot at by an unknown sniper, but Guido takes the bullet for him and dies. The team makes it back to the Din Republic with Klaus holding a small funeral service for the fallen members of Inferno. The girls then finally successfully get the drop on Klaus and tie him up, declaring victory as they surround him with their weapons drawn. The girls then reveal their wish to stay together to do missions with Klaus rather than return to their old academies, which Klaus gratefully accepts. Klaus keeps the challenge ongoing as he declares they haven\'t defeated him yet as he breaks out of his restraints with ease.The next several episodes are mostly flashback episodes that look back on Lamplight\'s activities prior to their first impossible mission. They focus on Erna, Sybila and Sara with one general team episode of all the girls trying to take down Klaus.In Erna\'s episode, Erna\'s special power is revealed to be bad luck which makes accidents happen around people. Her own bad luck had rubbed off on her which held her back during her academy days, and as a result she is usually distant from everyone. Erna resolves to prove to herself that she is a capable spy and orchestrates a plan to take down Klaus. She hangs out with Klaus and leads him through the town. Her bad luck causes multiple accidents that would normally be close calls, but Klaus is able to ridiculously brush it off as if it were nothing. Klaus then reveals he knows how Erna\'s power actually works and that she purposefully puts herself in dangerous situations out of survivor\'s guilt for surviving a fire that killed her family. As Klaus and Erna have their heart to heart, they are kidnapped by a band of thugs though Klaus determines that they were hired by the other Lamplight members. The other Lamplight members arrive and help Klaus defeat the thugs. Klaus then promises Erna they will deal with whatever misfortune comes their way in what was a wholesome scene, and Erna finally feels that she has a home for the first time in a long time.In the general team episode, Lamplight decides to each try on their own to take down Klaus, but each attempt fails miserably. The highlight of this episode was that Thea convinced Lilly to put on a maid outfit in order to try to seduce Klaus. Klaus looked more confused than anything and Lilly ended up running off in embarrassment. Lilly then suggests another team effort and Grete observes that Klaus always has his meals alone. The team tails Klaus around town and determines that he\'s allergic to beef, shrimp, and dairy. The team then cooks him a meal containing those three ingredients and convince Klaus to eat it. Klaus eats the meal and reveals that he wasn\'t actually allergic to these ingredients and essentially made the girls cook him a meal (sly move, gotta tip my hat to him there). We do get to find out that Klaus is only 20 years old, so not much older than the rest of Lamplight (the oldest members are Thea and Grete, who\'re both 18. Annette and Erna are the youngest at 14). Klaus is pleased that Lamplight\'s members are bonding together, but is somberly reminded of his days with Inferno.In Sybila\'s episode, after a plan involving Lilly being an unwitting suicide chili bomber fails, Sybilia decides to take on Klaus alone. Sybila\'s ""power"" so to speak is that she\'s the brawler/gunslinger of the team. Her grand plan is to steal a classified document that Klaus is set to pick up. We also get her backstory in which she grew up as an orphan with her two siblings and became a spy to help support them and other orphans. Sybila is unable to steal Klaus\'s bag, but observes and encounters a girl named Fine who tries to steal from Klaus. Seeing some of herself in the child, Sybila is initially sympathetic until she gets her own bag stolen. Klaus then reveals to Sybilia that the real reason he\'s out and about is to try to track down a criminal who\'s been running a crime ring of orphans. Sybilia then helps Klaus on his mission and they eventually track down and apprehend the criminal and break up the crime ring. After having their heart to heart, the two spend the day together, with Sybilia trolling Klaus that they looked like a couple. Klaus trolls her back and makes her call him ""darling"" (he is a chad and a savage, there\'s no denying that). Sybilia then awkwardly offers to share a meal with Klaus, which he accepts and suspiciously steps away when Sybilia opens the box, only to reveal that she herself got pranked by Lilly. Sybilia confronts Lilly about the bomb and she trolls her, implying that Sybilia has a crush on Klaus. As Sybila angrily chases after Lilly, Klaus happily observers the chaos and is proud that the girls are capable of deceiving each other.In Sara\'s episode, it becomes apparent that Lamplight\'s repeated attacks have caused the mansion to fall into a state of disrepair, though none of them actually want to do chores to fix up the place. Sara, whose special ability is communication with animals, reveals her motivations for becoming a spy which is to earn money for her struggling family. However, she has so far struggled in her training as a spy. As such she feels she\'s only useful as a handyman and has secretly been repairing the mansion at night. After she runs into Klaus one night, Klaus determines that she\'s been the one fixing up the mansion all by herself. Though Klaus notes that this is unfair, Sara explains she doesn\'t want to bother her teammates and explains her inferiority complex. As such, Klaus challenges the rest of Lamplight to a contest with various challenges of repairing the mansion. Though Klaus easily defeats them in every contest, they do manage to put up a good effort in the final challenge of cleaning the windows. Sara skillfully employs her animals to help ferry them water. Ultimately, Sara\'s endeavor is successful and the team agrees to take the state of the mansion more seriously. Klaus and Sara have their own heart to heart, in which she realizes that the challenges were meant to show her own worth. The episode does end on a funny note: Sara has been trying to train a new puppy but it has a habit of biting people. It bites Klaus, who tries to brush it off, but we can clearly hear that he\'s in pain which is a rarity. We also get an interesting story development in which Klaus is informed that the sniper that killed Gudio was likely from Serpent, The Galgad Empire\'s top spy team.The final 5 episodes are a bit of a mix between the second impossible mission and getting to know Grete. After fending off multiple takedown attempts from Lamplight, Grete, whose specialty is disguises, takes the approach of trying to rizz up Klaus. She serves him tea privately, flirts with him, and tries to put him in high sexual tension scenarios (aka, walking in on her after she gets out of the shower, which Klaus himself seems to be momentarily stunned by (and calls her beautiful).Klaus is then given a second impossible mission which is track down and eliminate the Galgan Empire\'s top assassin named ""Corpse"", which his calling card making each of his victim\'s deaths appear to be suicides. Before going off on that mission, he is tasked with hunting down an enemy spy and takes Lilly with him. Grete then pieces together a masterplan to finally takedown Klaus. During a pursuit through an alleyway, Lilly is injured and Klaus apprehends the spy. When Klaus returns, Lilly stabs him with a poisoned needle, claiming that she asked him to. Klaus then realized that Grete disguised herself as Klaus and told Lilly to stab him when he returned so that Lilly wouldn\'t sell Lamplight out to Klaus (which she has done several times during the show and is partly the reason why the attempts fail). Lamplight then surrounds Klaus and Grete holds him at gunpoint, declaring victory. For a moment, it seems like not even Klaus will be able to get out of this one, but he does and takes down Lamplight with ease. As Klaus tires himself out as he takes on more missions, Grete convinces Klaus to start letting them help out more and he eventually relents when he learns that Grete had been writing Klaus\'s mission reports for him. Klaus also deduces that Grete has feelings for him (though that was obvious from the get go and the dude\'s social skills are something to be desired). Klaus then agrees to allow Lamplight to accompany him on his mission to take down Corpse, announcing he\'ll take the strongest 4 members. Grete also confesses her feelings for Klaus, but he agrees to wait to tell her how he feels (even though it\'s pretty safe to assume he has no romantic interest in her). Lilly and Sibyila worry they won\'t get picked and try to poison Klaus as a means of proving themselves, but Klaus dupes them into drinking their own poison. He ends up enlisting the help of Lilly, Sybilia, Grete and Sara as the ""primary team"".Klaus has Lilly, Grete and Sybilia pose as new part-time maids for Uwe Appel, an important political figure in the Din Republic, in order to protect him from Corpse while Sara runs surveillance. Klaus occasionally checks in with them. Appel turns out to be paranoid of assassinations and has a rather unpleasant personality, with him having this tick where he\'s against anything he sees as ""wasteful"". We then get to learn about Grete\'s backstory in which she is actually from a rather prestigious political family, but seems to have some sort of trauma as she gets sick around men with the exception of Klaus. Sybilia, growing tired of Appel\'s antics, sneaks into his office to find some potential blackmail material but finds out he\'s squeaky clean and an honest man (What do you know? An honest politician!). He even refuses to eat certain nutritious foods which have caused health problems for him.  Appel catches Sybila in the act and seems like he\'s trying to decide how to fire her (either verbally or with his rifle), but then realizes that Sybilia is the one who helped take down the orphan crime ring earlier in the anime. Appel opts to forgive Sybila but decides he wants to fire Lilly and Grete but Sybilia throws herself on the sword and offers to be his driver which he accepts. Corpse then attempts to assassinate Appel but misses. Klaus suddenly arrives and pursues Corpse with Lilly and Sybilia.Corpse manages to evade Lamplight. Despite this, Appel tries to live his life as normal. Olivia, the head maid, becomes increasingly suspicious of the girls. First she confronts Grete about not mingling with the guests during a part in which she avoids punishment by telling a partial lie in how she\'s in love with another man which Olivia relates to. She then notes to Appel how calm the girls are during the attempts on Appel\'s life, particularly after the second assassination attempt. However, Grete gets her to back off as Olivia herself has also been relatively calm as well. This is the part where the series introduces a whole bunch of twists which I think are ridiculous and shoehorned. Lilly, Sybilia and Sara then begin to suspect that there\'s more to the plan and confront Grete, in which she owns up that she had disguised herself as Corpse and faked the assassination attempts in order to flush out the real Corpse (Which I\'m not sure how that worked out, as far as I remember Grete was actually on screen during the assassination attempts but I may be wrong here). Olivia then enters the room, overhearing Grete\'s confession and reveals herself to be in league with Corpse. She attempts to kill them by using grenades, but the girls survive using their quick wit and skills. Lilly suggests calling Klaus for assistance but Grete reveals she was posing as Klaus as well (how?) and that he was with the other team taking on Corpse. This suggests that they weren\'t the ""primary team"" after all, but the girls resolve to handle Olivia on their own. During this episode she is also somehow able to emulate his voice perfectly, which I don\'t get how that works either.The girls battle Olivia, but she is able to beat them. We then get Olivia\'s backstory in which she was initially a consort of some sorts to a man that Corpse had killed. Corpse was about to kill her as well but she begged for her life and asked to be trained as his apprentice, and the two started a romantic relationship as well to the envy of Grete. Olivia confronts Grete on the rooftop and has her dead to rights, but successfully pulls off her trap in which she gets Appel to shoot Olivia, disarming her. Grete then reveals another secret: a disfiguring birthmark which she had used her disguise skills to hide. Klaus then arrives with a detained Corpse and Olivia loses her will to fight and surrenders. Klaus commends Grete on her dedication to hiding her birthmark and the two have a little date after the mission that Lilly sets up. At the end of the date, Klaus confirms that he doesn\'t view Grete romantically (because he\'s emo), but instead wants familial love and sees Grete and the rest of Lamplight as part of his family. He then asks Grete to reveal her birthmark to him again and he calls her beautiful, making Grete cry tears of joy. This was a truly wholesome and heartwarming scene and it definitely sends a powerful message. Without a doubt, this particular moment was one of the highpoints in the whole anime.In the final episode, which takes place in a weird timeline where some of it is before the Corpse mission and some of it is after it. Grete decides to buy a special meat pie for Lamplight and remembers that it was one of Klaus\'s favorite spots in town. However she finds that the establishment has been closed down because the baker has been pressured by a company called Mannheim Food Corporation who have been trying to get him to sell them the meat pie recipe. Realizing how important the bakery is to Klaus, she enlists the help of Lamplight to save the bakery. The plan is to con the president of the company by selling them a fake recipe. Lilly poses as the baker\'s granddaughter and ""proves"" the recipe is legit to the president. The president pays for the recipe, but then has the bright idea of pulling a gun on Lilly, who knocks him out using her gas. Following the Corpse mission, Grete takes Klaus and her team out to the bakery where they are restarting operations as the baker has taken on an apprentice. Grete and Klaus then return to the mansion later where Lilly worryingly tells them that the other team, (Thea, Monika, Anette and Erna), hasn\'t returned.The final scene of the anime is in a dark hotel room, with Thea watching over a sleeping Anette and Erna with Monika holding Thea at gun point, asking her if she is going to betray Lamplight. Thus ending on an interesting cliff hanger.Alright, now time for our spy girls!Lilly (Codename: ""Flower Garden\'\' : While she is adorable and I very much enjoy her airhead type personality, I do question her capabilities as a team leader and a spy. It kind of makes sense why she struggled in the academy. Her clumsiness aside, she has ratted out her teammate\'s takedown plans to Klaus multiple times by accepting his food bribes. Though Klaus might\'ve fended off the attacks anyway (since he has literal plot armor and Jedi senses), Lilly telling him the plans undoubtedly helped. Grete actually made it a point to manipulate her into thinking Klaus wanted to be stabbed when she took the lead on trying to defeat him. Lilly certainly has an enjoyable personality and has good chemistry with the rest of the cast and has a sympathetic backstory, but she\'s not the most competent spy and I do wonder just how she remains as Lamplight\'s leader, especially since Grete proves herself as a skilled strategist in the second half of the anime. I do suspect she may have a crush on Klaus (evidenced by the shower attack as she was blushing while avoiding looking at Klaus who was fully nude, she always sells out her teammates for him, and was super embarrassed during her maid outfit attempt to seduce him). Now granted I think all the girls have some form of attraction to Klaus, I\'m not sure if they\'re going to choose to go down that route. Lilly also seemed like she was supposed to be the main protagonist of the show, and while she\'s undoubtedly a central figure and I\'ll never be against the anime spending time on side characters, she\'s often just another +1 in the group. She also really didn\'t get her own episode, though you can make the case that the first episode technically was. I do wonder if it\'s something we\'ll get in future content. I do think her codename is very fitting and I love the lily flower in her hair, but her catchphrase: ""I\'m code name Flower Garden--and it\'s time to bloom out of control"" is kind of cringey. I rolled my eyes when I heard that the first time. She also didn\'t really experience a whole lot of character growth.Grete (Codename: ""Daughter Dearest""): I liked her character! Initially I thought she was going to be a side character but the second half of the anime really puts a lot of focus on her. She proves to be a very capable strategist and her takedown attempt on Klaus nearly worked. She may not be the strongest member of Lamplight, but her disguise skills come in handy multiple times throughout the story (even in some BS moments). She is undoubtedly smart and really contributed to Olivia\'s defeat in the final arc. I do think she would make a better fit as leader of Lamplight and I wonder if it\'ll ultimately go down that way. Her backstory isn\'t really touched upon but it does imply she has some sort of traumatic experience with men, given that she\'s only able to be around Klaus. She does have feelings for him and her confession scene, along with Klaus\'s rejection, was truly a beautiful and heartwarming moment. Her catchphrase: """"I\'m code name Daughter Dearest--now let\'s fill this time with laughter and tears"" isn\'t the worst I\'ve heard, but it\'s kind of mid. By far, Grete had the most meaningful amount of character growth out of anyone and I think she\'ll be one to watch going forward.Sybilia (Codename: ""Pandemonium""):  She was cool character and I liked her. She\'s the brawler/gunslinger of the group and like the Lilly and Grete (and the rest of the girls really), she has a sympathetic backstory and wholesome motivation for being a spy. She is kind of a hot-head and somewhat butts head with Lilly and the others from time to time, but she is a funny and enjoyable character. She has a lot of great one liners and when she gets flustered its adorable. I do think she has the coolest codename. Her catchphrase: ""I\'m code name Pandemonium--and it\'s time I cleaned you out!"" isn\'t the worst either but again I\'ve heard better. Out of everyone else\'s catchphrase, it\'s probably the best.Sara (Codename: ""Meadow""). I liked her character. I thought she was wholesome and nice. She certainly has a heart of gold and I found it adorable that she\'s an animal lover, especially her little puppy. She also gets some meaningful character growth as she finally gets some self-confidence in her and realizes she can be a capable member of Lamplight. We also get to see just how helpful her abilities are as it comes through for Lamplight on multiple occasions. Her backstory is probably the least tragic, as nobody in her family died or abandoned her (that we know of). Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Meadow--and it\'s time to run circles around them!"" is average.Erna (Codename: ""Fool""): Her introduction was certainly a surprise and she did make a pretty solid impression on me throughout the show. I did find it interesting that she was a ""hidden character"", and not even any of the promotional material featured her. They did a good job keeping her character under wraps. She technically doesn\'t have any real power but seems to habitually bring bad luck to everyone around her (except Klaus who is clearly playing on creative mode). She is a wholesome character and has a tragic backstory. She is also the token Lolli of the show, though something about her appearance reminds me of the girl from the ring. She does get some meaningful character growth similar to Sara in that she finally realizes her self-worth and begins to befriend the other Lamplight members. Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Fool--and it\'s time to kill with everything!"" is kind of creepy and foreboding, which I\'ll give credit to!Thea (Codename: ""Dreamspeaker"") : Other than the fact that she gives off some dominatrix vibes and is very attractive, we get to learn very little about her character, which I was disappointed in. She seemed like an interesting character and strikes me as one of the more ""mature"" members of Lamplight. As such she\'s the ""seduction"" expert of the group. I hope we get to learn more about her in future content. Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Dreamspeaker--and it\'s time to lure them to their ruin."" is pretty cool and she does have an interesting codename that I think suits her very well from the little we see of her. The final scene in the last episode seems to imply something is going on with her as Monika asked her if she was going to betray Lamplight, so I guess we\'ll have to wait and see what her deal is.Annette (Codename: ""Forgetter\'\'): She\'s one character I was really hoping to learn about, particularly since she happens to remind me of DDLC character named Natsuki who she shares a striking resemblance with (aside from the eyepatch and different colored eyes). She seems to be the demolition expert and is usually pretty wild. But we know next to nothing about her. She also talks very casually and in slang, which sets her apart from the rest of the group. I was disappointed that she didn\'t really get too much screen time but it does seem like Season 2 will explore her character. Her catchphrase ""I\'m code name Forgetter--and it\'s time to put it all together yo \'\' doesn\'t really make a whole lot of sense to me and I wish it was a little more explosive sounding.Monika (Codename: ""Glint""): Also another character who seemed pretty interesting, and who I was interested in learning more about partially because her name is the same as another DDLC character who is also named Monika. She seems to have a rather cold and aggressive disposition like Sybilia, but not as vocal. Her specialty is some kind of special mirror use. Her catchphrase: ""I\'m code name Glint--now, let\'s harbor love for as long as we can."" is kind of lame and I don\'t know what exactly she\'s trying to reference here, but again we have next to no knowledge on her character. She does seem to suspect Thea is going to betray Lamplight so we\'ll see what happens there.Klaus: This dude has plot armor up the wazoo. Other than his fight with Guido, he rarely suffers a blow. I understand that he\'s the best of the best and was trained that way, but his feats are ridiculously superhuman and he gets out of way too many situations when Lamplight has his back to the wall. It\'s purely plot convenience that the girls haven\'t defeated him yet as he says ""How much longer should I play along in this game?"" before he gets out of whatever situation and turns the tables. Other than his outings with various members of Lamplight which are undoubtedly helpful to their own personal growth and shows that Klaus does indeed value them, his whole teaching style is ""trial by fire"" and he never actually teaches the girls anything skills wise. Instead he lets them figure it out for themselves, which is fine in some instances but he\'s supposed to train them to take on the hardest possible missions and from what we\'re shown during the ""training"" moments, it\'s purely plot armor that Lamplight survived their first mission.Guido: He was an impressive adversary and is the only character so far that was ever a match for Klaus and probably would\'ve won had Erna not stabbed him. They never got into his reasoning why he decided to switch sides which I feel like is a pretty big thing to leave out and we mostly learn about him through Klaus\'s background and man was a harsh teacher. Ultimately he did have a good bond with Klaus and made him into the spy he is today, so he clearly is an effective teacher despite his harsh methods. I feel like he could\'ve been a good long-term adversary for Lamplight to deal with but his debut is cut rather short as he\'s sniped.Olivia: I thought she made for a good main villain and served as a good foil to Grete\'s character. She is certainly a ruthless and cunning adversary and if it wasn\'t for Grete\'s skillful planning, she would\'ve completed her mission of assassinating Appel. She folds Lilly and Sybilia (probably Lamplight\'s strongest member) like lawn chairs and had Grete dead to rights. Though I did come to suspect that she was in league with Corpse, it was kind of obvious. Still, I enjoyed her as a villain.Spy Classroom was an anime that looked promising and I personally had high hopes for, but I was generally disappointed in it. It chose to tell its story in an out of order sequence of events and relied heavily on flashbacks and plot twists. It\'s like they tried to be like Attack on Titan through their use of getting to a certain event and then backtracking to explain how it happened (which I wasn\'t even a fan of AOT telling their story like that but I digress), but they couldn\'t match the level of writing necessary and it seemed like the anime didn\'t know what was the story it was trying to tell. While the first couple of plot twists were impressively done and caught me off-guard, after a while it got to be where it really felt like things were happening solely because the plot demanded.The story of Spy Classroom itself was decent. It had some cool action scenes and wholesome, slice of life moments and the characters were generally enjoyable. The biggest thing that holds this anime back is its execution, it was something to be desired. I also didn\'t mind them spending some time with the side characters and allowing them to have some character growth themselves, but the only characters who really experienced any form of character development were Klaus, Grete, Sara and Erna. We did get Sybilia\'s backstory but she remains roughly the same character. Ditto for Lilly. Meanwhile Annette, Monika and Thea were largely sidelined in the story. It\'s a big cast and there\'s only some much limelight to go around, but they should\'ve taken an all or one approach, but I imagine their stories will be explored in future content.Now Season 2 of this anime is premiering next month. I\'ll give it a watch but I can\'t say I have particularly high hopes for the anime improving. I hope I\'m wrong and hope that the producers learned their lesson and will stick to a more consistent way of telling the story and not use their current approach. The anime has a cool set up, interesting characters and it least seems like it has a general idea of what it wants to do, but the direction is all over the place.All in all, there\'s some things that are certainly enjoyable in this anime, but it has just as much going against it as it does going for it thanks to shoehorned and forced plot twists and a sloppy way of storytelling. It has potential to be good and the producers can certainly turn it around and it remains to be seen if they\'ll take the lessons they learned from Season 1 or not.', ""Almost dropped it due to the first three episodes. Made me laugh that the plot just jumps every time. I understood its purpose in the end so it's kind of okay but still, as a viewer for the first 3 episodes at that time, it actually appalled me how the story became so jumpy that it tempted me to drop it. Lily actually made me stay but it's a good thing I stayed. I enjoyed the story. Just kind of expecting more about their fight scenes. I understand they are more spies than assassins so they should be more on the mission than killing or...knocking out their enemies, but still, should have provided more.Anyways, nice cliff hang on the last episode so I'm gonna go to season 2. Just hope that I don't see like harem thing afterward since I actually did not like the Klaus and Grete pair, nor with any of the girls. I actually see Klaus almost as their guardian so it irks me if there's romance that's brewing between them. knocking out their enemies, but still, should have provided more.Anyways, nice cliff hang on the last episode so I'm gonna go to season 2.

This anime is a masterpiece.Most other negative reviewers did not understand what this anime is about, they probably are the kind of people who don't get sarcasm either if you catch my drift.This anime is satire. We live in a world where every season that comes around, a dozen of isekai are making their way through. This anime is insanely satire, at a point where if you've seen a couple of isekais yourself, you'll have a lot of fun watching this. My advice is challenge yourself to count the tropes they make fun of.The main character has an...OP ability. Spoiler alert : Most isekai we see have that. They're all extremely busted powers, so to top that, this anime simply gave the main character instant death ability. He can kill anyone with a single thought. It was so silly, he then started KILLING inanimate things: walls and ice.You'll notice through the anime we make fun of more than one kind of main characters, as a lot of encounters are kind of their 'own' main characters going through that world too. I also advise while watching to try and notice those archetypes of main characters, as some of them you will surely recognize from other anime/mangas.They're also making fun of some worldbuilding choices. Some sceneries are extremely overused and some of them just don't make sense ! Imagine, one scene you're in a medieval city, and the next you're in a modern one. Do not question why that world has cars, it simply does.Some of the powers you'll see are silliest, yet you'll notice a lot of them we've seen in other isekais. One of them is literally re:zero on-death save.The plot itself is all over the place yes, but we're going through a lot of hoops and very common progressions which are quite silly too. We at first have them get into that world, and not really question it. We see that happen more and more. Some of them literally had been to that world before (nice one, we see that happening more and more too in new isekai). We have the 'anti-villain' main character who's really killing anyone without much thought or struggle, and the supporting female character be like 'oh no. We can't.' and then in the same episode. 'oh yeah really it's fine I think'.Once you just zone in, and understand what this anime is about, my best advice is just to try and notice as much details as you can. This anime is a mix of the most popular tropes you would see in isekai animes, with some of the most popular characters, powers, sceneries, enemies, progressions etc. Some parts will make you think 'yeah, true, how do they explain this part in normal animes?'Sit back, don't take this anime seriously, and enjoy the show :).

It introduces itself as a clear parody of an isekai, and it’s all downhill from there. Countless plot holes, no clear objective to the main story, and multiple sub-stories...are just some of the issues. The worst part is that nothing that happens in the story matters. An antagonist shows up? Not to worry, dear viewer, don’t waste your time getting invested in the antagonist’s character or even remembering their name. Our trusty MC will kill them in the most anticlimactic way possible before their voice actor has time to wonder if the quick paycheck was worth having their name attached to this project. I’m not even kidding when I say that outside the main characters that keep the plot going, a character is lucky to live past the same episode they’re introduced. It all finally wraps up in another anticlimactic way that you’re numb to by the end of the series. Also, there’s some mecha stuff that I forgot existed in the story until they were shown again in the last ep.——— Characters: 3/10 ———In terms of the MC, you’re getting exactly what you came for: an OP giga chad that has never and will never come close to losing EVER. PERIOD. I’m not saying that kind of MC can’t be fun, but here it just flops for me because he makes everything that happens in the story pointless. Like I mentioned, there is no reason to care about any antagonist because as soon as they pose a threat to the MC they die, which by extension, makes it difficult to care about the plot as a whole. The MC is also pretty two-dimensional outside of a backstory they interject with occasionally, which is fine I guess. Everyone else is generic af and plays into some kind of lazy trope. Also, get ready to be bombarded with a million names almost constantly, but if you’re anything like me, don’t bother remembering them because chances are they either matter very little to the story or will die in a few scenes anyway. I swear to god, one episode in particular hits you with at least a dozen names in the span of five minutes.——— Animation: 5/10 ———There really isn’t anything much to say here. Frames are in fact playing in rapid succession to create the illusion of motion. The animation/art is just the safe, modern anime style you’re probably used to watching. Nothing bad, but also nothing great. It serves its purpose.——— Sound: 5/10 ———Just like the animation, there really isn’t anything noteworthy in this department. The op is fine, although completely forgettable imo and there’s no part of the ost that didn’t just fade into the background. Again, nothing bad but also nothing great.

It\'s bad because I couldn\'t care less what happens.Here we have the nth take on the isekai genre - this time permutating an entire class getting transported to another world combined with a main character whose overpowered skill is being able to kill anyone, anything and even any concept just by saying the word ""die"". If that sounds bad - yes it does.It\'s not so much the poor animation, stop-start pacing or even the storyline itself - it\'s the sheer quality of the characters, or lack thereof, and the sheer quantity of them getting thrown at you every...other minute in each and every episode. Characters get shown on screen, their names get flashed, their voice actors get to shine with a few lines, and then they die. Like literally within minutes, sometimes seconds of coming across our main character, Sir Kill-a-lot. Those characters that don\'t die are either bland, annoying or straight up unbearable.The ridiculousness of it all came across as somewhat funny initially, with our main character possessing a skill as absurd as that and just murdering pretty much everyone he comes across without laying a hand on them. Then it was hilarious because the range of possibilities of what he can kill expands as the story went on, including the very concept of physics itself. There was also a bit of supposed ""intrigue"" with him being the outcome of some crazy experiment or whatnot.But any interest one may have in the premise of this show flies out the window once the joke has been repeated a few times. After the first few episodes, there are no stakes left. There can be no threats to the main character. It\'s just a matter of time before any viewer would lose all investment into the characters and storyline.At least One Punch Man actually punches something.1 point for the opening theme, which might be the only redeeming part of the show.

This anime is a huge waste of time. It\'s not without tropes. It is just utilizing the stupidest trope of them all. The anti trope trope. No different then conforming to being a non conformist. Complete waste of time anime. Not only did they make the protagonist to OP. They made him boring OP. Can sense murderous intent and kill with a thought. How freaking boring is that!I believe this is my first review but I don\'t get it. Why do people like this. Just like one punch man. My previously most hated anime of...all time has been trumped by this one. At least one punch man occasionally made me laugh well being pitifully boring (I know someone is going to say, ""That\'s the point"". Yeah I know it\'s the point. And I find it to be not only boring but a painfully easy writing technique. I mean the writer doesn\'t have to worry about building characters or creating emotions because he just creates one shot characters to be killed.If you like it great. I will never understand your type, but to each their own. I found this to be a pitiful waste of time. all time has been trumped by this one.

Allow me, dear reader, to share my musings on this peculiar gastronomic experience through realms unknown:Picture this, a protagonist who eclipses the might of One Punch Man, transcending the need for physical contact or even a mere gaze. With a mere thought, our main character can render anything in their path asunder. The intent? A comedic isekai romp that whisks you away on an unpredictable journey.Yet, amidst the laughter, there's an attempt to forge character...development and unveil the intricacies of skills within this fantastical world. Alas, the MC's penchant for swift annihilation raises the query: What's the point of such endeavors?Shall I continue with this culinary exploration into the unpredictable, or is this a mere fleeting dalliance with shallowness? Only time will tell. development and unveil the intricacies of skills within this fantastical world. Alas, the MC's penchant for swift annihilation raises the query: What's the point of such endeavors?Shall I continue with this culinary exploration into the unpredictable, or is this a mere fleeting dalliance with shallowness? Only time will tell."", 'Sokushi Cheat takes a more extreme approach to the ""overpowered protagonist"" concept; the protagonist Yogiri Takatou not only never loses, but he also rarely showcases internal conflicts or opinionated goals to work towards. Author Tsuyoshi Fujitaka mentioned in an interview that this is exactly what he wanted to play with — a protagonist who never struggles until the very end. Fujitaka\'s concept naturally alienates many, for by design there is little to get attached to in the story\'s journey, and there\'s essentially no tension. However, this idea has potential to carry out a more lax attitude regardless of the intensity of scenarios. The nature of...nothing in existence being able to threaten Yogiri enables him to engage with the fantasy world in a detached and reactive fashion. The most cataclystic of world events become moments that simply happen; Yogiri is there but effectively doesn\'t interact with it save for when he or his group would be threatened. The absurdities of Yogiri\'s capacities offer a license to examine a world filled with chaos and metaphysical absurdity without placing emphasis on the scope and extremity of such things. It establishes an avenue by which any fantastical concept can be framed as unimportant. In this way, I find the work conceptually intriguing.Like many other Narou works, a lot of Sokushi Cheat\'s interactions are centered around self-awareness of its genre. Characters will make fun of the oddies of the setting and the absurd trajectories that arise from Yogiri\'s powers. There\'s an occasional amusing joke every once in a while, but rarely does the work standout in its self-awareness. One edge Sokushi Cheat has in its making jokes about its own concepts is that because there\'s no limit to the scope of power the other characters can have (by virtue of no level of power mattering against Yogiri), the work is able to take certain concepts to a more peculiar conceptualization and make fun of them. An example is a character whose base power is ""cooking"", but this power can be stretched to have unreasonably versatile applications from the holder\'s framing of everything in the lens of cooking. Elements like this are compounded left and right into the series, leading to a chaotic mess that couldn\'t really fly in a setting where the interaction of characters would have to be more stable, but Sokushi Cheat\'s world is able to as unstable as it wants by virtue of the protagonist\'s foundation. Any unstable element will eventually be nullified by Yogiri\'s intervention, opening the door to interactions of components far more absurd than in more conventional works.Many Fujitaka works (e.g. Sokushi Cheat, My Big Sister Lives in a Fantasy World, and Harumi’s Legacy as the Strongest Mimic) have a particular absurd identity to their character interactions, as it\'s quite common for them to engage in conceptual discussions that feel too peculiar for regular characters to be conversing about. The conversations can sometimes feel too absurd to be organic which can be a turn-off, but at the same time, there\'s a particular charm to these overly conceptual conversations by virtue of how aberrant they are compared to conventional discourse. The anime adaptation for Sokushi Cheat unfortunately loses much of this, as the adaptation goes at a brisk pace and rushes towards the larger plot events. There are still remnants of these moments, such as the scene in episode 1 where the main heroine Tomochika Dannoura probes Yogiri on what his stance would be if Tomochika were to hypothetically betray him, but these are still far more tame compared to the more absurd conversations that were omitted. Consequently, the anime\'s conversations don\'t stand out as much as they could have, which is fairly unfortunate since with a lack of tension, character interactions and jokes are some of the main ways the show would be able to draw interest.Some of Sokushi Cheat\'s more interesting moments involve characters trying to gain insight on the nature of Yogiri\'s powers. The clash with vampire sage Lain offered a fair bit of info on how different conditions interact with Yogiri, many of them failing and some at least offering an indirect way to survive. Such moments provide another avenue of interest, because while viewers may be aware of how futile dealing with Yogiri can be, characters in-universe will cling to possibilities. This enables an amusing information game that, while it\'s destined to fail, the way characters approach the herculean task of overcoming Yogiri\'s powers can be interesting to see. Unfortunately, the last third of the anime chose to rush its way to the more eventful moments, which led to the omission of one of the most compelling instances of such moments. It\'s with decisions like this that I feel the adaptation fails to fully captatilize on how the work retains interest in a tension-like environment. The rushing to eventful moments has less weight when these eventful moments have such anti-climatic moments to begin with, by virtue of Yogiri\'s invincibility.Tomochika has some amusing straightman moments, but a lot of her banter doesn\'t add anything new. She does have one standout moment when she describes how she conceptualizes Yogiri\'s powers in relation to her morals, and Yogiri\'s reaction to this is one of the most standout aspects of her dynamic. Save for that however, her more notable conversations and self-reflections that existed in the source material did not make it into the adaptation. As such, she doesn\'t have a whole lot going for her apart from her standard straightman jokes.While I do bring up a few ways in which the adaptation lacks some of the source material\'s best merits, that isn\'t to say that the core source material fully capitalizes on its concept. Although I admire Fujitaka\'s ultimate vision and some arcs have amusingly satisfying and chaotic payoffs, some of the shortcomings of the anime stem simply from certain arcs themselves having a trajectory or conclusion that doesn\'t offer much. The series has shown its capability of creating amusing constructions with the concept, such as conflicts that have been resolved before they have even begun yet the unknowing characters still take events seriously, or events piling onto each other in a way that feels incomprehensible by virtue of the main characters being outsiders to the unfolding scenario. However, for each of these more interesting trajectories, there\'s conclusions where characters simply come across Yogiri and die. Many occurances lack the thoughtfulness to be satisfying.As someone who is willing to engage with tensionless fantasy works, Sokushi Cheat is a work whose concept I respect, and I commend the author\'s commitment to the lack of a protagonist struggle throughout. Nonetheless there are plenty of shortcomings both with the core work and the work\'s adaptation. I do hope that more authors experiment with the degree of lack of struggle that Sokushi Cheat does, as if capitalized with more creative trajectories, this sort of idea could be fascinating in challenging the standard storytelling constructions writers use to appeal to an audience. nothing in existence being able to threaten Yogiri enables him to engage with the fantasy world in a detached and reactive fashion.

Often a review will only look at a given work from the former perspective, and there\'s nothing wrong with that. However, a reviewer can sometimes omit something crucial by ignoring the latter.Make no mistake - as an anime series, standing on its own merits, ""Sokushi Cheat ga Saikyou sugite,...Isekai no Yatsura ga Marude Aite ni Naranai n desu ga."" is a terrible work. It\'s dumb, pretty trashy, and barely seems to have any kind of coherent plot. It\'s garbage.However, when viewed in the context of the Isekai genre that it belongs to, and the absolute deluge of Isekai works that we (the audience, weebs) have been subjected to over the past decade or so, something else becomes obvious - this is an excellent, and very pointed, spoof of the entire genre.Sokushi Cheat (I\'m not going to paste the entire title more than once, sorry) comes off as trashy because the genre itself is trashy. It struggles to maintain a coherent plot because frankly, the plot\'s purpose is to bring in as many Isekai tropes as possible and thumb its nose at all of them. I wouldn\'t go so far as to say that it\'s a clever spoof, or even a loving parody - that would be an insult to much more sophisticated shows. No, it comes off as the work of someone who is utterly sick and tired of the genre and all of its features, and has decided to unceremoniously eviscerate and dispose of as many of them as possible.The vast majority of the show\'s characters, events, themes, and even plot twists, are all well-treaded in the genre (to the point of being stale, in my view) and should be instantly recognizable to anyone who has watched or read a decent number of Isekai works. That, too, is the point. It deconstructs the genre, but not in the analytical way that one would expect of the term - Sokushi Cheat doesn\'t so much dissect Isekai tropes with a scalpel as just take a sledgehammer to them, and then burn the corpse for good measure.The result is a darkly humorous romp through a typically nonsensical Isekai world, with plot points and characters introduced purely to hold a magnifying glass up to the least-flattering blemishes of the genre, which in turn is just to give you a better view of the author popping those same blemishes like zits.If you consider yourself a seasoned Isekai veteran and would maybe like to see a vicious spoof of this otherwise stale genre, I highly recommend watching (or reading) ""Sokushi Cheat ga Saikyou sugite, Isekai no Yatsura ga Marude Aite ni Naranai n desu ga.""

It's not one of you typical generic isekai but the entire thing is a mess.

They are trying to make it somewhat of a power fantasy with edgy and cheesy aesthetic but it doesn't work. The atmosphere and theme keeps jumping.

But 4 were not granted gifts and abandoned by the rest of the classmates.

Unfortunately it gets worse after episode 8 as the anime is quite rushed in terms of pacing, and the humour from the source material ends up getting discarded, in favour of some rather poorly animated fight scenes.By the third part of the anime, characters are barely even introduced, with only a quick on screen card with their name and abilities. And there are a lot of new characters, making it difficult to remember any of them.  In terms of plot, episode 9 and 10 feel like a lot is being skipped and briefly mentioned as...happening off screen.

Rushed, vacuous, convoluted, dull, predictable, and most of all forgettable, it is the sort of parody that can make me look back fondly on the parent genre\'s least beloved entries for the endearing sincerity and simplicity of their incompetence. Come back, \'Reign of the Seven Spellblades\', all is forgiven!Let me say a few words about the genre. It\'s not unusual for new fantasy series to...embroider themselves with isekai kitsch: it\'s practically a cost of doing business, and it doesn\'t necessarily harm the story. Going someplace new is an evergreen theme, for Odysseus as much as Kirito, and the video game skill tree our hero might unlock upon arriving someplace new is a harmless bit of kitsch. Ideally, perhaps, the story would include no extraneous elements, but plenty of watchable shows sprint through a tolerable half-episode of isekai overhead before settling in for the real story, which turns out to have nothing to do with reincarnated teenagers assigning skill points.\'My Instant Death Ability\', on the other hand, wallows in isekai slop from start to finish, doubling down on kitsch at every opportunity, indulging in all the worst excesses of the setting without once delivering on the core appeal of fantasy adventure — which, by the way, has been parodying itself for years. \'My One-Hit Kill Sister\' can be considered a parody of a fantasy adventure, and in any case it\'s a lot of fun to watch; \'My Instant Death Ability\' can be considered an insult to the viewer, and it\'s not even a clever insult.As rushed as it is vacuous, the show is watchable, barely, as a kind of twenty-minute weekly chore. Nothing lasts and nothing matters: establish a location, introduce a character, kill the character, leave the location; no stakes, no conflict, and no lasting consequences. If it ever slowed down enough to convey the plot, or if it ever asked us to care, even a little, about any of the characters, then it would simply be infuriating. As it stands, I did manage to point my eyes toward the screen for most of the runtime, though if you asked me now what happened to the sword master, or what the sage was trying to achieve, or why the robot turned into a dragon, I honestly couldn\'t tell you.Anyone with eyes can see at once why the show doesn\'t work. You don\'t need to know what words like ""structure"" and ""pacing"" mean: the director clearly doesn\'t. It looks bad, sounds bad, makes no sense, and serves no purpose. The comedy consists entirely of yelling. For half the runtime, half the screen is taken up by title cards for roughly fourteen thousand characters, half of which die each episode, and I wish the other half had died too. There is one cute girl, but she spends every scene yelling at a fat ghost.I may be misremembering some of that, but I\'m not going to check, because I don\'t care and it doesn\'t matter. No one should watch this show, and it\'s embarrassing that it was made. I can forgive the people responsible for it, and I don\'t think they deserve to go to prison, but a hundred hours of community service does seem appropriate. embroider themselves with isekai kitsch: it\'s practically a cost of doing business, and it doesn\'t necessarily harm the story.

No, and you've been warned.Yogiri and the rest of his class were summoned into this other world by the Sage Sion to become sage candidates.

Most stories evolve into this, but Sokushi Cheat starts there and as such never manages to feel compelling or engaging. If it’s meant to be a deconstruction, it fails to do that either and just feels like a run of the mill isekai.When you have a main character that can literally kill anyone or anything with one word, the show is always going to struggle to stay interesting. You’ve removed the stakes from the start. At that point, it’s essential that you introduce other...characters we can get attached to and give them challenges. If the main character can’t die, at least make us worried that some other fan favourites will. The author fails to do that in this story. The only other character besides the MC that’s worth giving a damn about is Dannoura, who happens to be with the MC literally 24/7 and so there’s no threat to her because he can save her whenever. It’s just rinse and repeat on him saving the day time and again and gets old after about the 3rd episode.Another issue I have with this story is the sheer amount of characters they push on us in small time periods.

Pfft, how about instant death with just a thought?Superpowers. Superpowers range from the ability to ignite flames in the palm of your hand to the ability to destroy the universe at the snap of a finger. I bet that each of you at one time or another has wondered ""what superpower would I want for myself?"", I\'m sure that most of you will give an answer on the level of ""the ability to fly"", or ""the ability to pass through walls"", or ""the ability to see through clothes"", it depends on how you look at it. But...what if I told you that\'s nothing compared to the ability to kill with your mind? Hell, yes, it\'s impossible in our harsh real world where there\'s no trace of magic, but this is I-S-E-K-A-I, everything is real, you can get anything and become anything, even a slot machine like in Reborn as a Vending Machine or a dog in Inuhiro. As Polish writer Janusz Wisniewski said ""When there is neither tea nor sugar in the cup, but only hot water, imagination and sense of humor help"", and here the Japanese succeeded not worse than in the technical scale.And what is the ability of Yogiri Takatou, the highlight of our program? It\'s incredibly simple, he can kill, and he kills with his mind. ""Die,"" you\'re dead. It doesn\'t matter who you are, worker, dragon, God, you\'re dead. You\'ll probably say ""that\'s too cheater"", and yes, you\'d be right, that\'s the comedy of this show and all its charm. Japanese humor knows no boundaries, and you\'ll understand it even after interacting with the people of the Land of the Rising Sun. This show plays humor to the degree of absurdity, a huge number of plot holes and atypical situations. If, for example, the show 2023 KamiKatsu ironizes the gods, here the author of the original (short story) named Tsuyoshi Fujitaka ironizes the characters\' superpowers and personality. It\'s pointless to strain your brain twists and try to think about the plot here, lol, there isn\'t one. You have to laugh and relax, that\'s what the show\'s creators are counting on. So to all the boring guys who scream ""The show is ridiculous and stupid!"" I\'ll say this, go watch serious dramas and philosophize there. Every show has a purpose, and this show should make you laugh with its absurdity. It starts off in the spirit of a typical fantasy, schoolchildren out of the blue find themselves in another world where they get a power and a certain task. This is what happened to the Yogiri class during a bus ride. The guys got powers, cool! Not all of them however, for a small group of classmates got nothing, among them Yogiri and his loyal classmate friend named Tomochika. The class took off, leaving the guys behind as bait, but no such luck - Yogiri has the ability to kill. And now the plot splits into two camps, on one side are the classmates with basic abilities, and on the other side are Yogiri and Tomochika who are hanging out in a new world and, you could say, acting as travelers.A novella with that screaming title «My Instant Death Ability is So Overpowered, No One in This Other World Stands a Chance Against Me!» was released from 2016 to 2023 on the Shōsetsuka ni Nar website, and just think, it has 14 volumes and 341 chapters, unbelievable, for that many chapters the protagonist just had to solve the issue of overpopulation of our planet with the ability. Now we are presented with an anime adaptation by Okuruto Noboru directed by Masakazu Hishida, who has joined the same studio and in the spring season we are waiting for his next work with Okuruto, which is an adaptation of the manhwa Kenka Dokugaku.The animation turned out to be a bit sparse, as well as the musical component. If the creators of KamiKatsu made horrible graphics their humorous highlight, then in My Instant Death Ability the creators tried to make a beautiful picture, which they failed. The backgrounds are nothing, and the drawing is extremely simple. A pretty picture is not necessary for a parody like this, but it still makes a difference in the show. Music. I especially liked the opening title track, the song ""Killer Bars"" performed by Hilcrhyme, which is fun and upbeat.From one point of view of humor this show looks great, many moments were unexpected and therefore funny, but still the work lacks some comedic originality. The vulgar jokes on the background of jokes about the main character\'s strength look absurd, and some flashbacks from the past are superfluous. Let these scenes clarify the situation, but chasing two birds at the same time in the adaptation did not work. Anyway, parodies are good, but with this development of events in the future we will see more parodies and parodies on parodies. Die. what if I told you that\'s nothing compared to the ability to kill with your mind? Hell, yes, it\'s impossible in our harsh real world where there\'s no trace of magic, but this is I-S-E-K-A-I, everything is real, you can get anything and become anything, even a slot machine like in Reborn as a Vending Machine or a dog in Inuhiro. As Polish writer Janusz Wisniewski said ""When there is neither tea nor sugar in the cup, but only hot water, imagination and sense of humor help"", and here the Japanese succeeded not worse than in the technical scale.And what is the ability of Yogiri Takatou, the highlight of our program? It\'s incredibly simple, he can kill, and he kills with his mind. ""Die,"" you\'re dead. It doesn\'t matter who you are, worker, dragon, God, you\'re dead. You\'ll probably say ""that\'s too cheater"", and yes, you\'d be right, that\'s the comedy of this show and all its charm. Japanese humor knows no boundaries, and you\'ll understand it even after interacting with the people of the Land of the Rising Sun. This show plays humor to the degree of absurdity, a huge number of plot holes and atypical situations. If, for example, the show 2023 KamiKatsu ironizes the gods, here the author of the original (short story) named Tsuyoshi Fujitaka ironizes the characters\' superpowers and personality. It\'s pointless to strain your brain twists and try to think about the plot here, lol, there isn\'t one. You have to laugh and relax, that\'s what the show\'s creators are counting on. So to all the boring guys who scream ""The show is ridiculous and stupid!"" I\'ll say this, go watch serious dramas and philosophize there. Every show has a purpose, and this show should make you laugh with its absurdity. It starts off in the spirit of a typical fantasy, schoolchildren out of the blue find themselves in another world where they get a power and a certain task. This is what happened to the Yogiri class during a bus ride. The guys got powers, cool! Not all of them however, for a small group of classmates got nothing, among them Yogiri and his loyal classmate friend named Tomochika. The class took off, leaving the guys behind as bait, but no such luck - Yogiri has the ability to kill. And now the plot splits into two camps, on one side are the classmates with basic abilities, and on the other side are Yogiri and Tomochika who are hanging out in a new world and, you could say, acting as travelers.A novella with that screaming title «My Instant Death Ability is So Overpowered, No One in This Other World Stands a Chance Against Me!» was released from 2016 to 2023 on the Shōsetsuka ni Nar website, and just think, it has 14 volumes and 341 chapters, unbelievable, for that many chapters the protagonist just had to solve the issue of overpopulation of our planet with the ability. Now we are presented with an anime adaptation by Okuruto Noboru directed by Masakazu Hishida, who has joined the same studio and in the spring season we are waiting for his next work with Okuruto, which is an adaptation of the manhwa Kenka Dokugaku.The animation turned out to be a bit sparse, as well as the musical component.

Die.', 'This is an isekai that parodies the overpowered trope overused by isekai stories that have come out the woodwork in recent years.This is a show where you need to turn off brain and just enjoy the parody that it is.If you are looking for another aspect to enjoy this show, I look at it as an anime tinge with a bit of the charm of ""Death Takes a Holiday"" except Death is a high school boy who was raised properly by parent figure who saw humanity in him and not just as the force of nature that he is. These scenes were shown as a...flashback because the story starts with a bus full of high school students transported to another world.This anime was a mess of plot threads and character arcs, and the last three episodes spent a lot of time tying everything up and it still missed out on resolving the other stories. Still, it wasn\'t a headache. In fact, the ending was satisfying enough.My tip is to follow the main characters in Yogiri (death boy), Tomochika (his classmate) and Mokomoko (Tomochika\'s guardian family spirit). There isn\'t much the other characters can do. Even if they reached the last episode of the series, there wasn\'t anything they can do once they faced Death. Don\'t get invested in them and just revel in the absurdity of it. flashback because the story starts with a bus full of high school students transported to another world.This anime was a mess of plot threads and character arcs, and the last three episodes spent a lot of time tying everything up and it still missed out on resolving the other stories.

Don\'t get invested in them and just revel in the absurdity of it.', 'Do you know the feeling when your favorite novel is getting an anime adaptation and when it is announced you hype a lot but when it get released... It is the worst thing you ever seen in your life and objectively the worst adaptation from a novel that was ever made?COOL THAT IS WHAT IM FEELINGBut as Jack Ripper would say... Let\'s go in parts1- The worst studio and non-existent StaffOne thing I wondered a lot when Instant Death was announced as an anime was how they would represent Yogiri Takatou\'s power. Maybe they would do it like the light novel and manga...where the enemy simply falls dead to the ground...But no, thanks to this basically non-existent Staff, they used the worst way to adapt Yogiri\'s power. Supposing they really didn\'t want to make something extremely dry so as not to be boring, and that\'s why they didn\'t use the factor of the enemy simply dropping dead and decided instead to change it for something more visual... I would think this idea is coolI had thought ""Imagine every time Yogiri uses his power, the entire aesthetic or artistic style of the anime changes to demonstrate a certain greatness coming from takatou. Like for example a sudden change in the animation or the OST""... But no , they didn\'t understand Yogiri\'s power and literally just put a filter with a purple circle PNG that makes the anime all purple and a generic sound of magicThe point is that Yogiri\'s power IS NOT MAGIC. It doesn\'t make sense for you to change power to something it isn\'t. The yogiri simply kills because he can kill and that\'s it, it has nothing to do with ""Magic"", it would be better to just let the opponents fall dead without any effectThis nonsense about his eyes shining when he uses his power is also a huge nonsense, in all other media it is something extremely sudden with no indication that the opponent died other than him saying ""Die"", but I think the Staff really needed it screw it all2- The worst animation it could getInstant Death\'s animation being incredible isn\'t really necessary. It\'s a satirical work of comedy, where the ""Great"" clashes are more at the end of the work than at the beginning of it, so I thought ""Probably they will use simpler animation and then in a future adaptation of the following arcs they will make a better animation""Oh what a shame... Not only is the animation terrible as it looks like a slideshow, but the colors are also horrible. The colors are so strange and exaggeratedly colorful that it looks like a children\'s anime, which ironically seems to be the case after all, the anime censors the deaths (which aren\'t a big deal but they still censor it in a very mediocre and lazy way).The character design is horrible, in the manga I also couldn\'t differentiate the characters much because of the designer\'s somewhat similar design... But here it\'s worse, thanks to the artists being as bad as someone who has never drawn, every character is poorly colored because of the colors and sometimes they don\'t even seem to match the description in the manga. It\'s so bad that I got sick watching the animeThe only design that got upgraded from the novel is yogiri design that is now more unique and less genericI can see that this studio that animated it is so bad that I\'m really afraid to see the other CRIMES they committed because if with a Novel as basic as Instant Death they corrupt the animation more than acid corrodes paper, imagine what they did with their other animes...3- The worst OstThe sound design is terrible, as I have already demonstrated with the example of the protagonist\'s power being a generic magic sound and most of the other characters that use magic also have bad sound design... When we have fire magic, the sound is shit , it seems that one of the interns was there and blew into the microphone and they thought it was good enoughThe songs are VERY BAD, apart from killer bars(which no matter how much I try to make a parallel with Yogiri Takatou[but fails doing it since] is still a good song and I imagine that\'s where all the anime\'s budget went) all the songs are bad, out of tune and genericWhen we\'re in Lain-Sama\'s rushed arc, suddenly comes that generic action music that was composed by people throwing instruments at the wall, making it seem like it\'s not an action scene but a comedy scene. Besides, this song... It\'s used every time something """"""""""""""Serious"""""""""""""""" is going to happen, probably because the anime has little musicBy the way, I\'m going to open an addendum here for the opening since I talked about killer bars... This was the point where I got the most hype, I thought they could try A LOT of different things with this op but the op is literally a bad animation in the beginning, 1 minute of yogiri walking forward while png appear and the purple circle makes them disappear with a bad effect, about 5 seconds of """"""""fight scene"""""""" and more bad animation(at least the foreshadow on the characters that yogiri kills are cool)As for the ending, one of the worst endings I\'ve ever seen behind other lazier endings like the ending of some other generic isekai... But this one is COMPLETELY forgettable and it\'s just some photos appearing on the screen to the sound of bad music and with your eyes bleeding from enduring a new episode4- The Worst AdaptationI think I\'ve established here that Yogiri is simply the most powerful character in fiction... He was literally able to kill the neurons of the entire anime staff team, because this anime is VERY BADLY ADAPTED and is not just rushed, the anime literally moves at the speed of lightOne of the strong points of Fujitaka\'s writing (author of Instant Death) is the worldbuilding and the cosmology he creates... But the Staff didn\'t understand this and specifically skipped this part, the anime\'s pacing simply doesn\'t existFor example, ep 2 completely rushes the undead invasion arc. Literally, you could almost consider that they skipped an arc, I was sad because I thought ""Wow, they want to get to the best adapted arc in the manga right away, which would be between episode 7 or 8""... Oh yeah... THEY SKIPED THE CELESTIAL RECORD EATER ARC WHICH IS LITERALLY THE BEST ARC AND THEY EXCHANGED IT FOR YOGIRI\'S PAST ARC... But you know the best? Yogiri\'s past arc was ALSO rushed, it was literally patheticThey adapted a lot of text into 12 episodes. If this anime were a serious anime, they would have reached the end of the tower arc (perhaps even the end of the Celestial record eater arc), and then continued in the next season, after all, IT TAKES A LONG TIME to present the worldbuilding and cosmology of the verse. .. But they ignored itThe funniest thing is that the giant FISH appears in the OP and also in human form, indicating that it would appear in the anime, but they don\'t jump from the tower arch at the end of ep 7 to the battle royale arc in the manga mixed with the other arc involving him meeting his gang again, because after all the anime is VERY RUSHED so they mix arcs with other arcsThe powers of the characters in the manga are very well explained so you can understand the size of the power that Yogiri will simply destroy without difficulty. Aoi\'s power for example, she has the power to see the value of a person\'s destiny to discover how much the person is protected by destiny, in addition to being able to manipulate the plot and destiny of reality a little. In the anime they turned this super cool power into an ""I can see how strong you are"" wannabeIn addition to some other adaptation gaffes like when they simply can\'t get past what Aoi saw when she tried to see the value of the yogiri\'s destiny she collapsed because she saw a being that represents the end of all existence... It is described as a entity so absurd that thinking about ""fighting"" against it is stupid.The fact that Yogiri is a transcendent cosmic entity is what makes Instant Death so good. This whole satirical isekai mask that in the background hides a plot with a character that represents a cosmic entity in the Eldritch Horror style is super interesting. It would be like putting Azathot in an isekai, the result would be super scary but comicalWhen Aoi discovers this and reveals this about Yogiri to those who watch, both in the manga and in the novel you really understand that he is really scary because he is so powerful it is incomprehensible. In the manga it simply seems like he is a strong guy who has broken the power capacity that Aoi can understandWhen Aoi inspects him in the manga with the power she actually has(not this ""I can see how strong you are"" Wannabe) she simply sees the yogiri on an empty background and then she says ""He\'s the one standing on the end because he is the end""... Now in the manga she inspects him and he causes cracking effects in Aoi\'s perspective, as if he were powerful. The point is that it is not to convey that he is simply ""powerful"", the point is that it is to convey that he is simply TRANSCENDENT, which the anime fails countless timesAnother thing is that Yogiri as an Eldritch horror entity also has a true form. This form is described as Countless eyes that stare at whoever the yogiri wants to kill and drive anyone who sees his true form to insanity. You can see that they tried to put this in the opening... But it was so comical... It\'s simply black smoke with eyes in PNG... That\'s not what the Novel wants to convey, but rather a feeling that there\'s an abyss staring you in the face. But obviously the way they portrayed it in the anime made it look bad.One last problem is that the anime doesn\'t know when it wants to be serious and when it wants to be funny. Instant Death is a work that has a lot of humor but needs to know how to be serious, after all it hides much of the ""cosmic horror"" factor with humor. But the adaptation got this wrong once again after all... Not only does it have a lot of humor, but the serious moments are also made with humor because of the bad directionConclusion:This was by far the worst anime I\'ve ever seen (even surpassing Kaiufuku, which for me was the worst in the past) because it destroyed a work that meant a lot to me, I really like Instant Death and they committed... An unforgivable heresyI don\'t know how Fujitaka accepted a mediocre studio and a mediocre staff to adapt this interesting and enigmatic work. Unfortunately, either he cheated on us for money, or he is simply a stupid personI don\'t recommend you watch it if you\'ve already read the manga or novel and liked it... This dishonors the original work. If you\'ve never seen Instant Death, don\'t watch this anime either, read the manga or novel too, if you see this anime you will definitely hate Instant DeathAlso the last episode isn\'t solving everythig wrong with this... So I will ignore it since ik what will happen nextI really started the year at rock bottomWell, a well deserved 1 where the enemy simply falls dead to the ground...But no, thanks to this basically non-existent Staff, they used the worst way to adapt Yogiri\'s power.

Loses itself in way too many plotlines near the end though, and ends up being pretty forgettable.

It\'s a half-Isekai, half-death-game anime about a school bus full of Japanese high-school students willing to abandon their friends for dead or become potential sex criminals as soon as they either receive or don\'t receive superpowers from a sketchy sage.Of course, none of that matters because the main protagonist, Takatou, can just kill anything by pointing at this target and saying ""die"", which he only used to...save his classmate and potential love interest, Dannoura, from a dragon and his potential rapist otaku classmates because he liked the way her boobs felt against his arm when she clung onto him out of desperation one time.The rest of the story is literally hard-to-follow nonsense that bounces between medieval fantasy, sci-fi, and zombie apocalypse—you name it, it\'s in here. It\'s hard to say just how absurd, and not in a good way, this show is. You have to see it to believe it.The characters are just as ludicrous as the story. The only character who ironically doesn\'t fall into this category is Takatou, whose instant death ability is so overpowered that it makes him rather dull. Whilst his ability and how he solves any challenges with it is the joke within this comedy, it quickly becomes tedious. What doesn\'t get boring is Dannoura\'s reactions to seeing him quickly breeze through any roadblocks, no matter how godly or Eldridge they may be. It is the same with the enemies who try to use their overpowered abilities to try and find loopholes in Takatou\'s ability, only to fail miserably.Nearly everything about the production of this anime is terrible. The animation is janky and awkward, and the characters\' movements sometimes clip into other people or obstacles. The music sucks, and the bad CGI. The way episodes are edited either makes the pacing feel like it\'s going at breakneck speed or at a standstill. Sometimes, you can watch an episode without knowing what\'s happening. On the surface, it\'s the usual light-novel shovelware garbage train wreck.Underneath though, the sheer audacity of My Instant Death Ability is So Overpowered, No One in This Other World Stands a Chance Against Me makes me want to recommend it for some reason. This show is terrible, awful even.

It\'s hard to say just how absurd, and not in a good way, this show is. You have to see it to believe it.The characters are just as ludicrous as the story. The only character who ironically doesn\'t fall into this category is Takatou, whose instant death ability is so overpowered that it makes him rather dull. Whilst his ability and how he solves any challenges with it is the joke within this comedy, it quickly becomes tedious. What doesn\'t get boring is Dannoura\'s reactions to seeing him quickly breeze through any roadblocks, no matter how godly or Eldridge they may be. It is the same with the enemies who try to use their overpowered abilities to try and find loopholes in Takatou\'s ability, only to fail miserably.Nearly everything about the production of this anime is terrible. The animation is janky and awkward, and the characters\' movements sometimes clip into other people or obstacles. The music sucks, and the bad CGI. The way episodes are edited either makes the pacing feel like it\'s going at breakneck speed or at a standstill. Sometimes, you can watch an episode without knowing what\'s happening. On the surface, it\'s the usual light-novel shovelware garbage train wreck.Underneath though, the sheer audacity of My Instant Death Ability is So Overpowered, No One in This Other World Stands a Chance Against Me makes me want to recommend it for some reason.

Because of the death instant ability, many characters are introduced along with their skill, level, etc. as on-screen text while the characters are talking so it's a bit confusing to follow the talking subtitle and the on-screen text translation. But then no longer after the characters are introduced they died, so there is no use to read all the on-screen text.The animation is okay, character designs are just like any other isekai anime with cute strong girls.

Yet, while this may seem like one of those \'trashy\' Isekai narratives where viewers will be able to vicariously indulge in a power fantasy through its main character, the utter irreverence of the premise and story execution, prevents it from happening. That is because, for the most part, this series follows the footsteps of works like ""One Punch Man,"" parodying and satirising the many tropes of its genre.Certainly, ""Instant Death"" is not as endearing, well-written, well-paced, or as well illustrated and animated as ""One Punch...Man"" but part of it is because it pushes the basic general idea of this premise - a main character so powerful, he renders all conflicts pointless with 1 action - to the utmost extreme.While ""One Punch Man,"" seems reluctant in completely following through with this premise by indulging in the battle Shonen tropes that it parodies and deconstructs such as building dramatic narratives about some of its villains and main characters, and providing Saitama with some cool action sequences and has enemies where he can duke out for a while (even if he is holding back), ""Instant Death"" is willing to go all out with this premise. Aside from its crucial main characters, most characters and antagonists have the depth of a puddle and they pretty much die the episode that they are introduced. The many Isekai tropes that the series randomly pulls in completely halts for Instant Death power shenanigans, pulling the brakes so that the story can\'t indulge in these tropes.Yet, there is a reason why series like ""One Punch Man"" have not gone that far in their parody of the genre and that is because this can feel incredibly unsatisfying to watch! As ""Instant Death"" proves, the story can feel very inconsequential and rather pointless when all conflicts can literally end in the same episode that they are introduced, and end in the most visually boring way (he just says die!). Yet, what pulls this series together in my opinion is its characters and the somewhat philosophical dimension of death that is entwined with the story\'s premise. With Takatou being an all-powerful being that is literally the end to all things, the show kind of implicitly asks us to ponder about the meaning of death, to the ending of existence, and, with the flashbacks of his life before being Isekai-ed, to questions about what makes a human being. This makes Takatou quite an interesting character to follow, and maybe even think about. (Okay, maybe to say that these things are brought up in the show is a bit of a stretch, but there is inherently something quite interesting to the premise that this series dips into, but does not really embrace or even acknowledge much.)I have been following ""Instant Death\'s"" manga for a while now and I genuinely think that it is pretty good entertainment. The jokes do land if you know trashy Isekai tropes, the main character is interesting, and some of the character interactions are quite fun to read. Yet, with this experience, I can say that I don\'t think this anime really does this series justice. For one, the pacing is off. It\'s wayyyy off. Particularly in the last few episodes where the conflict, characters, and interesting scenarios come and go like soap bubbles in the air. This makes it hard to even digest the events that are happening and its possible significance to the main characters and their journey. Simply put, the anime\'s story is quite poorly paced and it can make the sequence of events in the story seem very random without much intent (I mean, it is... random but just going off on the manga, it is all part of its intent to parody the Isekai genre).Still, I do like this series and I do think it can be entertaining, especially if you don\'t go in expecting a dramatic story like Shield Hero, or a comedy that takes its stakes seriously like Tsukimichi, or even Konosuba. But it does have its glaring, very glaring flaws. I do recommend giving the manga a try though. It may be loud, chaotic, random, and a little too flat in how it develops and handles conflicts, but it is an entertaining and rather fun read.

It didn\'t feel cliché at all. There are many characters all with different powers, sages and even invaders from ""other worlds"". Also, the real world is represented, when in many Isekai you barely see it and then forget about it, in fact the MC gets his OP power from the real world and not the Isekai, and I thought this was a very original trope.Now there are many many deaths and you realize the MC isn\'t a typical ""hero"" character but actually a kind of like a roman god that doesn\'t follow idealistic human morality, another point...that is quite original. I really liked too that the real world scientists who know about the MC are terrified of him, basically like he is a horror movie monster, but at the same time he seems to just be a normal kid, one that was bestowed a ridiculously overpowered ability that kills everyone instantly of course. And when you think about it, a kid bestowed with such an ability that sometimes activates automatically, well he would use it probably in a manner similar to this anime, at least in self defense and when he senses people want to kill him.Even inside the main Isekai, there are many different settings with very different cities and people in them. From episode to episode, the settings vastly changes and there are many different races and factions that battle in the background, with their own quests and biases.For it\'s originality, it\'s worth a watch, this isn\'t your typical gimmick Isekai anime.

A lot of behind the scenes stuff is revealed, so the opposing sides are now firmly established. And the show ended with a pretty explosive hook. It took more than half the season, but Yogiri is finally showing a personality. And now there is a mystery behind him that he apparently is unaware of. Too bad it took so long for them to make me actually care about the character. I've a feeling it's either going to go for two cours or the ending is going to be really rushed. "", 'When you think about isekai surely one of the first things that come to your head is that it has an OP MC. This show is completely about this, about an OP MC killing things, that’s why it’s called Sokushi Cheat ga Saikyou sugite, Isekai no Yatsura ga Marude Aite ni Naranai n desu ga aka Instant Death, and just as those other shows where the OP MC makes every single battle uninteresting because they have no stakes, this series is no different, actually, it is even worse because of how Yogiri is designed to be, he is designed to try to be the strongest...character, and not just from his own series, the author of this very clearly tries to make Yogiri the strongest when compared to other characters from other shows.Actually, Instant Death is not a show, it is VS debating brainrot. If you don’t know what’s VS debating is I’ll give a little explanation, have you ever seen people asking “who will win Goku or Superman?”? Well, VS debating is taking that question and actually trying to answer it, people will search feats of the characters, use physics to calc their speed and destructive power and even classify every single one of their abilities, and while classifying them you will get to a tiering system to put the characters in some tier of power level. What do I mean with VS debating brainrot? Well, obviously, some characters will be created unintentionally powerful to the point of being ridiculous, but then what if someone knows about this kind of stuff and decides that he wants his character to be even stronger than them? Well, this series happens, that’s why you get some really specific details about how Yogiri’s instant death ability works, to make it able to affect characters when compared to him in VS debating, that’s why there are random scenes of people saying “oh, he killed my avatar and was also able to kill my real self” or introducing a character to kill their external power source that was in another dimension, this is to showcase his feats, because the creator of this series knows about VS debating, so as I said before, this isn’t a real series and it is more a wanking fest of a character to make him the most powerful fictional character. This makes the series completely worthless, as it doesn’t tell a real story, the characters are just there to have different powers and abilities to be defeated by Yogiri so someone can say “my character can beat this other character” in a discussion.Honestly, even if you watched it because the main character has the ability to kill people and see stupid people “paying the price” for what they did, it would still be a waste of time, the way they die is so instantaneous that it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t feel satisfactory to see idiots die because they just drop dead on the spot. You can’t watch it for the animation because it is terribly done, none of the battles between other people matter because the protagonist can kill them with a thought and they just drop dead.This series is a pit of nothingness, there’s nothing here, it doesn’t exist, because it’s complete and utter shit, it’s the meme of the OP isekai MC but taken to the absolute extreme, so it is just boring to watch.

The Hakkenden: Shin Shou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12715/The_Hakkenden__Shin_Shou,"['This is the second part of this OVA series. This run was from 1993-1995. I am again assuming that the synopsis for the first part of this series has been read. These are the last 7 of the 13 episodes in this series.This part of the OVA series blurs the lines between reality and illusion even further than the first 6 episodes. Strange is the word, but you will see plenty of bloody battles, and a lot of the dark side of humanity. I want to also remind of the time period this is based in, we are talking the mid 1400\'s.The animation styles...vary in a couple episodes, in fact I absolutely hated the animation in episode 10/13. I loved the episode as a psychosis snapping episode, but I barely made it through the episode due to the animation style. That episode aside, the rest is pretty much right in line with the first part of the series in animation and sound. It wasn\'t the best of the time period, and it was mediocre in these categories at best.The story however takes a turn towards the realm of very strange, and I really liked that about this story. It isn\'t your happy ""the good guys will triumph in glory"" type of story. In fact, you will most likely end this series asking ""what the heck did I just watch"" or you\'ll feel strangely at ease with the open feeling at the end. It really is a cerebral challenge, and that\'s what makes it good. The ending of the story ties you back to the beginning, which is necessary after the roller coaster ride they take you on through the story. I cannot say that they tie everything up in a pretty ribbon for you, in fact I had a similar feeling at the end of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Now I am not saying they are the same, but I am merely comparing to the emotional state I had as a viewer with the ending of both.This is different than the current norm, and that\'s what I liked. Keep these comments in mind if you want to check this series out. Lastly I will explain why I gave both runs of this OVA series a 7 overall. Quite simply I liked it, but I wouldn\'t call it a masterpiece. I like strange and different in my anime at times, and though I liked it, I didn\'t love it.

"Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.",https://myanimelist.net/anime/46471/Tantei_wa_Mou_Shindeiru,"['*spoilers*This show is totally fucking with us.The main girl is named Siesta. “Siesta” is Spanish for “nap.”And this show does nothing but put you to sleep.But that’s only if you’re lucky, because staying awake is torture. I know “The Detective is Already Dead” may sound like an enticing title, but don’t be fooled. This is a battle harem. It may not be set in an academy, and there may not be an arena for waifu fights, but the essential elements are there, and the show isn’t ashamed of this at all. In fact, it’s the only selling point. Why is a show about a...middle school loser becoming Discount James Bond, traveling the world fighting international counterintelligence and terror organizations, but also aliens, mind controllers, werewolves, and superhuman androids enjoyed by anyone? Because he does so with a cute detective waifu at his side constantly trying to fall on his dick. I don’t know if it’s a spoiler to say this, but as the title suggests, the detective is, indeed, already dead, so everything I just described only takes place in flashbacks, and everything happening in present day consists of new, different girls trying to fall on his dick. This is actually genius when you think about it, because now you and the self-insert protagonist don’t have to choose a best girl, and can instead just fuck them both, one in the past, and another in the present. But I didn’t mean to so quickly sweep all that dumb shit under the rug. To say this show contains aliens, mind control, werewolves, and superhuman androids is not a spoiler, because they aren’t treated as mysteries nor presented as reveals. I know this may seem odd considering nothing about the premise or promotional material would suggest this show gets that ridiculous, but that’s just it. This show makes no attempt to build the world or make the setting feel distinctive. Everything will look and feel totally banal, and then suddenly you’re watching this indescribable Frankenstein’s Monster of disparate genres and ideas which don’t mix together at all. This may be a weird thing to say, but nothing in this show feels like it was done in the right order. Yes, the pacing is incompetent, but that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s hard to put this into words, but scenes are just so poorly considered and end up feeling awkward or like there’re taking place in the wrong context. The lifeless directing and ultra-generic art style don’t help either, because a weird and out-of-place character or concept will be introduced, and the music will change to try and switch the tone, but NOTHING changes visually, so the whole sequence just feels deadpan—like the building blocks making up the scene were ordered wrong or internally misplaced.With all that said, the real reason this show is such a boring piece of shit is plain and simple: it just has awful writing. Siesta’s motto as a detective is, “A first-rate detective gets a handle on a case before the incident occurs,” and this motto is the central gimmick of the series. We and our self-insert protagonist are the fish out of water, and Siesta is the seemingly clairvoyant, Holmesian mastermind who already holds all the relevant knowledge beforehand. We, the audience, are supposed to marvel at her intelligence, but what the author doesn’t understand is that this does not make for an interesting story. It is well-established that what makes detective stories engaging is the audience’s desire to solve the mystery with the clues and foreshadowing provided by the author, but if you know the author isn’t going to provide you with ANY clues or ANY foreshadowing, and is instead going to constantly pull random shit out of thin air and expect you to applaud his creativity, then you’ll immediately lose interest. However, what makes this show in particular its own special brand of retarded, is that explanatory information is withheld even during scenes which have nothing to do with mystery.This show is amazingly forthright with how contrived it is.Why does our teenage waifu decide to move in with our teenage protagonist half a day after they meet?Just because.Why does our middle school aged protagonist with no credentials get an international license to carry by an intelligence syndicate?Just because.Why does Waifu #2 get a heart transplant that magically imbues her with the thoughts and emotions of the heart’s original owner?Just because.Why can our normal human waifu safely jump out of a building wearing a dress, high heels, and carrying our protagonist in her arms?Just because.Why does Waifu #3 stop some random asshole on the street who she’s never met before and assume he’s a legendary detective?Just because.Why does our waifu’s blood turn into bullets, and why do those bullets magically revoke a person’s free will?Just because.Why does our protagonist scream “It’s time for My Teen Romantic Comedy™!” despite rejecting our waifu’s romanic advances?Just for the memes.I have twelve episodes worth of this bullshit to chose from, so trust me when I say I could do this all day. Any principle fixture of the plot or character chemistry is totally preposterous, and it’s not even in service of anything interesting. Remember, this show is just a battle harem, yet in its attempts to stand out, it just embarrasses itself when it probably would’ve been better off relying on more standard concepts. The show still would’ve been a boring piece of shit, but at least it wouldn’t be so confusing and dumb.This show is also amazingly forthright with how trashy it is. It may rattle off endless dialogue in an attempt to feel intelligent, if only on a kindergarten level, but its fanservice is flagrant. Don’t get me wrong. There is certainly diegetic fanservice—like whenever one of the girls squats or bends over right in front of the main guy’s crotch like a porn actress, we’re treated to a nice shot of her exposed lower-back and ass—but there will also be totally lecherous and nonsensical shots of girls’ bodies apropos of nothing. This isn’t even mentioning all the ridiculous shit the characters do in service of pandering which totally shatterers your suspension of disbelief. Waifu #2 is literally introduced by walking up to the main guy, shoving her hand down his throat, fingering his tongue, removing her hand covered in drool, talking down to him like a dominatrix, and then smothering his face in her tits. Seriously, is this a new fetish or something? What that fuck is this?It is genuinely challenging for me to describe the characters in this show without describing other characters from other anime. Siesta tells the main guy he’s perfect for covert detective work because his face is so unexceptional, anyone who sees it will quickly forget about it. This is funny not simply because I can say the exact same thing about this show in its entirety, but because I can also say the same thing about her and every other one-dimensional, cardboard character from within it.Watch Re:Starting Life in Another World From Zero™.Take Emilia. Cut her hair into an even bob, leave her ribbon on the right side, remove the flower, and make her eyes blue instead of purple.Take Rem’s obsequious, unconditional love, but also Ram’s wry cleverness, and combine them into one girl.Congratulations. You’ve crafted Siesta from scratch. Now you have a sexy waifu to leer at, but one who you can also appreciate as an intellectual equal despite your apprehension toward women.Watch NISIOISIN’s Monogatari Series™.Take Araragi. Replace his disheveled hair with something more generic and refined, and widen his eyes a little too.Take his relatable cynicism, but remove all the character complexity and past experience which makes his personality believable.Congratulations. You’ve crafted the main guy from scratch. Now you can self-insert without having to be reminded of your social flaws which make this kind of escapist fantasy attractive to you in the first place.The main character’s real name is Kimihiko Kimizuka. In light of this, Siesta decides to nickname him “Kimi.” This makes sense considering his name, but what the show attempts to lampshade is the fact “kimi” is the Japanese word for “you.” If you’ve never seen one of these self-insert harem shows, this may seem meaningless, but if you’re familiar with the way these shows work, you probably see why this is so unbelievably shameless. The dialogue scenes in these shows often use a Shot/Reverse Shot directing style, so when the waifu on screen is talking to the main guy stood across from her, she is effectively just talking directly into the camera. In other words, she’s looking at and speaking to the audience. This is prefect for self-insert escapism, and there are even shows like One Room which consist exclusively of a girl talking to the camera and pretending to be your girlfriend, but this show has found a way to have its cake and eat it too. Unlike One Room, it has a real cast of characters, but in practice, it almost nullifies this fact by having the waifu refer to the main character as “you” instead of his actual name, so you can just jerk off and not have to worry about hearing another man’s name ruining the fantasy, because as far as you’re concerned, she’s talking to you. If not so morally contemptible, this manipulation would be hilarious.“The novel is better.”This statement is a fallacy. While it’s true most anime are just advertisements for the source material, especially those produced by companies like Kadokawa, shilling the source material to your fellow anime fans is assuming they actually give a shit about reading it, but I don’t. I’m trying to find good anime, not good manga, and certainly not good light novels. Given the absurd amount of monotonous dialogue packed into this show, it’s effectively a novel in and of itself, so if it’s any consolation, this show is still a piece of shit even if you’re only viewing it as an advertisement for the novel. After all, it gives me no reason to assume the novel which it’s advertising is any less shitty, and even if the novel isn’t shitty, that fact wouldn’t somehow make the anime less shitty. If you ever see someone throwing around the word “secondary” as an insult, you know the point they’re making is wrongheaded. Attempting to discredit someone’s opinion on an anime because they haven’t read the source material is a flawed line of thinking, because it’s attempting to force a conflation between adaptations and supplemental materials, when in reality, an adaptation is its own work which should be criticized on its own merits. These people may be correct, and the source material may be better, but it doesn’t defend the anime, and that’s what we’re talking about here.I almost forgot to mention how ugly this show is. I think it goes without saying it’s artistically soulless, but even on a technical level, it’s just poorly produced. The first episode isn’t mind-boggling or anything, but it’s serviceable, and it has a few cuts of cool animation. However, this premier is unapologetic bait on which all efforts were expended and all good animators were invited, and everything afterward looks progressively worse. The background quality drops to the point it can be painful to watch, and the animation is never too far behind. This is often the case with light novel adaptations, but this show has a particularly bad case of shitty character designs. Light novel cover art is extremely detailed, so it’s rare for an animation studio to adapt these designs faithfully into an anime, but any character designer worth his or her salt shouldn’t have a hard time simplifying the designs for a proper adaptation. However, if the character designer is a hack or if the studio just doesn’t have the talent, and if this ineptitude is then combined with shitty animation, that’s how you end up with shows like Overlord, Youjo Senki, 86, Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody, or this fucking trainwreck. I think I’m going to give this show a One, but I honestly believe it deserves a Two. It wasn’t downright offensive, and its only real crime was waterboarding me with boredom, so in all fairness, it probably deserves a Two, but it simply has no redeeming qualities. If you put a gun to my head, I still wouldn’t be able to say anything unconditionally nice about it. I mean, frankly, if you put a gun to my head, so long as it allowed me to stop watching this trash, I’d pull the fucking trigger for you.Thank you for reading. middle school loser becoming Discount James Bond, traveling the world fighting international counterintelligence and terror organizations, but also aliens, mind controllers, werewolves, and superhuman androids enjoyed by anyone? Because he does so with a cute detective waifu at his side constantly trying to fall on his dick. I don’t know if it’s a spoiler to say this, but as the title suggests, the detective is, indeed, already dead, so everything I just described only takes place in flashbacks, and everything happening in present day consists of new, different girls trying to fall on his dick. This is actually genius when you think about it, because now you and the self-insert protagonist don’t have to choose a best girl, and can instead just fuck them both, one in the past, and another in the present. But I didn’t mean to so quickly sweep all that dumb shit under the rug. To say this show contains aliens, mind control, werewolves, and superhuman androids is not a spoiler, because they aren’t treated as mysteries nor presented as reveals. I know this may seem odd considering nothing about the premise or promotional material would suggest this show gets that ridiculous, but that’s just it. This show makes no attempt to build the world or make the setting feel distinctive. Everything will look and feel totally banal, and then suddenly you’re watching this indescribable Frankenstein’s Monster of disparate genres and ideas which don’t mix together at all. This may be a weird thing to say, but nothing in this show feels like it was done in the right order. Yes, the pacing is incompetent, but that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s hard to put this into words, but scenes are just so poorly considered and end up feeling awkward or like there’re taking place in the wrong context. The lifeless directing and ultra-generic art style don’t help either, because a weird and out-of-place character or concept will be introduced, and the music will change to try and switch the tone, but NOTHING changes visually, so the whole sequence just feels deadpan—like the building blocks making up the scene were ordered wrong or internally misplaced.With all that said, the real reason this show is such a boring piece of shit is plain and simple: it just has awful writing. Siesta’s motto as a detective is, “A first-rate detective gets a handle on a case before the incident occurs,” and this motto is the central gimmick of the series. We and our self-insert protagonist are the fish out of water, and Siesta is the seemingly clairvoyant, Holmesian mastermind who already holds all the relevant knowledge beforehand. We, the audience, are supposed to marvel at her intelligence, but what the author doesn’t understand is that this does not make for an interesting story. It is well-established that what makes detective stories engaging is the audience’s desire to solve the mystery with the clues and foreshadowing provided by the author, but if you know the author isn’t going to provide you with ANY clues or ANY foreshadowing, and is instead going to constantly pull random shit out of thin air and expect you to applaud his creativity, then you’ll immediately lose interest. However, what makes this show in particular its own special brand of retarded, is that explanatory information is withheld even during scenes which have nothing to do with mystery.This show is amazingly forthright with how contrived it is.Why does our teenage waifu decide to move in with our teenage protagonist half a day after they meet?Just because.Why does our middle school aged protagonist with no credentials get an international license to carry by an intelligence syndicate?Just because.Why does Waifu #2 get a heart transplant that magically imbues her with the thoughts and emotions of the heart’s original owner?Just because.Why can our normal human waifu safely jump out of a building wearing a dress, high heels, and carrying our protagonist in her arms?Just because.Why does Waifu #3 stop some random asshole on the street who she’s never met before and assume he’s a legendary detective?Just because.Why does our waifu’s blood turn into bullets, and why do those bullets magically revoke a person’s free will?Just because.Why does our protagonist scream “It’s time for My Teen Romantic Comedy™!” despite rejecting our waifu’s romanic advances?Just for the memes.I have twelve episodes worth of this bullshit to chose from, so trust me when I say I could do this all day. Any principle fixture of the plot or character chemistry is totally preposterous, and it’s not even in service of anything interesting. Remember, this show is just a battle harem, yet in its attempts to stand out, it just embarrasses itself when it probably would’ve been better off relying on more standard concepts. The show still would’ve been a boring piece of shit, but at least it wouldn’t be so confusing and dumb.This show is also amazingly forthright with how trashy it is. It may rattle off endless dialogue in an attempt to feel intelligent, if only on a kindergarten level, but its fanservice is flagrant. Don’t get me wrong. There is certainly diegetic fanservice—like whenever one of the girls squats or bends over right in front of the main guy’s crotch like a porn actress, we’re treated to a nice shot of her exposed lower-back and ass—but there will also be totally lecherous and nonsensical shots of girls’ bodies apropos of nothing. This isn’t even mentioning all the ridiculous shit the characters do in service of pandering which totally shatterers your suspension of disbelief. Waifu #2 is literally introduced by walking up to the main guy, shoving her hand down his throat, fingering his tongue, removing her hand covered in drool, talking down to him like a dominatrix, and then smothering his face in her tits. Seriously, is this a new fetish or something? What that fuck is this?It is genuinely challenging for me to describe the characters in this show without describing other characters from other anime. Siesta tells the main guy he’s perfect for covert detective work because his face is so unexceptional, anyone who sees it will quickly forget about it. This is funny not simply because I can say the exact same thing about this show in its entirety, but because I can also say the same thing about her and every other one-dimensional, cardboard character from within it.Watch Re:Starting Life in Another World From Zero™.Take Emilia. Cut her hair into an even bob, leave her ribbon on the right side, remove the flower, and make her eyes blue instead of purple.Take Rem’s obsequious, unconditional love, but also Ram’s wry cleverness, and combine them into one girl.Congratulations. You’ve crafted Siesta from scratch. Now you have a sexy waifu to leer at, but one who you can also appreciate as an intellectual equal despite your apprehension toward women.Watch NISIOISIN’s Monogatari Series™.Take Araragi. Replace his disheveled hair with something more generic and refined, and widen his eyes a little too.Take his relatable cynicism, but remove all the character complexity and past experience which makes his personality believable.Congratulations. You’ve crafted the main guy from scratch. Now you can self-insert without having to be reminded of your social flaws which make this kind of escapist fantasy attractive to you in the first place.The main character’s real name is Kimihiko Kimizuka. In light of this, Siesta decides to nickname him “Kimi.” This makes sense considering his name, but what the show attempts to lampshade is the fact “kimi” is the Japanese word for “you.” If you’ve never seen one of these self-insert harem shows, this may seem meaningless, but if you’re familiar with the way these shows work, you probably see why this is so unbelievably shameless. The dialogue scenes in these shows often use a Shot/Reverse Shot directing style, so when the waifu on screen is talking to the main guy stood across from her, she is effectively just talking directly into the camera. In other words, she’s looking at and speaking to the audience. This is prefect for self-insert escapism, and there are even shows like One Room which consist exclusively of a girl talking to the camera and pretending to be your girlfriend, but this show has found a way to have its cake and eat it too. Unlike One Room, it has a real cast of characters, but in practice, it almost nullifies this fact by having the waifu refer to the main character as “you” instead of his actual name, so you can just jerk off and not have to worry about hearing another man’s name ruining the fantasy, because as far as you’re concerned, she’s talking to you.

And by that, I do mean how potential viewers should expect from the show altogether. Let's face it, the English title should also fire some questions into your head. You may be asking yourself why the detective is 'already dead' or who really dies in the show. In what seems like a thematically intriguing premise quickly turns sour when we realize just how mediocre this actually turned out to be.Taking a step back, I didn't want to be judgmental at first glance. In fact, I was actually impressed by some of the promotional...material it showed off, especially a gun wielding girl fighting what seemingly taking place on board an aircraft. It's very confrontational from the start and leaves little room to breath for the first episode. To further its experience, the show decided to air the action style pilot at double the standard length, as a way to give us a taste of what to expect. Does the first episode make or break the chance to enjoy the anime? Let's find out.For starters, we do meet two prominent characters - Siesta and Kimihiko as they get caught in the middle of a plane hijacking. To make matters worse, the hijacker has supernatural abilities that can threaten everyone aboard the plane. Siesta's request to Kimihiko to become her assistant is replied with ambigiouity although he has little choice than to team up if they both want to survive. It sets forth the core of the show as the duo begin their adventures together. Fast forward and later, they are thrown into a high school setting and for some reason, the anime decided to add in a wedding dress for Siesta. I'll leave that to your imagination but let's just say that such a transition is a massive direction in setting. But you may still be asking yourself: just who exactly is Siesta?With Kimihiko's rotten luck, you'd expect him to be the last person on Earth to meet a stunning girl like Siesta. Even more so, he becomes her partner after displaying his innate skills in a complicated situation. Watching the two work together at first seemed as mysterious as the main premise itself. They have nothing in common but are seemingly bound by fate. It's not soon after when the story transits into meaning of the anime's title and we find out who the dead detective is. However, it would also appear that Kimihiko isn't fully ready to move on with his life and this draws him to other girls such as Nagisa. From here, his life gets perhaps even more complicated than ever before.Now I want to be discret and warn that the anime's story can be a bit confusing at times. From what the anime adapted, some novels are out of order and it deepens the confusion. It's not that the anime is difficult to understand but that it doesn't follow a traditional chapter-by-chapter adaptation format. Watching this anime did show me the depth of Kimihiko's personality as he develops peculiar relationships among its cast. Unfortunately, most of these lacks the sort of concrete depth you should be expecting. For instance, Kimihiko's character relationship with Nagisa is bleak at best as the girl practically forces him to help her. Their confrontation can almost be described as brutal and replusive to the point where Kimihiko feels like a victim. That is to say, it's also hard to feel sorry for Kimihiko when we can't get fully invested into his character. We don't know much about his past except for his relationship with Siesta. In respect, I think it's dangerous for the anime to plant the story in this direction. We can only ask ourselves more and more questions about the past while almost being neglected to know about the present. Then again, this is a mystery anime, right?In some aspects, I do appreciate at how the show handles its mystery in terms of revelations. While some story segments are easily predictable, others can be misguided and with red herrings. However, it's not a complicated storyteller where the show feels like a puzzle. What's unsettling about the storytelling is the way the anime depicts Siesta's overall character role. She goes from alive to dead in different episodes and sometimes, you have to ask yourself what exactly the author wants you to experience. Sorrow? Suspense? Ambiguity? In essence, I ask myself what the purpose of the premise really is. Yes, the detective is already dead but at the same time, she is also alive. I think from the beginning, killing a character like Siesta permantely would set off a massive red flag so the series avoids this by bringing her back in different ways. It's clever on some levels but also disappointing. Why? Let's just say that the more times she is on screen, the less appealing the mystery is. If it can even be called that...because honest to God, the 'mystery' of the show is more of an amateur detective fiction.Holding the show further back is the reminder of the cast. Among them advertised from the key visuals include Yui, Charlotte, Alicia, and Nagisa. Yes, this anime may not be a harem but having Kimihiko pair up with them gives off a stench. Oh and did I almost forgot to mention the SPES? That's a mysterious organization who is deeply involved with Siesta. Unfortunately, the show does a poor job at making them look like a credible threat or at least one for fans to invest into. The more and I watched the anime, the less appealing it felt with each episode lacking the thrilling suspense I anticipated. The characters are underdeveloped and far too much emphasis is dedicated to Siesta, whether she's dead or alive. If I wanted to see a mystery anime, I could've picked up something more coherent. What we got here is nothing short of a jumble of incoherent mess.But....I do want to praise the anime's visual quality. While the main story lacked a compelling plot, the artistic visuals speaks another language. The female cast such as Siesta, Charlotte, and Nagisa are characterized with alluring appeals that makes them stand out compared to almost anyone else. Furthermore, the consistency of colorful backgrounds is clear from the very first episode. It also falls no short in showing the action sequence and violence on occasions, when given the opportunity. Elsewhere, there's also some degrees of fan service such as the classy swimsuit episode or when Nagisa ruthlessly bullies Kimihiko with suggestive yet sexy behavior.Yes, that's it. To call this show a deep complex mystery would be an illusion. What started as an appealing premiere ended up being one of the most underwhelming anime of the Summer 2021 season. That's not an exaggeration because after watching the anime, I felt almost betrayed. If you want better a mystery, watch something with an actual planned out plot and meaningful character cast.

This ain't it folks."", ""Never heard of this show, Synopsis didn't really give any viable information on what the plot is. Heck even the cover art doesn't match the title for some reason. The detective is already dead? but what's the harem of girls at the back?Watched it and well..The 1st episode was good, 50 minutes long, a massive leadup to the twist provided in the synopsis. We get introduced to the Mc and Siesta, the mythical powers in the world along with the antagonists gets introduced. It was good, we get to see how the two become partners albeit for one episode only.Then we get episodes...2-4 and things go down the drain, what looked like a promising concept turned into a bunny girl senpai-esque harem show with Date a live looking characters.Episode 2 was sort of good? I mean we did get Nagisa and a bit of Siesta but whatever plot idea we got from that episode was thrown out the door when episode 3 came along.It's toughI don't want to be too harsh to this adaptation because I've heard good things about the ln but.....I was so disappointed with the recent episodes, mainly because it went against my expectations but in the wrong way. I'm a fan of harem shows don't get me wrong but I just don't like it when it goes this kind of route.Let me repeat, the disappointment isn't because the show doesn't live up to the hype people said it has, it is because it changes plots so suddenly, from a seemingly mystery thriller to becoming a romance/harem show with a sprinkle of mystery to returning back to a mystery thriller the next episode then becoming a beach episode.It's this inconsistency that really brings this show down, it feels like its trying to appeal to as much people as possible rather than commit to what has already been setupyou have an established antagonist group from the 1st episode, a twist of Siesta dying and the middle schooler mc having to deal with it, I won't blame you if you think this was a mystery anime. Heck Episode 2 as well made me think oh cool so it keeps the mystery theme along with referencing Siesta and the addition of Nagisa to the detective crew?Then it pulls a 180 on episode 3 and 4, it keeps a little mystery in exchange we get a cute girl with seemingly no connection to Siesta at all.-It still remains the same up until Episode 6 so far- inconsistent plot and allAlso why do some of the characters look like bootleg characters from other harem shows? Siesta looks and talks like Origami from date a live albeit with a little more emotion heck Saikawa is bootleg Kurumi as well.Animation is lacking but that's understandable coming from a new studio.The show has been disappointing but it's a fiesta, the plot is everywhere and that's probably why you should watch it. It's a mess of an adaptation.also cameo from god and fox friend in episode 3.I'll give it a 5 for now, I don't want to be too harsh especially since I like the mystery genre 2-4 and things go down the drain, what looked like a promising concept turned into a bunny girl senpai-esque harem show with Date a live looking characters.Episode 2 was sort of good?

The Detective is Already Dead fits this role perfectly. With one-dimensional characters, an unengaging story, and plain awful visuals, there is next to no praise that can be given for the series. Don’t worry though, as it makes up for this by making sure there’s at least one cute girl in every scene.There is an abundance of poorly directed scenes that lack the intended impact that they were going for. The moments that are...supposed to feel emotional will feel no different from every other scene. This is due to a number of reasons but ultimately comes down to the flat characters and their lackluster responses to anything that happens. The art and animation quality doesn’t help either when every character is awkwardly placed in a scene with a blank expression. As a viewer, you don’t know what you’re supposed to feel at a scene because it never gives you a good reason to feel a certain way. All it does is chuck in a couple of potentially sad scenes without using proper visual techniques to back it up.You might’ve noticed a certain mystery tag on the show but don’t be fooled, there are essentially no mystery elements to be found. I’m not even sure if Mystery was supposed to be a major aspect of the plot, but when mysteries are present they are handled terribly. In most good mystery anime, you'll find that it engages you with foreshadowing, hints at a greater narrative, and an exciting sense of discovery. The best part of mysteries is when you feel as though you are figuring out the plot right along with the characters. This anime, however, makes no attempt at the aforementioned techniques. Instead of uncovering the plot with the characters, you will be stuck watching as the main character figures things on his own with no explanation to the viewer. Then, once the whole “mystery” is over he will explain it all in one big long scene of boring dialogue. The foreshadowing is atrocious, and the only purpose mystery serves is to make our main character look all clever by the end of it. I’m not kidding when I say one episode of Scooby-Doo would have better mysteries than what this show tries to do.The characters were particularly frustrating throughout the show, including everyone’s beloved white-haired waifu, Siesta. I felt physical pain every time there was attempted humour in the dialogue. It’s obvious what they were going for with the main character’s deadpan reactions and Siesta’s typical kuudere bluntness, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a worse attempt at it. The dialogue aims to be clever but never achieves more than being flat and unfunny. While I can at least give credit for the attempts at fun dialogue for the main duo, the rest of the characters are simply boring. It amounts to nothing more than some basic personalities slapped onto a generic character design. I find it amazing that they can describe the main character as ‘forgettable’ throughout the show and not wonder if having a forgettable main character is actually a bad thing.Of course, these major issues don’t matter when there are some cute girls in the show. While going about defeating the big bad organization the main character manages to get several cute girls on his side to help him fight his battles. In fact, he’s so good at attracting cute girls that there isn’t a single other male character that isn’t on the side of the antagonists. I feel like this would be a given at this point, but don’t expect any sort of character development. Even after a character's death, which is so major that they included it in the title, we don’t get to see any characters attempt to cope with it. Instead they just sort of go on about their lives and all is okay right after a time skip.There are times where the writing in this series can feel even childish. Take the antagonistic force for example, it’s nothing more than a generic evil organization given the name ‘SPES.’ Things like the motives and ideologies of the organization aren’t clearly explained and the representatives of the organization are your average bad guys. It’s unable to challenge the views of the protagonist, only seeking to end the world. It would’ve been much better if it stuck to one clear villain that can properly conflict with the protagonist’s own motives and world views. The series thinks up one cool scenario, such as a plane hijacking for an opening episode, and never uses it to its advantage.If you were hoping for visuals to make up for this prepare to be disappointed. Some people may view the quality to be acceptable, especially after an okay first episode, but you can easily see it drop right from the second episode. For starters, I couldn’t help but notice that most scenes would just leave out crowds from backgrounds making the whole show feel isolated. Movement is stiff and the fight scenes avoid movement as much as possible, just throwing in still shots of characters talking rather than fighting. The expressions fail to give a good impression of a character's feelings and are never more detailed than the average wide-eyes shocked face. As far as soundtracks go this one was unimpressive and forgettable. It never quite matched the scene and added little value to the show as a whole. I might just be nitpicking here, but there was a noticeable amount of sound effects missing that the show needed. Scenes felt quiet because of this and were unable to really stick out as something important.The Detective is Already Dead is awful in every way possible. It calls itself a mystery yet fails to actually provide engaging mysteries. The characters are nothing new, though I can guarantee that people will watch this for the sole purpose of seeing more Siesta. On top of this, it doesn’t even have good visuals or soundtracks to back it up. It’s what happens when a studio has no sense of direction or time management, only seeking to capitalize on a popular light novel, and I would recommend staying clear of it if you value your time. supposed to feel emotional will feel no different from every other scene. This is due to a number of reasons but ultimately comes down to the flat characters and their lackluster responses to anything that happens. The art and animation quality doesn’t help either when every character is awkwardly placed in a scene with a blank expression. As a viewer, you don’t know what you’re supposed to feel at a scene because it never gives you a good reason to feel a certain way. All it does is chuck in a couple of potentially sad scenes without using proper visual techniques to back it up.You might’ve noticed a certain mystery tag on the show but don’t be fooled, there are essentially no mystery elements to be found. I’m not even sure if Mystery was supposed to be a major aspect of the plot, but when mysteries are present they are handled terribly. In most good mystery anime, you'll find that it engages you with foreshadowing, hints at a greater narrative, and an exciting sense of discovery. The best part of mysteries is when you feel as though you are figuring out the plot right along with the characters. This anime, however, makes no attempt at the aforementioned techniques. Instead of uncovering the plot with the characters, you will be stuck watching as the main character figures things on his own with no explanation to the viewer. Then, once the whole “mystery” is over he will explain it all in one big long scene of boring dialogue. The foreshadowing is atrocious, and the only purpose mystery serves is to make our main character look all clever by the end of it.

Someone comes up with a brilliant idea: “let’s confuse them so much, they’ll HAVE to watch the show!” And what’s more, this idea actually fits with the themes of the story! And so, all the PR staff put their heads together and come up with an intriguing, faithful, and popular marketing campaign that garners eyes from all over.People are constantly speculating, discussing, and spreading the word about your adaptation! Bloody brilliant! The PR team’s...done its job, and a spectacular one at that. All you have to do now is execute even a HALF-decent adaptation and you’ll get a respectable number of BD/merch sales, possibly even enough to cover production costs. NOTHING can possibly go wrong.Oh, wait.There are a number of issues with your show. Subpar direction. Atrocious animation -- apart from one sakuga sequence in episode 1 by Hashimoto Ryuuki. Barely functional backgrounds. A disjointed story. How?Well, your answer lies with 株式会社KADOKAWA -  not Studio ENGI, as I, and many others, may be inclined to believe. Shall we begin?Earlier this year, during KADOKAWA’s FY2020 report, the company outlined plans to ramp up anime production to 40 per year. 40. Per. Year. From. One. Company. It’s an obviously unsustainable plan - the industry in its CURRENT state is chock-full of production bottlenecks, overwork, and thin profit margins (if any at all). It didn’t bode well for anime as a medium. And Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru. (Tanmoshi) is case in point.Tanmoshi entered production in LATE 2020. FOR A JULY 2021 PREMIERE. To illustrate how absolutely absurd that is, in an absolute time crunch, a studio may be able to produce a fully-animated episode of an anime in five weeks. (That’s an incredibly unrealistic pace for even just one good episode, let alone an entire cour, but we’ll let it slide.) Tanmoshi has approximately 13 episodes worth of animation material (the first episode premiered with 50 minutes - which in itself was a terrible decision that I’ll get to later).So, doing some very simple mathematics with some very unrealistic benefit of the doubt, 13*5 comes out to 65 weeks for Tanmoshi to be a fully finished product with regard to animation. Assuming a July 1 production start date - again, being very generous here - that’s STILL ONLY 52 WEEKS AND SOME CHANGE. Oh and, of course not accounting for national holidays like Obon in September of 2020. So - that’s a whole 13 WEEKS shaved off the schedule. Which, again, for those of us who have forgotten our times tables, is TWENTY. GODDAMN. PERCENT. With this, inevitably, comes outsourcing. And said outsourcing did not perform well. Which is not out of the norm. So, uh, no surprise that the anime really struggles on the production value side of things.You may be wondering, what does Kadokawa have to do with this? Well - as the owners of the rights to Tanmoshi, it’s Kadokawa who both choose a time to approach a studio AND who largely dictate when an anime will premiere. THEY foisted this timeline upon ENGI. Logically, the next question would be “why didn’t ENGI simply reject the project?”Well… they couldn’t. Kadokawa is the majority stakeholder of ENGI. ENGI is beholden to Kadokawa. It’s likely that no other studio could handle such a fantastical contract, and so it was dumped upon the youngling ENGI - who, by the way, don’t have the greatest track record when it comes to their anime.All this begs the question, “how is this remotely beneficial for Kadokawa?” Easy: as a publishing company first and foremost, Kadokawa couldn't care less about studios, anime as medium, or adaptations. Their first and predominant priority is the promotion of source sales - the light novels, in this case. Anything else is a bonus. Which means, the adaptation did its job. The light novel has skyrocketed in Oricon sales rankings, with all five volumes out currently in the top 20. (The light novels are GOOD.)Thus, most of this train wreck of anime can be wholly attributed to Kadokawa -- ENGI really just needed more time.I say most, because while I addressed the categories of Art and Sound (all of the production value related stuff), I have yet to consider the merits of the story. As a diehard fan of the source, I have my prejudices here - but they probably won’t matter. This is an objectively trash adaptation story-wise, too.Remember that 50-minute premiere episode I said I was going to get to? We’ve just gotten to it. A terrible decision to start the cour off. What the anime did was take a coherent story - and rearrange events in the timeline to the point where the intrigue, the charm, the suspense - all vanished. It took a well-developed but mysterious Siesta and inappropriately (in the context of the story) contrasted it to the seemingly 2D, bland Natsunagi. The characters didn’t work with the flow of the story. In essence, it made episode 1 work better than it should have had it kept a normal length and stuck to the story - but in relation to the rest of the show, IT DIDN’T MAKE SENSE.The story jumped from setting to setting, seemingly with no distinction to the development of any character, and left plotlines hanging unresolved until a later point with a dissatisfactory conclusion supported by a lack of exposition and storytelling.There were hints of the source’s brilliance and of passion/competency on the part of the staff throughout Tanmoshi. Episodes 1 and 4, episodes 8 and 10, they were tolerable, acceptable, even, in many aspects. But that isn’t enough to salvage a show. It simply isn’t. If you’re considering getting into this show, may I suggest the light novel? Because otherwise, the show isn’t worth your time.2/10.Thanks, Kadokawa. done its job, and a spectacular one at that.

This is a Frankenstein anime made of a convoluted mix of tropes: harem, mechas, tentacles, werewolves, aliens, terrorists, you name it.This anime did everything it could to call attention to it: white-haired waifu bait, a few seconds of high quality animation in episode 1, vtubers cameos, character designs that look stolen from \'Date a Live\' and harem merchandise marketing, but after it got the attention it wanted, it was an utterly disappointment since it didn\'t have anything to stand on its own.The ""mystery"" consist of characters...saying that they ""knew it all along"" without providing any logic explanation to the viewer. The ""comedy"" consist of cringe ""quippy"" lines from the male MC, who is a middle schooler that somehow looks and acts like a salary man and doesn\'t change physically despite going through 4 years of puberty.Characters are devoid of personality and sometimes even their basic reason for existing in the story is not clear. Female characters are harem fillers, enemy characters are dumber than a videogame set on ""super easy"" mode and the overall plot is full of contrived and absurd developments.This anime may be a good watch for those who want to analyze a case study on ""how not to write a story"". saying that they ""knew it all along"" without providing any logic explanation to the viewer.

I heard that they make some rearrangement from the light novel. one of their LN fans said that it was for the audience to get invested in this siesta character. but for me, that\'s seriously a bad take. they should just limit it only to 30 minutes.-episode 2:-I mean like siesta just death was like 1 year ago. and he finally get to go to school again, and suddenly this new girl just came to him, and then out of nowhere she already receive the heart transplant (obviously getting it from siesta). it was even resolved just in one episode .and then they go to that kind of drama where they said that siesta heart longing for the mc even after she died. and then nagisa slap him for not being sensitive and all. man I literally watch that scene with a straight face. not enough development, this nagisa girl was also just introduced a while ago. that\'s really a bad execution for the drama part.-yeah it\'s been like 1 year since she got the heart transplant, but the thing was we actually didn\'t see what she felt in that one year. that\'s why the scene between her and the mc in the jail felt off. there is not enough build up to feel maybe sad, sympathy, or something like that.-and okay so he is now a third year student in high school, so maybe his age is like between 17-18. So the fight on the airplane was 4 years ago. are you telling me they went to all that adventure begin when that guy was 13-14 ? He wasn\'t behave like a middle schooler at all and he looks the same even after 4 years oh god. man who tf design this character, we need to talk.-episode 3:-for this episode, I don\'t have much to complain, it\'s just the scene where nagisa finally get ready to move on after what happened to her was horribly executed. her back story was so short man. I just can\'t get invested in her past story and it ended up with this kind of half cooked conclusion.-episode 4:-arrive late to the concert, didn\'t have communication tools(walkie talkie, etc), didn\'t use your connection with the police to ask the for personal guards at the concert. ma boy I thought you were the assistant for the legendary detective for 3 years ? nah man what tf is all of these.- and also why did you bother to make all the deduction but just to blame that spes organization or whatever their name every single time. I mean c\'mon you already know from the start, don\'t bother to make this a mystery if you already know who tf planned all this shit.- and then you have a loli with a fucking pistol and tried to kill you, and the solution was a ""do you want to be our friend ?"" and the loli just cry all over the place, end. haha man that was just madness. we don\'t even see the loli reaction after getting threaten by the spes, we didn\'t see her desperateness to be alive, was he scared, was she in despair because no one there to help her. but in the end, a mere ""you want to be my friend ?"" was the conclusion for a girl who tried to kill you. absolute madness-episode 5-tbh, I quite like this episode. you can see that the story about cerberus really well constructed. We\'ve got the introduction in the first 10 min, some action in the middle and a good cliffhanger in the end. idk why they can\'t do this from the start of the series.-even so, I don\'t understand why did they include that fan service at the start, seriously unnecessary and also a mf mecha out of nowhere in the end of the episode. they really shouldn\'t even include comedy tag in there tbh, they need to put the whole circus as the tag in there. but overall I really like this episode. at least, it\'s not as disastrous as the previous 4.-episode 6-once again, I would say when you keep going back and forth so much time, the consistency wasn\'t there. it\'s not only on the story, but also the characters as well. so in this episode we\'ve seen where siesta nearly die there, even though we all know she not gonna die that easily. my question is they\'ve been going on the adventure for 3 years already, isn\'t there any life threathening situation similar in this episode ? and also the way kimizuka reacts, it\'s the same as nagisa\'s scene in episode 2, doesn\'t really felt anything on it. this is what happened when there are no exact build up on it.-also in this episode, I would say they will never go to that kind of fully serious route. at first, you thought that damn this shit finally going to get serious, and then suddenly you got a loli with an amnesia out of nowhere get into the team. and then that loli probably gonna have a specific power to solve the current case.-episode 7- I really think their major problem is their consistency on the story direction. I mean in this type of story which revolves around detective, investigation and all this kind of shit, personally I love to see they go to a more darker theme. this is because they basically deal with that spes organization that cost people lives all the time, that\'s some heavy cases to be considered. it\'s not like they deal with light cases such as what you see in hyouka for example.-so when I see they split it to like half of it was dark and half of it was light. for me they need to at least decide which direction they want to go. basically in this episode, it\'s just a useless shit that don\'t even contribute anything to the story. when there are episodes that didn\'t heavily involve with the spes, they basically just give us that kind of romantic moment between kimi and siesta. it\'s like giving kids candies after they gone through a shit day.  it\'s not like I\'m against that kind of ""light"" episodes or something, nah I\'m good with it. but the point is, it\'s so obvious that they want to go 50/50 with the direction. and for me, that ain\'t something that I love to see tbh.-episode 8- once again , they failed to connect these characters to the actual timeline . like what I\'ve said before , they\'ve been going on the adventure for 3 years already , the amount of emotion they emitted were ridiculous . it\'s also applied on how they act , c\'mon I thought this siesta girl was the great detective , why the hell she didn\'t take any action before those victim die ? I mean what the actual hell man , they treat it like this was their first mission . it doesn\'t make sense at all bruh . and also the way their shifting the story\'s tone , just pick one , either you want to go happy or serious , that\'s it .- and how they exclude the op and ed theme , man I\'m expecting something big ,I mean we all know if any show going full throttle without iclue their op and ed theme , that episode gonna go wild . but as usual , all we got was half assed made episode .-episode 9- yeah we\'ve got another talk no jutsu scene . the first one koumori , the second one saikawa , and they ad more to the list in this episode lol .- once again , I didn\'t know how much I\'ve talk about it in this review but man , they literally treat this arc like it was their first ever mission together . and the so called romantic scene that didn\'t even blend well together , I didn\'t have any kind of attachment to these characters , in any ways or whatsoever . the plot inconsistency really disturb the execution , that scene between them should\'ve felt more dramatic and sad . but yeah all we got was ass .-episode 11damn that fight is just Nauseated face , what happened was he waited for charl to shoot him and avoid all those bullets , but not going invisible and hide somewhere else ? I mean wtf . and the moment where charl decide to burn the ship , I mean the chameleon had a fucking good agility and vision to deny those bullets with his tail , but can\'t actually see the lighter which moves slower than the bullets ? wtf- and why tf alicia suddenly become the essential character here , and how tf siesta heart moves from hel to natsunagi in just one year . wtf happened here oh god . and if alicia can took over natsunagi\'s body , doesn\'t that mean siesta can do the same ? and why natsunagi only remember about siesta while alicia is somewhere in there too ?- final episode- yeah as usual , with their cringy conversation while fighting that monster . at this point I can\'t complain about anything anymore . all my frustration were left on the previous weekly review . so yeah that\'s it , one of the worst show this year , just next to ex arm . finally it\'s going to an end . praise the god for making me watching this without punching my laptop screen . festival out of nowhere. I heard that they make some rearrangement from the light novel. one of their LN fans said that it was for the audience to get invested in this siesta character. but for me, that\'s seriously a bad take. they should just limit it only to 30 minutes.-episode 2:-I mean like siesta just death was like 1 year ago. and he finally get to go to school again, and suddenly this new girl just came to him, and then out of nowhere she already receive the heart transplant (obviously getting it from siesta). it was even resolved just in one episode .and then they go to that kind of drama where they said that siesta heart longing for the mc even after she died. and then nagisa slap him for not being sensitive and all. man I literally watch that scene with a straight face. not enough development, this nagisa girl was also just introduced a while ago. that\'s really a bad execution for the drama part.-yeah it\'s been like 1 year since she got the heart transplant, but the thing was we actually didn\'t see what she felt in that one year. that\'s why the scene between her and the mc in the jail felt off. there is not enough build up to feel maybe sad, sympathy, or something like that.-and okay so he is now a third year student in high school, so maybe his age is like between 17-18.

We\'ve got the introduction in the first 10 min, some action in the middle and a good cliffhanger in the end. idk why they can\'t do this from the start of the series.-even so, I don\'t understand why did they include that fan service at the start, seriously unnecessary and also a mf mecha out of nowhere in the end of the episode. they really shouldn\'t even include comedy tag in there tbh, they need to put the whole circus as the tag in there. but overall I really like this episode. at least, it\'s not as disastrous as the previous 4.-episode 6-once again, I would say when you keep going back and forth so much time, the consistency wasn\'t there. it\'s not only on the story, but also the characters as well. so in this episode we\'ve seen where siesta nearly die there, even though we all know she not gonna die that easily. my question is they\'ve been going on the adventure for 3 years already, isn\'t there any life threathening situation similar in this episode ? and also the way kimizuka reacts, it\'s the same as nagisa\'s scene in episode 2, doesn\'t really felt anything on it. this is what happened when there are no exact build up on it.-also in this episode, I would say they will never go to that kind of fully serious route. at first, you thought that damn this shit finally going to get serious, and then suddenly you got a loli with an amnesia out of nowhere get into the team. and then that loli probably gonna have a specific power to solve the current case.-episode 7- I really think their major problem is their consistency on the story direction. I mean in this type of story which revolves around detective, investigation and all this kind of shit, personally I love to see they go to a more darker theme. this is because they basically deal with that spes organization that cost people lives all the time, that\'s some heavy cases to be considered. it\'s not like they deal with light cases such as what you see in hyouka for example.-so when I see they split it to like half of it was dark and half of it was light. for me they need to at least decide which direction they want to go. basically in this episode, it\'s just a useless shit that don\'t even contribute anything to the story. when there are episodes that didn\'t heavily involve with the spes, they basically just give us that kind of romantic moment between kimi and siesta. it\'s like giving kids candies after they gone through a shit day.  it\'s not like I\'m against that kind of ""light"" episodes or something, nah I\'m good with it. but the point is, it\'s so obvious that they want to go 50/50 with the direction. and for me, that ain\'t something that I love to see tbh.-episode 8- once again , they failed to connect these characters to the actual timeline . like what I\'ve said before , they\'ve been going on the adventure for 3 years already , the amount of emotion they emitted were ridiculous . it\'s also applied on how they act , c\'mon I thought this siesta girl was the great detective , why the hell she didn\'t take any action before those victim die ? I mean what the actual hell man , they treat it like this was their first mission . it doesn\'t make sense at all bruh . and also the way their shifting the story\'s tone , just pick one , either you want to go happy or serious , that\'s it .- and how they exclude the op and ed theme , man I\'m expecting something big ,I mean we all know if any show going full throttle without iclue their op and ed theme , that episode gonna go wild . but as usual , all we got was half assed made episode .-episode 9- yeah we\'ve got another talk no jutsu scene . the first one koumori , the second one saikawa , and they ad more to the list in this episode lol .- once again , I didn\'t know how much I\'ve talk about it in this review but man , they literally treat this arc like it was their first ever mission together . and the so called romantic scene that didn\'t even blend well together , I didn\'t have any kind of attachment to these characters , in any ways or whatsoever . the plot inconsistency really disturb the execution , that scene between them should\'ve felt more dramatic and sad . but yeah all we got was ass .-episode 11damn that fight is just Nauseated face , what happened was he waited for charl to shoot him and avoid all those bullets , but not going invisible and hide somewhere else ? I mean wtf . and the moment where charl decide to burn the ship , I mean the chameleon had a fucking good agility and vision to deny those bullets with his tail , but can\'t actually see the lighter which moves slower than the bullets ? wtf- and why tf alicia suddenly become the essential character here , and how tf siesta heart moves from hel to natsunagi in just one year . wtf happened here oh god . and if alicia can took over natsunagi\'s body , doesn\'t that mean siesta can do the same ? and why natsunagi only remember about siesta while alicia is somewhere in there too ?- final episode- yeah as usual , with their cringy conversation while fighting that monster . at this point I can\'t complain about anything anymore . all my frustration were left on the previous weekly review . so yeah that\'s it , one of the worst show this year , just next to ex arm . finally it\'s going to an end . praise the god for making me watching this without punching my laptop screen .', ""The story was far different from what I imagined and It is pretty good. Yeah, the story seems slow at times but it didn't stop me from enjoying it. I started it and I wanna see the rest of it. Yeah, it wasted alot of potential story parts but as far as I know, the story will get good later.The animation and sound quality pretty ok.Its character development is slow but its happening. They brought rushed when bringing new characters thats a bit problem. But I hope they cover the gap in the future episodes.I just want to say Don't be influenced by...others.

But aside from the naming convention that sounds like a clear reference to Hokuto no Ken\'s Kenshiro\'s famous catchphrase, and as ""smart"" as the anime wants us to believe it does, ""Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru."" is a work that for the life of me (and many others) just couldn\'t seem to wrap around what it\'s trying to be.Nigojūu\'s biography is far more interesting than his work, not gonna lie, and for real. You can read it on Wikipedia, but the TL;DR is this: this guy, during his university days, was influenced by Oreimo so much that he wrote some light novels, only to be met with disappointment. Years later with the release of Saekano, he took part in Comiket events, formed a Doujin circle and dedicated most of his time into writing light novels and responding to open calls when competitions arose, and this work won the grand prize for Media Factory\'s 15th MJ Bunko J Light Novel Newcomer Award in 2019, which simultaneously started serializing in November of that same year. Nigojū\'s influences when creating Tanmoshi (the short nickname of this work) are from Oreimo, Saekano and even Oregairu, which these 3 are romance light novels, and IMO, it\'s heavily influenced as the anime had showed. So, blame this guy all you want if Tanmoshi felt more like the detective\'s harem version of BBC\'s Sherlock.And yes, the story/plot is just that: unknown enemies at work, detective earns a sidekick, and there it\'s off to solve the numerous cases of which all are linked to the usual organization ratcheting evil, how simple does that sound. The thing that makes Tanmoshi stand out is that the ""legendary detective"" Origami Tobiichi *oops, wrong character, ahem* Siesta, she is a kink of a potential waifu character that does what detectives do, but on an insane level. Dealing with shape-shifting beings from the underworld organization that is SPES, she is unstoppable in both action and wit to outwit them, even when she\'s already dead and has part of her organs transplanted onto others that can easily pass them off as being part of Siesta\'s party charade. If you were to ask me if this idea sounds fresh, it truly does feel that way. But the whole execution of the show of trying to leverage that fact of being a missionary detective class of a ""smart-ass"" case study just feels wrong on so many levels, and not to mention that there hardly isn\'t any kind of lore of rhyme and reason to it. Everything just screams: ""Since the plot device is there, why not let\'s use to our fullest potential, even when it looks or sounds bad.""And you\'ve guessed it, that plot device is rounded through Siesta\'s sidekick that is the ""troublemaker"" Kimihiko Kimizuka, a guy that\'s born with a condition that naturally attracts him to troublesome situations. You name it, he\'s in all of it. Being thrown into Siesta\'s detective mission on a whim, starting out with Episode 1\'s airplane hijacking that marks the start of the conflict between Siesta and SPES, he was literally forced into her mission without parole and acted as her sidekick for that duration. It was there when he made his mind to be her sidekick (NOT a detective, mind you) in the aftermath and proceeded to spent his time with her until the series\' title beckons her fate. A fun fact that Kimizuka\'s voiced by a newbie whom only had an insignificant work to his name, and this is VA Arata Nagai\'s MC debut. What\'s surprising is that he sounds like most other veteran male VAs in the industry (something akin along the likes of Bunny Girl Senpai\'s Kaito Ishikawa), and for a first main role, he does the job well to give some personality to Kimizuka, because he\'s a largely boring character to look at. Something that I\'ve noticed about Kimizuka, is that he has to be constantly spoon-fed with infodump, largely because he really doesn\'t know what\'s going on during his detecive adventures with Siesta, and that\'s fine.But bring in the other girls that are attached to Siesta in one way or another (the weak-hearted Nagisa Natsunagi, the sapphire-eyed Chuunibyu idol Yui Saikawa, and the ""before Kimizuka existed"" assistant Charlotte Arisaka Anderson), and the show\'s rhythm immediately trenches akin that to a not-so-alike rom-com harem situation (that thankfully isn\'t a core theme of the show). Kimizuka IS supposed to take Siesta\'s place and rekindle his thoughts before these girls show up, but they sure took Siesta\'s position and made him look like the joker fool of a sidekick once again. I get it that Kimizuka\'s supposed to push the plot forward, but the incoherent storytelling that makes even lesser sense as the series progresses is its Achilles\' Heel, so much that I gave up trying to analyze what could happen (as if the predictabilities aren\'t that obvious enough). Looking back on the influences of Oreimo, Saekano and Oregairu, the one thing that Nigojūu tried to do was to stand out in the least blatant way possible, but these influences (I\'d reckon) got to his head too much that sometimes he sacrificed the story for characterization, which for a comparison, is the worst of the 3. Not everyone can be Kyosuke Kosaka, Tomoya Aki or Hachiman Hikigaya, and Kimizuka is almost completely devoid of his own instinctual humanity to act on his own behalf. A good character being dependent of, but not independently.Making things worse is how Tanmoshi was marketed to increase the hype for both light novel readers and anime-onlies. For one, some of the promotional visuals released had both the original and ""true"" versions (which I know that not a lot of people would\'ve even paid close attention in the first place). How this goes is that the original visual would be released first, then once the episodes relating to them had finished airing, the ""true"" visual would be released. It\'s not really a spoiler since it basically spoils the final product of the character arcs, and then again, it\'s a reference that only if you\'ve watched the anime and went back to the visual, then it paints the difference. Also, a double-length episode is almost set and guaranteed to fail because of content that is hamfisted to give the audience some ""perks"" of its story to give it a great first impression (see this season\'s Bokutachi no Remake), only to be faced with the slow intake of brewing disappointment. It almost felt like that the studio behind this (ENGI) wanted to give a good proposition, so they went all out in the production to give an amazing Sakuga Episode 1 for all of us to be wowed. Sadly, being a studio that\'s tied to it\'s parent compaany Kadokawa (which this series is serialized under), after that inital episode, it completely burned out slowly but surely, and you can feel that creeping up when you least expected it. Heck, they even got Hololive\'s Shirakami Fubuki and Natsuiro Matsuri to be a cameo in an episode, so I can only commend on how hard the production team must\'ve tried to drive the show\'s momentum. All of this begs the sole question: ""So what\'s the point in all of this?""If anything, the music\'s decent enough with at least a good OP and a decent ED. The OST which also tries hard to make it sound like an American or Japanese live-action themed detective show just...feels out of place, and is something that tries to push the envelope that it grates on my nerves quite a fair bit.It pains me to say that Tanmoshi could be a lot more better if it knows how to balance between its slice-of-life and true detective moments in a coherent manner, because majority of the people who watch anime aren\'t deep thinkers, and they would pretty much prefer a tried-and-true detective show like Yuukoku no Moriarty a.k.a Moriarty the Patriot, which goes deep into the detective lore, making it a compelling watch. That said, I highly recommend you go and read the light novel, even if the storytelling\'s just as bad (or good, according to your tastes), but at least like your favorite fiction book, you will never stop wanting to read it to the end.TL;DR Skip the anime, go for the light novel. doing a work that he so desired to make, and it was deemed good in its written form.

It\'s actually so obvious that they tried so hard to copy the relationship between Mai and Sakuta, it\'s insane.Story: 4The story starts off with a 50 minute long episode, which practically shows us how Siesta and Kimizuka met on a plane that has been hijacked. Somehow, Siesta has been able to get a huge freaking GUN on board which is stupid since they didn\'t even explain how she got it in. Everything after that is generic, extremely predictable and boring to watch, I don\'t even know how I managed to...watch 6 episodes.Art: 5The art was mediocre, nothing special to comment about it.Sound: 3The sound... was just nowhere to be found. Every song and intro are absolutely boring to listen to, it\'s really disappointing.Characters: 2Here we go.

She always engages into stupid monologues that make 0 fucking sense, and in some magic way it always works in her favor.

Seeing a case slowly unwrap itself, while you follow along and make your own conclusions is thrilling. Or if you’re as dumb as me, you have no clue what’s going on and just wait to get amazed by the big reveal. With timeless classics such as Sherlock Holmes, A Study in Scarlet, and The Moonstone to more modern cinematography pieces such as Will Smiths Bright or Id: ‘Invaded (pls watch this, its so good) the genre has cemented itself as an integral part in the media business. A good detective...show is made upon an intriguing yet overwhelmingly convoluting plot with sharp witted, intelligent yet charismatic characters. Unfortunately this show has none of this.The plot if you could call it that, is like something out of a kid’s fantasy. The mc is a crisis magnet. He finds himself in various troubles against his will. One day he gets kidnaped by a group of unknown people and put on a plane where he is saved by a white haired girl who’s apparently a detective, who then decides to make the guy his partner and he accepts. What…?You could already see some absurd flaws in this plot. What normal high school going teenager gets kidnaped for no reason. It’s absurd and so ungrounded from reality that it’s almost hilarious. Our mc gets saved by the detective. Now normally detectives don’t go around fighting crime like batman. They’re the brains of the operation, they approach the case with intellect, find clues, connect the dots and figure out the criminal who’s then dealt with by law enforcements. But out waifu detective goes against every trope that makes a good detective as she becomes the person to rescue him. She then offers him to join her in her journey. Any person with half a working brain cell will say “NO”. The mcs a self-aware trouble magnet, the last thing he needs is more trouble. The logical decision would be to steer clear of people with shady jobs. But guess what, he said yes, why wouldn’t he.So we see Batman and Robin go and solve crimes together. It’s unnatural and downright unrealistic to see a high school student adapt this quickly to the life of a detective let alone be going around solving major criminal cases. Then we see the untimely death of the detective, which results in their journey coming to a close. The End…or I hoped it ended.We see our mc go back to his normal life, cause that’s natural innit? One day you’re a detective fighting mafias, next day your back to being a high school student. He then meets many different girls, which already cements the fact that this show is gunna take a harem route, so all indications of a good detective show is thrown out the window. Instead we get this horrible, time-lapse of past and present. The formula doesn’t work, one episode he is talking to a couple of girls who are linked to a crime organization or something, the next episode the guys mourning Siestas death. It then shifts to the mc and Siestas journey 3 years ago as they travel the world solving crimes. The storytelling is horrible on the same level as Peach Boy Riverside, if not worse. This absurd changing of pace out of the blue doesn’t work. It’s a real emersion breaker, and makes an already nonsensical plot even more convoluted. The plot twists in this shows are horrible to the point they don’t make sense. They went with the whole Higurashi approach of showing major events before setting up the whole premise, except unlike Higurashi it just doesn’t click. It would have been better if his past with Siestas was just vaguely introduced in the first episode, and we uncovered more and more details as the episodes went on.The plot is pure nonsensical mess. A detective show is meant to give you clues as you piece them together to find the truth hidden behind a curtain. The whole objective is to get you to think, make a conclusion by yourself before the big reveal, or add some misdirection’s in the plot to add an element of surprise when the culprit is eventually revealed.  This show goes against all the tropes by either having completely absurd revelations or not revealing them at all. You spend your time wondering why something’s happening, and the show instead of slowly revealing the answer to you, drops a complete bomb shell out of nowhere. The whole mystery aspect of the show gets so absurd, to the point you just don’t care anymore. To call it a detective show is honestly an insult to an actually good detective show.The main characters being the guy (forgot his name) and Siesta, dont go against the classic anime mc troupes. Siestas a big tiddy anime waifu. She’s the main attraction of the show and is probably the only reason this show was watched to begin with. She bares a striking resemblance to Origami from Date A Live, but nearly not as amusing to watch. She’s super generic and is personally the only likeable character of the show. Not because she’s over filled with a super charming and charismatic personality that makes you curious to see her journey through, more cause…well you already know. She’s a huge tension breaker. Whenever a serious situation arises she already knows what’s going to happen. How you ask? Who knows, it’s never explained. She’s purely set up for fan service. If the camera isn’t trying to show her cleavage or go up her skirt every 20 secs, she will start flirting with the mc to remind you that there’s obvious romantic chemistry between them, which is completely disemboweled due to the super awkward and cringy character interactions. Personal bias, I have a ting for white haired waifus (Teletha Testarossa supremacy), so to me she’s 10/10 absolute perfection.The mc, is as tasteless as plain rice, no that’s honestly an insult to rice. He’s flavorless, bland and all around super boring. From the initial depictions you can’t tell if this guy has yet to reach puberty or has a family of 4 with a mortgage. I can only describe him as the weird half-brother of Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai. They’re both emotionless to the point they get extremely unlikeable. There’s no hint of charisma or quirkiness in the guy. His overtly mature personality is super boring. He has banter with all the side girls, but that’s the extent you’ll see him somewhat act like a human, and not a complete vegetable.The side characters are forgettable. They are there for the sake of being there, and the shows fully aware of it to the point that there left completely redundant, both plot and animation wise. They’re super unmemorable, and nothing about any of them sticks out.The detective isn’t the only thing that died….the animation died with her. The show nosedives when it comes to quality. The animation goes from being acceptable and bright in episode one to all characters besides the two mc, looking like the weird doll villain out of Resident Evil 8. Where did the budget go studio? Clearly not towards the plot cause that’s still horrendous. If there isn’t enough resources to even properly animate the side characters who have recurring appearances in the show, you can only imagine how horrible the other parts of the show might look. If you’re thinking that the animation can act as a saving grace from the horrendous plot, Im sorry to say but you’ll be extremely disappointed.The best I could describe this show would be a parody of detective shows. Like a shitty movie created by middle schooler’s for their drama class. It’s not even a “so bad its good kind” of show, it’s honestly just bad. The plot is a mess, I feel like I’ve repeated that sentence about 50 times and still haven’t properly expressed how awful the plot is. They go against every core elements of a good detective show. An intriguing case, a witty, charismatic yet determined and serious when the situation arises kind of detective, a slow paced plot where they leisurely reveal certain clues so you could form a theory of your own as your follow along the story, an element of surprise while revealing the culprit or critical plot points, and a completely wrapped up, fully explored ending. None of these criteria’s are ticked. Instead they went with the classic route of adding a harem into everything. The whole detective aspect in the show is nonexistent, and seems more like Clickbait than anything. Save yourself 4 hours of your life and do anything else rather than watching this show. If you want to watch a good mystery show, I highly recommend Monster, Mushishi, Great Pretender, Id Invaded or any of the Kara no Kyoukai movies. They’re all better, intriguing and overwhelming shows and more worth watching than this dumpster fire. show is made upon an intriguing yet overwhelmingly convoluting plot with sharp witted, intelligent yet charismatic characters. Unfortunately this show has none of this.The plot if you could call it that, is like something out of a kid’s fantasy. The mc is a crisis magnet. He finds himself in various troubles against his will. One day he gets kidnaped by a group of unknown people and put on a plane where he is saved by a white haired girl who’s apparently a detective, who then decides to make the guy his partner and he accepts. What…?You could already see some absurd flaws in this plot. What normal high school going teenager gets kidnaped for no reason. It’s absurd and so ungrounded from reality that it’s almost hilarious. Our mc gets saved by the detective. Now normally detectives don’t go around fighting crime like batman. They’re the brains of the operation, they approach the case with intellect, find clues, connect the dots and figure out the criminal who’s then dealt with by law enforcements. But out waifu detective goes against every trope that makes a good detective as she becomes the person to rescue him. She then offers him to join her in her journey. Any person with half a working brain cell will say “NO”. The mcs a self-aware trouble magnet, the last thing he needs is more trouble. The logical decision would be to steer clear of people with shady jobs. But guess what, he said yes, why wouldn’t he.So we see Batman and Robin go and solve crimes together. It’s unnatural and downright unrealistic to see a high school student adapt this quickly to the life of a detective let alone be going around solving major criminal cases. Then we see the untimely death of the detective, which results in their journey coming to a close. The End…or I hoped it ended.We see our mc go back to his normal life, cause that’s natural innit? One day you’re a detective fighting mafias, next day your back to being a high school student. He then meets many different girls, which already cements the fact that this show is gunna take a harem route, so all indications of a good detective show is thrown out the window. Instead we get this horrible, time-lapse of past and present. The formula doesn’t work, one episode he is talking to a couple of girls who are linked to a crime organization or something, the next episode the guys mourning Siestas death. It then shifts to the mc and Siestas journey 3 years ago as they travel the world solving crimes. The storytelling is horrible on the same level as Peach Boy Riverside, if not worse. This absurd changing of pace out of the blue doesn’t work. It’s a real emersion breaker, and makes an already nonsensical plot even more convoluted. The plot twists in this shows are horrible to the point they don’t make sense. They went with the whole Higurashi approach of showing major events before setting up the whole premise, except unlike Higurashi it just doesn’t click. It would have been better if his past with Siestas was just vaguely introduced in the first episode, and we uncovered more and more details as the episodes went on.The plot is pure nonsensical mess. A detective show is meant to give you clues as you piece them together to find the truth hidden behind a curtain. The whole objective is to get you to think, make a conclusion by yourself before the big reveal, or add some misdirection’s in the plot to add an element of surprise when the culprit is eventually revealed.  This show goes against all the tropes by either having completely absurd revelations or not revealing them at all. You spend your time wondering why something’s happening, and the show instead of slowly revealing the answer to you, drops a complete bomb shell out of nowhere. The whole mystery aspect of the show gets so absurd, to the point you just don’t care anymore. To call it a detective show is honestly an insult to an actually good detective show.The main characters being the guy (forgot his name) and Siesta, dont go against the classic anime mc troupes. Siestas a big tiddy anime waifu. She’s the main attraction of the show and is probably the only reason this show was watched to begin with. She bares a striking resemblance to Origami from Date A Live, but nearly not as amusing to watch. She’s super generic and is personally the only likeable character of the show. Not because she’s over filled with a super charming and charismatic personality that makes you curious to see her journey through, more cause…well you already know. She’s a huge tension breaker. Whenever a serious situation arises she already knows what’s going to happen. How you ask? Who knows, it’s never explained. She’s purely set up for fan service. If the camera isn’t trying to show her cleavage or go up her skirt every 20 secs, she will start flirting with the mc to remind you that there’s obvious romantic chemistry between them, which is completely disemboweled due to the super awkward and cringy character interactions. Personal bias, I have a ting for white haired waifus (Teletha Testarossa supremacy), so to me she’s 10/10 absolute perfection.The mc, is as tasteless as plain rice, no that’s honestly an insult to rice. He’s flavorless, bland and all around super boring. From the initial depictions you can’t tell if this guy has yet to reach puberty or has a family of 4 with a mortgage. I can only describe him as the weird half-brother of Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai. They’re both emotionless to the point they get extremely unlikeable. There’s no hint of charisma or quirkiness in the guy. His overtly mature personality is super boring. He has banter with all the side girls, but that’s the extent you’ll see him somewhat act like a human, and not a complete vegetable.The side characters are forgettable. They are there for the sake of being there, and the shows fully aware of it to the point that there left completely redundant, both plot and animation wise. They’re super unmemorable, and nothing about any of them sticks out.The detective isn’t the only thing that died….the animation died with her. The show nosedives when it comes to quality. The animation goes from being acceptable and bright in episode one to all characters besides the two mc, looking like the weird doll villain out of Resident Evil 8. Where did the budget go studio? Clearly not towards the plot cause that’s still horrendous. If there isn’t enough resources to even properly animate the side characters who have recurring appearances in the show, you can only imagine how horrible the other parts of the show might look. If you’re thinking that the animation can act as a saving grace from the horrendous plot, Im sorry to say but you’ll be extremely disappointed.The best I could describe this show would be a parody of detective shows.

It certainly doesn’t take a legendary detective to realise what crime was committed here.Yet again, we have an adaptation of a light novel that god knows why got the green light. While 86 was bad (fight me I dare you), it was at least not as bad and also popular enough to justify an adaptation. But this? No significant fanbase to work with, so the studio really chose this series...out of all the possibilities to gamble a big hit on. I guess the anime industry has dried up the isekai well already so it’s on to chums like this now.After watching 4 episodes where I literally fell asleep halfway through, I strongly considered dropping this series right then and there. But I forced myself through it so you folks looking to binge seasonals once they’re done know what to do: avoid this show at all costs.Is there anything enjoyable about this series? Absolutely not! You’ll find nothing but lackluster plot, lackluster characters, and most importantly, god awful directing and cutting! I’ve seen amateur film projects in high school produced with better sequencing of cuts than this shit. Just check out EP 3 for example: it feels like 4-5 distinct 5 min long episodes randomly spliced together. You have music trailing off and some “inspirational” or finale-like lines from a character as the camera pans up to the sunset in the sky, only to be jolted awake with random chit-chat as Kimizuka and Siesta 2.0 walk down the street discussing their assignment.Don’t even get me started on the characters. I haven’t come across characters this one-dimensional and boring since your average shounen power fest. MC and his harem are beyond lame. Even in the scope of the hundreds of mass-produced romcoms the anime industry has shoved out, none come close to matching the lack of distinction and “character” as Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru’s cast.But I think this anime’s truly biggest flaw is the bloated shitty dialogue. There’s so much dialogue and conversation thrown around between characters, but less than 10% of the show’s total is actually relevant to character or plot development. Take EP 5 where Siesta and MC are talking during the flashback. Literally 90% of their conversation is just random shit that you could not listen to and still be up to date with the plot. This “conversation” also doesn’t progress characters either. Not using chances like this for meaningful character development is a heinous crime indeed. In the off chance dialogue is relevant to the series, it’s often so cliche or normal that you can predict the lines that’re gonna be said, almost as if a 4th grader wrote them. In the “climax” of EP 4, I literally predicted every single line in the exchange between the MC and the idol chick. Am I an unparalleled genius or is the show just that bad at writing dialogue? Take your pick.No engaging or interesting plot, no deep thematic messages to unravel, no hype action scenes, no touching character moments/dynamics/development, and no skills when it comes to directing episodes. You can ask me a thousand times what’s good about this anime and my answer will remain the same: literally nothing. There is nothing unique about this anime that warrants watching it, so don’t waste your time and move on to literally anything else. Even hentai is worth more than this shit since you can jerk it off and get some post-nut clarity. out of all the possibilities to gamble a big hit on.

She is adorable when she even lets out only a sneeze and the male MC VA being a close resemblence of the practical and monologue filled hachiman .Just watch the First special episode if it does not leave you begging for more by the end of it, drop it because honestly what follows is mostly more of the first with just the detective being dead . unbelievable degree the likes of which we don't see even in romance anime , then we see a easy movie budget level of animation and fight scene where we are introduced to some sci-fi robo warfare shit start expecting yeah this has to be one delusional Hormone driven shounen anime and it almost feel like one due to the very very amazing animation (prolly the best this season so far).

How does it happened? Why does it happened?Basically sums up my whole experience with this anime.From start to finish, I never had a good grasp of what\'s happening. It\'s a wild mess of an anime.The story is pretty weird. The first episode is enough to show anyone that. I thought this show would be a grounded mystery show investigating the dead of the detective... but boy I was wrong. It\'s pretty much just a fantasy anime in modern setting. The detective stuff is basically non-existent due to how the mary sue main character ""solves everything before it happen"".There\'s no investigation, deduction, and...it just heads to confrontation just to show the action. If you\'re expecting some Sherlock Holmes sh*ts here, then you\'ll be disappointed as much as I do.There\'s also the fact that the pacing is pretty bad. 80% of this show is basically flashback which isn\'t bad by any means if those were meaningful flashbacks... which they weren\'t. I won\'t say anything past that since it\'ll be a spoiler if I do.The characters are mediocre. Just like I mentioned, the main character, Siesta, is a mary sue. She\'s called the great detective but there isn\'t anything in this series that shows the audience why she\'s great. The only reasons for her ""deductions"" is that she solves everything even before it happened. Like bruh, that\'s one of the laziest explanations I\'ve heard. Don\'t get me started on the cardboard main character, kimizuka, as well as the underdeveloped side characters that this show have.The animation is decent at best. It\'s clunky, sometimes even off-model, and just limited animation at times. It definitely had some good animation sprinkled throughout the series, but majority of the animation is below average.The music is good. It\'s nothing too major that affects the scenes to make them memorable, but the ost does it\'s jobs well to compliment the scenes. The opening and ending are pretty nice as well.Overall, just a disappointment mess of an anime. I think that the novel is better than this mess, but since I never read it, I can\'t tell you anything. it just heads to confrontation just to show the action.

There is truly nothing in this world better than The Detective is Already Dead. This series deserves a movie, a second season.. no not even a second season 4 extra seasons. In fact we need this series to last longer than humanity itself, so when aliens look back into our world's history they can also watch The Detective is Already Dead. I do not know how else to describe this show other than an absolute beauty, from the characters having absolutely zero value to the idol scenes. This...anime truly has it all, I always joked that having a beach episode was the dumbest thing but how about a cruise that lasts 3-4 episodes. I thought characters looking into their past was a generic attempt at filler but try having the whole anime just be the past. Time skips are no longer the biggest problem in life anymore when there are middle school children that the mc is literally falling for and proposing to. I wanted to take a second to voice my feelings on this show so badly because personally I feel actually so saddened that there is no second season in this show. It is truly life changing and has inspired me to even make an account on MAL and even go as far as to making a whole review. But somehow a fictional series has done so. Please go watch Tantei Wa Mou, shinderiu. It is truly a masterpiece, this is no anime.

I tried not to spoil anything important that isn\'t in the first episode.The art is pretty mediocre. In the first episode, the fight scene was great and it was overall good. All the episodes since have been lazy, the characters look off-model half of the time and it ruins the ""waifu-esque"" designs. I feel like the first episode was just bait and animation to use for trailers. In the later episodes, there is a chase scene between a mecha and a giant monster, great action right ? No, this was so boring, one...dimensional, there was no effort put into it.The sound is forgettable, the op is generic and I can\'t even remember one background soundtrack.Now one of the real problems is the characters. Siesta is the only one I can even call a character, she has a personality, motivations (weak but still better than the others) and even if she isn\'t the greatest, at least there is SOMETHING. The others are the blandest cliché, the MC just follows the plot and Siesta, I can\'t tell a single thing about him except ""he looks like a blasé salaryman"", Nagisa is a tsundere with oppai and...she follows him because of plot.

I consider myself to be someone who\'s willing to look past a lot of jank to find something, some semblance of passion or heart even in flawed projects. But this... this show has tried my patience a lot.TanMoshi is a goddamned slog. It is so utterly boring with unlikable characters stringing you along for the whole ride. There is nothing worth watching in this. Kimi is such a black...hole of personality that he sucks out everything there is in this show with his drabness. The other side characters don\'t do much either. Siesta is fun in the first episode but bizzarely just lacking in the flashbacks with her, and everyone else is just bland. I get that this is a LN adaptation and is very heavy on the narration. Fine, lots of shows do that. But TanMoshi never has anything interesting in its narration or inner monologues. It\'s all mostly very obvious thoughts or plans of action on the current situation. There is nothing clever or witty to the writing. It\'s just so boring.And don\'t even get me started on the story. I was thinking, maybe, just maybe they\'d pull off something clever with the show near the end. Like you know, maybe Kimi isn\'t such a useless dumbass and is actually secretly planning some 5D chess move or just anything. But no, everyone is just an idiot and the most obvious plot ""twist"" that happens right in front of his face with Hel, Nagisa, and Siesta\'s circumstances go completely, and I mean, completely unnoticed by him all throughout the adventure and I just can\'t stand it.The funny (or sad) thing with this show is that every week I watch it, I completely forget what even happened in the episode come the following day. Apart from the very first episode. I was fully expecting to maybe riff on the ridiculous detective action from this show, but man, week after week, this show is just giving me nothing. It\'s a vacuum of creativity and story telling. A cautionary tale that even the most chuuni-sounding premise can fall completely flat on its face and deliver an uninspiring experience to the viewer. Beware all ye who enter indeed.2/10 hole of personality that he sucks out everything there is in this show with his drabness. The other side characters don\'t do much either. Siesta is fun in the first episode but bizzarely just lacking in the flashbacks with her, and everyone else is just bland. I get that this is a LN adaptation and is very heavy on the narration. Fine, lots of shows do that. But TanMoshi never has anything interesting in its narration or inner monologues. It\'s all mostly very obvious thoughts or plans of action on the current situation. There is nothing clever or witty to the writing. It\'s just so boring.And don\'t even get me started on the story.

Horrible dialogue, horrible characters (even Siesta), and some of the worst pacing I've seen in an anime. The only saving grace could possibly be the art not looking horrible, and music that is passable at best.If you're thinking of starting this anime because the premise sounds cool, don't bother. The plot is so all over the place, the main gimmick of the show (the detective already being dead) just doesn't work well. Lots of the show is...way too dragged on to the point of nauseum. Aspects that don't even matter all too much either.All in all, Would not recommend. Don't fall for the trap a lot of us fell into. Escape while you still can. way too dragged on to the point of nauseum. Aspects that don't even matter all too much either.All in all, Would not recommend. Don't fall for the trap a lot of us fell into. Escape while you still can."", ""This review might contain some spoilers!So Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru, one of the biggest disppointments of this year, with its first episode being very well animated and overall pretty exciting, it went down really fast. Later on it was really hard to even finish an episode. So what went wrong?Story:After the first episode I found it sort of interesting, there is an evil organization - SPES and a legendary detective - Siesta who wants to take it down. The problem is that in the other episodes you almost never see the threat that SPES poses and overall not much explanation is present.There are also some...plot holes, for example Siesta shot a monster with a bullet that should make it not attack her. Because of that it was ignoring her for a minute, but then out of nowhere it turned around to strike her for a pointless scene.The timeline also gets kind of confusing with dreadful flashbacks, but it is not for the purpose of mystery or at least it didn't feel like it. It just felt like the storytelling was boring and very poorly executed. I would for sure not label this as a mystery anime. Honestly, I can't even figure out what the genre should be.2/10Art:Animation in the first episode was awesome, it looked very smooth and the choreography of the action was great, but again it went downhill. It became kind of dull. The characters looked pretty good, but the background felt always the same and so after a few seconds I got bored by it. There was never an exciting location and the animation mostly looked like a powerpoint presentation.4/10Sound:The OP and ED are pretty good but nothing memorable. Also, the OSTs were fine nothing amazing, but certainly not bad. What I thought was kind of amateurish was the mixing. I felt like sometimes the background music was either too quiet or not in the right frequencies to hit.5/10Characters:Legendary detective Siesta who knows everything and can solve anything. She was the only character that stood out but that doesn't mean that she is in any way a perfect character. She is pretty good, however she can't carry the other boring characters. They were simply bland and in the scenes without Siesta there was much to be desired.3/10Enjoyment:Needless to say I did not find this anime very enjoyable. Every episode I had a little bit of hope, but was always let down. The comedy was so-so. There was some fine fan service and a funny drunk Siesta moment, though that is not something I am looking for in an anime centered around detectives.2/10Overall:This is a blunder. I am not sure if the source material is any better, since I have not read it, so maybe try to read the LN, because this is not something I can recommend.3/10 plot holes, for example Siesta shot a monster with a bullet that should make it not attack her.

They even had the audacity to mention Baker Street smh""This is absurd."" - MC\'s quote describes the Plot so well. There is no logic or reasoning much less any deducing or solving mysteries from anime with ""detective"" in its title. Story, pacing, timeline... everything is all over...the place but the worst thing is this anime takes its self seriously which makes it 100x worse.Bad story aside the conversations are dry as a desert with forced monologues and fake emotions. There is no chemistry or charm to these 1-dimensional characters as much as this anime wants you to believe.Overall only thing that\'s going for it is the Art style and Animations which immediately loses its value when characters talk over them like shut your damn mouth for 20 minutes, please. the place but the worst thing is this anime takes its self seriously which makes it 100x worse.Bad story aside the conversations are dry as a desert with forced monologues and fake emotions.

I never read the source material for Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru... but I can't imagine how this was all supposed to work.The anime withholds 90% of the story from you and assures you that stuff was super cool. And then the plot twist only makes sense if the...MC is a moron, but he is shown to be intelligent even if not as smart as the improbably Sherlockian titular character.This could have been a fun show if they had presented things in a better way than completely at random.

It\'s very hard to imagine people enjoying the show because it has a good narrative or characters that seem like real people. Any type of good comment on this show is either done by a brainlet or a person that has never watched anything good in their life.Now that my rant is over, let\'s actually get into the review side of things. Yes, the experience of \'Tante wa mou, shindeiru\' was absolutely dreadful. It\'s not even over...yet, for Christ\'s sake! It was hard for me to find enjoyment in the couple of episodes that have released. But still, I shall power through it in hope that it will get better, as many of the light novel fans claim (of course, it\'s very hard for a show to redeem itself when it\'s this bad, but I can\'t say it won\'t do it until it\'s actually finished airing). There\'s a ton of spoilers since I couldn\'t explain why I hated it without showing some examples.The story is all over the place. From the synopsis, it does seem like an interesting mystery anime. Since I haven\'t seen too many of those, I thought about giving it a try, plus the fact that it was seasonal. The first episode had a total runtime of 50 minutes, which did feel kind of odd at first but that wasn\'t enough to make me want to drop it instantly. So the protagonist gets into a lot of trouble because of his coincidental circumstances around very illegal stuff like drug and human trafficking, robberies, murders and so on. On a very eventful day, he gets kidnapped and the kidnappers ask him to deliver a briefcase via plane. While on the plane, all of the sudden one of the flight attendants asks for a detective, oddly enough. As described by the MC, a very beautiful girl next to him claims that she is, indeed, a detective. For some odd reason, she wants him to be her assistant. No reason in particular. They find out about some plane hijacker that was in the same situation as our protagonist (he was basically forced to hijack the plane and make it crash with the girl detective). So he\'s from an organization named SPES that specializes with super powers (I know, it gets even weirder as the show progresses) which said detective was clashing against at the time. The hijacker is defeated, everyone is happy and, oh man, thank God the plane didn\'t crash, because if it did, both main characters would\'ve been dead and this series would have never taken place. All is well after the plane landing, until our protagonist is yet again surprised by the detective. She basically asks him to be her assistant again in order to fight against the evil deeds done by SPES. I\'m not going to talk about the rest of the first episode, but at the end, after they both solved their second case, it is announced that 3 years later, the detective dies. At this point, I was still intrigued by what the hell all of this was about. The fact that it was all over the place was interesting at first because of it\'s uniqueness, but in the second episode everything went downhill.I\'d have to guess their budget couldn\'t pay for another Siesta special folding gun epic shooting scene, but at least they could have not given up on voice acting. The story itself from the light novel is the same as the anime I\'m guessing, so the story and character part is entirely the authors fault. So, as for dialogue between characters, I only have him to blame. I swear, every single episode felt like different Oblivion NPC\'s speaking to each other and repeating the same shit all over again. The show\'s simplicity isn\'t affecting the quality, it\'s the writing itself. So fuck you, dear author, for writing this dumb fucking story. But besides that, for a couple of episodes, the show sticks to the narrative of \'oh yeah, a couple of time has passed and this retard of a protagonist finally becomes the detective himself (NOT)\' which is fine, don\'t get me wrong. It was poorly executed, but not the worst part of the show. Most scenes made no sense (why visit the plane hijacker again in order to confirm the identity of Siesta? and how in the bloody hell did you know where he was locked up??) and the dialogue truly felt like 2 robots clashing over who could beat Alpha Zero and Stockfish in Chess. The essence of human touch is invisible in this show. And, oh Lord how comedic this is, but the shots of the characters when they speak remind me of \'Kingdom Come: Delivery\' cutscenes.After the MC and newborn Siesta solve yet another case, we get a flashback of the MC and actual Siesta around 2-3 years ago in London (for God knows what reason). The flashbacks are made so that they make sense. This one is just here for the sake of it. We are reminded of their old adventures just because they forgot to maintain a chronological order of the events. Why would you waste about 3 episodes of bad to decent content just to go back in time again (with no reason) and show us the events that you were supposed to show earlier? (they could have just removed the 3 episodes and put the rest of their case solving BEFORE those 3 episodes)Of course, the rebuttal of those events doesn\'t bring ANY type of case solving back to the series. Now we\'ve got Mr. \'I wish to destroy the world\' that follows the same book that Roswaal from Re:zero used to read all the time and Mecha Detective with Mecha Assistant. It\'s such a breath of fresh air to know that some people compared this show to Evangelion because of episode 6, because now I know that the fans of this show need to redo elementary school. Besides the events of Re:zero versus Evangelion, the show doesn\'t seem to stop this flashback scene that already lasted 2 episodes since a new girl showed up, and this time she\'s older than the detective herself! Do I hear ""love interest?"" Don\'t mind if I do! Even if displayed for about 10 minutes, the new girl seems troublesome, and by God, she actually has dialogue. I can finally listen to a person speak! Well, she only has like 5 lines that differ between each other, but she still sounds more human than the 2 Mecha Detectives.The characters are a train wreck. As stated before (repeated many times as well), the dialogue between them is more robotic than our future as a species. Not once have I not found myself pausing at every line to analyze the type of 12 year old dialogue the characters have. They\'re plain. Way. Too. Plain. Nothing has bored me more than the MC speaking. I was more entertained in the show when nobody was saying anything. When anybody was speaking, it was either an anime trope or just information dump for the viewer to completely process in under the 2 seconds it took for a line to be read. But, to be fair, the MC\'s long ""Urusei, Baaaaaaka"" was the cherry on top for the shitshow that unfolded on my screen. The other girls are fine. Still robotic, monotone and boring, but at least the people looking for waifus have a lot of... content to watch.The story was : Pathetic! a 1.The art was : Decent and slowly getting worse! a 3.The sound was : Incomprehensible! No songs to be remembered and the OST will go down as the most forgettable anime OST ever! a 3.The characters were : Absolute agony! a 1.My enjoyment : If I could give this a negative score, I 100% would; a 1.And the score overall amounts to : a measly and very sad and depressing 2 (standing for ""absolutely dreadful!"")All in all, Tante wa mou, shindeiru is a flawless masterpiece, the anime of the decade, even century! I have not seen any show that can beat this one in animation, writing, characters, sound or voice acting. Get the fuck out MALs top 10 anime! It is time for you to be dethroned by the mighty ""The detective is already dead."" And, by God, don\'t watch this show.As an end note, I despise the studio for having a Hololive cameo for that dumb fuck of an Idol character. Go fuck yourself Nigojuu (author of light novel) and ENGI for making one of the worst shows of this decade. How do people even enjoy this? yet, for Christ\'s sake!

Go fuck yourself Nigojuu (author of light novel) and ENGI for making one of the worst shows of this decade. How do people even enjoy this?', 'Before starting the review, I have to admit, I am neither an avid reviewer nor someone with high anime standards. I watch anything and enjoy basically anything, as long as they\'re enjoyable, even if the anime itself might be stupid. Heck, I can watch Steins;Gate one day and watch Kanojo mo Kanojo afterwards and laugh it off.Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru however, is just plain hard to swallow.I get that people enjoy or dislike anime for various reasons to each their own, such as being against harem, plot holes, deus ex machimas, OP MCs and whatnot......but I think everyone can agree that bad pacing ruins...any anime. So is the case of Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru. The pacing is all over the place, it seems like they did a deck shuffle for all the episodes before actually deciding to air it.To go with the standard format, please read as below. Minor spoilers up to the current episode may be present, but should probably not be a major issue, since the idea of this is to discourage you from actually spending your time on the anime anyways.Story: 2/10I have to say, the double-duration episode 1 did catch my eye. Mixing mundane daily life + some romcom elements into a mystery might be weird, but for someone who rates anime simply by personal enjoyment, it is still pretty enjoyable to watch the interaction between Siesta and Kimi in the cultural festival, even though the festival itself made no sense, and the whatever bad guy of the episode that I can\'t even remember anymore also made no sense. However, theres nonsensical anime such as Kanojo mo Kanojo which also made absolutely no sense, but is still an enjoyable watch if you turn your brains off.However, being a detective mystery, you should\'ve be expecting some actual suspense and mystery with comprehensible writing (despite the quirky elements thrown into it), but no, this anime decides to shower you with a random-af timeline that seriously felt like every episode was its own little story... except its a goddamn detective story, you are supposed to build suspense and connections between the episodes. (You have the monogatari series which made use of this concept pretty well, in comparison.)In other words, if you treat this as a SoL romcom between Siesta and Kimi it might not be that bad, but even the damn title is marketed as a detective mystery. There\'s literally ""Detective"" and ""dead"" in the title, of course I\'ll be expecting some good old suspense and thriller, even though I wasn\'t expecting some ID:Invaded quality, it still severely fell through my expectations. What in the world is this jumbled mess?Art: 7/10I have to admit, the primary reason I\'ve picked this anime up is because of Siesta\'s design, and I don\'t even like Date a Live despite the striking resemblance (pronounced as plagiarism) compared to Tobiichi Origami. The character art design was decent, but it is to be expected from an anime with Siesta as the poster girl. If the poster girl wasn\'t attractive, the anime will obviously fall flat before even airing, and I am sure the studio, despite being idiots with the scriptwriting, at least understood this.The action scene does leave me a bitter taste, especially after watching episode 6 (the pseudo gundam vs Godzilla thing)... It almost felt like watching a ppt slideshow. I mean the animation wasn\'t that bad, but there is little to no choreography involved.Sound: 5/10Personally, I am pretty easy on my music requirements. (You have masterpieces like Vivy / ID:Invaded recently with spectacular music, by the way, so I wasn\'t expecting much). Nothing memorable, I generally skip the OP and ED, and there\'s no memorable insert songs, but that is not to say the music is bad. It just didn\'t catch my attention.I am sure someone else might\'ve liked the music, but I wasn\'t one of em.Character: 4/10The character design in terms of art is great, as mentioned above.The character design in terms of scriptwriting though is plain weird. While Siesta and Kimi do have decent chemistry and Kimi feels refreshing being an MC who doesn\'t chase panties and can show (unnatural) intelligence in various moments, these are all thrown out of the window when you realise the MC isn\'t even 18 years old.Why do you build the characters to behave like college students, dress like college students, talk like college students and then proceed to tell people they\'re not even 18? Why? So you can fantasise? Or was it just to make the episode 1 cultural festival make sense? Because it doesn\'t.If you somehow think that isn\'t a big deal, imagine Steins;Gate, Death Note, Psycho Pass etc telling you the MC is 15 years old. Does that make sense to you?If you want logic in the show, by all means, commit to it, otherwise, go for a fully wacky approach like Grand Blue or something. Don\'t half-ass it, it almost looks like you\'re creating anime on a part-time basis.Enjoyment: 2/10I really want to drop it, but I am just here on the ride curious to see how bad can it still turn out, because truth be told, as the weeks go by and each episode airs, every episode somehow manages to do worse than the previous episode, mainly in terms of pacing and writing coherence. I am episode 6 in and I seriously have no idea what is going on.Once again, I am sure different people enjoy different anime, be it that you might like deep anime, wacky romcoms, ecchi harems, but seriously, Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru is none of them. It fits none of any known genre because it is just an incoherent mess. If there\'s a genre called ""jumbled mess"" and there\'s people who enjoy that, by all means, go for it, otherwise you\'ll probably be like me: Leave the anime playing in the background and do something else. Am I even considered someone who watches this anime at this point?Overall: 2/10While this season isn\'t wonderful by all means, I\'ll recommend you to try something else instead.If you want some CGDCT SoL, go for Maid Dragon.If you want some worldbuilding isekai, go for Slime or Realist Hero.If you want some deep thriller stuff, try Vanitas.If you want some drama, try Bokutachi no Remake.If you just kinda want to turn your brains off, even Tsuki Michibiku fits the bill.See the problem? Tantei wa mou Shindeiru doesn\'t fit anywhere, because you can\'t find any genre to slot a jumbled pile of nonsense into.(English ain\'t my primary language, so I apologize for any grammatical errors.) any anime. So is the case of Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru. The pacing is all over the place, it seems like they did a deck shuffle for all the episodes before actually deciding to air it.To go with the standard format, please read as below.

However, theres nonsensical anime such as Kanojo mo Kanojo which also made absolutely no sense, but is still an enjoyable watch if you turn your brains off.However, being a detective mystery, you should\'ve be expecting some actual suspense and mystery with comprehensible writing (despite the quirky elements thrown into it), but no, this anime decides to shower you with a random-af timeline that seriously felt like every episode was its own little story... except its a goddamn detective story, you are supposed to build suspense and connections between the episodes. (You have the monogatari series which made use of this concept pretty well, in comparison.)In other words, if you treat this as a SoL romcom between Siesta and Kimi it might not be that bad, but even the damn title is marketed as a detective mystery. There\'s literally ""Detective"" and ""dead"" in the title, of course I\'ll be expecting some good old suspense and thriller, even though I wasn\'t expecting some ID:Invaded quality, it still severely fell through my expectations. What in the world is this jumbled mess?Art: 7/10I have to admit, the primary reason I\'ve picked this anime up is because of Siesta\'s design, and I don\'t even like Date a Live despite the striking resemblance (pronounced as plagiarism) compared to Tobiichi Origami. The character art design was decent, but it is to be expected from an anime with Siesta as the poster girl. If the poster girl wasn\'t attractive, the anime will obviously fall flat before even airing, and I am sure the studio, despite being idiots with the scriptwriting, at least understood this.The action scene does leave me a bitter taste, especially after watching episode 6 (the pseudo gundam vs Godzilla thing)... It almost felt like watching a ppt slideshow. I mean the animation wasn\'t that bad, but there is little to no choreography involved.Sound: 5/10Personally, I am pretty easy on my music requirements. (You have masterpieces like Vivy / ID:Invaded recently with spectacular music, by the way, so I wasn\'t expecting much). Nothing memorable, I generally skip the OP and ED, and there\'s no memorable insert songs, but that is not to say the music is bad. It just didn\'t catch my attention.I am sure someone else might\'ve liked the music, but I wasn\'t one of em.Character: 4/10The character design in terms of art is great, as mentioned above.The character design in terms of scriptwriting though is plain weird. While Siesta and Kimi do have decent chemistry and Kimi feels refreshing being an MC who doesn\'t chase panties and can show (unnatural) intelligence in various moments, these are all thrown out of the window when you realise the MC isn\'t even 18 years old.Why do you build the characters to behave like college students, dress like college students, talk like college students and then proceed to tell people they\'re not even 18? Why? So you can fantasise? Or was it just to make the episode 1 cultural festival make sense? Because it doesn\'t.If you somehow think that isn\'t a big deal, imagine Steins;Gate, Death Note, Psycho Pass etc telling you the MC is 15 years old. Does that make sense to you?If you want logic in the show, by all means, commit to it, otherwise, go for a fully wacky approach like Grand Blue or something. Don\'t half-ass it, it almost looks like you\'re creating anime on a part-time basis.Enjoyment: 2/10I really want to drop it, but I am just here on the ride curious to see how bad can it still turn out, because truth be told, as the weeks go by and each episode airs, every episode somehow manages to do worse than the previous episode, mainly in terms of pacing and writing coherence. I am episode 6 in and I seriously have no idea what is going on.Once again, I am sure different people enjoy different anime, be it that you might like deep anime, wacky romcoms, ecchi harems, but seriously, Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru is none of them. It fits none of any known genre because it is just an incoherent mess. If there\'s a genre called ""jumbled mess"" and there\'s people who enjoy that, by all means, go for it, otherwise you\'ll probably be like me: Leave the anime playing in the background and do something else. Am I even considered someone who watches this anime at this point?Overall: 2/10While this season isn\'t wonderful by all means, I\'ll recommend you to try something else instead.If you want some CGDCT SoL, go for Maid Dragon.If you want some worldbuilding isekai, go for Slime or Realist Hero.If you want some deep thriller stuff, try Vanitas.If you want some drama, try Bokutachi no Remake.If you just kinda want to turn your brains off, even Tsuki Michibiku fits the bill.See the problem? Tantei wa mou Shindeiru doesn\'t fit anywhere, because you can\'t find any genre to slot a jumbled pile of nonsense into.(English ain\'t my primary language, so I apologize for any grammatical errors.)', 'SPOILER ALERT:This started great in episode one, as this anime continued, it eventually took a nosedive in quality. The Detective is Already Dead is a perfect example of such a fate. This adaptation was one of the most anticipated series for the summer 2021 season, and yet it left us all with confusion and disappointment after a successful beginning. Here, I\'ll explain what made this show a disappointment and how it managed to survive the twelve episodes.Plot: As shown in the title, ""The Detective is Already Dead,"" it describes the adventures of a legendary detective who carried this anime and her tsundere sidekick. However, it...mixes in the present timeline and what happened in the past, which is one of the reasons why it dropped in quality. The first episode had a strong beginning with an incredible supernatural battle to add to the detective aspect. Eventually, after the first episode, the anime just became extremely dialogue-heavy. Although it would be for the build-up to another confrontation with the antagonists, it would eventually not live up to the expectations from the first episode. It bothered me that such a strong first episode gave me expectations for a great anime adaptation. But in the end, I\'m disappointed that it wasn\'t able to come close to that good story quality.Story: The story takes place with a man who attracts crisis around him, which led to him becoming a sidekick for a detective who\'s trying to stop an evil organization from doing their crimes. Combined with the aspect of the said organization having powers, it would\'ve been a great story to follow. That said, after the first episode, the amount of action between the sidekick and the organization decreased. I didn\'t mind those episodes, but I didn\'t like how slow the pacing was, I could\'ve been somewhat more exciting if it wasn\'t too dialogue-heavy. Towards the second half of the series, it features more action scenes, but it didn\'t make sense for being a detective anime ironically, and it dragged out until it ended.Characters: Out of everything this anime adaptation had to offer, the characters were the ones that carried the show, specifically the detective mentioned in the title. The detective, Siesta saved the show during its hard times. Although I found her character design incredibly gorgeous, I\'ve been told it looks too similar to another anime character named Origami. While there are some differences, I didn\'t like that they got away with near plagiarism for her. However, her chemistry with her sidekick Kimizuka was fun to watch. Seeing how he has feelings for her but acts tsundere around her was nice to see, and their relationship as partners was the driving force that made me continue watching this anime. While the other characters I liked, their character designs questioned their personalities, for example, a blonde character called Siesta ""Mom,"" which I didn\'t like as Siesta looks too young to have a child. Also, a time skip occurred and Kimizuka didn\'t age at all, which doesn\'t happen all that often, but they made him look the same as he did four years ago. Although the designs were questionable, some of them I found annoying, while the rest felt neutral towards, and that deserves some ounce of respect.Animation: The biggest problem with this anime is the animation used for each episode. The first episode was the best prologue, with good quality animation and movement for attacking the villain in that episode, but it suddenly decreased after that. Although it was to ease up on the lack of action scenes, once the studio picked up on the fights, its quality decreased. Slideshow movements were used in place of the first episode\'s movement animation. And it was disappointing since it failed to reach that level of expectations for the remainder of the series. In the last episode, the quality almost improved, but it wasn\'t enough to save this series from its rough adaptation.Sound Design: The opening and ending sound wholesome, showing how the anime is also a romance series and that a relationship between Kimizuka and Siesta bloomed before she died. It felt refreshing to hear, and I give props to the singers behind both of those songs. The sound design however I didn\'t like, especially towards the last few episodes. At first, Siesta\'s gun sounded like a regular gun, but soon, it eventually mimicked the sound for when one of Naruto\'s shadow clones disappears. It was so noticeable that I was disappointed with the drop in sound quality as well, I mean, why would they do something like that in the first place?Overall, The Detective is Already Dead was a series I was looking forward to but didn\'t hit the right notes for a great adaptation. The character designs were questionable, the story was too dialogue-heavy, the animation quality failed to live up to the first episode\'s expectations, and the sound design used sound effects from other anime series. However, I did enjoy the chemistry between Kimizuka and Siesta and how ambiguous they were in the episodes in which their relationship was featured. Siesta can be in the contender for the best girl this summer anime season. Everything else about the series could\'ve been better if they adapted the light novel into a more interesting detective story after the first episode. The Detective is Already Dead deserves a better adaptation and should give it the justice that we all wanted to see for a long time. mixes in the present timeline and what happened in the past, which is one of the reasons why it dropped in quality.

The only thing I can think of to compare it to is GoT series 8.The art looked beautiful and episode 1 seemed to race along, with the mysterious detective Siesta taking our MC (who is apparently at school but you'd never guess from the look of the character) along on a real roller coaster ride.In subsequent episodes we have an abrupt change of pace, the MC is now mourning the death of Siesta 3 years later and we...get a moderately engaging plot about a couple of girls which is linked to the organisation Siesta was investigating in episode 1, okay so far.Then we abandon the new characters to go back to what happened in the three years the MC was with Siesta. Not only is another change of focus jarring but the quality is dropping too. The characters are still nicely drawn, but the scenes seem to be becoming devoid of detail other than the main cast. The voice acting is coming across as bland and lifeless, the story beats are peculiarly meandering.Why are visiting these places? How does Siesta know anything? Where did that giant mech come from? Who is this new girl? *shrug* It's a mystery, but not a good sort of mystery where there is a logical progression and a feeling of getting glimpses of something behind a curtain, more a series of deus-ex reveals whose lack of coherence prevents you from taking any satisfaction in the reveal - because there are no clues at all for you to make any inference from. How are you supposed to know that the bad guys have mutants and mech suits in a base under London? Beats me, but Siesta apparently knew. How? I don't know. A good mystery gives you clues and gets you guessing before it lets you in on the secret, maybe it throws in some misdirection can it can surprise you, it introduces a cast of suspects and scatters crumbs for you to puzzle over.Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru does none of this. It just throws one bizarre reveal after another at you until... I just don't care anymore. I literally just watched the detective die and I was totally unmoved. I repeat: I just watched the emotional peak of the series and it left me cold. The romance was over already, I don't care about the characters anymore and I can't be bothered to puzzle over the plot.My advice is to maybe watch some of this. Ep 1 is probably a 7 or 8. Episodes 2-4 maybe a 6 or 7.

I can kind of provide a bit of perspective on what the show's done so far with the knowledge of what comes next, and...Unfortunately, the adaptation is still pretty damn mediocre.Story: 6/10 and I'm being generous on this one because I did quite enjoy the light novels. So far the development has at least stuck with the light novels but for the love of all that is holy ENGI has managed to suck all the soul out of it.Art: 4/10, there's one really well animated scene in episode 1 and the most I can say for the rest is that...the art style is at least consistent. Lots of other animation fuckups (ep 4 manages to make an animated show look like it used a greenscreen) and nothing visually spectacular.Sound: 2/10. Holy shit they need to fire their sound director (/s, hope they figure something out about this). Sound effects play for WAY too long or not long enough, the OST includes multiple tracks that are either straight up irritating to hear or that don't fit with the scene. Absolutely abysmal sound design, not giving it a 1 because it's functional like 40% of the time.Character: 5/10, the characters are fleshed out pretty decently in the light novels and really get you invested into them, but the anime just is not doing that. Kimi's VA is very clearly new and oftentimes reacts to things with the enthusiasm of a dead fish. A lot of the dialogue was also adapted exactly 1:1 from the light novel and is not executed in a way that feels like a real conversation. I'm being generous on this again because I liked the LNs.Enjoyment: 6/10, just because I do still like some of the character designs and it's nice to see some of the LNs be animated.Overall: 5/10, but ONLY because I read the source. Would've dropped it by now otherwise. If you're planning on forcing yourself to power through the rest of the show, just read the LNs. the art style is at least consistent.

Up to this point, you are probably thinking about what kind of mystery it will offer in the following episodes and how both characters will solve them. However, you will be disappointed if you believe that this anime is anything close to a mystery anime. Unlike other detective stories, such as Sherlock and Detective Conan, it offers no mystery because everything is explained right at your face. Even in an anime like...Detective Conan, where the culprits’ motives are stupid, each case successfully builds up suspense and allows the audience to engage in solving the cases. Apart from this, the supposed female main character, aka the detective, Siesta, shows up only around 5 times in the entirety of 12 episodes. The male main character, Kimihiko, aka the sidekick, paired up with another random girl and they started their journey to do God knows what. The story jumps from point A to point B and to point Z, and this is not an exaggeration. Everything part of the story is being tossed around with no explanation and occasionally some flashbacks are supposed to depict the relationship between Siesta and the MC. The story is a disaster because the story doesn’t know which direction to go and there’s no consistency in anything.Art: 4The first episode is where all the budget is and when animators are hired. In the first episode, the animations are amazing with 360 camera angles and constant movements on the plane. The way the fight scene was animated makes you feel the momentum and intensity of the battle without giving you the time to breathe. There are certain times when I thought that the entire anime is going to be this good and I just came across a hidden gem in the mines. It turns out to be that I was wrong the whole time, and everything turned to sh!t afterward. After the first episode, I have two speculations: The animators died from exhaustion or there’s no budget left. The still motion and PowerPoint scenes disappointed me after seeing how great the animation is in episode 1. Other than the first episode, nothing from the rest of the anime is impressive as they look bland and uninteresting. By the way, the colors the anime decided to use lean towards a greyish style, so nothing looks vibrant or colorful in a way.Sound: 3The opening and ending are both pretty nice to listen to, but other than that nothing stands out in any particular way. Everything after episode 1 shrinks in terms of quality, so there’s nothing to expect from it. The opening and ending have high replayability as they are well produced by the singers.Characters: 1The male MC, Kimihiko, is probably one of the blandest characters you can ever see in an anime. You cannot separate him from Hyouka’s MC as they are identical. The MC tried to give off this “I don’t care,” “I’m bored,” and “I don’t want to do your bidding” attitude, but in the end, he will do everything for Siesta, the female MC. His personality is also the same as many other MCs, which is shoving his ideologies down other people’s throats. It is so one-dimensional to the point where it’s annoying to watch him on the screen and you will hope that he can just shut up for real.Siesta is one of the female MCs, but a girl named Nagisa takes her place (literally) by having 90% of the screen time. Both characters are the same because they have no personality whatsoever, and they exist for Kimihiko’s sake. Their backstories are not sad or touching because the anime did not bother to elaborate more on them, and they give you the feeling of “oh that’s it? Huh, interesting.” Notice how I did not mention any other characters or villains? That is because they don’t matter to the story at all. The “villain” is an evil organization that is evil because it is evil…Yep, that’s how it is. With or without them, the story can continue perfectly fine, so I don’t even want to bother writing about them.Verdict: 1I’m one of the idiots on the internet that got tricked into wanting to watch this anime after seeing the PV released by the anime studio. Throughout my watching experience, I find myself dozing off because of the terrible writing and I have a hard time trying to piece everything together.

However, all of that expectation shattered away with making the direction of this anime away from it should be. We expect a thrilling yet entertaining story in...detective world, but the anime is turns out to be not more than a protagonist making a kind of harem with the cute girls he met around the story.Don\'t get dissapointed with the anime because it also really boring and confusing in both of the narrative aspect and character development. You won\'t get a good narrative aspect and character development when the anime decided to throw random premise on the narrative, it feels like every episode on this anime is switching the genre back to back.Last but not least that makes the audience will be dissapointed with this anime is because the anime make an anti-thesis of what a detective can and cannot do for solving a case (watch the early episodes and you will understand). The case solving in this anime is also absurd because the detectives turns out to be omniscient about all the problem that happened in the series which directing this anime more in the negative ways of story telling and character development.If you into cute girls, you probably can check this anime out, but don\'t get dissappointed later because the bad direction on the story telling and the character developments because that is what this anime going to direct to, selling their cute girls with ""detective"" name attached into it. detective world, but the anime is turns out to be not more than a protagonist making a kind of harem with the cute girls he met around the story.Don\'t get dissapointed with the anime because it also really boring and confusing in both of the narrative aspect and character development.

Would you look at that, the controversial anime ""Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru"" came in handy.The story follows Kimihiko Kimitsuka, a young man who is practically haunted by accidents and misfortune and keeps getting involved in crimes. Three years ago, Kimitsuka became an assistant to a mysterious detective named ""Siesta"" on a hijacked plane. Together, Kimihiko and Siesta had crazy, globe-trotting adventures and fought against a secret organization. However, all that came to an end when they were separated by Siesta\'s death. Back in the...present, Kimihiko tries to return to an ordinary, boring life as a high school student, but things are never that simple, even if the detective is already dead.As someone who hasn\'t read the light novel, I was very excited when I first saw the trailer and I was really looking forward to watching it and the first episode truly did not disappoint. The great start in the hijacked plane and the beautiful animation captivated me. Even though the second half of the 50 minute first episode was rather boring in comparison, I was still excited to see the next episodes... But then I was disappointed.Even the second episode was acceptable with Natsunagi on stage but from that point forward the story went down the drain.It wasn\'t disappointing because it didn\'t meet my expectations, but because the story just didn\'t even stay consistent once. When you get right down to it, you could apply just about any genre there is to this anime. We have Mystery, Harem, Romance, Mecha, Comedy, Supernatural, Slice of Life, Drama and some more.It starts off with Mystery, then new girls are introduced who all join Kimitsuka\'s harem and fawn over him. Then there\'s some more mystery with some slice of life and comedy and in between they throw in a beach episode.Most of the episodes just go by with dialogue between a few characters without anything really happening either.The sound was okay for the most part. I sometimes had the feeling that the played OST\'s didn\'t really fit the scene and were sometimes played too long or too short, at least that was my impression.From what I\'ve been told so far, the light novel is a lot better and the anime adaptation doesn\'t compare to it in the slightest and I may give this one a read as the actual premise of the show isn\'t bad.Towards the end, I didn\'t quit this anime just because of Siesta. present, Kimihiko tries to return to an ordinary, boring life as a high school student, but things are never that simple, even if the detective is already dead.As someone who hasn\'t read the light novel, I was very excited when I first saw the trailer and I was really looking forward to watching it and the first episode truly did not disappoint.

Ever seen Gosick? Yeah, this is modernized Gosick with a battle set Victorique and a very much useless Kujo who is, apparently as incredibly that dense that 'random', interesting and heated up life situations seem to happen to him 'unexpectedly'.The mysteries are bland and uninteresting, what? Another piece of shit...added to a heap of shitloads to great detective works. The story progression is the worst and the dialogues are too boring, I slept over half of the first episode cause this snoozefest was trying too hard to be something interesting. The organization plot is tired, overplayed and uninteresting, we get it, there is always a bad organization that seem to just want to destroy and take over the world.I saw only 3 episodes and as far as i did I honestly could not get what the point of this anime is.Art: 5/10.The Animation like most is watchable at least. Nothing unique about it.Sound: 3/10.couldn't get into the music. Yawn music here, 10/10 for being a snoozefest. 3/10 for not being used for what the main background of the entire thing is meant for.Character: 1/10.Siesta: Your kawaii, blonde-, wait white-haired, generic ass, cute Female Mc who knows everything. She's got mood-swings too I guess, or not? I don't even know, she isn't one to stay in character. Bland, bland, bland.Kujo: Dense Male MC, a student warped up in shady conspiracies that he randomly just gets into cause he's got the worst luck in the world, and cause he is our male lead. Yeah, how realistic, cause this happens to the best of us.Others: Oh my gawd, that Cutesy pop star they introduced annoyed me to bits, the others just here to make something of the entire thing.Not one character I liked.Enjoyment: 1/10.I dozed off when I saw half of the first episode, the first episode was 40+ mins long, and I found my eyelids closing up cause this is not my shit, yup! Close them eyes and focus away on something else Dennis.Damn!One of the very worst I seen all year.Overall: 1/10.Maybe a weak start? Idk But I can't go on.Mystery genre is one of my favourites in everything but this was just too weak. Nothing pumpin about it.

The seemingly only redeeming feature is the enjoyable first episode which had clearly more effort invested and the constant hint that actually underneath this sorry mess lies a much better story.I hadn't read the light novels but this nagging sense that perhaps this anime may not being doing the the source material justice drove me to seek out some of the scenes where contextually things just didn't make sense....And of course unsurprisingly, it transpires what we have here is genuinely an incredibly poor adaptation of a much more worthy story.The light novels are what you expect of the story. Things just make more sense. For example an introspective is just that and happens in a flash, not as protracted dialog in the middle of a battle. Also, characterisations and tone are far more evident which unusually are almost completely lost in the anime - such as Kimi wearing a shirt instead of a bathrobe in a key Ep7 scene.Clearly, animators have to take certain liberties in converting a story and for the most, I think viewers can be forgiving if the anime brings some sense of the experience the source material sought to deliver. Even where an adaptation falls short, you can mostly take away at least some enjoyment because it had a great opening or those few events that really encapsulated a scene. The Detective Is Already Dead regrettably fails on all accounts.There is nothing to take away from this other than a fervent desire to read the light novels and reframe the whole experience as it was intended. Which if considered then I suppose the animators have done a good job. However from the company that brought us 'Your Name' and 'Bunny Girl Senpai' this is a truly disappointing outcome which draws stark focus on some of the root causes plauging the anime industry at present.

The second and third, a solid 4 out of 10,  The fourth was an absolute train wreck, and while the following episodes had the large element that made the first episode so good, the show got bad extremely fast. Promising an intriguing mystery with supernatural aspects, and a dynamic similarly as lovable as In/Spectre, the show instead after the first episode not only disconnected itself from the world, but changed from a gripping mystery, to a bad slice of life detective show. Copious amounts of fanservice, 1 dimensional girls who like the mc because he is the mc,...disconnected arcs, and lack on continuity further ruined the show, as well as changing what made the show so good, bad.What made the first episode so stunning and encapsulating was the combination of logical but room to be explored supernatural elements, mysteries that were actually mysteries, a compelling narrative that was to be followed, interesting character dynamics, and a cliffhanger ending.However, what the rest of the show brought were plain bad 4-year old level mysteries, bland and annoying harem elements, unnecessary fanservice, boring dialogue, and a main character who has to many relations, is good at too many things, and seems to be the smartest person alive, despite being built up as an everyday guy. Its boring, unnecessary, and almost feels like an insult to the first episode, as when the supernatural elements are brought up again, its just dumb and feels like a fanfiction written by a 10 year old who liked Naruto, full of spelling mistakes and dumb powerups.Following the stellar first episode the storyline jumps between the past and the present, where the two main leads fight some villain organization that is never explained. However, those are the decent episodes. The majority of the show takes place after the poorly written detective superpower show with these high school fangirls of his each claiming to be geniuses, when in actuality just show skin to the main character, where their detective mysteries are expertly dumb. In episode 2 he helps this girl find a lover she was looking for in the by using alien tech(that is supposed to be super secret), straight off the heels of fighting monster aliens that hijacked on a flying plane with super powers in which they fought it out to barely survive. Their company is the good guys, yet they are the bad guys, and despite trying to keep an air of reality there is literally an episode where a werewolf captures the main character, turns into a girl who is the leader of the organization, who unsurprisingly likes the main character and takes him to her lair. From there she pulls out a mini Godzilla and shows it to the main character for absolutely no reason. Following that Siesta comes in a giant Mech(which apparently America had the whole time) fully equipped with missiles ,flying powers and superpowers in which her and the Godzilla battle it out in new York, destroy half the city, and then when the battle ends in their victory, nothing on the news is mentioned and New York is back together the next day as if nothing happened. And then to top it off, he is helping a Idol girl the next episode with stalker issues.There is very little to say about the rest as no substance is retained. The female characters are all 1 dimensional, each appealing to a different male audience as they flirt and tease the main character in different manners,  and relevant for fanservice and as waifu's for only newcomers to anime. Male characters are literally nonexistent outside the first episode(Check if you want to, the only other male character outside that a villain, coincidentally the 1/6 villains that is male), and the story is boring as the main character choses all these “mysteries” for no reason, aside to move the plot forward. The comedy almost never lands, the emotional moments are bland and overused, yet they spend to much time watching them cry, letting your thoughts drift to, how did this show even get here.Every villain is Defeated due to talk no jutsu, and the animation is absolutely appalling. This is 7 deadly sins level of appalling. The Bland and dumb 15-minute fights that end in talk no Jutsu never have any decent Choreography buildup or logic in them, and so many frames and sequences are gritting to see.A huge disappointment. The opening is really good, the animation in the first episode good, but lazy in all the other episodes.

The interactions between characters are just terrible. The twists are pretty weird and doesn't really have anything that'll shock you and it's very anti climatic.The protagonist, Kimizuka is just so plain in appearance and personality.The other casts member are nothing special either except for two characters that are keeping this anime somewhat alive, Siesta and Koumori. These are the...only characters that I find interesting that kept me from dropping this anime.I never criticize any anime like this before because I usually try to enjoy it with the good points that the anime provides and overlook those bad points, but this anime is just so bad that there are barely any good points. I got to the point to where I watch an episode in 2x speed because it was so boring.Some people might actually like it since there are few interesting thing in the story, but pointing out those would require me to give away a major spoiler. only characters that I find interesting that kept me from dropping this anime.I never criticize any anime like this before because I usually try to enjoy it with the good points that the anime provides and overlook those bad points, but this anime is just so bad that there are barely any good points.

I don\'t know what the these others are thinking. I\'m going to write a good anime review right now so if you don\'t read it all through you\'ll miss my redemption of this anime.Think about it, most anime that you can think of right now maybe 4000 or so, how many of those are overwhelming anime? So many of them. What makes a good anime is I think not something that has been done a thousand times. And because most anime is overwhelming, that means the next following anime...is going to be even more convoluted and overwhelming than the last. So I don\'t know what these others are currently thinking, maybe because they are just thinking that because they\'ve thought they seen a lot of anime that must mean they know how to talk about certain anime; maybe that\'s why that they hate this anime so much because it\'s so not overwhelming. It\'s like you know there\'s some anime you\'ve probably seen that have been so too built up, convoluted and overwhelming that it totally defeats the purpose of evaluating whether it\'s good or bad, even if it is, even so it\'s just so a pain to even watch, like the story setting taking place in the background of mars during the sunset while grasshoppers are somehow bouncing on the soil, or then there\'s a 10 episode log of character development for every single last character. It\'s like watching subbed anime even when you\'re unable to read the screen fast enough before they start talking something else. This anime is the opposite of that, even if you don\'t understand what it\'s all about, at least it\'s not a total pain to watch. It\'s straight forward, the detective is already dead and it\'s a mystery, a mystery doesn\'t even need any more than that.Here\'s the deal here. If you like a mystery that\'s not going to pop right up in your face and say it\'s a real mystery, not like, so overdeveloped that it distracts what the mystery is supposed to be about, then you\'ll love watching this anime. It\'s not like every mystery that\'s a mystery is always meant to be solved in the end, no one even really likes a mystery, but the anime is a mystery that doesn\'t tell you that unless you figure it out from watching it, of course that\'s what makes a mystery a real mystery, nothing else matters, and of course, you don\'t need the evaluation of someone else\'s opinion to tell you that either, mysteries never solve themselves, that\'s what makes a good mystery a good mystery. A good mystery is one when because that it\'s a mystery and no one likes it, everyone thinks they\'re right in the end, because, it\'s a mystery.I don\'t give a shit what the anime is about, whether it\'s like about werewolves, androids and aliens, it\'s what makes the main mystery about the anime all that much more interesting just because this is what the anime is about and yet it\'s still about an entire separate mystery. You know, I\'ve watched some good anime that I didn\'t even care whether it was good or not, like taboo tattoo, ""I mean, come on, it was one of the most awesome, badass, under overwhelming anime that I\'ve seen too, like who is this no body whippy guy having to do with this awesome bad ass anime, the guy gets his powers from a tattoo he got from a hobo in an ally, what the heck was that supposed to be,"" however, it was still so good while I didn\'t have any understanding of why at all, I don\'t even feel like giving it a rating, because, I wouldn\'t even know what to rate it and I still don\'t even know, it was just an awesome most bad ass anime that you literally couldn\'t tell even whether it was so good or not unless by watching it and honestly that\'s all that I really needed.I\'ve honestly secretly wished someone thought of this anime. I knowingly acknowledge given everything that I\'ve said thus far that mostly the anime I\'ve seen out there is not even worth watching to me, I thought someone could have made an anime just like this and then someone did, finally someone understood something that I would have actually liked watching. I don\'t care really whether even if the anime I watch is over developed or overwhelming, I care just more about, not having to rewatch the same fu cking bullshit from an anime about the same thing all the fu cking time. Finally, someone thought about making an anime that doesn\'t pander catering to an audience just to be valued as a good anime. I\'m surprised no one else thought about making this anime, once you hear me talking about it or watching it yourself you\'ll see what I mean.Before I even discuss this anime, what I should do is discuss what those other reviewers have been saying.I\'m sure that those that disliked and reviewed this anime are looking at me right now like I don\'t know what I\'m talking about because there\'s more of them than me. There always seems to be like a board of a dozen people that all think that all think that just because they think they\'ve watched a lot of anime they know how to talk about what good anime is. Hey. You know what, I personally don\'t think that someone that talks shit about anime because they\'ve watched a lot or whatever, should be making a review talking about how one mystery anime is such crap. Someone put a lot of thought into that anime. If you\'ve really believed that you\'ve watched enough anime to be able to talk about it, then you should know that what you get out of an anime isn\'t the same as what\'s been put right in front of you, like there could be an anime about, not letting you kids shoplift or something, and then what you get is an anime all about kids shoplifting, it happens. That\'s anime. When you combine a detective anime with its title being The Detective Is Already Dead, it should have been a dead giveaway. Who gives, a shit, about that it\'s about like werewolves, androids and aliens? A good anime, is something that hasn\'t been made a thousand or more times. Just watch the anime and be impressed. What you think of an anime doesn\'t mean shit to me, because even though some people might find this anime terrible, anyone could have told you whether an anime is good or not by just watching it. You don\'t need someone to tell you that just because you haven\'t seen much anime, movies, read books, that it doesn\'t take anyone to tell you whether something is what you like or not unless you watch it. Who the fu ck are you to talk shit about an anime just because you don\'t understand it? It\'s definitely an anime, and it\'s definitely a mystery about why you should watch it, now just because you\'ve thought you\'ve seen many anime you think you can talk shit about this one, just watch it. That\'s what\'s it there for. Like I was saying earlier, who gives a shit what it\'s about, because the only ones that like talking shit about this anime are just you. I\'ve bet money it even that I myself even have watched more anime than all of you. I\'ve watched so much anime that I\'m practically all out of dubbed anime to watch right now. I don\'t normally watch subbed but I\'m currently thinking about watching just to finish where dubbed left off.I didn\'t start watching this anime just to find out that it was about werewolves, androids and aliens, or to find out what the mystery was supposed to be about, I watched it because I want to find out why I should want to know why the mystery to the mystery was a mystery, the only way I would have known was for me to watch the anime. I don\'t care whether the detective is just trying to sit on a dick or the sidekick guy is just a total loser, that\'s not why I started watching or why I had to keep watching to find that out. I had my moments when I thought the same almost like where\'s the mystery in this detective show, but still I know when I see an anime that I like watching and I don\'t even care whether it\'s good or not, seriously. It bothers me now that some people have been ragging so hard on this anime. I mind you that in addition, I\'ve never even made a single review on an anime ever right now. I started watching this anime because like the title suggests, the detective is already dead, and I just want to find out why this total loser is working on solving mysteries with this lady genius detective, like that\'s all I care about, you can call this anime anything you want but that\'s the real mystery like a slice of life, psychological, fantasy, I don\'t even give a shit, I just want to watch it to find out what I\'ve talked about, I mean the main character of the show isn\'t even there for half the show because like the title said she\'s already dead, the guy could be a nasa slash brain surgeon cab driver for all I care, so what I happen to think is that this anime delivered holding up to what it was meant to represent and symbolize, and if that\'s all I have to think just to be able to watch this anime, then I have no qualms with that, I need nothing else more than that unlike some people making reviews about it that are currently all probably thinking the same exact thing by readying this right now. Look, I don\'t give a shit, and I just happen to like this anime, there\'s nothing that any one of you could have said to me to have made me change my mind just about what I happen to call a good anime, that\'s the real point that I\'m making right now. If you\'re going to talk about anime or something, look don\'t just keep talking shit about the things that you don\'t like like you\'re somehow doing a great service to the world right now, someone put thought into what you get to watch just to be able to give you that ability to think you must should always be taking shit about it, if you think that\'s, that, is a good best way to be watching anime, then now I really don\'t give a shit because you must have some really bad tastes in anime then, I don\'t know what else to say because I already hadn\'t any high hopes for anyone else being able to know what real good anime is.So this anime has a legendary detective and she is really good at being a detective, the whole anime you\'re left wondering what else does she know that should you know that she could have told you from the beginning even at the end when she\'s already dead. You\'re going to be wondering what this girl was doing with this random loser, when she\'s gone, the only one to find that out was the dude so you get to see just how a legendary detective rubbed off on this sidekick. The first legendary detective dies but then she comes back as a different girl with that girl\'s heart, so if you\'re already wondering how this dude was relative to this legendary detective because he\'s the only one that worked with her, then you\'re going to love this other mystery about this new girl too allowing you to further see just how good the legendary detective was at being a detective, but never then through the whole anime could you have been able to find that out unless the flashback of the sidekick through half the anime were happening, then you\'re left just wondering that same mystery. I mean that you\'re literally left wondering that from beginning to end, because it starts out with the first legendary detective, then it goes to a new girl, then it goes back to the first one, then it goes back to the new one, not only are you wondering what happened to the detective girl but also just because the story picks up with she left off with the sidekick a sidekick that you\'ve been trying to figure it out why she\'s even with this guy, that\'s just makes the mystery even more interesting, because she comes back as a different girl. What was this girl doing with this guy when she died and why did she die, that\'s the meaning of the mystery in this anime. The anime isn\'t about the dude, he\'s not the detective, she\'s the detective, the anime was never going to be about battling werewolves, android and aliens, it was the mystery, a mystery about where and when this girl died and what was she doing with this random loser guy? Not even that it\'s about how this dude is just a total loser random sidekick, I honestly couldn\'t care less how this guy is, but, he is really, that\'s not what gets me, the only one who can figure out what happened after this detective died was this random dude, so if if this is a mystery anime, it\'s not about how or not whether this guy is just a total loser random guy sidekick, it\'s about the girl who died because the name of the anime is the detective is already dead, that\'s the mystery and he\'s not really all that much help is he, I could just ignore everything else that this anime could be about, whether it\'s overwhelming or doesn\'t make sense, what doesn\'t make sense is what this girl is doing with this random dude and since you\'ll find out that she\'s a damn good detective you\'ll want to find out why this mystery was a mystery that\'s so interesting to you. Not other mystery anime are ever like this one, it\'s one of a kind, others aren\'t really even detective anime, even if it is, it\'s not it\'s more like it\'s about vampires, a little kid that solves crime or something totally bizarre that\'s just a mystery that\'s never even solved which happens to make it a mystery, no one else ever thought of an anime about the detective already being dead, like no matter what it\'s about, that\'s the real mystery. No one could have thought about making an anime mystery where the actual main bad guy slash girl that\'s a real monster really literally teams up with the detective and sidekick just to figure out they aren\'t good together before and not having that it is that is real mystery no one ever thought of before in a mystery anime, and rightfully so because that\'s not even what the anime is even about, it\'s a mystery. What\'s more, because of that as a matter of fact that makes the mystery a mystery worth solving in the end no matter what anyone else thinks even, because think about it, it wouldn\'t be a mystery that could be solved if the detective is actually dead but actually the girl comes back as a new girl detective and she picks up the tasks the other one left behind, so if it is a mystery worth finding out the one you have to keep watching is the sidekick through the anime and basically also just it\'s like, the detective is already dead. Like who cares who this guy is? The detective is already dead, this anime wouldn\'t work right if it is about anyone else this guy could have been, so it wouldn\'t have mattered whether it was good or not, the only one who needs to figure out the mystery is the dude, like whether it was even a mystery or not he\'s the only one that needs to find that out, and that\'s what makes it a mystery. And people should be capable of knowing that what makes a good anime good isn\'t always that it\'s supposed to be meant to be making any sense, that\'s not always what makes a good anime good all the time. Sometimes there\'s good anime even that doesn\'t make any sense no matter how good it is.For a mystery, I\'d say that this anime is perfect in balance between development of setting, characters and plot and just enough unrelatableness that makes it a mystery whoever is watching it and yet still provides an escape from normal living people to be interesting to watch. If you were looking for an anime that\'s not forcefully making you conceptualize, doesn\'t have to make much any sense and allows you to escape your mundane everyday life, then you\'ve just found it. is going to be even more convoluted and overwhelming than the last. So I don\'t know what these others are currently thinking, maybe because they are just thinking that because they\'ve thought they seen a lot of anime that must mean they know how to talk about certain anime; maybe that\'s why that they hate this anime so much because it\'s so not overwhelming. It\'s like you know there\'s some anime you\'ve probably seen that have been so too built up, convoluted and overwhelming that it totally defeats the purpose of evaluating whether it\'s good or bad, even if it is, even so it\'s just so a pain to even watch, like the story setting taking place in the background of mars during the sunset while grasshoppers are somehow bouncing on the soil, or then there\'s a 10 episode log of character development for every single last character. It\'s like watching subbed anime even when you\'re unable to read the screen fast enough before they start talking something else. This anime is the opposite of that, even if you don\'t understand what it\'s all about, at least it\'s not a total pain to watch. It\'s straight forward, the detective is already dead and it\'s a mystery, a mystery doesn\'t even need any more than that.Here\'s the deal here. If you like a mystery that\'s not going to pop right up in your face and say it\'s a real mystery, not like, so overdeveloped that it distracts what the mystery is supposed to be about, then you\'ll love watching this anime. It\'s not like every mystery that\'s a mystery is always meant to be solved in the end, no one even really likes a mystery, but the anime is a mystery that doesn\'t tell you that unless you figure it out from watching it, of course that\'s what makes a mystery a real mystery, nothing else matters, and of course, you don\'t need the evaluation of someone else\'s opinion to tell you that either, mysteries never solve themselves, that\'s what makes a good mystery a good mystery. A good mystery is one when because that it\'s a mystery and no one likes it, everyone thinks they\'re right in the end, because, it\'s a mystery.I don\'t give a shit what the anime is about, whether it\'s like about werewolves, androids and aliens, it\'s what makes the main mystery about the anime all that much more interesting just because this is what the anime is about and yet it\'s still about an entire separate mystery. You know, I\'ve watched some good anime that I didn\'t even care whether it was good or not, like taboo tattoo, ""I mean, come on, it was one of the most awesome, badass, under overwhelming anime that I\'ve seen too, like who is this no body whippy guy having to do with this awesome bad ass anime, the guy gets his powers from a tattoo he got from a hobo in an ally, what the heck was that supposed to be,"" however, it was still so good while I didn\'t have any understanding of why at all, I don\'t even feel like giving it a rating, because, I wouldn\'t even know what to rate it and I still don\'t even know, it was just an awesome most bad ass anime that you literally couldn\'t tell even whether it was so good or not unless by watching it and honestly that\'s all that I really needed.I\'ve honestly secretly wished someone thought of this anime. I knowingly acknowledge given everything that I\'ve said thus far that mostly the anime I\'ve seen out there is not even worth watching to me, I thought someone could have made an anime just like this and then someone did, finally someone understood something that I would have actually liked watching. I don\'t care really whether even if the anime I watch is over developed or overwhelming, I care just more about, not having to rewatch the same fu cking bullshit from an anime about the same thing all the fu cking time. Finally, someone thought about making an anime that doesn\'t pander catering to an audience just to be valued as a good anime. I\'m surprised no one else thought about making this anime, once you hear me talking about it or watching it yourself you\'ll see what I mean.Before I even discuss this anime, what I should do is discuss what those other reviewers have been saying.I\'m sure that those that disliked and reviewed this anime are looking at me right now like I don\'t know what I\'m talking about because there\'s more of them than me. There always seems to be like a board of a dozen people that all think that all think that just because they think they\'ve watched a lot of anime they know how to talk about what good anime is. Hey. You know what, I personally don\'t think that someone that talks shit about anime because they\'ve watched a lot or whatever, should be making a review talking about how one mystery anime is such crap. Someone put a lot of thought into that anime. If you\'ve really believed that you\'ve watched enough anime to be able to talk about it, then you should know that what you get out of an anime isn\'t the same as what\'s been put right in front of you, like there could be an anime about, not letting you kids shoplift or something, and then what you get is an anime all about kids shoplifting, it happens. That\'s anime. When you combine a detective anime with its title being The Detective Is Already Dead, it should have been a dead giveaway. Who gives, a shit, about that it\'s about like werewolves, androids and aliens? A good anime, is something that hasn\'t been made a thousand or more times. Just watch the anime and be impressed. What you think of an anime doesn\'t mean shit to me, because even though some people might find this anime terrible, anyone could have told you whether an anime is good or not by just watching it. You don\'t need someone to tell you that just because you haven\'t seen much anime, movies, read books, that it doesn\'t take anyone to tell you whether something is what you like or not unless you watch it. Who the fu ck are you to talk shit about an anime just because you don\'t understand it? It\'s definitely an anime, and it\'s definitely a mystery about why you should watch it, now just because you\'ve thought you\'ve seen many anime you think you can talk shit about this one, just watch it. That\'s what\'s it there for. Like I was saying earlier, who gives a shit what it\'s about, because the only ones that like talking shit about this anime are just you. I\'ve bet money it even that I myself even have watched more anime than all of you. I\'ve watched so much anime that I\'m practically all out of dubbed anime to watch right now. I don\'t normally watch subbed but I\'m currently thinking about watching just to finish where dubbed left off.I didn\'t start watching this anime just to find out that it was about werewolves, androids and aliens, or to find out what the mystery was supposed to be about, I watched it because I want to find out why I should want to know why the mystery to the mystery was a mystery, the only way I would have known was for me to watch the anime. I don\'t care whether the detective is just trying to sit on a dick or the sidekick guy is just a total loser, that\'s not why I started watching or why I had to keep watching to find that out. I had my moments when I thought the same almost like where\'s the mystery in this detective show, but still I know when I see an anime that I like watching and I don\'t even care whether it\'s good or not, seriously. It bothers me now that some people have been ragging so hard on this anime. I mind you that in addition, I\'ve never even made a single review on an anime ever right now.

Look, I don\'t give a shit, and I just happen to like this anime, there\'s nothing that any one of you could have said to me to have made me change my mind just about what I happen to call a good anime, that\'s the real point that I\'m making right now.

Coated with smart marketing techniques and a high quality first episode, Tanmoshi eventually became one of the most anticipated show of the season. Aside from being heavily hyped on, it was also the most disappointing show this season. If you are looking for some sort of detective case-solving anime. I highly recommend for you to give this a pass. This is nothing like your average detective show... in a bad way.Tanmoshi follows the misadventures of a detective, Siesta, and the assistant she randomly picked on an airplane, Kimizuka...Kimihiko. Oh wait did I say ""detective""? Sorry, I actually meant a crazy tsundere cyborg witch with no detective skills claiming to be a detective. As long as you are using a proper dictionary, the definition of the word ""detective"" probably goes along the lines of ""a person, especially a police officer, whose occupation is to investigate and solve crimes"" or something similar. However, Siesta is nothing like that! Instead of finding clues and impressing viewers by revealing surprising facts of the case, this ""detective"" simply solves ALL of the cases with ONE reason and that is:""A good detective solves the case before they even happen.""Seriously, even non-living objects realize that this fact isn\'t true in the slightest way. Siesta is more of a fortune teller than a detective. Believe it or not, bad writing is already present in the first episode, the episode that everyone praised to be a masterpiece, which I admit, including myself. We were blindfolded by the high-quality animation and the wholesome romance between Siesta and Kimizuka. The anime is capable of producing good plot twists, and is also equally capable of completely ruining it. Blood that prevents consumer from attacking the target, a heart that somehow functions as a human brain capable of taking over the new host, etc. Siesta holds all of those otherworldly abilities to aid her in ""solving"" the cases like a piece of cake.Remember how I said Tanmoshi has some top-notch animation and sound qualities? It\'s only true for the first episode. Sound effects in some scenes don\'t make sense that even the characters living in the anime world literally complains about it. The smoothness of action scenes beside from the first episode is comparable even to a PowerPoint presentation. People who came here for a good story already left, and now shall the people who came for animations.Tanmoshi was a life-changing experience. It taught us to be more aware of smart marketing skills and to not keep our hopes too high for anything. We might get utterly disappointed when the worst comes. Kimihiko.

And welcome to “Garbage of the Season [3]!” The series where I discuss the current season's trashy pile of unwatchable monstrosities so that mom can’t say I’m doing nothing with my life. But before I start, I’d suggest you smash that helpful button and click on notifications so that you won’t miss out on any of my upcoming reviews. So without further ado, roll the intro…*Sarah Brand - Red Dress starts playing*…*End of intro*Today’s garbage is the ever popular The Detective Is Already Dead. A mystery show where the biggest mystery is how it was ever greenlit. It’s an abhorrent clusterfuck from start...to finish. With a script worthy of being the toilet brush in every bathroom of Taco Bell, before then getting nuked several times over.If you’re looking for a good mystery with fun crime-solving then this show will give you the opposite of what you are looking for, as well as severe headaches and permanent eye damage. Just stop reading this review (but don’t forget to smash the helpful button and subscribe) and pretend that this piece of fiction never existed. Any actual crime-solving is kept to the minimum amount and is never actually fun. For the mystery is more often than not near impossible to figure out because they don’t give you enough information. That and the characters solve it almost immediately because “a true detective gets a handle on a case before the incident occurs” or some bullshit. Plus that the show contains supernatural elements and logic is an afterthought, so anything goes really.But what’s the anime about then? The answer is waifus. It’s about selling merchandise of all the waifus. There’s a reason why in every arc the anime covers, there’s a new girl that gets center focus. I assume these arcs have been jumbled because the narrative is very disjointed. Both new and old characters just pop up out of nowhere and there’s never a clear sense of where the show is headed. It feels like they improvised the script for every episode as they were making them. It’s that messy.But who cares about the story? You can’t smash a story like you can a waifu after all (or the helpful button). So what really matters is that the waifus are S-tier, and they are. S as in suck that is! They undeniably exist for the lone purpose of being waifu bait. You could tell that by their introductions alone, being that they randomly appear out of thin air. That’s not an exaggeration, they are literally shoehorned in precisely when the story needs them to. And yet they don’t even succeed with their one purpose. White bread is more appealing than they are. Yes, that also includes Siesta the Mary Sue. Now try to solve the mystery of what the main guy is supposed to be! That’s right! You!The character designs aren’t bad at least but everything around them looks horrendous. The contrast between the characters and the backgrounds makes it look like they're in front of a green screen. It’s not authentic looking at all. Most of the animation budget ran out after the ten seconds of incredible animation in the first episode. Leavening the rest to look stilted and clumsy.In its sound department the anime delivers nothing but toilet sounds. The music is uninspired and boring. The sound effects are often laughable. And even the voice acting ranges between okay to straight up embarrassing.To summarize, I would describe this show the same way as eating ice cream in the winter. Just wrong in every sense of the word. But you know something that isn't wrong in every sense of the word? Me...GotS! And this has been Garbage of the Season! Leave your thoughts about The Detective Is Already Dead in the comments below and I’ll see you in the next review. But before I roll the outro I have something important to share with you guys.Making reviews like this takes a lot of work.

But with that said, roll the outro...*A video showing Paris Hilton doing push-ups in a greasy bathtub starts playing*The End... to finish. With a script worthy of being the toilet brush in every bathroom of Taco Bell, before then getting nuked several times over.If you’re looking for a good mystery with fun crime-solving then this show will give you the opposite of what you are looking for, as well as severe headaches and permanent eye damage. Just stop reading this review (but don’t forget to smash the helpful button and subscribe) and pretend that this piece of fiction never existed. Any actual crime-solving is kept to the minimum amount and is never actually fun. For the mystery is more often than not near impossible to figure out because they don’t give you enough information. That and the characters solve it almost immediately because “a true detective gets a handle on a case before the incident occurs” or some bullshit. Plus that the show contains supernatural elements and logic is an afterthought, so anything goes really.But what’s the anime about then? The answer is waifus. It’s about selling merchandise of all the waifus. There’s a reason why in every arc the anime covers, there’s a new girl that gets center focus. I assume these arcs have been jumbled because the narrative is very disjointed. Both new and old characters just pop up out of nowhere and there’s never a clear sense of where the show is headed. It feels like they improvised the script for every episode as they were making them. It’s that messy.But who cares about the story? You can’t smash a story like you can a waifu after all (or the helpful button). So what really matters is that the waifus are S-tier, and they are. S as in suck that is! They undeniably exist for the lone purpose of being waifu bait. You could tell that by their introductions alone, being that they randomly appear out of thin air. That’s not an exaggeration, they are literally shoehorned in precisely when the story needs them to. And yet they don’t even succeed with their one purpose. White bread is more appealing than they are. Yes, that also includes Siesta the Mary Sue. Now try to solve the mystery of what the main guy is supposed to be! That’s right! You!The character designs aren’t bad at least but everything around them looks horrendous. The contrast between the characters and the backgrounds makes it look like they're in front of a green screen. It’s not authentic looking at all. Most of the animation budget ran out after the ten seconds of incredible animation in the first episode. Leavening the rest to look stilted and clumsy.In its sound department the anime delivers nothing but toilet sounds. The music is uninspired and boring. The sound effects are often laughable. And even the voice acting ranges between okay to straight up embarrassing.To summarize, I would describe this show the same way as eating ice cream in the winter. Just wrong in every sense of the word. But you know something that isn't wrong in every sense of the word? Me...GotS! And this has been Garbage of the Season!

The main premise of the famous detective being dead is actually pretty great. Like ask yourself what if Sherlock Holmes had just the same amount of content it already has but imagine that at the beginning of it all you were told he’s dead. The same exact story but told by Watson and how he follows and admires...Sherlock. It’s a pretty compelling narrative. The thing is, the anime didn’t do that at all. It’s disappointing because I was really looking forward to it. The genres are not drama, mystery, romance nor comedy. There’s no drama, there are sci-fi random battles. There’s no mystery other than “how the detective died”, the story is too obvious and straight forward, leaving nothing to be questioned. There’s no romance, or at least not a good romance, the couples are not organic at all so it’s boring or even cringy, that same thing applies to the comedy aspect.If I had to re-brand this anime it would be: sci-fi, supernatural, loli… Yes, loli. Even it is not technically a genre but a style of character, there is A LOT of focus on the loli characters. Don’t get me wrong, that by itself it’s fine but the characters are literally little obnoxious girls and it doesn’t even go well with a detective narrative. Then if that wasn’t unnecessary enough, there’s the need to implement sci-fi and supernatural elements that make no sense at all. They’re not justified, it’s not the future, there’s no magic or spiritual encounters for it be coherent with the world presented. Plus, that absence of adults in this scenarios is more than concerning, it’s like Pokemon but with actual world-wide criminals, serial killers and a nonexistent judicial system.ABOUT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:•\tKIMIZUKA: the only one I can actually say something good about. I actually love this protagonist so it such a waste that he could be put into a good narrative. The voice acting of Arata Nagai is pristine and so pleasant to hear. An adolescent character that had to grow up too quickly and is put in this sort of scenarios is always fun to watch.•\tSIESTA: not really that legendary nor admirable… That’s all I have to say.•\tNAGISA: Is she a Rin Tōsaka rip-off?•\tYUI: Stereotypical loli #1•\tALICIA: Irritating, delirious, unnecessary to the plot. Stereotypical loli #2•\tCHARLOTTE: Mommy issues much?•\tSPES: Feels like taken out of the G.I.JOE series, but lame.ABOUT THE OPENING SEQUENCE: 「KOKO DE IKITERU」“I'M ALIVE HERE” is a really pretty song but it doesn’t go with the plot, it focuses on Siesta’s feeling for Kimi and vice versa and as I stated before, they are not good for each other in a romantic relationship. They’re great as friends and co-workers but that’s it. So, stating the anime is about how they’re deeply in love thanks to destiny joining them together, is really misleading. The sequence itself is fair, there is nothing special about it.ABOUT THE ENDING SEQUENCE: 「KODŌ」“BEAT” is actually a really good song choice. This anime did so many few things right, and this was one of them. I want to end in good note as this anime is not particularly bad, it’s just a great idea that wasn’t made justice. The song talks about Nagisa’s point of view and her relationship with Siesta. And even when Nagisa is as dull of a character as she is, the ending credits humanize her in ways the anime should’ve done and failed to do. The animation sequence is poor and confusing, the first frame is perfect but just that one frame. I’m glad not many people stick to watch the whole thing, I personally don’t unless I personally love the song, so I stuck with that one frame for the most part, and it was so beautiful.

There wasn't much news about it but from the visuals I had seen and from the title alone I was heavily intrigued and was looking forward to its release. Only to be severely dissapointed.Story: 3The first episode was interesting, spending 40 minutes hooking the viewer on a concept that led up to the eventual reveal that was the title, only to throw all of that intrigue out the window. The story resembled that of a Slice of Life show rather than a coherant narrative like you would expect. As the episodes...progress this doesn't change, a new case is presented every couple episodes or so and with each case a new character shows up, which of course is some kind of cute waifu. It gave up its potential of being an extremely gripping mystery story to become a waifu harem which I will get onto now.Characters: 2Let's start with our main character, Kimihiko Kimizuka, which the show and I will refer to as 'Kimi' for short. A character who is always getting into trouble for the sake of the plot. I first saw this in the episode and considering my expectations, thought that maybe he is a man in his twenties whose life is fallen apart and he is resorting to sketchy activies which gets him into these situations. But no, he is just a middle-schooler with a bad case of Unlucky-Protagonist-Syndrome. Kimi isn't a bad character per se but he isn't good either. There isn't anything memorable about him, and honestly that's all I can say about him.Then we have Siesta who is the dead detective (despite her being in about 75% of the show but oh well). What can I say other than that she's your average cute mary sue waifu. In the first episode she apparently knew everything that was going to happen and planned everything from the start. Okay? Is there an explanation to this? Nope. The show wants to pin her as some kind of perfect genius but it falls flat as it makes her achieve all these great accomplishments with essentially no work put in because she's just that amazing.Then there are the other characters who I won't even go into as they have one presonality trait each and they drill it into the ground.Art: 5Not much to say about this. It wasn't great, it wasn't awful, just average. It was pleasing to the eye at the very least.Sound: 4Again, nothing spectatuclar about this. There weren't any tracks that stuck with me in particular other than the ending theme which I found myself humming a few times so I guess there's that.Enjoyment: 2There were a couple of moments that I enjoyed throughout the show, the rest had me rolling my eyes, shaking my head, and constantly checking how much longer I had until the end of the episode. It's a chore to watch. If that doesn't sum up my enjoyment of the show, then I'll be direct: I very much dislike this show.Overall: 3If you enjoy harems with one dimensional characters and overall just a show where you can sit back, switch off your brain and watch absolute nonsense, you might enjoy this show.

It somehow manages to avoid being either decent or hilariously awful, and has been the single greatest waste of my time since getting into anime. I will try to be concise with my review, because while other reviews may go more in-depth with what makes this show so bad, even spending the time to read about it is a waste of your time.The first thing that The Detective is Already Dead...does is attempt to deceive you. They pull you into what seems to be an interesting story with a mystery at its core.

And then they just start to throw whatever bullshit they can think of at the wall to see if it sticks.

I beg you, it is not worth it.', 'I’d like to start this review off by calling out the title of this show, as it’s not only the biggest lie that I’ve been told since being told that SAO Alicization was actually going to be good, but it’s just false advertising and somehow I feel like that’s a crime to lie to your audience like that.Story:“The Detective is Already Dead” is a show that in theory, should let you know exactly what it’s about from just the title alone. Our story starts with Kimihiko Kimizuka, or Kimi for short, who boards a plane to deliver an unknown package to god knows where. Along...the way, the plane gets hijacked, and thusly meets a white haired girl who only calls herself ‘Siesta’ before taking the package that Kimi brought with him to save the day. As it turns out, she was the one who orchestrated him coming onto the plane (among other things), and offers him a position next to her as her detective’s assistant, as Siesta is the (self-proclaimed) great detective. But unfortunately, tragedy strikes eventually, and Kimi well into his high school years proclaims that “The Detective is Already Dead”.Or is she? See, this show isn’t exactly what it says on the tin, and the closest comparison I can make about this show is by comparing it to a 14-16 year old’s bad fantasy fanfiction. “The Detective is Already Dead” is a show that not only has awkward pacing as a result of the show desperately pushing for twist narratives to show the audience it’s a lot more suspenseful than it really is, but it’s also a show that really doesn’t want to concretely say that the detective is already dead even though that’s literally what it says in the title of the show! In fact, Siesta is alive for over half of this godforsaken show, which really begs the question why we had to bother with starting the show off in the present future when half of this thing was gonna end up being backstory set in the past like a year past when the first episode started anyway. You could’ve just started at the beginning of the whole story and we wouldn’t have had to deal with these shitty pacing issues, but I guess that would just be too ordinary of a storytelling structure to handle, now would it?Unfortunately, the worldbuilding and supposed lore that “The Detective is Already Dead” wants to tell also reads like bad fanfiction with the only upside to that is how the show fully commits to it because I guess if you’re going full sci-fi, you might as well go all the way. When I came into this, I expected a mystery show of some kind with school mysteries on a smaller scale. Not…androids, alien plants, or whatever hell else SPES is supposed to be. The sense of scale for this show is so much bigger than it should be, cause end of the world scenarios where the world is driven to chaos is not exactly the kind of thing I expected going into a show about middle and high schoolers ‘solving mysteries’. I mean the fact that you expect me to believe that covert operatives trust children with both guns and toppling a supposedly evil organization that wants to see the world burn is already a stretch considering you’re letting two underage children roam the world with some kind of funding that we’re never privy to learn about. A lot of it reads like it belongs in the ‘rule of cool’, as the show will gladly throw in mechs, giant monsters, aliens, and the loose definition of ‘android’ into the show, but will explain almost none of it because that would mean we would have to think about our worldbuilding instead of adding things because it seems cool to the plot.The end result of these myriad of story factors is that up until the very last 2 episodes, the entire show feels like a giant mess, and when it does somehow, miraculously come together, it still doesn’t feel very rewarding because while it does cohesively fit together in what could be loosely described as a neat package, it doesn’t feel rewarding in any way, and since the entire story is built on plot twists, the feeling of realization is more like frustration because honestly, I seriously can’t believe we were building up to THAT as our climactic reveal, but I guess this is the road we’re going down.Now does this mean story of “The Detective is Already Dead” is bad? Absolutely, but it’s at least the fun kind of bad where watching the show is painful, but making fun of it afterwards is a treat and a half. The show being incredibly edgy and taking itself all too seriously with a non-committal romantic subplot is only the tip of the iceberg for this because everything from the pacing to the characters don’t really make that much sense once you start poking holes in the whole thing. And trust me, there’re a lot of holes. Which makes the story not very rewarding to experience, and is definitely a big reason why this show gets such low marks for me.Characters:Kimi is about as interesting as sandpaper, and I don’t think there’s that much that can really be said about his character. The show desperately tries to frame him as a badass detective sidekick that’s both loyal and maybe likes the girl that he previously travelled with, but very little comes through in the end because he just kind of follows with what the show wants from him. A problem that’s made even worse by the fact that Kimi doesn’t exactly show many emotions, so he just seems bored or unfazed most of the time with what’s happening around him. Which I guess if you were constantly harassed by Dio but he’s a chameleon for a few years, yeah I guess you would be jaded by the shit that’s going on around you.Then there’s Siesta, the self-proclaimed detective that for all intents and purposes, is more of a plot convenience for the series than anything else. Where did she get the mech? Don’t worry about it. Why is her heart able to do anything it’s able to do? Don’t worry about it. Why does she have a stylized rifle capable of shooting through everything this series has that regular rifles can’t shoot through? Don’t worry about it. It gets to the point that Siesta feels less like a character and more like an omnipresent force that exists throughout the entire show, driving the show through a series of invisible hands that push the show to its intended end point. Which for a character that’s supposed to be a detective, feels very not detective-like because it makes it feel like the show is trying to make her seem smarter than everyone else instead of actually smart on account of the sheer amount of dialogue trees that amount to everything sounding like “Yes, that sounds totally legit and believable, let’s keep going on this train of thought please”.I would argue that Nagisa and Alicia are important characters to make note of, but truthfully despite the show’s desire to make them seem more important than they actually are, the show hardly turns their focuses on them, and it becomes very jarring when the plot makes it seem like it’s going to be a dramatic moment involving them when in reality, we’ve only known them for a short period of time. The rest of the cast falls under a similar umbrella as many characters, antagonists especially, are made out to seem like really big threats or important people we’re supposed to remember. But the show drops the ball on them so hard that they feel more like minor nuisances instead of an important part of the plot. Which really cuts into the worldbuilding because these other characters are supposed to be the worldbuilding. But they all contribute so little that to an extent, replacing them with cardboard boxes with googly eyes and a knife would end up with the same result.Aesthetics:ENGI’s art for this show is more serviceable than anything else. The show looks pretty generic all things considered, and only really shines in a few key moments in the series and nowhere else. One of the biggest boons this show has is its lack of 3D models, which considering some of the action scenes or creature features that this show has, you’d think they would use more of it. But they don’t, and it’s actually really nice to see not clearly 3D models put into the show to save costs.Speaking of action, there’s a lot more gunfire and other kinds of fights in this show than there really should be, and what ENGI managed to pull off was fantastic…for the first episode. After the plane scene, the show disappointingly doesn’t have the same kind of shot perspective and motion anywhere else despite its bigger and more ‘high stakes’ fights. Yes, starting out with a bang is great, but I guess that scene was so expensive that the rest of the show ended up becoming devoid of anything remotely resembling it. Which is a shame because I really liked the plane scene, and more of that would’ve been nice to have especially considering what we ended fighting in the second half of this show. I mean if you’re going to do ‘rule of cool’, might as well commit all the way, right?Neither of the tracks are really all that interesting to me, and feel more like they convey false emotions for the show than anything else. Both “Koko de Ikiteru” and “Kodou” are songs that try and hit on emotional beats that simply just aren’t there, and as a result don’t fit the show very well since despite saying that the detective is dead, the detective isn’t exactly very dead for most of the show.Final Thoughts:Honestly the only reason why I put this show on the docket in the first place was because Shirakami Fubuki and Natsuiro Matsuri were in the show’s credits for some reason and I had to know why that was the case. I think the only value of Tantei wa Mou, Shinderu is the ridiculous spoiler-filled synopses that you can make about this show because none of it makes sense out of context, and even in context it’s wild and doesn’t sound like something someone above the age of 15 would write let alone produce into a 12 episode animation production with hundreds of people working on the damned thing. This show takes itself ludicrously seriously, and I can’t tell you how many times the show tried to be edgy or dramatic as a result of some sudden twist that I could not be bothered with because they neither made any sense nor made any impact because we just had a twist ending last episode.Beyond the shoddy story held together by spit and twine, the characters aren’t very interesting, and the worldbuilding even less so cause everything is only there for the cool factor and nothing else. Because the textbook definition of ‘android’ does not involve any kind of biological component to it, and I refuse to believe that the original author who made this put in the effort to try and make anything make sense beyond just making everything sound cool and important. And that’s why personally, I don’t find this show all that compelling nor will I praise it for anything beyond the fight scene in episode because god forbid the story make sense when you transition the scene from a blind tentacle monster voiced by Kirito to a school festival riddled with powdered drugs passed out by bunnymen.As a result of all of this, the verdict I have for this show is to watch it strictly if you have friends willing enough to stick around to the end to make fun of this show, and to stay away from this one as far as possible if you want to tackle it alone. I honestly didn’t think that any show aside from isekai power fantasies could be up its own ass this much, but I guess if you stick around a medium long enough there will still be things that’ll surprise you. Also there wasn’t a single actual mystery in those show that required genuine deduction of any kind, and now that I think about it, this show is also using the word ‘detective’ wrong too. the way, the plane gets hijacked, and thusly meets a white haired girl who only calls herself ‘Siesta’ before taking the package that Kimi brought with him to save the day. As it turns out, she was the one who orchestrated him coming onto the plane (among other things), and offers him a position next to her as her detective’s assistant, as Siesta is the (self-proclaimed) great detective. But unfortunately, tragedy strikes eventually, and Kimi well into his high school years proclaims that “The Detective is Already Dead”.Or is she? See, this show isn’t exactly what it says on the tin, and the closest comparison I can make about this show is by comparing it to a 14-16 year old’s bad fantasy fanfiction. “The Detective is Already Dead” is a show that not only has awkward pacing as a result of the show desperately pushing for twist narratives to show the audience it’s a lot more suspenseful than it really is, but it’s also a show that really doesn’t want to concretely say that the detective is already dead even though that’s literally what it says in the title of the show! In fact, Siesta is alive for over half of this godforsaken show, which really begs the question why we had to bother with starting the show off in the present future when half of this thing was gonna end up being backstory set in the past like a year past when the first episode started anyway. You could’ve just started at the beginning of the whole story and we wouldn’t have had to deal with these shitty pacing issues, but I guess that would just be too ordinary of a storytelling structure to handle, now would it?Unfortunately, the worldbuilding and supposed lore that “The Detective is Already Dead” wants to tell also reads like bad fanfiction with the only upside to that is how the show fully commits to it because I guess if you’re going full sci-fi, you might as well go all the way. When I came into this, I expected a mystery show of some kind with school mysteries on a smaller scale. Not…androids, alien plants, or whatever hell else SPES is supposed to be. The sense of scale for this show is so much bigger than it should be, cause end of the world scenarios where the world is driven to chaos is not exactly the kind of thing I expected going into a show about middle and high schoolers ‘solving mysteries’. I mean the fact that you expect me to believe that covert operatives trust children with both guns and toppling a supposedly evil organization that wants to see the world burn is already a stretch considering you’re letting two underage children roam the world with some kind of funding that we’re never privy to learn about. A lot of it reads like it belongs in the ‘rule of cool’, as the show will gladly throw in mechs, giant monsters, aliens, and the loose definition of ‘android’ into the show, but will explain almost none of it because that would mean we would have to think about our worldbuilding instead of adding things because it seems cool to the plot.The end result of these myriad of story factors is that up until the very last 2 episodes, the entire show feels like a giant mess, and when it does somehow, miraculously come together, it still doesn’t feel very rewarding because while it does cohesively fit together in what could be loosely described as a neat package, it doesn’t feel rewarding in any way, and since the entire story is built on plot twists, the feeling of realization is more like frustration because honestly, I seriously can’t believe we were building up to THAT as our climactic reveal, but I guess this is the road we’re going down.Now does this mean story of “The Detective is Already Dead” is bad? Absolutely, but it’s at least the fun kind of bad where watching the show is painful, but making fun of it afterwards is a treat and a half. The show being incredibly edgy and taking itself all too seriously with a non-committal romantic subplot is only the tip of the iceberg for this because everything from the pacing to the characters don’t really make that much sense once you start poking holes in the whole thing. And trust me, there’re a lot of holes. Which makes the story not very rewarding to experience, and is definitely a big reason why this show gets such low marks for me.Characters:Kimi is about as interesting as sandpaper, and I don’t think there’s that much that can really be said about his character.

The protagonists were interesting in the first EPs, but after a few characters were introduced, it just became a mundane harem nonce.The concept of supernatural power and detective investigation was interesting ones to choose, but this let me down completely. After 3-4 EPs, the storyline became so boring, just try to give boobs service without a reason and the intensity of the whole anime just drops so low.If I were to describe using a few words for this anime it would...be ""Boring and disappointing."" be ""Boring and disappointing.""', 'Before writing this I read through a few other reviews, and it seems to me that no one can really explain just how bad this show is. So I\'ll give it a shot.The ""plot"" (if one could call it that) surrounds the adventures of a detective and her sidekick. Except the detective doesn\'t do much detective work, being closer to an inconsistently godlike action hero, and the sidekick mostly just exists to be a punching bag (either emotional or sometimes even physical). Now if the show was honest about that it could be in some way entertaining, however it constantly manages to work in detective...mysteries that then get solved in the most ridiculous and nonsensical ways. It spends far too much of its time trying to be a detective show and failing miserably for you to ever enjoy the action shounen mystery.But even then that aspect has massive problems as well. For starters, this world contains supernatural powers. But these supernatural powers are never clearly established. We are never explained the power scaling system, the futuristic technology, or any significant amount of world building. The main goal is pretty simple - they need to stop the evil organisation SPES. But what from? Nobody knows. Not even SPES knows, they have orders from a mysterious bible/prophecy thing that tells them what to do. And as a result it\'s hard to ever feel any sense of urgency or even concern for our protagonists\' plight.To make matters worse, the meaning of the title ""the detective is already dead"" is revealed in the first episode, where we find out that the detective died offscreen at the end of the first episode and everyone just went back to their own business. Not only does this destroy the pacing of the rest of the story - since they wasted the first episode establishing a character who is already dead - but she doesn\'t even stay dead. And that is to say that we return to the past before she dies. If they were going to show us the adventures of the detective and her sidekick, then why did they kill her off at the very start? Now we know undoubtedly the fates of the main characters - the sidekick will survive and the detective will die - but only at the very climax of the story. So there goes all the suspense and tension.There are a lot more problems with the story, but I don\'t want to give any more spoilers than I already have, so suffice to say that most of the pacing is also really slow and all the individual resolutions of each arc feel hollow and bland.Now the characters. The main character here is Kimihiko, the sidekick of the legendary detective - who only goes by the name of Siesta. The two develop this back and forth banter throughout the series that was incredibly poorly handled. The dialogue felt stiff and awkward, but more than anything it was just too surface level. These characters never really go beyond this safe, boring banter. Every time they get into some deep or challenging conversation where their true feelings are confronted, they back out and return to the dumb banter. Good character dynamics are not forged from the banter, but from the absence of banter. What made Spike and Jet\'s relationship in Cowboy Bebop feel so close is that they were so in sync with one another. Their dialogue felt streamlined and efficient. But here the banter is incredibly hard to listen to. They say things like ""do you remember that time we did XYZ"" ""yeah there was this ABC and it was really wild I can\'t believe we did that"". Normal people don\'t spell out every tiny detail during conversation, and that\'s mainly what made this feel so unnatural.But the characters themselves are also a problem here. Kimihiko starts off the show as a cynical bad luck charm. His inhuman ability to get caught up in the worst possible situations is a good point of humour and makes him likeable. However this never really makes a return in the series. The cynical charm of Kimihiko is eroded as the series goes on and we get more of that awful banter. Siesta is also a terrible character, probably the worst character in the entire show. She is this ""genius detective"" who solves cases with the most nonsensical BS imagineable, but then is also able to predict future events in the series without any real explanation being given, while also being unable to predict certain events when the plot needs them to happen. To top this off she is mysterious and distant, with many not so subtle hints throughout the show that she might be a more caring person than she appears; climaxing in a ""heartfelt"" farewell. The problem here is that instead of feeling distant or professional, she just feels inconsistent. All that banter strips away any sense of professionalism or distance, and as a result it just feels like her relationship with Kimihiko is a never ending cycle of witticisms where neither party really changes or grows throughout the story.The side characters are pretty bland. There are almost no men here, just a constant never-ending stream of generic waifu material to distract you from the awful plot.And that brings me to the ""plot"". The animation here is terrible. Incredibly average. Do not be distracted by the stellar first episode, every single one after massively overuses still frames and all but ditches the 3d tracking shots. The episode direction is also terrible. Shot composition is either your average ""shot reverse shot"" for dialogue scenes or during action it\'s a series of janky panning shots that don\'t fit well together. Everything beyond that first episode feels rushed and cheap.As for the character designs, the women have plenty of ""plot"" (aside from the lolis, of which there are at least two) and their designs are somewhat creative. Overall the colour palette is generic digital colour shading with almost no interesting deviations or creative lighting choices. If that went over your head basically the show is cheap and bland.The sound is pitiful. The only memorable music from the show itself is the comically bad action music, which sounds like it comes from Mortal Combat lmao. The opening and ending are fine I guess. Neither were particularly memorable to me so I have little to say on them.Overall I was not enjoying this show. Do not watch for any reason other than morbid fascination. It\'s actually quite interesting to consider just how this show manages to fail so badly, so if you\'re a student of animation or film, I would recommend checking this show out to obtain an extensive list of what not to do when making an animated series. For everyone else, stay away from this steaming dilapidated festering abomination of a dung heap. mysteries that then get solved in the most ridiculous and nonsensical ways.

The worst thing you can say about it is that it\'s too boring to even watch to laugh at.  One of the worst shows of 2021.Story: The plot follows a high school student named Kimizuka who\'s roped into a wild world of secret agents, cyborgs and aliens by ""legendary detective"" Siesta.  However, as the title helpfully spoils for you, there is an immediate timeskip forward to one year after Siesta\'s death, when Kimizuka meets fellow student Nagisa, the recipient of Siesta\'s transplanted heart.  It\'s...impossible to summarize what comes afterwards, a ridiculous mishmash of every conceivable genre that\'s so preposterous that it robs the story of any possible emotional stakes.  None of it works, and there\'s no kinder way to say it than to say that it\'s just stupid.  There\'s no reason for anyone to be high school aged other than the light novel source material is obviously being marketed towards teenagers, and the series regularly seems to forget how old they are and shows them drinking alcohol at bars more than once.  The twists are eye rolling and more likely to make you laugh than anything else.  The entire middle section of the series is an extended flashback to the incidents leading up to Siesta\'s death, much of which is unnecessary.  Siesta\'s death itself is laughable, and the nadir of the series and its tendency to depict Siesta as a 1000 IQ supergenius that puts Code Geass\'s Lelouch to shame with her ability to play 12 dimensional chess and orchestrate an impossibly complex plan exactly according to her will.  It\'s idiotic and will definitely make you mad.  A really terrible story that feels like it was never even looked at by an editor.Audio/Visual: Don\'t be fooled by the single gorgeously animated action sequence in the first episode, there is nothing else like that in the entire series.  The animation in this series ranges from passable to atrocious.  Especially as it gets later in the season, some sequences seem to lack in between animation, corners are cut in very obvious fashion (like fights taking place in an inexplicably empty plain with overcast skies so they don\'t have to animate anything in the background), and it looks plain unfinished in some ways.  It looks terrible and some of the action sequences are simply embarrassing in how the low quality animation takes any drama out of the fight.  The voice acting is flat almost across the board and it feels like everyone was sleepwalking through their roles, especially the VAs for Kimizuka and Siesta, whose emotionless delivery makes it hard to take the dramatic scenes seriously.  The music is inoffensive but nothing special.Characters: If there\'s a single positive thing I can say about this show, it\'s that the banter between characters can sometimes be entertaining.  Kimizuka and Siesta spend most of their screentime bantering, and it can be hit or miss, but has its moments.  Sometimes it can be too much and you can just feel the writer smugly grinning to himself about how clever his dialogue is.  But it can also be funny, and the brief time that Kimizuka is Detective-ing with Alicia, their banter is charming.  Most of the characters are just unnecessary though, Char in particular does nothing and the show would have been exactly the same if she hadn\'t been in it at all.  The characters overall aren\'t awful, but many don\'t add anything to the series. impossible to summarize what comes afterwards, a ridiculous mishmash of every conceivable genre that\'s so preposterous that it robs the story of any possible emotional stakes.  None of it works, and there\'s no kinder way to say it than to say that it\'s just stupid.  There\'s no reason for anyone to be high school aged other than the light novel source material is obviously being marketed towards teenagers, and the series regularly seems to forget how old they are and shows them drinking alcohol at bars more than once.  The twists are eye rolling and more likely to make you laugh than anything else.  The entire middle section of the series is an extended flashback to the incidents leading up to Siesta\'s death, much of which is unnecessary.  Siesta\'s death itself is laughable, and the nadir of the series and its tendency to depict Siesta as a 1000 IQ supergenius that puts Code Geass\'s Lelouch to shame with her ability to play 12 dimensional chess and orchestrate an impossibly complex plan exactly according to her will.  It\'s idiotic and will definitely make you mad.  A really terrible story that feels like it was never even looked at by an editor.Audio/Visual: Don\'t be fooled by the single gorgeously animated action sequence in the first episode, there is nothing else like that in the entire series.  The animation in this series ranges from passable to atrocious.  Especially as it gets later in the season, some sequences seem to lack in between animation, corners are cut in very obvious fashion (like fights taking place in an inexplicably empty plain with overcast skies so they don\'t have to animate anything in the background), and it looks plain unfinished in some ways.  It looks terrible and some of the action sequences are simply embarrassing in how the low quality animation takes any drama out of the fight.  The voice acting is flat almost across the board and it feels like everyone was sleepwalking through their roles, especially the VAs for Kimizuka and Siesta, whose emotionless delivery makes it hard to take the dramatic scenes seriously.  The music is inoffensive but nothing special.Characters: If there\'s a single positive thing I can say about this show, it\'s that the banter between characters can sometimes be entertaining.  Kimizuka and Siesta spend most of their screentime bantering, and it can be hit or miss, but has its moments.  Sometimes it can be too much and you can just feel the writer smugly grinning to himself about how clever his dialogue is.  But it can also be funny, and the brief time that Kimizuka is Detective-ing with Alicia, their banter is charming.  Most of the characters are just unnecessary though, Char in particular does nothing and the show would have been exactly the same if she hadn\'t been in it at all.  The characters overall aren\'t awful, but many don\'t add anything to the series.', ""Its Really nice and enjoyable anime please don't judge quickly by some others reviewsSeason 2 have Happy ending its already annonced itVolume 5 light novel have super awsome plot twisted with huge surprise.This anime have comedy interesting engaing storyWorth Watching, Character Design is Really impressive that character design don't Need Fan art that much awesome.I will buy all Light Novel and Manga to because i want season 2 soon possible with my own earningi Guaranteed You will like to.Main Character Siesta girl is super smart like Sherlock home and looks exact Pretty cute doll you to fell in love that characterits...Available in crunchyroll app with English DUB,Hindi DUB, Japanese DUB WATCH IT YOUR FAVRATE LANGUAGE Available in crunchyroll app with English DUB,Hindi DUB, Japanese DUB WATCH IT YOUR FAVRATE LANGUAGE"", 'I guess this Anime will definitely get a second season, as the last dialogue of Kimi said ""its too soon to call it an epilogue"" So I hope it gets a S2...This was a good anime, Animation was good, the characters looked beautiful, Siesta-Kimi chemistry was good, also Side Characters and the Soundtracks were Beautiful...The story is kinda slow at start but the pace it picks is drastic with major changes in short time, so that might be the reason people have some negative views about this Anime, but who cares if you choose to watch you should have the enthusiasm to complete because as...a Anime only watcher I get attached to characters and want to see them go through all the way till the end...

It had crappy animation, a laughable story, strange music choices, and was overall not a very enjoyable experience. It\'s first episode was fine, but after that it just nosedived. It ended with a setup for future seasons and I hope to god it doesn\'t get them.First the easy stuff: sound and art. The show did not fare well in this category. The soundtrack was either completely forgettable or didn\'t play when it should. Climactic fights would...have absolutely no music playing, which just made them feel even worse. The one track I did at least sort of like was Siesta\'s theme, which was a nice little music box melody. Nothing fantastic or revolutionary, but it sounded nice. The art is also pretty bad, the style they used is incredibly generic and bland, with little to no originality. The art itself was also not well done, with quite a few shots looking strange or just plain bad. Another thing I should comment on is the painfully boring fights. They almost never have music and always look boring, with little cool moments and flair. They just feel soulless and suck.The story is probably my biggest criticism of the show, it has pacing problems, bizarre elements, and is overall just not interesting. I\'ve seen people say that this show tries to be like Monogatari Series, and I think they have a point. They both are dialogue-heavy, with most of the episodes being taken up by conversation between characters rather than big plot events or action. However, Monogatari has well written dialogue, and the characters have great chemistry with each other, leading to this emphasis on dialogue making the show great, instead of just boring non-stop talking. Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru is missing the critical ""good dialogue and characters"" component, so it falls flat on its face with this approach and just ends up being really boring. The overall set up of the story itself is also strange, for a show called ""the detective is already dead,"" she sure is alive for at least half of it, maybe more. I mean I would obviously expect Siesta to be present throughout the series, she is the best character out of the ones available, and the show would be strange if she didn\'t show up. This does not mean that the entire middle portion of the show should be set up in the past before she died. It\'s not really a problem, but it is sort of strange. The plot itself is quite a mess, with it both being super generic AND incredibly bizarre. The main villain is the super generic evil shadow organization SPES, who make fancy android parts that can do weird things. It\'s like the Ex-Arms from Ex-Arm except less cool (if anybody else actually watched that train wreck from winter 2020). The cronies sent by this organization are just as generic and uninteresting, with there being little of note to say about them. As for the bizarre, its time to talk about the twist.The main plot twist and element of the climax is one of the worst twists I have ever seen. It comes completely out of left field, and was so incredibly outlandish that I started laughing. Having ""out there"" plot developments are fine, I recently watched Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 part 2, which also has a crazy plot twist, and loved it. The major difference is the setup and preparation, the reveal in Shingeki no Kyojin is supported by clues given throughout the previous seasons, fits in place with the rest of the story, and was properly built and hyped up throughout the previous seasons. So when the crazy reveal happened, it didn\'t feel super out of place or outlandish, just really awesome. Tantei fails at this miserably, with its reveal not being set up with many clues, being built upon information and rules of the world that are not explained until during the reveal, and it never even being alluded to that such a twist would happen. And on top of all that, it\'s full of plot holes! So what is this twist? Well for that I\'m going to have to get into spoiler territory, so...[SPOILERS]The big twist is that Siesta, the detective that Kimizuka was a sidekick for, Hel, the main villain of the flashback sections, Alicia, a random amnesiac girl that Siesta and Kimi come across during their travels, and Natsunagi, a girl who received Siesta\'s heart in a transplant surgery who ends up becoming the next legendary dective, are all sort of the same character. The jist of it is that Alicia and Hel are sort of a split personality, with them sometimes fighting for control over their body by suppressing the other. But since Hel is the dominant consciousness (or something like that, I forget if it was even explained why, and I don\'t want to go back and check), Alicia doesn\'t have any memories when she finally gains control for a short period when she meets Siesta and Kimi. So these two characters are the same person, awesome. Siesta is the next one to be added to the mix when she dies in a fight against Hel, who takes her heart and plants it in her own body, which prompts Siesta\'s consciousness to take over her body. She then sacrifices herself to suppress Hel and give control to Alicia, who won\'t have any memories, but will be able to live their own life. It is then revealed that Natsunagi is actually this Alicia after she was given control over her body.There are so many things that are bad about this twist. First of all it is never really alluded to or anything like that, the best thing you get is a symbolic shot in the ED. This is of course barring the original Hel/Alicia part, because that was the subject of a whole arc of the show. Other than that there really isn\'t much. This reveal is also not built upon pre-established rules either, I had no idea you could invade somebody\'s consciousness ad take over their body until this reveal told me. Because of these combined factors, this reveal ends up just feeling absurd. It also doesn\'t hold up very well logically, they do give an explanation for why kimi doesn\'t remember any of this until the climax of the show with some magic amnesia gas they talked about in the first or second episode. The main problem is what this means for Natsunagi\'s backstory, she is supposed to have had no memories once Siesta gave her control of Hel/Alicia\'s body, yet there is no mention of anything like that at any point in the show. She acts as if she has memories of a childhood, and parents, and a life in general, despite the fact that she came into existence 1 year ago with absolutely no connections. Also, why didn\'t SPES just capture her once Siesta handed over control? There are some other problems but I\'ve gone on about this twist for far too long and should get on to wrapping up my review.[SPOILERS END]So on to characters. Most are either generic nothings or just suck. The show has about 5 important characters, which I\'ll rate from worst to best. Saikawa has a really annoying voice and doesn\'t get enough screen time to really warrant her existence outside of the arc focusing on her. Next is Char, who is just the definition of a ""nothing"" character. I barely remember her, firstly because of her forgettable personality, but also because of her limited screen time. Then I\'d say its Kimi, who is a pretty average pessimistic good guy MC, nothing special. Natsunagi is a pretty typical tsundere character, and Siesta is a toned down tsundere but with a bunch of smarts. The biggest problem with the cast is that except for Kimizuka and Siesta, none of the other characters are developed nearly as much as they should have been, which is a big problem if your anime is largely dialogue. I\'ll also bring back the trying-to-be-Monogatari thing up again, with it being pretty true as far as characters go. They both share quite a few similarities (there\'s even a joke about him being a lolicon) and have similar personalities if you strip away most of the external stuff. The big difference is that Araragi is a funny character, and is built up and developed throughout the series, and is one of the many machines in Monogatari that dispense that amazing dialogue.So in short: Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru is at times a bad Monogatari clone, but is always a poorly animated show with bad music, bad characters, and a worse story. have absolutely no music playing, which just made them feel even worse. The one track I did at least sort of like was Siesta\'s theme, which was a nice little music box melody. Nothing fantastic or revolutionary, but it sounded nice.

That’s a more appropriate name for this series. Fans of the light novel who came to watch the anime adaptation have likely not enjoyed this, and for anime only watchers, clearly this show has taken a nosedive, as we see the score dropping on MAL as we speak. Very much a disappointment for the mystery genre.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Comedic/Romance themes /20*Slight spoilers aheadSTORY: 6.5/25Usually I’m not very harsh in giving scores, but there were definitely some irredeemable qualities (especially the second half of the show), that just...turned me off. The episode where Siesta meets her demise, as the title indicates, was extremely anticlimactic as the character development was just simply not there for basically the whole show, so the death scene was executed extremely poorly, and I’d give the show a better score if that scene was executed better. Furthermore, with this title “The Detective Is Already Dead”, the show would have had to blow me away with how the detective died in order for it to be good, but instead, half the show is a flashback, that we know the result to, which was not very fun at all. In the end, we wonder if the detective was even dead at all, as there was a lot of flip flopping and wishy washiness around her death, like geez pick a plot, is she gone, or not??? The genres in this show include Mystery, Comedy, Drama, Romance, and this show does not show these genres effectively. The fact that the audience is never really able to guess the “mysteries”, and with random events like the robot scene, it just feels like a huge mess of who knows what. Also, there are plenty of loose ends, like Saikawa’s eye, what SPES really even is, and their motives, and just a lot more if you think about it. This was a classic “blow all the budget in Episode 1” story.ART: 6.8/10Episode 1’s art was fun to watch, but it went downhill from there. There were even some scenes that had shots that looked identical to another scene, it was like a copy and paste.MUSIC: 7.3/10Decent opening and ending, but quite forgettable. That doesn’t mean it’s terrible at all, it’s just a regular 7/10 from me.CHARACTERS: 3.0/20Easily the worst part about this show was the lack of character development. For a show to be successful, and to elicit an emotional response from the audience, the show must find a way to make us feel an emotional attachment to the characters, and the fact when Siesta died, I didn’t feel a thing, that was a sign that they botched the scene completely. I heard from some light novel readers that they skipped a bunch of dialogue that was important to the scene, and that to me is just unfortunate. Furthermore, the romance is this show is also executed poorly, as it becomes some sort of confused harem-like situation with not much of a reason behind each romance. Honestly, I’d give a higher score to characters in a slice of life anime who do basically nothing, because there were just so many irredeemable qualities in this show. For a show to have good characters, they each must have a purpose, and with characters like Fuubi, or Charlotte, they really didn’t have much of one.ENJOYMENT: 5.0/15Fell off during the second half of the show.COMEDIC/ROMANTIC THEMES: 6.0/20Sadly, both the comedic and romantic themes were not up to par. The romance got very forced and felt unreasonable.OVERALL: 3.46/10I was skeptical of the title at first, and at the end of the day, was the detective even dead in the story? Honestly, before Episode 9, this show was between a 6 or a 7, but after that, the dialogue and the fights got worse and worse, and the wishy washiness of Siesta’s death just did not sit well with me. A very hyped show before the season began, sadly ends up as a contender for disappointment of the season.*I did like Siesta as a character a little bit, not gonna lie :) “Baka ka, Kimi wa” turned me off.

I seriously had high hopes for this as someone said it\'s gonna be some id invaded level pyscho and it turns out to be the biggest disappointment this season. Well ep 1 was good not that good that I anticipated but yeah it was better than the whole anime. Now I have seen many people are liking that anime but for me it was nothing special and as more episodes came it just became more and more...boring. First of all what tf with that explanation they didn\'t explained anything. It was just like detective is genius she knew everything from the beginning. Dude atleast tell us how she knew. And then they made some organisation and that story is a side plot their most focus is on creating a harem for a protagonist. And then sometimes they make something too much non sensible that it just doesn\'t make sense. First of all that girl has detective\'s heart so thats why she felt attractive towards him and then later in the show it gets revealed that in that one girl their are some four other girls residing. Who can change side whenever they want. That\'s just gets super annoying if you\'re doing something atleast explain it clearly. And when they found episodes were getting boring they introduced lolis cuz that\'s how ladies and gentlemen you make a show interesting.Now animation and art were just amazing coming from a no name studio it was a shock but it\'s just they wasted money on some average show. That anime doesn\'t deserve the budget it got.Now the music was also A tier it did it\'s job fantastically both op and ed are worth not skipping but again you also need a good story.If you\'re into those ""my waifu your waifu"" ""or my loli your loli"" type of shows this anime is specially made for you boring.

It is not an anime I anticipate watching weekly but it is one that I enjoy as I wait for the next episode of the ones that I am waiting for.  It\'s a detective story with a slight twist.The Story line is decent and easy to follow.The art and sound are consistent for what is standard in todays anime.The main character seems to abruptly change going from being ""Watson"" (bumbling sidekick) to Holmes (ace detective)  The anime seems to skip out on that transitioning period.  It gives small glimpses into it but so far not...a true showing of that growth.The other characters are more than just side notes but are not as interesting.

I nearly stopped halfway through for that reason. It's sad cuz the storyline wasn't too bad and the art is very good.  The MC was a pretty interesting character in the beginning but he turned into a simp so quickly. I guess it's supposed to be harem-esque but it's not my cup of tea. The dialogue was so hard to get through and the twists and turns they revealed were not surprising in the least. Siesta was the reason I...kept pulling through because I thought she was an interesting character but there's only so many boob/buttshots I can handle.

Maybe a phycological thriller with fantasy elements. The synopsis even adds to this making you think that it really will be so. And yet the cover doesn't match this presumption in the slightest. Something is wrong here, I can feel it.It's as you would've guessed from the cover. A slice of life kind of show about the main character getting into trouble with detective stuff long after his partner is crime has perished. So far, the plot is something that would be no different whether...Siesta was dead or not. Two high schoolers solving mysteries and dealing with bad guys along the way with the heroine falling for the MC along the way. In a sense it's a convoluted form of a romcom.All of this is ignoring one thing that really bugs me. The whole show makes Siesta out to be the main character, the main heroine of the anime and yet is explicitly states that she is already dead, heck even the title is telling you, and yet most of the character's development is based around her and not themselves. It makes it seem like their all just another aspect of Siesta and not their own individual people.Well if you take all this out and just watch it regardless.

The main difference is the 2 clips and a cross and 3 clips hairpin in the same place as each other. Personally, that is fine, people look like each other.The story itself is clear to me for the older audiences because it has a deep story that does a slapdash action sequence around it. It is however full of holes and not constructed as well...as the LN. Typical drama.The art style is a good standard, people saying it's bad to need to really pay attention to other shows.

They are a bit soulless since I think the show knows that chance of renewal is low so they rushed development a bit. When it is great it's great when it's not it's not.Honestly, for me in the end the show is fine, it had more potential than it gave out but it is by far nowhere as bad as some make it out to be.

I understood what was happening, but still plot points felt so random. The evil organization almost felt mysterious, but in reality it’s not menacing at all, and I could not care less about it.The animation was amazing, although I have seen better. Lots of the effort went to making the female characters look...and sound like waifu materials.The only two characters that was decently done are Siesta and the sidekick.

One of the side characters randomly appeared in an early episode, and it was only until the last episode that her name was mentioned.Overall, despite the good animation and interesting lead female character, the plot was too convenient and convoluted for me to care.

It follows Siesta and Kimizuka as they travel the world to solve mysteries regarding abnormal humans preceding Siesta\'s death (and yes, she dies, but it\'s not a spoiler because it\'s literally the premise of the show) and Kimizuka\'s life after Siesta\'s death.Most of the mysteries in this show are not your orthodox ""whodunnit"" type you\'d find in Sherlock Holmes or Detective Conan, but the show did a good job of making the audience feel something\'s not right and dropping sufficient hints for the audience to figure out themselves what\'s...not right and why it is so. It also did a good job of connecting the dots; no questions were left unanswered except some that of course would be more appropriate to be answered in a sequel or the light novel--or even left unanswered as they are not the point of the show. Rather than focusing on Siesta and Kimi\'s external conflict with the abnormal humans, the point of this anime is the philosophical conflict between Siesta\'s professionalism and Kimi\'s love as the two build a closer and closer relationship.The animation is a bit sloppy, that\'s why many people regard this anime as bad. But I think the art and animation are decent at worst, and that\'s enough for me. I came here to enjoy the story of the circumstances surrounding the detective Siesta\'s death, and the story did a good job of that. I can settle with decent art and animation. Of course, it\'s good if an anime has good animation, but anyone who judges an anime only by its art and animation would be disappointed by anything that\'s not as eye-pleasing as Your Name, Demon Slayer, Violet Evergarden, or the likes. This show also has good moments, namely the fight in the first episode and that one scene in episode 12 (which I won\'t explicitly say because it might lead to spoilers, but I think anyone who have watched this til the end know what I\'m referring to).The characters are good. Each have their own goals and disbeliefs about themselves or the world that induce conflicts between characters. This show follows principles of character making and conflict building well, and also ties to a good resolve for each of the characters that leads to character developments. I also particularly like the difference in maturity between past and present Kimizuka. Expect some cheesy dialogues, because that\'s what you get from shounen animes.Overall, I give this anime an 8/10. I enjoyed it: laughed at the comedy, had fun picking up clues and arriving at solutions to the mystery, and cried during the last moments of Siesta. This show reminds me of I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, where the heroine\'s death is the premise of the show and yet they did a nice buildup that when the time finally comes, it hits hard. Ultimately, this is a story about moving on after the death of a dear person, being content with your own identity, and fulfilling what you have set to do at the beginning--even if it means sacrificing things precious to you.FAQsQ : Is this anime overhyped?A : I watched this anime three to four months after it first aired so I don\'t know much about the hype it got.Q : Should I watch this anime?A : All depends. If you\'re one of those people who only settle for state-of-the-art visuals and think anything that doesn\'t fit the standard of Makoto Shinkai\'s works (note the exaggeration) is not worth watching, then skip this anime. If you want to enjoy a romcom with emotional punches here and there, then absolutely watch this anime. not right and why it is so. It also did a good job of connecting the dots; no questions were left unanswered except some that of course would be more appropriate to be answered in a sequel or the light novel--or even left unanswered as they are not the point of the show. Rather than focusing on Siesta and Kimi\'s external conflict with the abnormal humans, the point of this anime is the philosophical conflict between Siesta\'s professionalism and Kimi\'s love as the two build a closer and closer relationship.The animation is a bit sloppy, that\'s why many people regard this anime as bad. But I think the art and animation are decent at worst, and that\'s enough for me. I came here to enjoy the story of the circumstances surrounding the detective Siesta\'s death, and the story did a good job of that. I can settle with decent art and animation. Of course, it\'s good if an anime has good animation, but anyone who judges an anime only by its art and animation would be disappointed by anything that\'s not as eye-pleasing as Your Name, Demon Slayer, Violet Evergarden, or the likes.

Gotta write this review so I don't need to pent-up my anger. So far this is the worst anime I watch throughout the 2-year period of this pandemic (and I've watched TONS of them). That's how bad this one is.I'm a huge mystery fan so to see this poor-written, illogical plot is such a disappointment. I mean it kinda had potential at the very first episode, but then everything just went downhill. Not to mention, why is there's no Harem tag for this anime? I would have avoided this at all cost if...I have known this is one of the fan-services-that-full-of-cliches animes (This is such a disadvantage of my no-drop policy).There is literally no character development until the very last episode when MC decided to carry on the mission that Siesta assigned him (and live happily forever after with his waifus as well I suppose ._.) Almost all characters are so plain and shallow-minded/one-sided (I do gotta say I enjoyed the Holmes-ness in Siesta and her amazing strength tho, she's the only one that seems to be more outstanding than others)To sum this up, I think I'm being generous giving this one a 3.

I don't know what they were trying to do, maybe they were rushing the story or something (crazy rushing!), but they totally skipped like half the case and u have i had no idea what was going on, they literally skipped a whole...episode.

I do not care. I am not wearing the yellow flannel for this one. I think that this show could've been really fascinating. The first episode was probably one of the greatest first episodes of an anime I've ever seen. It's a 50 minute long special of just butt fuck stupidity and anime cliches in one beautifully rolled burrito. It had a good twist that really set up the show for something great but it definitely fell off. I think it was interesting to introduce Nagisa in the way that the show did, but the whole arc where they have to...rescue an idol just really didn't sit right with me. It was long, out of the way, and blocking the real important question that we wanted answered. I understand the show wanted to delay that reveal of how the detective actually died but the recruitment of a fucking kid to stop the organization feels like a very empty setup for a second season. The entire concept of the show simply can't be stretched into a 12 episode season, nonetheless, two 12 episode seasons without falling off somewhere. I think this show would work best in 4 episodes honestly. It could've been a masterpiece if they just had it end relatively quick. The ending of the season reveals how the detective dies and Siesta is just like okay you guys need to stop the organization that killed me because yes, but I'm also still watching over you literally because I'm a fucking demon or whatever. I could literally do it myself because I have level 1000 plot armor but I want to see you dumb schmucks try to figure it out. The ending of season 1 heavily implies a second season, but there simply isn't enough content in the detective already being dead. I truly want to love this show. I think that the concept is wonderful, the OP/ED are perfection, the world is interesting and the art looks really nice in some scenes but I really can't bring myself to like it. It just has cute girls doing ridiculous fucking shit which is funny sometimes but not funny when you have to watch 12 episodes to wait for a funny scene. This show is like if a pretty girl farted in my face. I'd want to like it because she's pretty but it's still a fart. The characters are cute but they are so fucking boring. Nagisa looks like Uni from Hyperdimension Neptunia but that's really the only thing I like about her. She is the weirdest tsundere ever because the show can't morally have her liking Kimi. But they probably will anyways because the detective is already dead!!! Anything is possible when the detective is already dead. Fuck man!

This time around, he is given a suitcase and is somehow forced to smuggle a suitcase onto a plane. Once he is on the plane a stewardess is promenading around the plane, and looking for a detective on board. During...this time we are introduced to our female main character Siesta that is a ""legendary"" detective, who chooses to appoint our main character as her sidekick because of him being a magnet to trouble. Now as our protagonist is brought into the pilots cabin, we have a dude named Bat that hijacked the plane and is offering to surrender if the detective figures out why he hijacked it in the first place. And basically our detective ""figures out"" that he was forced to hijack the plane and crash it killing himself with it, but the reason why he looked for a detective was because he was afraid of dying and his pride wouldn\'t let him be beaten by anything other than a great detective. After Siesta figures that much out, Bat gets pissed off and decides to reveal himself as a part android with a tentacle ear and tries to kill Siesta, Kimihiko luckily guesses that the suitcase he was forced to smuggle had a firearm and tossed it to Siesta after a bout of fighting in order to gain her the victory. Then after sparing the life of Bat, he decides to try to kill her again, but unsurprisingly the bullet she used was magically infused with her blood and that protects her from being harmed by whom she shot. After this incident, we find out that the detective Siesta knew the hijack was going to happen and knew that guy was an android, she even apparently forced our protagonist to smuggle her gun onboard.Now, even this 10-minute beginning sequence, we already have tons of plot holes. Is being a magnet for trouble a supernatural ability, or is this just a string of coincidences, how does this make Kimihiko a valid sidekick for Siesta? How was the protagonist actually forced to smuggle the weapon on a plane, and how wasn\'t it discovered, all we saw was him being pulled into a car by some dudes, he could have easily just given himself in to the airport security? Why did Siesta even decide it was a good idea to let this android on a plane if she already knew who he was, and she already seemingly has connections (for example those dudes that forced Kimihiko to smuggle a gun), she is clearly allied with the government or some other organisation and could have prevented the android even getting on to the plane and risking the lives of hundreds of people?After this, there is another ""mystery"" solved during the episode at a school. But this time, for whatever reason we are also interrupted by some other nonsensical occurences such as Kimihiko and Siesta literally PUTTING ON A COSPLAY in the middle of chasing a guy in a pink bunny suit. These things are meant to be comedical as far as I understand, but it was far from anything I might consider calling funny.The pacing of this show is also pretty strange, as literally the next episode we find out that Siesta is dead, after Kimihiko had been her sidekick for three years, none of which we had even gotten a glimpse of, rendering the event devoid of any meaning or substance as we had gotten only 40 minutes with Siesta. Also, this episode Kimihiko is approached by a girl (she believes he is a legendary detective because ""his"" feats were published in newspapers for some reason) that claims that her heart is searching for someone and she can\'t shake it ever since she had gotten a heart transplant (fair enough). Kimihiko uses ""his connection"" with the police to basically walk into a maximum security prison where Bat is housed to ask whether he can recognize the sound of her heartbeat. Unsurprisingly, the heart of the girl had apparently been previously Siesta\'s, which also raises questions, didn\'t Kimihiko know she had transplanted her heart to someone? To prove that this is Siesta\'s heart, Bat uses his tentacle to try and strike the new girl (Natsunagi) and his tentacle desintegrates, this is also pretty ridiculous since I would assume the prison knows this guy can grow tentacles out of his ear, so why is he only protected by bars? After finding this out, Natsunagi decides that she wants to be a detective because her heart wants to, although she doesn\'t have any sort of qualification whatsoever to hold such a position, are all the skills and knowledge of how to be a detective also given to her through the heart she got transplanted??Over all the story really doesn\'t bring anything interesting and hasn\'t piqued my interest with the Oregairu-like problems Kimihiko is currently being approached with, and the comedy aspect of the show also does not hold anything comical within itself.Art: 8I have no problems with the art, the characters are well designed although the MC looks quite generic. And the action sequences are pretty well choreographed.Sound: 6The sound doesn\'t have anything spectacular about it, but nor does it have anything special going for it. Personally I found the voice and tone of Kimihiko to be somewhat unconvincing at some moments, but there isn\'t anything abhorrent about it either.Characters: 4The characters are incredibly generic and one-dimensional, with basically nothing going for them, the decisions that are made and the paths they take to handle things (such as Siesta and Bat) are at times confusing and seemingly baseless, I have mostly discussed this in the story part of my review.Enjoyment: 2Although the first episode started off somewhat promising and intruiging to me as a mystery anime, but all of this was gone with the lackluster decisions that were made by Siesta who apparently knew everything that was going on all of the time. Right off the bat you\'re able to solve the mystery, or at least come up with a logical solution. Once again this proved to me that the art can only carry an anime so far.Overall: 4This anime overall is currently a pretty big letdown for me, as when I first saw it I hoped it would be something to be intriguing, but the many plot holes that ensued right from the get go mostly ruined my hopes for it being what I thought it would and I feel like I already know where the story will go without me having to watch it.

Thats usually the case, but it dosen't apply to this show. The first few episodes, i genunely enjoyed and thought the concept was interisting, also no harem was a plus point. It started to really go downhill when-Interactions between the characters feel forced.-Nagisa (the main 'FMC' of the show) tries to hard to replace siesta or...whatever when she clearly couldnt.

I found him to be amassive hypocrite and made the show much less enjoyable.All in all, if i was felling generous i would rate this a max 3/10 .

Also pls. These are just some spoilers if you haven’t seen it, especially If you’re planning to watch this shit on YouTube Muse Asia.Story is very boring at times. This just reminds me of Bo2’s campaign because they integrate both past and present , but frank does tell a story. However, it’s not really that boring, it can be fun for Bo2. While this anime just showcase the what happen to Siesta before she died, just like what the title says. It’s horrific...to spoil the anime by just putting a generic anime title in it, because it feels dull and unattractive. The only time this is at least good is the fighting scenes like encountering Cerberus, Hel, Chameleon and Koumori. However among those four, Chameleon, is the only acceptable enemy I would see when it comes to intimidation and aggression, the second is Hel (Ep 6), but as for her, it just gets boring in ep 9 and 12. While the rest are just only dialogue and small intimidating fights. There’s even some shitty harem on-going. Other than that, there were even Unsolved scenes that just questioned my existence. For example, how did Siesta became a detective? To whom did he/she inspired Siesta? Who inspired Kimizuka to become a detective before he me Siesta? Did Kimizuka inspire Siesta to be like a detective? If you’re gonna be seeing these questions, prove it to me by posting them in the manga. I dont really see the comedy right there, the only comedy I see is in Ep 8 where Kimizuka makes fun of Alicia in the infirmary, or Siesta making fun of Kimizuka, but again, this looks uncomfortable and it’s actually illegal (About the Alicia part). Unless you’re in an anime world, there’s no logic behind it.This wat i only like about this anime. I like it’s art style, on-par with other animes. No hate there.Sound is a mix of good and bad. The good part there is the opening and ending of this anime. Very emotional and very satisfying. As for the anime background sounds, they’re just pretty mediocre AF and unsettling. I would only consider some funny background sounds like the part used in the scene where Siesta tries to inject Kimizuka so he’ll forget what happened.IDK what to say for the characters. Siesta is really that overrated. People seeing her, their S++ Tier WaiFu or Siesta tier waifu. Ok, just stop with the “SiEsTA iS mAh beAuTiFul WaiFu” because this killed my brain, and i keep fucking look at other short bob white hair girls that looks like fucking Siesta like Tobichii from Date a Live and Elaina from Majo no Tabitabi (Ep 8). I get that she’s beautiful and all, but this is going way too far for me and I keep fucking insane hearing this. Not jealous, but they’re just everywhere. EVERYWHERE. Going away with that, Kimizuka is probably the only acceptable detective around, but pitifully weak. Natsunagi same problem as Siesta, but isn’t attractive as she looks, and adds some Nino personality. Not gonna complain about people hearing about Natsunagi since she’s not popular amongst anime lovers or manga/light novel readers. All i say is that you care beauty over brains.The only episodes I would consider them as a gem IMO, would be Episode 1, 5, 6, 9, and 12. They perform better than some episodes that get the least recognition. Also, would you stop with some episodes that you like to see Siesta being lewded like Ep 7 for example. It’s uncomfortable and unsettling to my eyes and ears.This anime falls off when it comes to Comedy, combat and romance and cannot be in the same tier as some other animes. I don’t care if you watch this because this is your problem and not mine. If you want an anime that has some similar aspects like this, having the looks of Siesta, Sci-Fi, romance, comedy and action, then go and travel to “Date-a-Live”. Consists of 3 seasons and there is even a season 4 next year.Same complains as me? Join me at my funeral! to spoil the anime by just putting a generic anime title in it, because it feels dull and unattractive. The only time this is at least good is the fighting scenes like encountering Cerberus, Hel, Chameleon and Koumori. However among those four, Chameleon, is the only acceptable enemy I would see when it comes to intimidation and aggression, the second is Hel (Ep 6), but as for her, it just gets boring in ep 9 and 12. While the rest are just only dialogue and small intimidating fights. There’s even some shitty harem on-going. Other than that, there were even Unsolved scenes that just questioned my existence.

Well, to me it was bad enough that I can\'t even erase the monstrosity that was forged into a string of episodes. It was so bad that I\'m even writing my first review in the 13 years I\'ve used MAL. I can\'t take back the time I lost for this anime so I\'ll write a review to make up for that.Poorly written episodes and terrible dialogues, not to mention most of the series was just dialogue with nothing significant actually said.The plot was a mess and all over the place. Sure it tied in very messily at...the end which they tried to ""tie it up with a pretty red ribbon"", kinda literally, but it was in no way redeemable by the end. Nothing flowed well as it kept going back and forth from past to present. Poor attempts in creating mystery and villains that didn\'t fit the anime just made it even more confusing and was laughable when posing them as ""the enemy"". Nothing ever made sense.I tried to give points to the anime based on a few side characters who were cute or actually served a purpose other than plot relevance and their aesthetic was actually decent. But even then, they can\'t save the anime alone. Nothing can.Gosh, if you think this review is bad, it\'s because the anime was bad and I still can\'t grasp my head around its ""wtf-ery"".This anime wasn\'t even worthy of waifu-bait because the main characters were terrible.

The title of the show spoils the show. The arcs are too long and useless. I watched the entire show on 2x speed because of how boring the show is and how it goes on and on about things that make no sense. Waste of time. Seriously. I wish I had never watched this show. Be wary, don't make the same mistake. Although, I really liked Siesta's character.

If the anime adapted the LN faithfully with the majority of the elements shown then unfortunately the comments will then reflect the LN rather than the anime whereas the anime itself would then be rated higher since they were only adapting from the original material. However, if the anime was not faithful to the original material then you can take this review as more of a rough guideline of what the anime was missing that the LN does have.Story: The story and the...title of the anime implies that the detective had a major influence on the characters around her before her death which included the main character (MC) and (possibly) other characters that we will see throughout the anime. Alternatively, (and this is what I thought) I believed it was a play on words as in the role of the ""detective"" has died in a metaphorical manner. Therefore, I was expecting the revival of the detective role either by the girl (if she faked her death) or by another person (possibly the MC) whilst the anime explains the importance and role of the detective and how vital the detective role is is for those around them. The irony was that I was half right. The story does try to focus on the part of the detective role and the importance of the detective to be alive since the crimes and the overarching enemy are still at large. However, the way it was executed was not suitable for a mystery genre especially when you have a detective and sidekick role. It is more accurate to say it was less of a mystery genre and more of a supernatural genre that so happens needs a detective character to make the story work (similar to Neuro: Supernatural Detective).The importance of a mystery genre is the setup and exposition where the information presented is picked up by both the viewer and characters, this is known as presenting the necessary clues. As such, the clues available to the viewer and the characters should be enough to deduce the answer to the mystery by answering the fundamental three questions: What, How, and Why? I am sure you realised that what I just described was the basics of detective stories where a detective tries to answer these three questions. Of course, I am not arguing all mystery shows need to have all three questions answered but at least you need to answer the why question since a mystery is called a mystery since it has unknown causes where the focus of the story is to figure those unknown causes out. Those who are more familiarised with the genre can argue that I was describing the Knox Commandments and/or Van Dine rules (which you are not wrong but they are a little more technical and strictly not necessary for all mystery genres). However, the anime does not portray a single clue or information that allows us to solve the mystery (or in this context ""cases""), and yet the detective in the story can solve the mystery despite the lack of clues. This should make the viewer seem impressed by her feats, but this is not the case which lies in me being half wrong. The anime tries to impress you that there is a character that can resolve cases before the cases actually happen and the explanation for such feats is that she has already kept tabs on the necessary people related to the case. However, this is no more than just a word of god (i.e. the author) just providing convenient excuses to make the character look impressive by providing convenient information outside the episode to say that the clues were there just were not presented in the episode (for an analogy it is similar to the MC being nearly defeated by the enemy with a sudden twist of the MC gaining enough power to defeat said enemy by the next instance just because the MC had a key item that he forgot he had without the audience knowing). The irony is that the detective girl is just a human person without using any supernatural phenomena to quickly gather information (Gosick takes advantage of this supernatural phenomenon which makes the detective in that anime more relatable), it is plainly her intuition, observation, and problem-solving skills that enable her to solve the case. This feat makes the MC impressed at her but ironically this makes me (and possibly other viewers) annoyed since it makes it too convenient and unbalanced as a character. As a result, this hampers the story dramatically since this ability enables the detective to always keep secrets from the viewer and we will never know why the enemy exists in the first place nor why she and the MC have to go against an enemy at all, as well as why the detective is necessary since the detective herself does not explain why she is doing it (it is implied it is in her nature but that is not enough to explain the whole story).The lack of exposition and information which the detective should be conveying is not being conveyed (for the most important part of the story at least) and then it starts to focus on a passing-on-the-torch style where the detective dies and the role must be passed down to someone. However, considering that the importance of the role of the detective was not conveyed nor the reason why we need a detective, to begin with, makes this whole story quite pointless and very redundant. Arguably, you can say that no one needs to be a detective. There was a lack of structure of the whole mystery and a lack of reasoning behind the role of the detective as such it becomes very confusing why these characters are crucial, to begin with.Character: The only good point about these characters is their two-faced natures which makes them interesting and fun to watch. Each character is two-faced since they are always hiding something from each other and they are willing to go against each other if it goes against their beliefs. Thus, you feel more related to them since you can understand they are not just blindingly following each other and obeying each other for simple reasons as devotion, love, etc. It is more on the build-up of trust despite their different beliefs and personalities they can still work together and trust each other. However, the main issue with these characters is their age and their capabilities (especially the detective).First of all the story starts in middle school where the MC (despite looking like a highschooler) interacts with the detective girl during middle school and then all of a sudden you are told that three years have gone by (by the second episode) where he is now in high school, but during those three years, he went on many adventures with the detective girl. (You can argue it is just as ridiculous as Conan understanding many expert fields, like knowing how to ride a plane, during his middle school years). It feels very out of place for him to be in high school let alone to be in education it would make more sense for him to be a young adult that just graduated college or high school. The MC\'s personality and behaviour match those of an adult rather than a high school student. Furthermore, the banter he has with the female detective still works in adulthood rather than high school, considering how mature both of them are. The other characters that we interact with only highlight the relationship between the MC and the female detective despite their interesting qualities being only relevant for a short period of time. The characters that are meant to be the enemy could have been more interesting if we had a better idea of what their collective motive was. I am assuming that this is still too early in the LN and this would be explored later but as far as we can tell it seems that all they want to do is to cause havoc which sounds pretty weak for needing an organisation. Lastly, the girl\'s capability as a detective just rubs me off the wrong way since it appears that she is always one step ahead in the game but it just seems to be convenient excuses to make her sound impressive. I would let it slide if there was a valid explanation about her thought process on how she got the answer very quickly but consistently pulling out convenient clues and information at the right time just makes it sound like she has clairvoyance, which implies she doesn\'t. It is difficult to relate to her and the fact that she has an importance in the story does not convey properly since her personality and attitude make her seem all-knowing and a lack of her background makes it even more difficult to relate to her as to why she is who she is.Art and Sound: The animation was very enjoyable and high quality where each character looked lively. The sound was interesting where it has some nice OST\'s with the OP and ED being mediocre.Overall: I am more confused than informed about this anime. It is clear that it is talking about how the MC needs to keep the will of the detective alive but the way the story executes the detective role is lackluster and confusing since (after watching 12 episodes) I still have no idea what the importance/ plot of the detective is. Furthermore, the lack of knowing what the enemy is and what their main goal is is left in the air as well as the execution of the mystery genre makes it less of a mystery and more of a plot device. I would say compared to other mystery genres like Umineko and Hyouka this mystery cannot be categorised as a mystery since I (as the audience) cannot even comprehend how the detective girl can even reach some of these conclusions. The only mystery I did solve was when the MC tried to figure out a mystery related to an idol girl\'s request but instead of following clues, it was more along the lines of expectation by predicting that there is a twist to this mystery rather than actual clues lying around (which there weren\'t any). I will put it this way compared to Hyouka where there were clues presented it was actually possible to resolve the mystery without waiting for the answer but the twists are in the whydunit? Since, in the end, the reason for causing the mystery is always different and personal to the culprit. However, this series does not have such concepts making it more difficult to understand why the mystery is there and (again) the reason for a detective to be necessary. title of the anime implies that the detective had a major influence on the characters around her before her death which included the main character (MC) and (possibly) other characters that we will see throughout the anime.

The story felt very unrealistic and just didn't flow well, there were different timelines mixed together and it got really hard to properly follow, the plot elements felt really random too and it was much less about detective work and felt more about just boring supernatural elements.The characters themselves weren't terrible even though Siesta definitely felt like waifu-bait, but the dynamics between them all felt...really forced and unnatural. It's like this show was trying to be Monogatari but without any of the charm and much less smart which was a bit annoying to watch.Overall I don't particularly think this show is worth watching, it was just pretty boring and unbelievable plot-wise and the characters weren't strong enough to save it nor were any of the other evelemts. really forced and unnatural.

The artwork, animation, and music are stunning. The premise is definitely interesting from the beginning, but it failed to keep everything coherent.

There wasn\'t any focus at all, it\'s hard to feel anything, I barely even have any feel for Siesta at all, which the show mostly focused on.I can\'t say I\'m wholly disappointed; the beginning is definitely interesting, emotional, and...epic, and the end feels somewhat satisfying. However, the entire mid-story is bland, as all of the lore and build-up lies in there.

It's not something extraordinary, considering it also incorporates similar tactics that are also common...in the mystery genre (i.e. plot twists & red herring). The mixing overall could use a bit of tweaking, as I feel sometimes that there are points where the background is overpowering or not sufficient enough in relation to the character voices.Overall, the original written adaptation is not very well known so the anime has some baggage to carry. Most certainly there are some flaws that can be seen with the episodes that have aired at the time of this writing, but hopefully there would be some improvements along the way that would keep the series still enticing to returning viewers or be able to pull in new ones. in the mystery genre (i.e. plot twists & red herring).

The ending is almost the same too: when Zero Two and Hiro dies they met each...other, and it even writes that ""and the new story begins"" or something like that, it\'s still the same when Nagisa and the sidekick sat at the bar in the ship when an announcement came: ""Is there a detective on the board"", and the story is continuing, I think you get it.I don\'t know, I have the same vibes other, and it even writes that ""and the new story begins"" or something like that, it\'s still the same when Nagisa and the sidekick sat at the bar in the ship when an announcement came: ""Is there a detective on the board"", and the story is continuing, I think you get it.I don\'t know, I have the same vibes', ""This is a series that will be on my mind for quite a while. A very peculiar series. I thoroughly enjoyed that it had a certain calmer atmosphere and wasn't as flashy as many others. They had a very interesting method of storytelling. They weren't linear, but it was played off really seamlessly.Truth be told, the fight scenes were interesting but nothing spectacular. Although they seemed to have a limited number of tracks to play in the background, I was pleasantly surprised by how delightful many scenes seemed in silence.I had two major annoyances with it. First, I did not enjoy how this was another...case of a (male) main character being bullied by their closest friend(s), and this somehow leading to a very close relationship. Second, although the series seemed to be surprisingly mature in a number of ways, many characters (for example Alice) ended up being childish too often. case of a (male) main character being bullied by their closest friend(s), and this somehow leading to a very close relationship.

I guess? But you never do.- Tries to be funny, but it isn\'t.- Main characters are a love interest, apparently, but they both compliment each other like water and fire. Not that it\'ll stop the writer from pretending they don\'t.- Has ""detective"" in title but there is hardly any detection going around. The hilariously named detective ""Siesta"" (falling asleep already) can solve anything using.. magic. I\'m guessing that\'s the case cause she plans ahead, before she even encountered a case.They tried to pass her off as Sherlock Holmes, but even Sherlock had to show up at the scene and do some CSI shit, analyze the scene and decipher clues.This anime was written by someone who thought he could write a detective show, but failed at even basic world building. The premise of the detective dying is a failure as well. Hodgepodge of random monsters showing up, along with a mecha, doesn\'t help.TLDR; Let this anime die.1/10 - Still attracts ladies (usually underage).- We are supposed to identify with him.. I guess?

Toaru Ossan no VRMMO Katsudouki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54431/Toaru_Ossan_no_VRMMO_Katsudouki,"['To be quite frank, I never thought that I would actually leave a review for anything on this site, using it mainly just for informational purposes. However, after completing this show, I feel compelled to leave a review for it in an attempt to ward off anyone thinking it might be worthwhile to watch.It isn\'t. At all.It starts off mediocre and...fine. Unoffensive but lame.However, by the time the show ends, we have been subjected to the main character (called ""Earth"", in the game which serves as the shows main setting) being an absolutely unlikable mean-spirited jerk for almost the entire latter part of the show....He has basically no redeeming qualities as a person, and only his ""skill"", in the game is actually what makes people drawn to him. In reality, he\'s just thrust into relationships with people, and by his own admission would rather completely avoid them than work with them other than when it serves his own purposes, such as going through a dungeon or having things made for him.He happily uses powers bestowed to him by the Fairy Queen character of the game, but is largely extremely rude and ungrateful to her, at multiple points literally tying her up so that he can run away. His entire attitude towards the fairy NPCs is one of convenience, and they serve has nothing more than a means to an end for him despite them largely wanting nothing more than to help and support him because they are ""drawn to him"".He becomes ostensibly the game\'s first ""famous"" player, but then is under the impression that he can seriously walk around just going ""yeah you\'ve got the wrong guy"", when people see him. He was literally shown to every single player and seen by hundreds of players fighting in the tournament in which he battled the Fairy Queen. Other players started using bows simply because he used one in that fight. And yet he think he can just continue walking around thinking people won\'t recognize him? Seriously? Even though the player-base expands multiple times for reasons outside the game, that doesn\'t erase his reputation in it.If, while playing an MMO, I see the same player a few times while doing my thing, I will remember them. If they were literally famous in the game, I would definitely remember them and even tell other people that I saw them. It\'s the equivalent of seeing a streamer in-game, basically. He cannot escape the fact that he is well-known. And yet despite allegedly having years of experience playing MMOs and being almost 40 years old in real-life, he cannot comprehend this simple fact.The show tries to redeem Earth at points, but then is ultimately undermined almost immediately by him again being rude or at best standoffish to the characters who want nothing more than to spend time with and support him. As said above, his interactions with other players seem cordial enough on the surface, but in reality he only interacts with them to serve a purpose. Which, fair enough, plays in to his whole ""want to play alone"" nonsense. But that does nothing to endear him to the viewers of the show.To be quite honest, Earth alone is reason to completely avoid this show. The plot is entirely forgettable, but again unoffensive, even if multiple plot points are left almost entirely unexplained or abandoned. If Earth had been even remotely likable...it still wouldn\'t be worth watching considering just how many good shows exist. But at least it wouldn\'t have left me with such a sour taste in my mouth. As it is, I am borderline angry with myself that I wasted my time watching this.I doubt that it will, but I swear if this show gets another season I\'m going to be extremely frustrated when it takes a wonderful show like The Devil is a Part-Timer a literal decade to get a second season.It gets a 2/10 simply because the other characters are at least semi-likable and despite how much I hate how much time I wasted watching it I don\'t really feel comfortable giving anything a 1/10 because I think everything has *some* redeeming qualities.

That\'s quite the sus motive.Yes, you heard me right. Novelist Shiina Howahowa started this work as a Syosetu title in January 2013, at the time when Reki Kawahara\'s Sword Art Online was taking off on its massive popularity, serving as the revival of the Isekai MMORPG genres, spawning works turned into anime, like Mamare Touno\'s Log Horizon. But you\'d have to be a...madman to realise that the author managed to come up with the LN, which, as of this review, is a massive 28 volumes long (WTF?), running at his or her own ""pace"" of what defines a ""unique"" VRMMO, but never having actually played a game for the most basic references. I\'m sorry, but that just does not fly, but other than the current juggernaut that is novelist Katarina\'s Shangri-La Frontier also airing this season (which is just overall better in every way), I\'d bet even ChatGPT could make a better story than this rather nonsensical BS plot.You might be tempted to think that this show reeks similarity to the Isekai and reincarnation themes, but it\'s not. It\'s just a VRMMO that\'s monitored by its engineers, then programmed through AI to suit the themes of its setting, which is where lands the real-life 38-year-old man by the name of Taichi Tanaka, to be portrayed in ""One More Free Life Online"" as a young boy named Earth. Yep, you\'re not squinting your eyes; he\'s literally called Earth. (Why the stupid generic name!?) The rather unassuming young boy, with a rather unrefined skill that once harnessed, becomes a rather ""unique"" skill that allows him to create better weapons, cook appetising food for the masses, and also gets him to befriend godlike entities like the Fairy Queen. I\'m just going to stop here because there is absolutely NOTHING that appeals to anyone about this show, even if studio Maho Film\'s anime adaptation came just about a decade too late. Not that anyone was thinking of adapting this (albeit with idiotic people thinking that this deserves an anime) and seeing it through as some production committee\'s ""free time"" to produce a subpar show that appeals to no one. (Hey, better use your resources for better shows).Speaking of Maho Film, over the course of the studio\'s 4 years of existence, they\'ve become the 3rd-rate junkyard studio for mediocre to bad Isekai and/or fantasy shows, and watching this show, you can really tell that it does not take debut director Yuuichi Nakazawa, series composer Touko Machida (which I consider to be one of, if not the worst screenwriters in anime), and the staff team much effort to produce this, which, come to think of it, is a rather good punching bag since better works are given to better studios to adapt, leaving new studios like Maho Film to ""create anime with magic"" of the BS kind.Everything from the lackluster ""Let\'s Play!"" playthrough sequence is just awful for both the story and its characters to the literate point of boredom, which, coupled with the rather mediocre production and music, just screams like everyone working on this is ""quite content"" with getting by with the lowest (not even the bare minimum) of talents. And it really shows: the show\'s potential that it will not get ANY better.Just do me a favour and make a hell of a skipping runaway from this show. The author clearly is warped by his or her own mindset, and if you take the plunge, you\'ll be the obvious clown of foolishness. madman to realise that the author managed to come up with the LN, which, as of this review, is a massive 28 volumes long (WTF?), running at his or her own ""pace"" of what defines a ""unique"" VRMMO, but never having actually played a game for the most basic references.

We are talking about people smelling, eating in-game food. The NPCs are also very advanced, making them feel like almost real characters. For example, the game allows people to have pets. But if the owners do not treat the pets nicely, the pets will refuse to cooperate with the owner. It even has kingdoms of different races, with their own politics going...on.All of this makes it feel more like an isekai than an actual MMO.

This is the story of a certain thirty-eight-year-old dude playing a light novel shovelware game written by someone who has clearly never played an MMO or witnessed the toxic carnage of an online multiplayer lobby.The light novel shovelware game fittingly called ""One More Free Life Online” is the playground for the certain dude’s avatar… “Earth”… no seriously, his character name is “Earth”…He decides to make an off-meta build as an archer who can craft healing potions and cook stat-buffing food and gets...bullied by other players for it… for some reason…  Just to be clear you can play as a mage who also uses long-range attacks so why anyone would be looked down upon for being an archer is beyond me. Anyway, because of a bunch of random patches made by the developers, Earth’s off-meta build gets him a lot of attention and things happen.Honestly, trying to explain this anime is giving me an aneurysm. It’s almost as if the author played Skyrim for an hour, saw a dragon flying backwards, thought it was the greatest game ever made and then tried to write a light novel series about it.The characters and writing are very baby’s first light novel. The characters talk like the actors playing upcoming release demos in Ubisoft/Activision-Blizzard E3 showcases rather than real gamers. Earth especially makes me cringe in my balls whenever he\'s facing a slightly higher-level monster and then states he’ll “use his thirty-eight years of experience” to defeat the monster… in a video game. Of course, it wouldn\'t be light novel shovelware if Earth didn’t have an increasing entourage of females, NPC or Player, wanting to jump his digital bone despite Earth having the personality of a piece of toilet paper.If there is one thing that I can give A Playthrough of a Certain Dude\'s VRMMO Life credit it’s for its in-depth crafting system which does look genuinely fun. Earth spends a ton of time crafting new bows, bombs and even bladed shoes to fight his play style. It seems the only limit is your imagination and the time spent needing to craft the equipment, but I would happily play around with this system for hours. Unfortunately, Earth seems to be the only player who uses this system and is ridiculed for his off-meta equipment by other players so it’s completely undermined.A Playthrough of a Certain Dude\'s VRMMO Life is another light novel show in story and presentation completely overshadowed by another VRMMO anime airing this season, Shangri-La Frontier which is a thousand times better.

And being honest, it really would be better as an Isekai, because the main character would have more of a reason to actually grind to get stronger.This is because he would need these abilities to actually survive, and as such would make more of a reason to your fight a opponents, plus the MC cannot cheap out with a respawn if something goes wrong, adding stakes into the mix.

And being honest, it really would be better as an Isekai, because the main character would have more of a reason to actually grind to get stronger.This is because he would need these abilities to actually survive, and as such would make more of a reason to your fight a opponents, plus the MC cannot cheap out with a respawn if something goes wrong, adding stakes into the mix.

Also, Sui is adorable AF unlike PikashaKami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko - MC is restarting his life and enjoying the things he do, never complains and is very modest.Isekai Nonbiri Nouka - MCs obliviousness is Cute while Earth’s Obliviousness is somewhat an annoying trait.To make the long story short, this anime has rude attitude MC, complains about events, Rude to Heroine, acts friendly but is fed up when people coddles up to him afterwards.

Axe body spray and unwashed gym clothes? Flat Mountain Dew Code Red and stale Ranch Doritos?If any of the above apply, consider cleaning your room. Your time will be better spent than watching this show. If not, consider scouring your corners for dust bunnies as you will have a more exciting adventure moving your furniture around and searching for dirt than watching the main character Earth and his attempts to be the coolest anti-social, but actually social, mid-life crisis gamer.The show...reeks of wish fulfillment, which is not necessarily an issue if used properly like in shows like Mushoku Tensei or Welcome to the NHK, and has writing and characters that feel like a 10 year old narrating the epic battle between his Godzilla and Hulk Hogan action figures as they smash plastic tooth and nail to shiny pecs and stache. The first episode is all about building up Earth as not a show off and is bullied for picking the bad skills that are secretly really good. Now this wouldnt necessarily be terrible given this is a wish fulfillment show, but he and everyone else have the IQ of dirt, probably why he's named Earth, with none of their actions or thinking being very reflective of anything someone can actually self-insert over unless they turn off their brain or are grossly out of touch with how actual people and/or MMORPG players think and act. It's like if the author could have, he would have written an entire arc about how the MC was the very first to ever think about breathing and because no one else had ever thought of breathing before and now he is teaching them how to he is the coolest most smartest kid in school. On top of that he is not actually a hardcore gamer because hes actually a working man who can only game 3hrs a day, but is still super cool and doing things in the game no one else has done before.No words can truly describe the amount of brain-rot I felt trying to wrap my head around what the author was thinking or feeling as he wrote this story. None of that makes sense, and quite frankly being able to sit down and game 3hrs EVERY day as a late career adult is a dream, but I guess to each their own and their responsibilities. It goes beyond fantastical wish-fulfillment and deeply embeds itself in the muck of delusions for the incompetent/ignorant. The least the author could have done is write a character and story that you can actually self-insert in if they were going to write this kind of story. Even if you try, there are so many incongruencies that you'll be ripped out of your fantasy a couple min later by some nonsense only conceivable by those who don't bother to do any research or story planning before putting pen to paper.Do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this show.It's not even a funny bad watch, it's just dumb and rather infuriating since it could very easily be salvaged into some palatable junk food anime if they even just followed the formula of every other fantasy mmorpg story instead of this garbage they put out.

That just points to bad/incompetent writing.3 out of 10"", ""Because actively avoiding all flags is never enough to escape the spotlight when you're a main character.This was an enjoyable show that never tried to take itself very seriously. It focuses on a relaxing power fantasy experience, following a protagonist who dislikes the spotlight but can't seem to catch a break. It is comfy and relaxing, and also has its share of epic fights and wholesome moments.A good bunch of the episodes feel low-energy, repetitive, or boring and pointless. So much so that at one point I had given up on it and fast-forwarded an episode to get through it. But I was...lucky I stuck around, because after the slow-burn came some really interesting developments.The mechanics of this game world are pretty interesting. Though it's not foolproof and properly thought out (like how the protagonist has such a huge unique advantage for doing something that shouldn't be that unique), it is still pretty fleshed out and quite interesting to follow along. Especially so when all the meticulously gathered gear, skills, and items finally come together in battle.I enjoyed watching the protagonist actively avoiding special events and duels - opposite of what you would normally see in this sort of VRMMORPG setting where players normally have a hunger for quests and events. In trying to avoid trouble, he ends up getting dragged into even bigger and more major events. This simple method of comedy makes the overpowered main character trope more tolerable using comic relief, as he gains all the attention and renown against his wishes, ironically as a result of his consistent efforts to avoid it.Also, the Fairy Queen is very cute... Kemomimi too. So fairies in this world double as kemomimi-havers...From here on I'm going to be more in-depth about my opinions on the show's writing, so there are likely going to be some spoilers to elaborate on the points. Though I'll try not to spoil more than what is needed.THE WRITING:The show is on first impression extremely average. But personally, there are many significant times when a little hint of genius peeks out from under the show's hood, with random bits of mature writing, patient foreshadowing, random events with hidden purposes, humanising monologues, and organic, cathartic payoffs.On that note, what probably makes this isekai stand out the most positively for me is how it handles 'payoff'. It is never spoonfed; what is going to happen next isn't as clear-cut and pronounced as the average isekai. Instead, we are dripfed various things with no further explanation, and we are left to speculate subconsciously, and left in the dark about what will happen next. We often see him doing his thing, and the show just moves on without telling you what was the point of all that. The show patiently bides its time and waits for the right moment for everything to come together in one big moment. The way the show handles payoff is really mature and organic.For example, Earth would spend episodes meticulously gathering items, crafting gear, and obtaining skills on his own free time. He might also obtain some random items and skills that he just stores away with no idea what to do with them. It feels almost eerie and unnatural how much emphasis the show is putting on these boring processes and unused Chekhov's gun elements, and something feels off as the show takes its own sweet time with something so boring that you want to just skip ahead.It then feels really organic and cathartic when suddenly all the little things he obsessed over come in handy. The weird feeling finally reveals its true colors, as we are treated to an epic battle that puts all of the things he has meticulously obtained into use, as it all comes together at once for a huge payoff that you should've expected but didn't because the show had given the façade that it was incompetent.It is this mature writing that kept me engaged and attached to the show throughout its run. After finishing the show, I no longer hold the impression that it is 'extremely average' at all. It has a unique charm that makes it stand out, albeit subtly. But it is also one that probably only avid isekai enjoyers might care about, be able to notice, and appreciate, especially given the barrier of entry that is the boring and generic first 3-4 episodes.THE COST:The cost of this, however, is that there are a lot of episodes where the protagonist just feels like he is doing whatever task pops up in front of him at a whim. Because he does this so much, this show often doesn't feel like it is following a story arc, and often feels episodic instead. Personally, I'm not fond of this because I much prefer shows with follow overarching stories over episodic ones, due to how inconsequential episodic shows can feel.It doesn't help that the episodic episodes are usually the weaker ones as well - where nothing much happens, where the slow burn takes place, and which ultimately leads to the greater payoff. Although the payoff might be great, the slow-burn itself is the least enjoyable part of the show. It unfortunately isn't an insignificant chunk of it either. That is not to say that some of these episodes weren't decent, but they are just comparatively lacklustre when put against the more climatic episodes where the protagonist spends more time interacting with major characters and making a bigger splash on the game world.CONCLUSION:Overall, this is a very enjoyable healing show that doesn't take itself seriously. Boring at times, but at other times surprisingly interesting. And as a whole, it knows what it wants to be and does it well enough for the isekai fan to enjoy as a pleasant treat of comfort food.Score (as of writing): 7.4 lucky I stuck around, because after the slow-burn came some really interesting developments.The mechanics of this game world are pretty interesting.

I liked BOFURI, I enjoyed GUN GALE ONLINE, heck, I even liked SAO (mostly).  But there was an undertone  in the main characters attitude that just puts you off.  I'm ok with someone playing a game by their own rules.  But how does that include abusing others who are just trying to show you they care?  His treatment of the queen really starts to piss you off, and by the end... DOES piss you off.Then, add to the fact that the queen is an AI...  WOW.  Whether LN, anime,...or manga; I hope he comes to care more about her and realize shes awesome AND THEN maybe learns how awesome she is by learning shes AI.  I give it a 5/10 because I reserve  below 5 for shows I feel warrant being burned from existence.  This one could be fixed.  Either he starts acting like a decent human around the queen or the AI queen realizes her power AND DESTROYS HIM.

I didn't like it. People might have, but I just didn't. It's about a character whom plan was to live quietly in the VRMMO world, but he ends up fighting a powerful opponent, like I mean level, at least, 40, when he is only at level 20, and he wins. Things drop off considerably by then.He was a Fairy Playa, then the fairy queen's sort of husband, then stuff happens, he keeps hitting NPC women like the fairy queen, and that sealed the rating of 2 for me.Didn't mind it being mid, I would have given it a 5,...but that annoyed me. It is in almost every episode with the fairy queen in, and the sister. I just didn't like it. Every time it was on my Continue Watching list on Crunchyroll, I'd be sad.I don't recommend it.

The first half of this anime was decent IMO, but quickly during the series you realize the main character prefers to be a loner and is, at first, a nice person for the most part. But when he gets more popular, he becomes a HUGE douchebag about the fact that he's popular, especially near the end towards a particular NPC (the character is in love with the main protagonist) that was giving...him all the attention and good rewards such as skills. He's fine with abusing all the privileges he got from that NPC but he gets extremely douchey when he gets too much attention and not get to be a loner.

It has already been done with Bofuri (Bofuri: I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense) to a similar comedic effect. In fact, I think this show consciously chose to be as opposite as possible as Bofuri. Middle-aged man versus high school girl, experienced gamer versus newbie, a mostly solo player versus a guild player.Thus, the appeal for this show is different. As an older anime watcher, having an older main character appealed to me....I enjoy playing games solo. That is what the protagonist wanted but being the focus and gravity of the story, it was inevitable that he gets drawn into unique quests, but given the choice, he would reject if he could.Recommended for those looking for a quick and easy show to watch, but even I must admit that the first three episodes were kind of a bore. The pace quickened as it raced to the end. I would be the first to tell you that there better shows to invest your time in. 2023 had a bumper crop of new anime.

It's so horrible that some people are blinded by its stupidity and say that it's better than SLF. Like bro what were you smoking while writing that? Yeah, I have a problem with both BUT Shangrila at least makes some sense, it's entertaining, has a good MC with supporting characters, and explained game mechanics.Let's separate it a little.The absurd technology:Ok, imagine we have a world where there is a deep dive technology and AI NPCs are more human. Yeah as I said deep dive like in SAO because SAO made those things mainstream in anime/manga. Here our MC goes into...a deep-dive while sitting. Hmm yeah, a 40-year-old dude sitting on a regular chair while in a comma. I think he must not have any pain after that.Nonexistent game things:Hmm, what to do with our game? Let's make only one player enjoy all the great things. Like what game would just make an entire story for one character? Like wtf, that's not MMO that's a singleplayer. Our MC has by pure luck acquired an AI companion exclusively for him he also had storylines exclusively for him. Like yeah, let's say that AI did all those things. Still, an average player would quit because of no interesting content. That is maybe why there is a nearly non-existent player base shown in the show. By the looks, it would be in our time something like a worse version of Nostale or RuneScape.You can craft everything you want without recipes:Yea, we are shown that our MC can craft himself all kinds of weird stupid bows but others can't make longswords until it's discovered in the dungeon? Like what? So our MC can craft himself those absurd bows and boots while others can't craft their sword an inch longer? We can see that he can craft anything he wants and also cook whatever meals he wants from irl but others can't. By my assumptions, there are maybe only 10k players and that would be really generous. You don't say that at least 10% picked Smith, another 10% picked Cook and some the potion maker?Combat:While trying to have some RPG mechanics it just makes so many mistakes. The author clearly had not played any game in years. Even tho the combat is at least partly watchable. It makes you think wtf is this?The side characters are good...Yeah, side characters are at least watchable. Be it the queen or the party. They feel like normal characters.Mindless stupid nonhuman MC:Another instance of MC with no real character. You can't even distinctly emphasize with him even tho you were a solo/party player he just doesn't make any sense. Don't say that he is like that because he is Japanese/introvert nah... that dawg is clearly mentally ill. You won't see any character progression or growth.Non-existent reason to watch:Ok it's not a slice of life, it's not a fantasy nor an isekai. It's literally about a dude who goes to work(we don't see him too much in irl, there also are not any scenes in the IRL world only his room) and plays for whatever reason games that he clearly can't even enjoy. There is literally zero reason for him to play as well as there is no reason for you to watch this anime. It's not even like SLF where skill matters. Nor does an actual level exist in that game he literally can take down a much higher-level enemy.Art style:Very 5/10 meh art style.Overall 4/10.

Toaru Ossan's scenery does not go unharmed from negative criticism, as the colors are often dirty, colorless, with poorly drawn, crooked, poorly framed drawings and, worst of all, they have an unacceptable morbidity, something truly unhealthy and regrettable, I mean.

Many of their daily stories in their city Nagoya are already known to us from the previous two seasons, but their city tour goes on and on!The four main characters still insist on their own opinion about the “better” city, they stayed exactly the same way as we know and like....With Memo we get to know a new girl who has moved from Tokyo to Nagoya and who misses her old “love” after the first day in Nagoya already. Despite the initial difficulties and a little misunderstanding with Monaka, she is getting used to Nagoya after some time as well. In addition, we experience two new supporting characters with Shiharu and Nanaho who also have their own thoughts on this matter. Still, it\'s nice to see how much they amuse and have fun together, even though they often have different opinions.With the studio ""Creators in Pack"" we see the same animation again as it is already known to us. The characters are designed in a cute way and very adorable. The cultural sights of Nagoya are also well animated. A special highlight is certainly all the food that we see in the series.

Nevertheless, the other two parts are also highly recommended for a little break in between.I\'m sure we\'ll get a fourth season with even more interesting facts from Nagoya in the future!', ""If there's anything that I've learned from watching this series it's that no matter how small and obscure your little province in Japan, you can always find companionship in people from any other province simply by talking with them about how much you hate Tokyo.The character designs and their cute interactions are really the only fun I can get from this as an American who has 0 stakes in the Nagoya/Tokyo debate. Honestly if it didn't have that gimmick it'd be a decent enough slice of life show, but the joke that they're from Nagoya runs pretty thin. 3 seasons of this, even if the...episodes are so short, and that same joke over and over isn't going to be enough to sustain it. I'm giving this a lower grade than the other seasons cause it really didn't need to exist. Honestly 2 seasons was pushing it.6/10 episodes are so short, and that same joke over and over isn't going to be enough to sustain it.

Yuri Seijin Naoko-san (2012),https://myanimelist.net/anime/12437/Yuri_Seijin_Naoko-san_2012,"['Yuri Seijin Naoko-san is a crazy little piece. It\'s a little hard to describe, but if you\'re familiar with the ""denpa"" aesthetic, you\'ll get this.STORY: 6There really isn\'t any story to be had here. Misuzu\'s sister left a while back and she\'s been replaced by a perverted alien who goes by the name of Naoko. Craziness ensues. The focus is obviously on the rapid-fire gags which will be hit or miss. There\'s one scene in which Misuzu dreams of her older sister which added a nice contrasting touch of nostalgia; it was very well done. Overall, it\'s all over the place, but that\'s the point.ART:...8It\'s very well animated. Seeing how it\'s only half an hour long or so, I would say watch it just for the pictures alone. It got me pumped up. The disconnected feel of the whole thing is both familiar and foreign--it\'s perfect for setting and motif. It\'s very denpa-kei.SOUND: 9BGM fits. OP and ED are awesome. If you like MOSAIC.WAV, watch it.CHARACTER: 7No depth. No development. Still, these characters are a pretty fun bunch and their interactions are lively.ENJOYMENT: 8I really liked this. It was very straightforward and it was a fun ride. Despite being little more than a half hour of gags, there\'s a sense of cohesion and scope. There\'s a sense of the ephemeral. When it isn\'t pounding you with excitement, it feels like you\'re drifting. Naoko-san can be summed up in the OP and ED. If anything, watch those.OVERALL: 7If you have time to kill, watch it. 8It\'s very well animated. Seeing how it\'s only half an hour long or so, I would say watch it just for the pictures alone.

Not much else happens this this is an ova, but if you really wanted to get the whole thing I'd definitely recommend the manga.Art: The animation is amazing, with maximum efficiency and minimal frames, from the brilliantly talented Tetsuya Takeuchi. You probably don't know, but his animation style usually fits into that category. The art is light and colourful, maintaining quality all throughout both ova's running time.Sound: The show has...a very retro feel to it, one that you would find on some of the old arcade machines and early 90's home consoles. Overall it's pretty enjoyable.Character: Because this show is so short, there isn't room for much character development at all, but you get the idea that Naoko is trying yurify everything, with Misuzu disapproving of everything like a regular person would. But of course there isn't much room for character development, so once again I heavily recommend the manga.Enjoyment: There were some pretty good moments all throughout the entire show, you'd think the entire thing would just be filled with lewd joke after lewd joke, which it is. However they are pretty funny throughout both ovas.Overall: You can definitely tell Tetsuya Takeuchi cared about this, you can tell that he actually read the entire manga to get a feel of the characters and how they would react. And I definitely hope he gets more opportunities to show off his talent because I'd certainly watch whatever he makes.8/10 They really need to make more of this a very retro feel to it, one that you would find on some of the old arcade machines and early 90's home consoles.

It isn't technically a yuri title, but it does use that theme for a lot of its comedy, and as someone whose enjoys that...kind of humor, I got quite a few laughs out of this anime. It also has a very deadpan style of humor that doesn't need extreme character reactions to tell you that something was funny. All of the characters were really funny and also kind of endearing by the time the series was over.With animation, however, there's a lot more going. I absolutely adored the aesthetic that this anime carried with its barely-outlined character, striking character designs, and just barely muted color palette. The animation also had an extremely fluid and free moving style, another aesthetic that I really love seeing and wish I could see in more anime.Most of this, of course, is due to Tetsuya Takeuchi's heavy involvement with the series (director, script, storyboard, screenplay, key animation, character designs, AND animation director; plus he was also involved in End of Evangelion, R.O.D., Love Hina, and Nodame Cantabile). You can really tell that this guy has a truly unique vision and it comes through beautifully in this anime.Oh by the way this was animated by ufotable. Yeah, THAT ufotable.I also liked the editing style a lot as well. It's a lot slower than the norm and not even close to being as spastic as more modern comedic series, and the longer takes and fewer cuts let the bizarre comedy and surrealism shine through without being interrupted by constant cutting, which I appreciated a lot.Music was very minimal, but when it did show up, it added the perfect touch of strangeness to an already strange environment.Overall, this is a highly underrated gem that I definitely recommend. It only takes about 35 minutes to get through both episodes, so time commitment is a non issue. Even if it was, I'd still recommend this series, and I hope to see more from this series and from Takeuchi in the future. kind of humor, I got quite a few laughs out of this anime.

I somehow enjoyed it tremendously.Story. [Spoilers]Misuzu is a regular junior high student that is excited to see her older sister, as she rushes home, she opens her sister\'s room only to find an ""alien"" obsessed with yuri is now staying in her home.After that they just have short little adventures and many skits in the rest of the episode. Until, it\'s towards the end. There is a scene where Misuzu has a fever and wakes up to her older sister taking care of her. After the ending song, the scene is then remade but...with Naoko taking care of her and her other family members gathering in the room. I thought that the scenes seemed nostalgic and the story took a pretty serious turn when the end came near.Art/Animation.The animation is fluid and just plain great. ufotable has yet to disappoint me with their high standards of animation. Its art style is unique while the colors are nice and complementary.Sound.Now I really couldn\'t remember the OST itself. I don\'t even know if it had one. The ending really spoke out to me though, it was good at setting the tone for the upcoming scene. The animation during the ending theme was BEAUTIFUL. Honestly, and the song seemed so melancholic and very different from the electronic and high-pitched opening.Characters.The characters really have no development whatsoever. They really don\'t need any of that though. The characters reactions to the perverted things that spew out of our favorite yuri citizen Naoko-san, are really all we need.Enjoyment.I loved this OVA. The characters and situations were so bizarre and pretty funny. I had a really empty feeling at the end of the OVA because I knew that there wasn\'t another episode.

By Yuri\'s hands we are fed, give us Yuri our daily bread. Amen. *Ahem* Yuri Seijin Naoko-san is good. My name is Neimaj, and thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this review.Kekeke. If it really ended there, the review would still be longer than the OVA itself. Seriously, Yuri Seijin Naoko-san is really good. Twenty-eight minutes. That\'s the amount of time this OVA had to leave a good impression on me. And oh boy, did it leave an impression. Naoko-san is such a wonderful character. She...came to planet Earth with a single goal in mind, to conquer it! By yurifying it! ""That\'s a goal I can get down with,"" I thought to myself. I love her purpose, voice, and character design. Naoko-san is an alien from the planet, Yuri. Her entire character is obsessed with making girls go gay. She lives in a treehouse right above a young girl\'s home by the name of Misuzu. Misuzu, coincidentally, had an older sister with the same name as Naoko-san. Misuzu does ponder whether or not her sister is Naoko-san, but that idea never comes back up, unfortunately. That\'s definitely the most intriguing part of this story. And most of what I\'ve said is the story. Naoko-san loves with a human family and bizarre things happen, like in Alf, or Urusei Yatsura, or any other show similar to this. However, Naoko-san is much more entertaining.Now, I typically dislike ""Straight Man vs. Funny Man"" comedy in anime. I promise, this is connected to Naoko-san, just let me speak about this for a quick second. So, the double act structure in comedy with a ""Tsukkomi"" and a ""Boke"" I find this style of humor to be very obnoxious in anime, because the jokes get very repetitive and predictable in such a short period of time. There are a few exceptions of this style of humor being well done, e.g., Arakawa under the Bridge. In Arakawa, the straight man (Rec) is surrounded by a bunch of crazy people (Everyone living under the bridge) and the jokes/situations work, because of the strange nature of the characters. They\'re weird and wacky people that have some depth to their character. Although, some of the jokes do get ran into the ground later on in the manga. I brought this up because Yuri Seijin Naoko-san does an excellent job with this style of humor, considering how likable and charming the characters are. They\'re all full of personality. Watching Naoko\'s jokes bounce off of Misuzu is very entertaining. Did I forget to mention that this OVA is hilarious? It does a masterful job at creating these funny visual gags with gorgeous and fluid animation. Every single frame looks amazing! Even the OP was astonishing to watch. One of the weirdest OP\'s I\'ve seen in a while. The ending of the OVA also does a good job at transitioning to the ED, which was also a great watch.I didn\'t feel like it was appropriate to give this OVA anything higher than a nine, mostly because not much actually happens. You can\'t really do much in twenty-eight minutes. Y\'know what? I\'m going to give this OVA a 9 out of 10, just for the hell of it. Why not. It doesn\'t do anything wrong. I\'m tired of giving the same scores whenever I make these reviews. It was a brief experience and I enjoyed a lot of it. I only wish it was longer.

The 28 minute OVA gets into some of the plot and it\'s pretty simple for a gag manga setup.Animation is nice and it has a quirky atmosphere, Naoko could be a fun character if we had more time. I didn\'t really enjoy this though, it just didn\'t make me laugh except once or twice. I don\'t dislike raunchy humor, but the jokes in this lacked punch and were borderline uncomfortable sometimes. Is Naoko a pedophile? Why is it most times the little brother shows up...the joke is about his dick? Implication of incest as a joke? Without being outright tasteless, it\'s bordering on it.Also there was a shortage of shoujo ai/yuri for something about a lesbian degenerate alien here to yurify earth. Not expecting ecchi, just a little more than a couple of characters being implied gay/bi, and I would hope they are not going for the main character\'s yuri love interest being her older sister as it seems to imply in the opening (notice I use a lot of ""implied"" here). the joke is about his dick?
