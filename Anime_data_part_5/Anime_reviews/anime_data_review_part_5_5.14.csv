Tales of Crestoria: Toga Waga wo Shoite Kare wa Tatsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42832/Tales_of_Crestoria__Toga_Waga_wo_Shoite_Kare_wa_Tatsu,"[""I give this a 10/10 mostly because the story presented in the game this is based of is amazing, unfortunally it is hard to capture all emotions that the actual tale offer in a short animation, making this adaptation kind of confusing and shallow for somebody that isn't introduced to the full story yet. Another con would be how this animation kind of turn out serving as a huge spoiler for anybody interested to start playing the actual game, specially since the story is it forte.Overall I liked the visuals and soundtrack, the characters design look a bit different and edgy from their originals, but...it still look good. it still look good.""]"

Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online - Refrain,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37831/Sword_Art_Online_Alternative__Gun_Gale_Online_-_Refrain,"['\'Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online - Refrain\', also known as \'Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online - Refrain From Watching\' is a recap episode of the first 5 episodes of SAOA GGO. The reason why this exists is rather simple: the anime was on hiatus this week and the studio broadcasting it had to fill the time slot with something. And so this masterpiece of modern anime was born.If we compare this to the first 5 episodes, it is basically the same thing but abridged version of it. In terms of editing, I have seen better shortened versions of anime made...by folks on youtube who have less than 1k subscribers. As a comparison, I have rewatched the first 5 episodes on 4x speed and I can conclude that following the story in that way is much easier than to understand what is happening the recap version. I wish they had done that and added some sick songs in it just to make it the fastest paces and longest AMV produced by the industry itself. Instead all they did was put the least liked guy in the studio to use Vegas Pro for 2 hours and made few seiyuus do a voice over. At least they turned the volume down on the original audio track.At the end, there is like 3 seconds of new material where the seiyuus yell weird Japanese sound effects like ""byo"" but instead of the characters making this sound, it\'s the guns and some boat motors, so I guess at least the people who had to make this thing enjoyed the making of it. If you for some reason want to watch this, I would recommend jumping to the time stamp of 22:00 and continuing from there because that\'s the only part worth of watching. by folks on youtube who have less than 1k subscribers.

Adding weird sound effects, retarded editing and honestly it was funny as fuck.Other than that, there is no real point to watch most of the episode unless you have memory loss or something, just watch the little ending clips.There isn\'t really much else you can say about this over than ... it\'s a recap ... it\'s going to be the same thing you saw before, just edited together as if they are ""Watching the battle afterwards"", therefore it\'s only showing the tournament, not the...back story. back story.', 'In short, I found this as unnecessary, though after watching the entire thing, my score went up significantly.There was no story, first off. If you’re new to the world of anime, then this might surprise you, thought the word ‘recap’ should be pretty self explanatory. This is simply going over the last 5 episodes. There is pretty much nothing new in here at all except the commentary-- which is grating and annoying, in my opinion.The animation was very well done, as usual. It’s clean, beautiful, and nice to look at. In some ways, it makes up for the shitty storyline.The sound so far has...been great. The opening and closing haven’t really grown on me all that much, but the background music, sound effects, and voice actors are all great, so there isn’t really anything major to complain about.In all honesty, I think my commenting on the characters would be biased since I don’t really expressly like most of them. This is a recap too, so I doubt anything I say will be any different than the way the characters are portrayed in the full series.I had taken a month long break (due to work and lack of time) from anime in general so I had seen episode 5 and didn’t really get around to watching anything until episode 9 was already out. I had a pretty solid understanding of what happened, but I watched this just to make sure, but it was honestly a waste of my time. All you need to know is that LENN and M won SJ. That’s pretty much it. In terms of enjoyment, I did have fun watching the spoofs at the end and how the author parodied himself, which is what made this recap redeemable.I would recommend this if you: like GGO and took a LONG break between the 5th and 6th episode, like spoofs (just watch the few minutes after the credits then), love GGO so much that you just want to relive it in a shorter timespanI would NOT recommend this if you: are watching episode 5 and 6 in succession, aren’t a big fan of spoofs, don’t have time to rewatch things/time to spare, don’t like GGO all that muchHave a great day everyone! been great.

Beats me.The only thing worth checking out about the recap is the after credits compilation of some of the shots from the show coupled with the “correct” sound effects, I wish they had that on the entire episode, it would have been worth it at last.Really, the recap is just M and Pito narrating over what went on the first Squad Jam, sort of like a couch-conversation style....Still, not worth your time. However, watching it through, it really shows how little happened in the first 5 episodes, truly the trashiest kind of entertainment, I love it. I can easily suck my mind out and give the dude a comfy place beside me to enjoy the show and still go over the episode no problem. Still, not worth your time.

Shaman King: Flowers,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51673/Shaman_King__Flowers,"[""Mild spoiler warningTl;dr: it looked like it was going to go down the Boruto road but they're starting to swerve in the last second.Art style and music are solid.From the end of the prequel we already got to know our MC Hana a bit, mainly that his character is more like Anna's than You's. He's short-tempered, constantly irritated, a loner and he doesn't like his dad. This is somewhat understandable since his parents are not around at all.Right out of the gate I have to mention that they messed up the power scaling immediately. I had to remind myself that Hana and his crew are...at the same age that You was during the Shaman Fight but they are already at the same level as You at the end of the show. This is a shonen so it is to be expected that the focus is on them but some of it is really pushing the limits of it all. I mean one of the characters is 7 years old ... and apparently the strongest of their team.And for whatever reason all of our beloved old crew are (mostly) still around but they choose to let the kids do the fighting that will determine the fate of the world.The story itself expands on the events of the prequel and introduces a logical continuation of the Shaman Fight but it does feel a bit forced at times. And apparently everyone was briefed by the author as to what is going on except the MC, because everyone acts like it is common knowledge what happens and no one cares to stop for a second and explain the greater picture to Hana.Some of the obfuscation is attributed to story reasons but come on, Hana visibly has issues that need solving.Some of the old cast like Tamao were totally shoehorned into their new role. She didn't stop at an 180, but kept spinning until she ended up where she is now. When the Shaman Fight ended she would have been at high school age but I don't believe for a second that she behaved the way they tell us she did.Halfway through the season, all of the above drove me to decide to not continue watching this series after this installment. At least that was what I thought but in the last 2-3 episodes they finally started to show some character development for Hana and the story itself. It is only a glimpse and I haven't read the manga so I don't know if that was only a small temporary improvement. I will definitely wait until reviews for the next season are out.5/10 - has potential but needs work at the same age that You was during the Shaman Fight but they are already at the same level as You at the end of the show.

Even though it's not little, 52 for many people is a lot.The art is very beautiful and the animation is pleasant.It's not more of the same compared to the classic anime, mainly because the protagonist's personality is different. The part where he criticized the bizarreness of Over Souls is very good.It's certainly one of the best animes of the season, but it won't gain as much fame even with a smaller season in terms of the...number of animes.It's an anime that explains the main points of the original story, so it's possible to watch it without having seen the previous anime, but I don't recommend doing that. number of animes.It's an anime that explains the main points of the original story, so it's possible to watch it without having seen the previous anime, but I don't recommend doing that."", ""This new season of Shaman King features a protagonist who literally a Boruto.

I liked it. Tonally it fit with the previous series. The characters were easy to root for including Hana, who might annoy some viewers. It balanced darkness and comedy well. However, there were still the detriments from the original series to contend with like how it handles other cultures and underage relationships. The speed of the narrative also seemed a bit too fast in places and when the thirteenth episode finished, it felt like it wasn't the right stopping point for a first season and maybe a 24 - 26 episode first...season might have brought us to a better stopping point.  That said, I appreciated that it didn't do a Boruto where you get hundreds of episodes of filler. I also like that the main plot is engaging and has me intrigued and willing to watch more.If you liked the original series and you like sequels that align more with Dragon Ball Super, which captures the tone and theme of the original while transforming itself into its own thing, then I think you'll also like this anime. If you had qualms with the original story or don't like it when the main character shouts ever so often, then you might want to skip this. season might have brought us to a better stopping point.

Spider Riders: Oracle no Yuusha-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2619/Spider_Riders__Oracle_no_Yuusha-tachi,"[""Another of my favorite anime goes unreviewed, so I'll try my best. Spider Riders is an anime that gets a lot of negativity, at least from the few people who have actually heard of it. This is somewhat justifiable, considering the butchered dub that most viewers were exposed to. However, the original Japanese version is worth giving a try.Note: Although SR was aired as 2 separate series in Japan due to ratings, it was intended to only be one, and was properly aired as such in the rest of the world. Thus, this review will reflect the entire series, not just the first 26 episodes.Story:...I watch a lot of anime aimed at children, and story usually isn't their strong suit. Spider Riders is an exception to the rule. It's about a boy who, following his grandfather's journal, discovers an alternate world where the humans are at war with humanoid bugs called Insectors. Thus, rather than a systematic monster-of-the-week, unending quest show, Spider Riders has an overall objective; to win the war. There's some pretty interesting twists as the story goes on, so it's not even as straightforward as my explanation would imply.The plot is somewhat derailed in the dub, but explaining why here would spoil one of the best of these twists.Art: Studio Bee Train does a great job with the art. The character designs are bright, cute and appealing. The spider designs all manage to be unique and intricate as well. I can only think of one episode offhand where the animation quality is noticeably weak, which is always a positive.Sound: The music, while not incredible, still manages to be quite catchy. It's a bit of a shame no OST was ever released for this series. It has some very nice BGMs with vocal, reminiscent of Yuki Kajiura. The OP and ED themes are generic, but not bad, my personal favorite being the second ED theme, Koi no Keshiki.The english dub replaces the OP with rap, and has a fairly grating soundtrack.As far as the acting goes, the voices suit the characters quite well. Shigeru Chiba as Grasshop (as well as his wife and two kids) is worth mentioning, simply for the amount of nonsensical bantering he does whenever he comes on screen. Toshihiko Seki's Buguese reminded me why I consider him one of my favorite seiyuu.The dub acting, of course, is less appealing. While the actors most definitely improve as the series goes on, some sound quite awful and unfitting in the earlier eps.Characters: The protagonist, Hunter Steele, is as idealistic as your typical shounen hero. He tends to see everything in black and white. However, the characters on either side of the war are in a much more grey area, and that helps make them interesting. While some of the characters are rather flat (the spiders other than Shadow, for instance) others are incredibly strong and dynamic. Most notably, Aqune, Buguese, and Corona. It's also hard to fit the cast into any type of cliche. If you're used to seeing girls in action cartoons as the useless cheerleaders who get kidnapped all the time, you have to see Aqune and Corona, who are just awesome heroines. I came to love or at least appreciate most of the characters as the show went on.Enjoyment: Spider Riders is a very enjoyable series to me. One has to keep in mind that because Bee Train was involved in it, things have to go at a very slow pace. Still, there was enough action, mystery and suspense throughout to keep me invested. I will admit though that the second half of the series was a disappointment in comparison to the first. It had some great episodes, but others were lacking. Apparently, due to some kind of executive meddling in the hopes of leaving opening for a season 2, the second half was changed drastically. Thus, a lot of the mystery and backstory were left unexplained. Still, I did enjoy the show despite it's very disappointing end.Overall: I'd consider Spider Riders a series that definitely deserves a chance, particularly the Japanese version. It was much more than I expected coming into it, even though it has it's obvious, glaring flaws. I thank the very interesting characters a lot for this. Buguese and Aqune both have a high spot in my favorite fictional characters ever, and that's quite an accomplishment, because I watch a lot of anime and love a lot of characters.

Same can be said for the appearance of the EVA characters and the fight against the angel which also comes out of nowhere and is utterly pointless. There's nothing that justifies their existence and nothing creative is done with them which is a bummer because the series managed to do something with them whenever they appeared on screen and were a cool bonus on the side for the fans but never relied only on that to make it cool. The only thing I can give to the movie concerning the collabs is that the Miku song is somewhat decent.Then another disappointment is that there's not any technical improvement to note despite what you could expect from a theatrical version, it still feels like it's made with a low budget and bad CG, the fight scenes are made up primarily of transformations and reused special attacks but barely any choreography to make it exciting. Actually, the only thing making it exciting are the insert songs and the various themes used in them and some of the new mech designs look pretty cool.The story doesn't even try either, bad guys are evil and they must be stopped, the end. There's a subplot with Hayato's father turning back to a child but it's honestly forgettable.It's sad to say but the fact that this entry is a failure is not a great surprise, most of anime aimed at kids choose the easy way out especially if it's a to milk a bigger franchise. I still have a fondness for the characters and the comedy which prevents me from hating it but I really wish they would have tried harder, just like they tried hard for the series not to be just a generic MotW. off by featuring Godzilla, the most emblematic monster coming from Japan.Why I'm bothering talking about this star system is to make my first point : the collaboration in the movie are pointless and act more as mediocre baits than enjoyable fanservice, the fight against Godzilla is rushed in a few minutes around the beginning, lasting only a few minutes and consisting of him firing a laser and wagging his tail once for the battle to be over and for him to not appear ever again with very little bearing on the story.

The Hakkenden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1822/The_Hakkenden,"[""Let me start by saying that the first episode is by far the best. In fact, I would have given this a much higher rating if the show consisted of just the first episode. It is a truly great episode filled with epic battle, desperation, and crazy folklore. Unfortunately, the show takes a real dive afterwards and as it goes on it seems more and more like the writer and staff lost interest and even forgot what they had originally planned. Sure, there's some more awesome fight scenes, but most of the show is characters that haven't been properly introduced with either unexplained or so...uninteresting motivations that you've forgotten what they were, aimlessly walking around and eventually bumping into people with whom they get in fights who are guess what? also Hakkenden! No way! You mean you've got a glowing birth mark too? but we were just fighting. Oh well, no point in explaining or even differentiating between the characters, hopefully this show will end soon. Or at least that's how I imagined the creators were thinking. Still, it's not without merit, some episodes are directed by different people and the art style changes too, which is cool because sometimes it looks really good. Also, as I mentioned, there is some good action and some truly sadistic happenings. This could have been a great show as I had been anticipating but I ended up having to struggle through to the end. They really kept meeting allies up until the last episode, it's like they didn't even plan it out. Very confusing. Still, if you're starved for Chambara as I am I guess it's worth a shot.

So the Satomi flee for their survival.One night, Yoshizane, the Satomi leader, says to Yatsufusa, their dog, that if he brings back the head of their enemy he will give the dog his daughter&acute;s hand in marriage.So as promised, Yatsufusa brings the head of Kagetsura to the Satomi Clan.

Breathtaking, well told, this tale of the dog warriors is a must see!', ""Note that my review of Hakkenden covers my thoughts of the entire series. With that said, on with the review.This is quite the underrated gem as I haven't seen many reviews of it mentioned online. Before I cover the highlights to Hakkenden, I might as well cover the obvious issue with the series in the form of its animation. The series is notable for having gone through various animation teams throughout its run and it shows with the differing animation quality and styles that get employed in the title's different scenes. In the better animated parts of the series, characters looks quite lifelike and well...detailed in their designs as they exactly as they would in 15th century Japan, which sticks out from conventionally drawn titles of the early to mid 1990s. At its worst, the characters look quite deformed and cartoon-ish in their designs as they move about and are more simpler in detail. Animated scenes are also a mixed bag here as you get occasions where you see nicely animated and brutal battle scenes or nice imagery coming from the various demons that the eight warriors encounter and instances where either you get enough still shots or choppy-looking movement coming from the title's varying animation styles that were being employed. I'm not too harsh with judging an anime purely on its animation, but there's no denying the inconsistency of it throughout Hakkenden may be a big turnoff for folks and is still a glaring issue with the series.If you can look past the visuals though, you'll find a rather engaging title mixing traditional samurai story with elements of Japanese supernatural folklore. The series is a tale depicting the eight reincarnated offspring of a demonic-possessed dog and princess Fuse of the weakened Satomi clan who slowly reunite to come together to restore their old clan to power. In terms of plot, Hakkenden is mostly focused on the slow reunification of the eight Dog Warriors as they learn more of their origins and have frequent encounters with demons and corrupt feudal lords, events that are usually instigated by the main antagonist of the series in the form of the demon Aboshi, with the first episode covering how the union between Fuse and the dog came about. The final episodes then focus on the eight reuniting with the Satomi clan to reclaim control over the land and having their final confrontation with Aboshi. While the plot seems simple in setup, the title's focus on its characters and time period add quite a bit of depth to Hakkenden.Many of the major characters in the series are fleshed out and you come to learn that the eight dog warriors share a connection through having tragic and violent pasts attributed to their unique upbringing and the time period in which they are brought up. This offers up a fresh approach to a historical title like Hakkenden where rather than the series glorify and romanticize the Sengoku era, the series focuses on the cruel reality of the era with political instability and violent warfare about. You have feudal lords caring more for their selfish needs than the well-being of others, families willing to give away their children to political figures for arranged marriage to either gain money or status, corrupt feudal lords willing to kill off anyone to save face for situations that cause the slightest of imperfections for their image and absolute loyalty/ devotion to feudal lords having its moral downfalls. To my knowledge, this was one of the first anime titles that offered such a focus for its historical setting and Hakkenden explores the problems of the early Sengoku era very well.Another notable element to Hakkenden is its music. Consisting mostly of light and traditional musical pieces, the various musical tracks are pleasant on the ears, flow nicely with the title's major scenes and offers one of the more beautiful sounding OP tracks I've heard in an anime.Hakkenden's historical focus, violence (plenty of dismemberment, blood and onscreen deaths are present here) and inconsistent animation make this a series that won't be for everyone. But if you have interest in historical anime and can look past the mentioned issues with the series, Hakkenden is an engaging experience with its rich cast of characters, supernatural elements and believable approach to exploring the early decades of Japan's Sengoku era. detailed in their designs as they exactly as they would in 15th century Japan, which sticks out from conventionally drawn titles of the early to mid 1990s.

This review covers the first 6 episodes since that is how this site has them separated. If you have the complete series like I do then this will cover the first dvd/volume and the first episode on the second dvd/volume. It is based on ""Nanso Satomi Hakkenden"" which is the longest novel in classic Japanese literature. This OVA series was released in 1990-1992. As always I write these reviews assuming you have read the synopsis.The first 6 episodes cover 4 of 8 heroes re-uniting....It starts with the background story and then moves into their respective reincarnated lives. It takes you through the journey often times with dream like sequences so that the lines between reality and illusion are a bit blurred. The animation style and music were not of the highest quality even at the time of release, but it is still done in quite a beautiful way even given the mediocre quality. The flow and progression of the story is thought provoking. This is by no means a ""dumb"" series in the sense that you do have to pay attention to the flow of the story or it may just go over your head.It deals with dark themes and social issues that do not exist today. We are talking about the 1400\'s in this series. The characters are very human in their behavior, and they are driven by a common mystery that links them together. The spirit bead that each carries seems to draw them together, and they band together during each others darkest moments. The villain of the series leads them through a nightmarish psychological journey, and they will need the strength of all eight to complete their quest.If you\'re ok with older animation styles, and you enjoy psychologically driven stories then this is a must see. Remember this is the beginning of the series. There are 7 episodes to follow these first 6. The story is really just getting started at the end of these first episodes, and the characters have a ways to go in their development. Definitely worth watching.

Vampire Hunter,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1952/Vampire_Hunter,"[""Vampire Hunter is the animated version of the 2D fighting game by Capcom of the same name, perhaps better known as Night Warriors: Darkstalker's Revenge. It seems to be targeted, as most such anime are, to fans of the original game, and, as such, seems to take it for granted that the public has some knowledge about the characters, their backgrounds, and the overall back story.As I'm not an aficionado of the games myself, having played them only every now and again, it's somewhat difficult for me to say whether or not the anime really ties into the games, so this review will mainly focus...on the OVA as is.As might be expected from an anime based on a fighting game, the story is the weakest point. By and large the main plot consists of a human world that has been ruled for some time now by monsters and creatures of legend called Darkstalkers (mainly Demitri Maximoff, for those who know the games) having evolved too much, giving rise to an invasion of robots (Huitzil/Phobos) that are programmed to wipe out advanced civilisation, while at the same time some universal overlord (Pyron) descends on the world to find someone who is strong enough to oppose him. As could be guessed, this someone of course shows up, in the guise of a man tormented by his being half human, half Darkstalker (Donovan). Or, to put it even more simplistic, it boils down to &quot;Hero battles Villain&quot;.Moreover, the plot takes itself far too seriously for something based on what is in fact a somewhat goofy, over-the-top series of fighting games, resulting in overly dramatic scenes tied to a plot that is paper thin and clich&eacute;d at best.In the meanwhile, a few other characters from the game appear with their own back stories, which are touched upon and sometimes played out for a bit, but these stories are only very loosely, if at all, tied to the greater plot. This in effect means that the story becomes a garbled mess, with many a character running around seemingly without a purpose.On the other hand, the presentation of the characters themselves is not half bad. Most anime based on fighting games opt to pick one main hero and one main villain and have them duke it out, with all the other characters dropping in for a cameo at one time or another to please the fans, leaving the uninitiated utterly confused as to who this or that new guy that never reappears was. Vampire Hunter, on the contrary, picks up about half a dozen of the characters, and expanding a bit on the background of each of these. Running for 4 episodes with a total length of about 160 minutes, Vampire Hunter seems to have found the ideal length for its approach: each of the characters is given a fair amount of time to be introduced and play his or her plot line, while none of them are given too much screen time. Characterisation itself is based heavily on the snippets of information given in the games, making the characters have somewhat distinct (even if largely clich&eacute;d) personalities, and having them act on these.What makes the characters all far more interesting is the way they are portrayed. Now, the art is without a doubt the high point of this OVA. Like in most OVA's of the time, backgrounds range from quite good to simply gorgeous, often giving the impression as if they were hand-drawn. The setting in general shows quite a few distinct locales, and the colorisation is very good: as could be guessed, use is made mostly of the darker colours of the palette, with much of the story taking place under a darkened sky or in the shadows. Brighter colours are generally more subdued, with the occasional dashing reds if the situation warrants it.The characters are all very well animated. Not only do they move fluently and have a wide range of facial expressions, they all follow the designs from the game very nicely. Not only are all characters very different in basic design, but many of them sport different styles of drawing and animation, again following the differences in style from the games closely.This being a fighting series, it should come as no surprise that the main attention of the show, and thus the art and animation, is on the fights. These are done very well. As far as I can say, the animators have copied many of the fighting styles and moves from the game, making each fight and each fighter distinctly different. This not only applies to the special moves, or whatever name you would give those, but also, and perhaps even more successfully, to the basic attack patterns, many of which are a joy to watch, being far more interesting than the special attacks, in fact. I'm sure the real fans will notice differences between the anime and the games, but for the rest of us it seems as if the anime follows the games closely.Being generally cautious of animated versions of fighting games, I have to say this one is by far one of the best I've seen to date. The story is ridiculous, pompous, and far to self-important, but this major downside is more than offset with the fairly decent character introduction and development and the more than decent art and fighting direction. on the OVA as is.As might be expected from an anime based on a fighting game, the story is the weakest point.

They are usually universally terrible and this would be the first adaptation I've seen that I liked. I was surprised when within the first few minutes of watching I thought &quot;hey, this doesn't completely suck...&quot; By the end I had concluded &quot;yeah, that wasn't bad&quot;. I'm not a huge Darkstalkers fan, but I played enough of it to think &quot;ehhh, what the hell, why not?&quot; I think even if I wasn't vaguely familiar with the characters I would've still enjoyed this. I watched all 4 eps in a row fairly painlessly and could've easily watched more...(see Characters below).Story:Make no mistake about it, this is definitely a show for people who like shows about fighting. If you don't like fighting games or shows like DBZ or Yu Yu Hakusho or Kenshin or even Bleach/Naruto then... I have no idea why you are even reading this. Otherwise I thought the story was about as good as anyone could expect for a show about a fighting game. To try to criticize the story beyond that misses the point and does a disservice to its accomplishment.There's a lot of repetitive use of the word &quot;dark&quot; (you could make a deadly drinking game out of it) and the general setup is fairly generic, BUT, the OTT plot is perfectly suited for the show, considering fighting games are OTT by design. I've seen much worse excuses to get characters to come together to beat each other up.In fact, I thought the premise that ties them together was actually pretty good as far as these kind of shows go. They actually make some kind of effort to explain the presence of &quot;the dark&quot; and make interesting use of what would otherwise be a cliche mix of &quot;something from space&quot;, &quot;an ancient race&quot;, and &quot;something from another dimension&quot;. Which was already a lot more than I was expecting.I actually liked that it kept itself kind of serious (I'm tired of anime with goofy/wacky sight gags and comic relief). It gave it a dramatic feel but not so much that it lost sight of being an anime about people fighting.I really liked how they centered the story around Donovan/Anita. They could've gone many ways with this: It could've been another ambitious story about an overpowered vampire and his quest for domination or some trumped up tournament to see who is the worlds strongest. I feel their choice in a &quot;protagonist&quot; was probably the best one they could've made of all the characters available. Sure the &quot;half-demon&quot; thing is overused, but in a world where humanity is being devoured by darkness, something about the virtue of a man who is constantly at war with his (literally) inner demon and the traumatized little girl he has vowed to protect just seemed right.The ending was a little disappointing, mostly because I think it crossed that line of cliche over-the-topness, but eh, I've also seen much worse and more frustrating endings, so...Characters:The characters have some questionable dialogue sometimes, but otherwise I thought it was surprisingly solid if not pretty good. Again, experience had me already expecting much worse. I thought they captured the characters unique personalities pretty well and didn't go too overboard with any of them. I thought they did a good job with introducing Donovan, Anita, Demitri, Morrigan, Huitzel, Pyron and the sisters. Felicia, Talbain and Bishamon showed promise. Lord Raptor was pretty much just an odd cameo, so aside from him, I liked how they were handling use of the characters and not just rushing/stuffing everyone into the story in some contrived and insipid manner. For this reason I actually felt the story was too short. I would've liked to have seen this as a series and see them try to include all the characters and somehow tie them into the epic confrontation with Pyron.Art:I actually didn't think the art was that great for an OVA. I did like how they didn't get overly retarded with the designs and stayed mostly faithful to the game (both in characters and combat). So for that it still ranks high with me.Sound:The sound was fine, more surprisingly however was that the dub didn't make me want to gag. Considering how cheesy and potentially disastrous the dialogue probably was, I thought they delivered it well. I assume the dialogue was cheesy only because I've watched enough fighting anime to tune out all but the worst of hammy speeches. (see Characters below).Story:Make no mistake about it, this is definitely a show for people who like shows about fighting.

Sure the &quot;half-demon&quot; thing is overused, but in a world where humanity is being devoured by darkness, something about the virtue of a man who is constantly at war with his (literally) inner demon and the traumatized little girl he has vowed to protect just seemed right.The ending was a little disappointing, mostly because I think it crossed that line of cliche over-the-topness, but eh, I've also seen much worse and more frustrating endings, so...Characters:The characters have some questionable dialogue sometimes, but otherwise I thought it was surprisingly solid if not pretty good. Again, experience had me already expecting much worse. I thought they captured the characters unique personalities pretty well and didn't go too overboard with any of them. I thought they did a good job with introducing Donovan, Anita, Demitri, Morrigan, Huitzel, Pyron and the sisters. Felicia, Talbain and Bishamon showed promise. Lord Raptor was pretty much just an odd cameo, so aside from him, I liked how they were handling use of the characters and not just rushing/stuffing everyone into the story in some contrived and insipid manner. For this reason I actually felt the story was too short. I would've liked to have seen this as a series and see them try to include all the characters and somehow tie them into the epic confrontation with Pyron.Art:I actually didn't think the art was that great for an OVA. I did like how they didn't get overly retarded with the designs and stayed mostly faithful to the game (both in characters and combat). So for that it still ranks high with me.Sound:The sound was fine, more surprisingly however was that the dub didn't make me want to gag. Considering how cheesy and potentially disastrous the dialogue probably was, I thought they delivered it well. I assume the dialogue was cheesy only because I've watched enough fighting anime to tune out all but the worst of hammy speeches."", ""There's this odd tendency to turn fighting game franchises into films, anime and even western cartoons. Usually with less than stellar results. What is it about fighting games specifically that results in all of these adaptations? Is it that most fighting games have little enough in terms of story and characterisation that studios figure they'll be easy to adapt without fan backlash? If that's the case you'd think they'd have learned their lesson long ago. Even before this was made. In any case, it's time to take a look at Madhouse's Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge and see where it falls on the adaptation spectrum.Our...story opens with Demitri planning an invasion of the demon realm. He's stopped by Morrigan who challenges him to a match because she's bored. Yes, really. Their fight is interrupted when a legion of Phobos robots appear. They spread across the planet seeking to exterminate all life forms. Meanwhile, Donovan, a half-vampire vampire hunter (How very original,) is on a journey of self-discovery when he encounters young Anita, a girl with a mysterious power who decides to follow him. While this is going on Felicia is going on tour, Lei-Lei and Lin-Lin are on a journey to save their mother's soul and... Yeah this OVA has a ton of sub-plots. I know that there are a lot of characters, but maybe it would've been a good idea to just stay focused on a small group. Especially when you've only got four episodes to work with. Most of the important plot elements revolve around Donovan, Anita, Lei-Lei and Lin-Lin anyway. Felicia's subplot in particular ends up being entirely pointless. Morrigan and Denitri ultimately contribute nothing either. They're pretty much only included because the fans love them. Now, I do understand wanting to make your fans happy, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the story. Honestly though, the story wouldn't be good even without the tangled mess of sub-plots, just less cluttered. It would still be largely derivative with too many flashbacks. The story mainly serves to take the characters from one fight to the next. That being said, a lot of the moments are kind of enjoyable just based on how over the top and cheesy they are. The ending in particular.As much as I enjoy the Darkstalkers games, most of the characters aren't very well used in this. Part of the problem is that the focus is on Donovan, quite possibly the dullest, most generic character in the franchise. There's also Anita, who has little personality in this and ends up serving as a maguffin rather than a fleshed out character. The only major characters in this I kind of like are Lei-Lei and Lin-Lin. They do get some really good moments and they have a lot more personality than Donovan or Anita. Morrigan, Demitri, Felicia, Zabel Zarock and Gallon could have been interesting but they're barely in the OVA and their appearances don't really contribute much. Speaking of under-used characters, Anakaris, Rikuo, Sasquatch and Victor all appear in this for a few seconds before being unceremoniously killed off. That doesn't seem like a very good idea when trying to appeal to your fans or were they deemed unpopular enough that no one would care?The art is rather varied. They incorporate a lot of the fight mechanics from the games into the actual battles, which usually leads to some strong, fluid action sequences, but there are some moves that just don't lend themselves well to animation and end up looking stilted and awkward. Particularly Morrigan's drill kick attack. Madhouse also does an excellent job drawing the characters as they are in the games. That being said, a lot of the designs were just poorly done to begin with. So, while I'm not going to fault the OVA for it, I am going to take a moment to rant about the designs in Darkstalkers. For example, why is Felicia largely a normal looking woman with cat elements while Gallon is more of a humanoid wolf? We've also got Donovan who just looks incredibly silly. We also have Zabel Zarock who brings some of the worst part of 90s comic design to mind He just needs a bunch of random pouches and shoulder pads to make the look complete. We also have Demitri's hair that is overly-gelled to make him look as much like a conehead as possible. Yeah, as much as I like the games the character designs leave much to be desired. That rant aside, the art in this is pretty solid. The only real issue, aside from the occasional stilted fighting move, are the facial expressions. Anita's nose disappears in a lot of shots, Morrigan's eyes get crossed a few times and her hair turns purple once, I think they're doing shading effects at the time but it just looks odd.One thing that's a bit odd is that the vocal cast from the games don't reprise their roles in the OVA. Still, the cast they did get does a good job. Miyamura Yuko does well as Lei-Lei. She may also be familiar to fighting game fans as Chun-li in the Alpha/Zero games and Seung Mina in Soul Edge. That's a strange coincidence. Okamata Maya and Yukana are both really good as well. The music in this is just great.The yuri factor is a 1/10. There's no yuri here.So, how is Darkstalkers' Revenge? Well, it's a goofy little OVA with some unintentionally funny moments, a story that's complete pants and well done fight scenes. It's certainly not good, but I wouldn't call it bad either. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. If you're a Darkstalkers fan you'll probably enjoy it well enough if only for the fight scenes. Otherwise I could really only suggest it if you just want some mindless action or if you have some friends over and want a good series to watch MST3k style. story opens with Demitri planning an invasion of the demon realm.

The main reason is because it had Morrigan Aensland on the picture, and I really like her on Marvel Vs. Capcom (the game). Also it have only 4 episodes, which is great for me (I really hate long animes. I'm in pain with Naruto, 17/220). Of course, having only 4 episodes makes it an OVA, and as some people say, OVAs have better drawings. In this case it's true, the drawings are really god. The story too is great. It really caught my attention.I think in the end I could compare it to the Streeth...Fighter series. It's not that kind of regular anime we have at bunchs. Even the animation looks different, like with some american influences (very similar to Street Fighter II). The characters are serious, you won't find any jokes or comedy like most of animes have.

I\'m not sure why, it just happened, but I\'ve praised the good (Fatal Fury 2), ranted about the bad (Battle Arena Toshinden), and speculated the disappointing (Street Fighter 2 V). Now I tackle the average.....The absolute average.It\'s apalling as to how middle-of-the-road Night Warriors actually is without being flat out awful. Back when Manga Entertainment first announced this in 1998, I was stoked. I played Darkstalker\'s Revenge religulously on the Sega Saturn and was certain that this game could surpass...Street Fighter on a gameglay level. So when I got my hands on volume 1 of the Night Warriors anime, I was blown away immediately by the visuals. As far as video game anime, this looks the very best, even by today\'s standards. The dark, moody atmosphere, the shading and black levels, all the characters look phenominally detailed. The animation is crisp and fluid, characters like Morrigan and Demitri striking familiar poses from the game. The fights are pretty top notch as well. But that\'s about it.For as great as a title can look, if you can\'t follow it with a credible story or engaging characters, you\'re just going to have something you can\'t possibly sink your teeth into. For as straightforward a plot that this show has, almost 78% of it\'s 4 episodes is devoted to waxing philosophical or fake political jargon amongst the Dark Ones and humans. There is a lot of dialouge in this, and most of it is nauseatingly dull and uninteresting. You\'ll find yourself wishing for a fight to break out (since this is based on a FIGHTING game), but even the action is rather lackluster. Each episode is roughly 40 minutes and at least 2 major action scenes will take place. And 1 of the two major scenes will involve 2 characters from the game battling each other to a stalemate. I am not exaggerating this. Instead of Anakaris the phaeroh versus Rikuo the fish man or Sasquatch the yeti versus Victor, Frankenstein\'s monster (these character\'s aren\'t even featured in the damn thing, btw), you get to witness Donovan fighting faceless thugs, Hsien Ko fighting faceless thugs, and Lord Raptor fighting......faceless thugs. Even Art of Fighting had characters from it\'s respective game squaring off with each other!! Watching one person lay waste to generic foot soldiers gets old very fast, and it usually leads to nothing.The show is only focused on four characters (Donovan, Demitri, Hsien Ko/Lei Lei, and Morrigan) and two villains (Alien Pyron and the Huitzil robots). But at no point throughout these episodes are you given a slight reason to actually care about their journey or what happens to any of them. It seems more like they want to defeat Pyron because the plot says so as opposed to some dire cause that was put in to motion by the bad guy. You know, almost ANYTHING WOULD WORK!!!!!!!!  The four ""good guys"" are all boring as all hell, a bridge game would spice up the tension. I\'ve never taken Pyron seriously as a villain, other characters like Felicia, Bishamon, and John Talbain are virtually wasted as mere cameos. Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture at least had a three act story. In Night Warriors, things are just happening for almost no explained reason as you just move on to the next scene. Aside from the brief bout between Demtiri and Morrigan way back in episode one, there is no other point that I can recall where anything picks up. Keep in mind, I think this is AVERAGE. *Sigh* At least the voice acting and the music are pretty good.IN CLOSING: Much like the terrible Tomb Raider movies with Angelina Jolie that ruined that franchise, I can only assume that this lackadasical anime offering was a death knell for Darkstalkers as very little has been heard from since. While it isn\'t as completely bad as most fighting game anime, boring characters, a sleep-inducing story, and a bad script makes Night Warriors such a yawn fest that it\'s no surprise they introduced a Little Red Riding Hood with machine guns to liven things up. You can make Morrigan and Felicia as curvy and revealing as you want and create Lilith to appeal to lolita fetishes, but Darkstalkers could never recover from this lame endeavor and will always be Street Fighter\'s whipping boy.STORY: 4ART: 9SOUND/VOICES: 8CHARACTERS: 3ENJOYMENT: 5OVERALL SCORE: 6 out of 10PROS: Beautiful animation, great voice acting and music, it\'s shortCONS: No plot, waste of characters, boring dialouge Street Fighter on a gameglay level.

Id personally put it up with the ranks of the Castlevania animated series in terms of quality. The animation is beautiful. While there are some times where it could look a little jank, most of the fights in it look stellar. Madhouse wasnt sleeping through this one. All the character designs are great. It has really solid pacing and it never feels boring. Its obviously not perfect though. This story doesnt really adhere to the whole show dont tell thing. I think Donovan is a great character. But there are many scenes where Hsien Ko and her sister...and literally just talking about his characterand the philosophy of why he does things. In that sense the writing tends to be really awkward. It presents really good themes and concepts to the viewer, but a lot of those themes are just spoken through hefty monologues by certain characters.

Liking the 2D fighting games would add to the experience.

Not nudity kind of fan service, though.The art and animation is quite good so you may like the show, but the characters and the story is as plain as in the game... here is where the ""fan service"" comes in: If you are a fan of the game (like myself) you will find yourself quite enjoying it because unlike other game adaptations the characters are actually using their game moves, using their special and combos and even the basic attacks. The fights are pretty well animated and you can really see Darkstalker in them... but if you never played the games...it might not impress you...The use of the roster is mid. They do show all characters but few play some relevant part, it would have been more interesting having more of them participating in the ending. Still, it\'s way better than modern game adaptations that instead of using characters from the game just introduce tons of new ones created by the director of the show and ignore the already existing ones that the fans would like to see...Also it seems it was supposed to have a sequel that wasn\'t made.

Deal with it!The season came to an end and I wanna write about it!For a series that I expected very little from, and still expected little from after season 1 it did not fail to deliver!When staring this series you have to know what you are going in to, and judge it for what it is. For what it is it\'s brilliant!About the characters:The jokes hit where they want them to hit, and a lot of that comes from Wooser\'s obvious but very charming personality and his way of interacting with the other characters. The relationship between Wooser, Ren and...Rin is actually on a certain level very deep in this season! They have a few moments when you expect it to turn goofy, but it doesn\'t! Those were handled very well and helped me getting really in to the characters.Darth Wooser is brilliant! Not only is he given more of a character, but a voice!And who voiced him?? Kamiya f*ck*ng Hiroshi! One of the most badass seiyuus today! The fact that 2 such great seiyuus voice 2 bunnies in a series like this is what makes it work!About the ""plot"":The few plotpoints that tied this together works really well! Especially the first and last episode! Opening the series with a realistic style and having Wooser remove the costume set the bar pretty high, and all tough they didn\'t keep it as high all the way through it was pretty damn close all the time! The episodes with emotional scenes really helped to even the season out which is what I thought season 1 lacked. This season could be over the top goofy at most points because of those moments.About the overall series:The other thing that really made this season is the mashups! They were there in season 1 but they really came to life here! Every episode introduces a really good co-op with another series that is usually very befitting of the characters! Wooser works great with them, and in some cases Miyano\'s own character makes an appearance! I waited through the ending song every week to see the conclusion of the mashups and it was always worth it! Speaking of the song, that is one of the best songs from Miyano ever! Having my own party to New order at the end of each episodes was just a blast!Going back to the beginning, you have to judge this series for what it is and what it tries to be. And for what it is it is just brilliant! Stepping it up like this in season 2 made it worth my time and a couple of re-watches!I am hoping for a season 3! I will now listen to the amazing ending song before going to bed and sleep for at least 10 hours!(which is a lot for me)Have a good one! Rin is actually on a certain level very deep in this season!

Yi Ren Jun Moye,https://myanimelist.net/anime/57656/Yi_Ren_Jun_Moye,"[""So it's your everyday super assassin that can take on 50 guys barehanded transmigrates into young master trash in wuxia world. And all the shenanigans ensues with conspiracies, power struggles, fight for the throne etc.Usual trope, but the main focus of the show that it is a comedy and exaggerated one. Sometimes it works and quite cute, but often it's like a joke repeated three times, which regretfully loses freshness and fun.It feels like show must have a decent plot, but few episodes are pointless comedy points and all the real stuff cramped in last rushed episodes. That is not saying all fun...episodes are pointless, like ones with family interactions show more depth to MC, but the pacing is somehow screwed.CGI is on point and the fights are cool, the facial expressions one of the best points in show and hold up the the comedic feel quite a bit.It's fine to watch if you don't judge it seriously, want some light fun and are numb to excessive amount of trope. episodes are pointless, like ones with family interactions show more depth to MC, but the pacing is somehow screwed.CGI is on point and the fights are cool, the facial expressions one of the best points in show and hold up the the comedic feel quite a bit.It's fine to watch if you don't judge it seriously, want some light fun and are numb to excessive amount of trope."", ""If you are used to looking at Isekai /reincarnation animes with the storyline of going to another world or timeline with the overpowered MP, this anime is that and a lot more too, UNFORTUNATELY.

How do you go from a top-rated super assassin that could take down a village of mobsters' tone to this outrageously exaggerated comedic childish one?

However, due to certain circumstances and an RPG projectile striking him as he handled a mysterious Pagoda he was reincarnated into Jun Moxie, a previously deceased trash - and the only son of the Jun Family - One of the four great families in the Tianxiang Kingdom. In the Jun Family, he is left with his Grandfather and Wheelchair-bound Uncle as his only blood relatives who work along with Jun Moxie to stay ahead of the problems that come their way. Jun Moxie adapts to his new life in...the Murim playing his role as the Jun family's Debauchee. Will he realize his goals or will he be eliminated by mysterious forces again?Story & Characters: 4/10Yi Ren Jun Moye makes it a point to break up the otherwise tense retribution story with light hearted characters and sudden bursts of unhinged moments.There doesn't seem to be a narrative maintained through to the end until the climax but in the beginning we see the goal for Jun Moxie and his family are to find out who was responsible for Jun Moxie's first death which we discover very early on in the series. As such, from then on the story becomes free style with smaller episodic activities occurring such as fighting bandit groups, solving mysteries, training new soldiers etc. I think this was a good approach for such a comedy driven narrative since we weren't dragged through the mud with all the unnecessary milestones.Jun Moxie and his friend group Dugu Xiaoyi and Tang yuan are an interesting assortment of main characters and they play their part in adding comedy well especially during fight scenes. The First young master of Li family Li Youran is also an interesting character who at first has not motives for his involvement in the Jun family but eventually after discovering more of the connections we understand he is a key character in the end. Overall, the named characters play their roles well as well whether for comedic or narrative driven purposes; They aren't discarded after a single episode but brought up in the background every few episodes which make their character grow on the viewer. Overall, Both character and story are appropriate for each other in terms of entertainment value.Art & Sound:When it comes to donghua CGI is the main source of animation and often times instead of high budget motion capture the CGI animation is done by keyframing. In this series it's obvious there is some high fidelity visuals but the keyframing is what this series could improve on - For the supposed budget it does seem very good overall.Sound is as expected of any series, I enjoy the effort each VA puts into their characters especially the VA behind Dugu Xiaoyi and Grandfather Jun who have extremes on opposing ends of the spectrum. Dugu Xiaoyi's VA is more snappy and girlish whereas Grandfather Jun is more demanding and desperate. Overall SFX is decent, the voice acting is really good though.Enjoyment & Overall:I really enjoyed this series for what it's worth, a comedy first series with hints of light hearted action and adventure. The ending was unexpected though and it does feel like something that could be more developed on before ending but the climax fight scene to end the series was very well orchestrated.

X/1999,https://myanimelist.net/anime/155/X_1999,"[""This movie is horrible. It is so bad that it's entertaining. If you've never read the manga or know nothing of the characters then it will make almost no sense. If you have however it's kind of amazing to watch it all pushed together. It's almost like watching a movie condensed into 30 seconds. Only it's a long overly complicated manga plot condensed to movie length with lots of barely explained fight scenes.It's CLAMP, so it's pretty. This is a given. But that's about all it has going for it when it comes to technical merit.SPOILER!!!Someone's head gets cut off practically every ten...minutes (or at least dies in some gruesome way). They fit the deaths of most of the cast into the movie. Someone should turn it into a drinking game.I think my mother summed it up best: &quot;Who are these people and why did they just kill each other? It looked like it was important for some reason.&quot; minutes (or at least dies in some gruesome way). They fit the deaths of most of the cast into the movie. Someone should turn it into a drinking game.I think my mother summed it up best: &quot;Who are these people and why did they just kill each other? It looked like it was important for some reason.&quot;"", ""I'll try to be objective without stating the conditions, my mood and my preferences when watching this movie. I'll just point out that when I wrote this review, I considered the fact that it is actually a summary of TV series compiled of 26 episodes and made in 1996 by CLAMP, a highly appreciated group of manga-ka.How to define what is a good anime? You consider the story and its development as a main point, the characters' originality and description, the animation and the drawing (although this can be an subjective point of view) and the sound as a whole - the voice acting and...the background music.The story in this movie, as well as in the series can be viewed only as an average and nothing new, even if we consider that this is an anime from 1996. The (un)conventional view of the ever-going fight between the good and the evil, which is never purely black and white. The moral and the reasons for choosing on one side or the other. The duality of people's choices and the world that we live in. All of these points are represented clearly, though not in a very original way.The actual development of the story is really different from the one in the TV series, but that's understandable considering the time frame. The story is taking a faster way of developing, it's has more blood-shed, and it's full of conflicts between the actors. And that is about all that is. It looks like it is just one big fight and it's background is depicted in a really hasty manner.Considering the large number of characters, there practically wasn't any time to tell each of their stories, even in the amount that it was done in a 26 episode series. You get the feeling that all that they're are about is filling up the story with action time and fights of the type everyone vs. everyone. And besides the genders and different fighting styles, there aren't many differences between the characters. So you ask why do you need 7 vs 7? Is 7 really a number that magical? It could've been done with just the main characters and the story would've been liberated of the ever-repeating fights that, of course, lead to the culmination in the last 10 minutes. Which is a fight with lots of blood shed, as well.The art is really good. From the drawing of the characters to the backgrounds and scenery, it's obvious that a lot of time and affection has been spent on it. The fights, including all the effects from sword slashing to sakura leaves flying around, are really a high point. The only thing that can be considered is the originality and the personal taste of the viewer.The background music is eerie throughout the movie and wonderfully backing up the blood-shed and the fights. But it gives an even darker light to the whole story and to the enjoyment of it all.So considering all this and hoping to stay objective to the end, my conclusion will be that this is an average version of a potentially great anime. And that is all. the background music.The story in this movie, as well as in the series can be viewed only as an average and nothing new, even if we consider that this is an anime from 1996.

And that is all."", 'Be warned: this review does contain a few spoilers. However, I tried very hard to keep it light.Also be warned that if you are planning to watch X, you should /not/ watch it as someone who has never /read/ X. You should read X first, then watch the movie. Otherwise you will not be able to understand or appreciate it at all. This review is, by the way, written with the assumption that you /have/ read X – but never fear, for there are very few actual spoilers for the manga and you may still read this review even if you haven’t read X. Now,...let us get on to the actual review…The majority of you are angry that X the Movie doesn’t follow X. But that’s because the majority of you are looking at the movie from the perspective of people who have read all eighteen volumes. You see, when I first started watching the movie, I went into it angry. I was ready to point out all the flaws I could possibly find.“No! No no no no no! Seishirou, Subaru, what are you doing!”“Subaru, you don’t walk around in shifuku! I think the animators confused you with Hokuto. Who has been dead for nearly a decade by this point so I don’t know how they could confuse you with her…actually…”“/No. What are you doing. Stop it. You’re both idiots/.”“No no no no no no noooo. Subaru, that is not your wish. And Seishirou, you’re just being downright rude. And stupid. Have I mentioned how stupid I think the two of you are?”“Whoa they turned into dragons!”~incomprehensible complaining, sobbing, raging ten minutes into the movie~“W-where is Kakyou?! Who is this brat?”“Whoa Yuzuriha, you’re pretty…forceful. I remember you being much bubblier and friendlier in the manga!”“Hey, Kusanagi. /What happened to you/. When did you become such a horrid brute?”“/What happened to your relationship with Yuzuriha/?!”“Well Fuuma…you’re just going on a rampage, aren’t you…”Half way through the movie, I realized something. And started laughing.X the Movie was released in 1996; by that time, the X manga was only up to about eight volumes. CLAMP is not about to spoil all their developments in a movie. How Subaru and Seishirou’s relationship resolves is one of the reasons a majority of people read X – how do you get that out of the way? /Especially/ since we don’t learn how their relationship ends until, oh, over five years later! The sensible way is to kill them off ten minutes into the movie, of course. Can’t get your hopes up too much, can we? While my heart aches, I can’t blame the directors or CLAMP since it was a rather grandiose move in order to keep X’s sixteenth volume a complete and, I might add, devastating surprise.Kusanagi is portrayed as a bastard, not because he is one, but because they can’t show what sort of relationship Kusanagi and Yuzuriha have later on. That would be spoiling it! As for Kakyou – I don’t think he was even introduced by the eighth volume, so they simply had to replace him with someone else. To be fair, whoever they replaced him with (I apologize, I already forgot his name, yes I know I’m horrible) looked quite similar to Kakyou. Another red herring, if I may say.So, basically, X the Movie is one gigantic troll.Distance yourself from X and you can see it. Even I, who loathe it when manga are taken and dissected into pieces and consequently abridged for anime format, managed to become objective and viewed X as simply…something separate from its manga counterpart. If you so desire to see it as such, you could even call X the Movie a really long trailer for X – or a “what could have been” version of X. You could even see it as a parody, if you want. A really bloody, messy parody.That aside, X the Movie is truly breathtaking. The art is beautiful. Here are the /real/ CLAMP characters – not the stiff, and, quite blatantly, often ugly art of the television series. The animation is wonderfully done and fluid. Now if only an anime series – true to the manga – could be released with this sort of quality! The character designs are completely and utterly true to their original counterparts. Seishirou is dashing as usual, Subaru is beautiful, Arashi is utterly gorgeous, Yuzuriha is adorable, Hinoto is stunning. I’d go into the other characters but that would take too long – I’m simply mentioning the ones that struck me with awe. The soundtrack is also quite solid; I can’t remember having any complaints about it. In addition, the seiyuu were quite fitting for all their characters.The visuals are very dark and mystical, as is fitting for X. Be warned, for there is…quite a bit of gore in X. In the television series, there was almost absolutely no blood, which was one of the major things that irritated me. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not a fan of gore at all. But X is filled with blood and guts and bones and pretty darn painful deaths, and if you’re planning to censor that, why make an anime series at all? The movie, written and released before the anime series, makes up for that.Those of you who, despite my warnings, will be going on to watch X the Movie (and have made it this far into my review) without reading X the manga must be warned – the characterization in the manga is different. The character development is different. The events displayed in the movie either did not occur or are not in chronological order. As I stated earlier – it is best if you read X before you watch the movie. Distance yourself. Know the characters. Know who they are. Watch, watch without getting angry – watch it the “right way”, and you will enjoy it.I know I did. I watched it and I don’t regret it in the slightest. I might even watch it again, if only for that beautiful art. let us get on to the actual review…The majority of you are angry that X the Movie doesn’t follow X.

It's the best start of familiarizing oneself with X. Those who already read manga probably won't be delighted. It certainly lacks depths of characters and between characters - or, does it really? For me, the depth of Kamui-Fuuma relation was obvious from the very start, as well as of some other people, even if it was only slightly pointed at. Apart from this...It's epic. Art. Psychology. Emotions. Despair, choices, fate, love, desire... Shattered glass, sakura petals, feathers, fire and water, holy swords...and chosen ones. Dreams, above all. Struggling for a future.Design is fantastic, much better than intv series. Music is... Well, I've never heard so psychedelic sound in any movie. It stays in your mind forever. The plot is so minimalist and so rich at the same time.

I haven't seen the TV series yet, however based on what I've read here, it doesn't seem like that's a requirement. Whether or not the actual series is better, however, is not in question here. What is in question here is the quality and source of enjoyment from this movie, and in that regard I found very little.The story seemed rehashed, recycled, and overused. Boy comes back home, meets childhood friends (one a girl who he's obviously still enamored with even after the six years he's been gone), has childhood friends taken away from him, and finds out he...can save the world.

The one that condenses the entire story in 90 minutes, and thus makes less sense than America’s gun regulations? I really love the thing. The anime. Not the fact that America has bad standards in terms of gun control.You guys might say that the main reason for me loving this trash is related to how I love the type of post-apocalyptic story that makes up X, but I’ve shown in the past to be really harsh on premises that I like but don’t deliver – insert rant about how White Fox shows suck here. You...could say that I know the characters and how things play out in actual story due to my love for the TV show – which I saw prior to seeing this – but I couldn’t get through the Diebuster movie despite loving the original OVAs, so that’s not a good answer either. I’m sure it helped though.No, the main reason I love this movie is how it pulls off its badness with so much style. I compare the film to Guilty Crown in the title above because it does many of the same things that made the show work for its fans – irony or not be damned. It’s well-animated, has characterization so rushed that it feels like the plot was made up as it went, and goes to really dumb territory that you can’t help but become entertained by it, even if it’s just to laugh at it. Basically, everything that made that show loved by its fans condensed into a more tolerable 90 minutes. Does that paint enough of a clear picture for you?If you’re one of those who’ve never seen Guilty Crown, let me elaborate further: I love the movie because it’s an epic mess treated with such seriousness to the point it’s hilarious, and has a beautiful visual style to please me as a fan of animation and make me overlook said plot deficiencies. In order to make the “epic war between those who want to save the Earth despite its imperfections and those who to destroy the Earth and build a new one” fit in such a short length, it kills off its characters quickly before you even get the chance to know them and doesn’t really look back on ‘em afterwards. The fights themselves are very well done, and the deaths involve a ton of blood and sometimes occur through beheadings. Hilarious beheadings. Try watching a character get their head chopped off and not laugh at the ridiculousness. The stuff in-between that cool stuff is full of your usual Clamp dialogue. I know some people aren’t a fan of that “Unmei! Kaihen!” stuff that the movie partakes in, but I personally thought the dialogue was enough to give you an idea of what was happening without really establishing anything. And really, a movie that relies mostly on stylistic action for its appeal doesn’t need that sort of establishment. If anything, that’d just make the film harder to sit through.I’ve seen the movie three times and I think my affection for it increased each time. Still prefer the TV show despite the fact that it has the opposite problem of being too long, but god this thing was equal parts awesome and comedy gold. Decapitations usually are. Especially when the movie ends with a whiny douche crying at how his happiness is gone whilst cradling his best friend’s head.

Kaihen!” stuff that the movie partakes in, but I personally thought the dialogue was enough to give you an idea of what was happening without really establishing anything. And really, a movie that relies mostly on stylistic action for its appeal doesn’t need that sort of establishment. If anything, that’d just make the film harder to sit through.I’ve seen the movie three times and I think my affection for it increased each time. Still prefer the TV show despite the fact that it has the opposite problem of being too long, but god this thing was equal parts awesome and comedy gold. Decapitations usually are. Especially when the movie ends with a whiny douche crying at how his happiness is gone whilst cradling his best friend’s head. School Days has nothing on this shit.', ""SPOILER WARNING !!

This movie was for me the 1st time  very unexcpected and twisty by storyline, bought it on tape back in 1998. Clamp´s animation style kicked off with this movie worldwide and was moderatly praised, Good animation style nice 3/d scenes, very interesting charachter development. The internal struggle of some persons and supernatural fights involved are some of the best i´ve seen ever! and the dark turnaround of good and evil. just classic ', ""The movie is a much better adaptation than the series. It has excellent storytelling, huge proportions, and one of the best endings of its time. The entire point of the movie is that human actions are ultimately pointless. Keep in mind that I saw the movie before the horrible anime series that was a complete betrayal. The movie is very dark and fatalistic, it is about the future being inevitable and human actions being insufficient to prevent it from coming about. Everyone who is pulled into this cycle of death and destruction in the never ending war between the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons...of Earth is killed, and they are killed simply so that their deaths can have no meaning. The only ones who ever know that some people died to save mankind from the people who died to try ending mankind are the ones who kill each other. For everyone else, life moves on as if nothing happened. All the loss is encapsulated and known only to Kamui. Kamui himself has only two goals, to protect his childhood friend Fuma and his childhood love Kotari. His choice to become a Dragon of Heavens is based on his desire to protect the only two things he cares about, his childhood friend Fuma and his childhood love Kotari and yet this very choice also dooms those two to die. Kamui must kill his best friend in order to protect his best friend. If he refused to kill his best friend then he would doom his best friend to death.Or looked at another way, Kamui must choose to kill the only two people he cares about in order to protect the billions of people living in the world he doesn't care about. He must lose everything and everyone he has ever known in order for everything to stay the same. In that sense the story is as much about fatalism as it is about a misinterpreted prophecy. The actual eternal war between the Dragons of Heaven and Earth becomes merely the fever dream of a false prophet, a false prophet who sends out people to die simply so that everything can remain the same as it would had they not died. There is no eternal war, just 7 people who kill each other because they believed that a little girl could see the future. And the future she saw was simply them dying. Thus the locations she believes are the lynchpin they need to protect in order to protect Tokyo are actually the places were the two sides will kill each other.

The art is pretty solid with some flashes of brilliance here and there, but sometimes there are also some inconsistencies in the animation that make things look overly stiff or the continuity of certain shots back to back don\'t line up.One thing I can say for certain, is that the big tree spirit actually kind of looks better than the CGI in Shield Hero season 2 on that dumb tortoise. All that said,...\'okay\' animation shouldn\'t always hinder ones enjoyment of a show or series.(Also, I can respect the tiny bit of extra effort going into some backgrounds, like the basketball hitting the rim and people not looking completely lifeless)Other than the \'shaky at times\' animation, the story isn\'t particularly that interesting so far. There isn\'t a main story plot line that has been set in motion to hook it\'s audience. Yet again it\'s the ""I\'m an average high schooler who sits by the window, OH MY GOD, who\'s this random goddess!"" trope. Also the comedy doesn\'t always land, because these jokes have been so played out.For characters, they have way too much room to grow because they aren\'t being fleshed out much. Our MC is supposed to be a talented young cook and he is, but it\'s just a gimmick to make him more interesting and to make him match with the puny goddess with a huge appetite. Also he does try to get away from her in the first episode, but right after, they form this unbreakable bond way too quickly. Very much cliché. All characters are kind of lacking and I haven\'t really found a reason to care about them yet.Regardless of the large amount of criticism, basically its another okay anime that has some potential that probably will go unfulfilled, that you can still sorta enjoy :). \'okay\' animation shouldn\'t always hinder ones enjoyment of a show or series.(Also, I can respect the tiny bit of extra effort going into some backgrounds, like the basketball hitting the rim and people not looking completely lifeless)Other than the \'shaky at times\' animation, the story isn\'t particularly that interesting so far.

It is definitely not awful in any way, but it is not spectacular in any way either.Plot: Ah Jie is making ramen one day, when his creation summons a spirit, Dora, into his realm. Dora, being a goddess, guilts Ah Jie into signing a contract with her in order for him to share he powers and become a Summoner.I wish I had more to write in...terms of plot, but there's really not much else than that going on. The story that they were originally following, dealing with the main villains of the story, was really only relevant for about 1 1/2 episodes. Most of the airtime is just tedious showing off of the abilities (which granted are cool sometimes), meeting new people, and then competing in basically a fantasy Olympics.Dora was definitely the best character, being cute and rambunctious, having enough personality to really make up for everyone else's lack of it. Hana is bland, Stan is just...odd but in a kind of useful way since his power is kind of cool, Miaowu is cute but kind of gets the short end of the stick in terms of spotlight. Ah Jie isn't too terrible of a character, but at the same time, he lacks a lot of personality, and I dislike the fact that as the villains are training, he just...never does...yet somehow always knows new abilities to use. I know they explain that you have to battle/fight with instinct in the series, but he just uses a new ability with each attack and spewing out kind of random names for each of them.The backstory with Ah Jie's parents as well as the storyline with the villains, just both got shelved and ignored for the most part. If this were a 24 episode series than maybe it is something that would have been able to get more showtime, but as it is, they both just got completely dumped and pushed to the back.My main issue, other than the lack of story, is the inconsistency with animation and voice acting. While the animation was really good in some parts, it was also super laggy/buggy looking at some parts. It is the same with the Voice Acting. Often times the voices are fine and have no issue, then just suddenly they sound so horrible audio wise and it is just really bothersome how inconsistent it is with quality.The Last Summoner can probably raise on my and a lot of other peoples rankings if it just fixes those inconsistencies, as well as the lack of story. I would watch a season 2 if it ever releases (Likely to since this was actually really popular in China) since the ending of this first season felt more like a midseason break rather than a season finale. I want to learn more about Ah Jie's parents and who he really is, and I would gladly continue and raise my rank should they actually add more information in this field.Animation: 5/10Art: 6/10Characters: 5/10Plot: 4/10Voice Acting: 3/10 terms of plot, but there's really not much else than that going on.

If this were a 24 episode series than maybe it is something that would have been able to get more showtime, but as it is, they both just got completely dumped and pushed to the back.My main issue, other than the lack of story, is the inconsistency with animation and voice acting. While the animation was really good in some parts, it was also super laggy/buggy looking at some parts. It is the same with the Voice Acting. Often times the voices are fine and have no issue, then just suddenly they sound so horrible audio wise and it is just really bothersome how inconsistent it is with quality.The Last Summoner can probably raise on my and a lot of other peoples rankings if it just fixes those inconsistencies, as well as the lack of story. I would watch a season 2 if it ever releases (Likely to since this was actually really popular in China) since the ending of this first season felt more like a midseason break rather than a season finale. I want to learn more about Ah Jie's parents and who he really is, and I would gladly continue and raise my rank should they actually add more information in this field.Animation: 5/10Art: 6/10Characters: 5/10Plot: 4/10Voice Acting: 3/10"", ""I got pleasant words.

Xiao Mo Tou Baolu La!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50411/Xiao_Mo_Tou_Baolu_La,"['If this show could be summarized with one word, it would be: underwhelming.I’ve read the webcomic this donghua is based on and I enjoyed that. The webcomic is colorful and full of life despite being still images. That is not present in the donghua. The colors feel a little stale compared to the webcomic and the stiff animation doesn’t really help. But let’s just say that the reason for this is a lower-budget. The story structure has no excuse.Most anime have 22-25 minute long episodes. Usually it takes around the first few episodes to introduce important characters and the setting, but this show takes the...entire season to do that. Busted Darklord only adapts one webcomic chapter per episode, which means the story moves super slow. So this entire season is basically just exposition. The show suffers because its episodes are so short. Shorter episodes are common for most of the donghua I’ve watched, but they’ve all managed to get the exposition done no later than halfway through the season.While this isn’t inherently a bad adaptation of the webcomic and isn’t a terrible show in its own right, the way it is structured makes it lose points. If the premise of the show does actually interest you, I would suggest reading the webcomic instead as the story is better executed there and the more interesting parts of the story have already been written. entire season to do that.

Not long ago, about twenty days ago, I\'ve started to read Xiao Mo Tou Baolu La!, or Busted! Darklord. Not long afterward, I\'ve dug deeper into the rabbit hole, and I found this anime, an anime adaptation of a weirdly enough, entertaining ""harem"". Positive about this anime, the story...follows the source material & have the basic Chinese Manhua martial art feel, the negative part about the storytelling is that it hasn\'t reached the peak of the Manhua yet. Why is it a negative point? The Manhua digs deeper into topics like ""This party is gender-specific"" & ""Your NSFWs are not permitted in this party, you are under arrested"", the topics get way deeper into the history of mankind, and the unspoken parts of most, if not all martial arts/demon hunting shows. Overall, the story was quite well executed, the plot twist can sometimes be confusing, but it doesn\'t get in the way of the plot enough to stop it from advancing, a solid seven out of ten.Art (7/10):Art is similar & crisp like the Manhua. The only point I disliked was the animation SOMETIMES being lazy and feels like it cuts corners at less important sections of the story, overall, not bad, but nothing to write home about either.Sound (7/10):Voice acting was superior to most other Manhua adaptions, the overall sound effects were great, I personally didn\'t really like the OP, it was not the genre/type of music I like, but it doesn\'t make the show unbearable, and overall the OP was bad is just my opinion. And currently, there are only Chinese, and I haven\'t managed to find an English subtitles version yet, so good luck to everyone who doesn\'t understand Chinese.Character (4/10):Of course, just like the Manhua, this ""harem""/ecchi anime doesn\'t offer fantastic characters, this is more of a comedic show, so I didn\'t expect much of it anyways, and overall, the side characters always get pushed to the side. The side character introductions & return is way better in the later chapters of the Mahua though, so I am looking forward to that.Enjoyment 8/10):I liked the Manhua, so I liked it.Overall (6.4/10):Overall, even though I liked it a lot, the highest I can give is still just a seven, it does have cliche plot writing & easily guessable plot twists that you ""totally don\'t see it coming"", and at the end of the day, it is still a ""parody of"" harem animes. An entertaining show & that is all.Recommend? Depends, I will say, wait for English subtitles, or just read the Manhua from Bilibili Comics app, the anime doesn\'t offer new content, except for making the world more immersive & lively(Visually). If you liked the original Manhua, then go for it, if you like harems, then it\'s a 100% yes, it offers a unique spin to harem/ecchi shows. Who will I not recommend it to? People who want a solid plot that have great impacts on each action the character does and will affect the story heavily if they failed to do what was expected, or people who want to watch just a pure harem, this offers more than just a pure harem, so if you only like lust scenes, don\'t go for this show. follows the source material & have the basic Chinese Manhua martial art feel, the negative part about the storytelling is that it hasn\'t reached the peak of the Manhua yet.

I didn\'t have any doubts about the transition from manga to anime; I was excited to see it come to life. Decades later, rewatching it in its entirety, the ending theme brought back memories, and I felt a wave of nostalgia. I used to hold a tape recorder close to the TV speaker to record and listen to it repeatedly.This anime, which predates Initial D by over 10 years, was the only manga at the time that portrayed the allure of cars. The...idea of using ""Nitro"" as fuel was mind-blowing. The animation and script might not be as refined as in modern anime, but for us kids in 1984, it was more than enough, and we eagerly looked forward to watching it every week. It became a standard Japanese anime for me. In that sense, it deserves a solid 5 out of 10 as a baseline score.However, the anime doesn\'t delve deeply into cars or provide detailed explanations of driving techniques like Initial D does. But if you\'re interested in experiencing the vibrant atmosphere of 1980s Japan, I recommend giving it a go. idea of using ""Nitro"" as fuel was mind-blowing.

Ueno-san wa Bukiyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37920/Ueno-san_wa_Bukiyou,"['I feel as if the title of this anime should be changed from ""How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno"" to ""How horny you are, Miss Ueno.""As the synopsis suggests, Ueno-san is ""in love with the concept of falling in love."" Our main trio of students consists of Tanaka, Yamashita, and Ueno herself, as they spend their time in the science club together testing out various inventions that Ueno has prepared in advance for the oblivious Tanaka. The premise sounds simple enough, right? Well, unless you enjoy watching junior high students participate in blatantly crude sexual gags with the follow up of loud nervous breakdowns, feel...free to pass this one up with ease. Now for the following...Jumping into every episode, we are greeted with Ueno introducing her new invention to the viewers with a complex narration of said device for around a minute or so, only to then use it in an attempt to explore her obsession with ""the concept of falling in love."" I quote this because apparently to Ueno, the experience of falling in love is achieved through involving your panties as many times as humanly possible, getting yourself along with other side characters to participate in absurdly unfunny sexual situations, and to yell as embarrassingly as you can whenever you get the chance. Seriously, if the show sees even the slightest opportunity to take advantage of this potty like humor, it will try as much as it can for the sake of a gag, and absolutely fails to make me laugh even once. With our main bro Tanaka, wholly uninterested and oblivious to the motives of Ueno, this rinse and repeat cycle continues for 12 whole episodes. Luckily these episodes only last for half the amount of airing time as standard episode length, so it could have been worse.Other than that, there really isn\'t much more to add. The shows art is fairly basic, and the characters play their roles accordingly of an over the top tsundere, a dense male interest, and a dull robot.

While some shows go out of their way to force this sort of stuff, and Ueno-san admittedly at times can too, the bulk of these have a simple source: the infinite horniness of Ueno-san, and how much she loves her...beloved kouhai. Most of her inventions are attempts at getting him closer to her or to get him to do perverse things to her. Her manner is pretty interesting to watch as it's not just about her trying to lewd him all the time, but rather her mindgames in trying to get him to lewd her, which is what she really so badly wants.However, she happens to be a complete and utter tsundere and even when she gets what she wants she ends up overreacting and running away unable to deal with the strong emotions that are in her heart. Despite how over the top her character is, she feels genuine and manages to feel like a real character. When she is dealing with problems that relate to other club's that go to her for help she manages to treat them seriously and do her best to help out. She isn't just her infinite horniness, even if it is a large part of her. After all she is a teenager and she is experiencing strong emotions for the first time, and it's not unnatural to not know what to do with them. So while over the top her emotions make sense to me, and I find myself able to relate to her and her struggles in trying to get closer to her love and get the things she wants without being so forward about it.Furthermore the jokes are able to have a good amount of variety and are able to focus on a wide array of different lewd actions and romantic actions rather than focusing on the same items over and over again. The wide array of her inventions allow for a diversity in what happens depending on what she wants to get Tanaka to do at that time.And while a dense harem MC can be frustrating at times the sheer denseness of Tanaka is quite humorous especially with how obvious Ueno is. It also helps that because Ueno is such a tsundere, it's not like either of them are making that many serious attempts to showcase their love. Nor is it like she is losing because he is so dense. And besides I feel the sometimes sweet and off the top of his head statements that he is prone to making is exactly what she likes about him. Because with all of his denseness he manages to make these statements that light her heart on fire, without even trying to do so in the first place. Not to mention the denseness actually does a great job for the straight man role that most japanese comedies have. With his denseness he is able to fill this role without feeling too over the top and unnatural in it. He states normalcy and acts the most normal of the bunch without overdoing it or putting too much weight on the joke in his words. While he fills the straight man role, he doesn't become nothing but a straight man, and manages to fit into that role naturally due to who he is.And this denseness creates an interesting mindgame dynamic. While some other shows have the main romantic leads face off against each other and try to outwit each other, Ueno's mindgames aren't battles of wits, they're battles of who is the dumbest. Ueno's plans are good but she manages to sabotage herself almost every time. Tanaka isn't even trying to mindgame, rather his sheer denseness works in his favor as he manages to go against her plans with sheer density. Despite this, the mindgames don't have a clear power structure. Ueno often gets her wants in a round about way due to Tanaka's denseness. It may not be the way she wanted but it still warms her heart and brings her closer to him.Even thought her plans fail their closeness grows with each one. Even in their interactions it's easy to see how close they are. Despite Ueno's weird requests Tanaka often humors her and goes along with them. Despite Ueno getting overloaded, she does get some of the love and interaction that Tanaka desires. Her plans may fail, but often she doesn't go empty handed. And when it comes down to it Tanaka does try his best for her, and it's sweet.Also I have to mention Yamashita who is a great wingman and does her best for Ueno. The dynamic between the two of them is also quite nice as they do care about each other and do try to help each other.Overall Ueno is a great comedy and a great romance. With some fun gags, some fun mindgames, and some great characters. Ueno is the highlight of the show, and it's so much fun watching her demanding tsundereness and all of her adorable over the top reactions to everything.

Should have recalled the cat died for it.The first gag is about Ueno wanting people to drink her pee... Plot of the century. Apparently it\'s her way to show some type of affection/love confession to this Tanaka dude, who is pretty dense, btw. Lots of pee and love related stuff goes down here (in the literal sense of the phrase, unfortunately), but I am not sure where the fun in here is supposed to be.Turns out rest of the series is highly similar to this first...sketch. Rom-com between Ueno the weirdo and Tanaka the dense, gags being bizarre and often centering around some sort of perverses. Nothing I would go against by default, but I am just not laughing.. at all. Not even once.I was utterly bored by the pantsu scenes and Ueno\'s over exaggerated anime reactions where she yells like some sort of loli tsundere voiced by Rie Kugumiya or some equally lame shit.

Well, this is one of them.Which is to say, this is an inappropriate comedy that manages to stay classy and not devolve into outright vulgarity. The source of gags is absurdity of situations and absurdity of character interactions, which, on the other hand, brings it closer to the stuff like Asobi Asobase. Also be mindful that it’s that specific type of anime comedy where they find a billion ways to tell the same exact joke differently.The heroine is a middle-school girl inventor that could’ve easily propelled humanity a millennium forward if she wasn’t too busy with...romantic plots like trying to force the male lead to drink her (purified) urine, which in her adolescent maiden’s mind is something akin to an indirect kiss.The hero is genuinely autistic in an actual medical sense of the term, on a high-functioning end of the spectrum. He isn’t just dense to heroine’s advances - he’s not familiar with the concept of romance or boy-girl relationship (and can’t tell boys and girls apart to begin with).The supporting cast are colorful weirdos, some of them are blatantly copied from Monogatari, at least as far as character design is concerned. The show wears this on its sleeve, in fact, the similarities are incorporated into the show’s comedy - some gags are based on subverting your expectations of how the corresponding Monogatari character will act in a given situation.Also, there are plenty of moments of genuine romantic fluff that makes you go “aww”, further driving home SYD comparison. The OP and ED songs (there are 3 different ones of the latter) are likewise cute and fluffy. The season ends on a high note of PROGRESS.The only downside is 10 minutes per episode format, the comedy is strong and varied enough to carry full-length episodes, so it feels like a wasted opportunity.9/10 for a comedy show that knows what it does and does it well. romantic plots like trying to force the male lead to drink her (purified) urine, which in her adolescent maiden’s mind is something akin to an indirect kiss.The hero is genuinely autistic in an actual medical sense of the term, on a high-functioning end of the spectrum.

The twist is that instead of conventional ways she tries to awaken various fetishes like pee/sweat fetish,foot fetish,big boob fetish etc in the mind of the kouhai and hilariously fails at it.Most of the time...you would be left thinking,""If only this would happen to me!""The character designs are surprisingly well done for a short anime.Don\'t miss this one,the episodes are not that long anyway! you would be left thinking,""If only this would happen to me!""The character designs are surprisingly well done for a short anime.Don\'t miss this one,the episodes are not that long anyway!', ""This anime is a girl named Ueno that create some machines, and with these machines, she tries to make Tanaka Fall in love with her, but how, that's the strange part.[MINORS SPOILERS]One word explains Ueno, pervert.

Bit of minor spoilers mind you.The plot revolves around three high school students and their science club activities, but of course its no ordinary activity nor are the studentsMeet our main female Mc, Ueno who is a fanged tsundere girl with a strong attitude,clumsy...ofc, a bit perverted and most importantly a fucking genius.A genius in creating Bizarre,crazy and amazing Inventions, which could uplift and help mankind into a better future. But who cares for mankind as the personal  her junior and the male mc Tanaka.Tanaka lets say is another of a normal but  top tier dense, blockhead Mc of all time. Ofc i termed him blockhead is for the his continuous aloofness and ignorance of Uenos advances.But Ueno on the other hand is not so normal in her advances, as her idea of conveying feelings of love is messed up or rather to get to the point she tries to appeal with her kinky,thirsty feminine side with weird ass fetishes.Yep fetishes like stockings, panties, swimsuits even urine and sweat and the list just goes on.The inventions which are the main tools of attracting Tanaka are at first seemingly brilliantly amazing if applied and looked at normally,its explained by the narrator in a really good way too.But then comes the true perverted motive behind explained by ueno, how she can use it to awaken Tanaka's manly perverted side and divert it towards her.For example a invention to create urine and sweat into drinking water (her urine for tanaka to drink ofc), or to make stockings turn into a pet or a stocking as a  phone charger. (you see where i am going)This is just the start of the comedy, the real fun starts when Tanaka in his simple curiosity gets baited into using the inventions, which either causes him to screw up the purpose of the invention in his simplicity or cause physical contact with ueno who is the perverted mind but all of a sudden turns into a maiden of heart with his touch with her shy and girly side awakened which of course causes nervous breakdown in her and in the end the plan to fail hilariously.Finally we have our third support character Yamashita, Ueno's assistant. A normal character, but with some good rare comedic outbursts, antics and dialogues.She knows whats ueno's upto and supports her cause, but sometimes ends up as the guinea pig for her inventions or sometimes the poor victim of the failures. But best thing is she is a wingman & always save Ueno's ass on time. literally.There are other side characters too mainly which are all girls, who are mostly weird  and sometimes present weird sexual kinky innuendos, but in a series is like this its pretty normal and quite adds up quite nicely to the plot.Apart from the weird, crazed fill comedy, there are some rare sweet moments which are delightful and worth it. That's what made me like this show even more.Animation is quite decent, clear cut drawings and bright colors, makes it look a kid show but definitely serves the purpose of the series.The ED which has three different Versions which have great visuals, good sound track and amazing creativity which caught my eye. example constellations in a dark sky made in the designs of Ueno's InventionsThat was particularly interesting and really well done.Another feature i liked was Ueno's VA performance, her delivery of random lines and the ones where Ueno is supposed to be nervous, anxious or the likes really helps to complete Ueno's personality.In the end i would say, the only downside to this is its a short series of 12 minutes. wish it was longerbut if you have a good capacity for really bizzare,a bit vulgar, weird  but good comedy which can really make you enjoy and laugh your ass out.

And while I'm not naive enough to think that middle schooler don't like sex jokes, here it's a bit too much and their age make everything feel a...bit creepy.Overall it's not that terrible, if you like the humor you will probably find the show enjoyable, but if like me you don't then that plus the characters' age make it really not worth watching. bit creepy.Overall it's not that terrible, if you like the humor you will probably find the show enjoyable, but if like me you don't then that plus the characters' age make it really not worth watching."", ""I started watching one episode and couldn't stop.

The proportions and anatomy checked out too. The environments (mostly the science room) looked good. No nature showcases or panoramics. Impact shots looked fine. Facial expressions were way too cute. Supporting details and extras also looked good and were nice additions that the manga didn't have.Overall, the art quality was pretty good and there wasn't too much for me to complain about. The art was adapted well from the manga.Animation: 7/10Animation was pretty nice too. General motions looked fluid. Gestures and natural movements...looked believable. Quick sequences looked good too. No selective framing, dropping frames, shortcuts, etc. Not really any impact sequences.

I thought this show did a great job in giving life and personality to the characters from the manga, especially the main character, Ueno. The VA for Ueno really deserves praise for how well she did voicing Ueno.Plot & Development: 6/10Follows the manga pretty closely while taking some liberties in presentation to add punch or flair. Outside of the adaptation and just looking at the narrative itself, this story surprisingly has a lot of adult themes. It doesn't hold back any punches when it comes to deliberate service shots or lewd content, but the humor is very slapstick and cute. If there's one thing I like about this show is how cute the reactions of Ueno were. Overall, a fine adaptation.

I liked some of the ED's.Conclusion: 5/10Adaptations of episodic stories turn out like this usually; not really introducing a lead-up to a conclusion and just ending the show as is. That's fine. There wasn't a dedicated conclusion really. The end of the show was just the end of the last particular skit that was adapted. One example of recent memory was Asobi Asobase.Overall: 6/10This was mostly just a personal taste sorta thing. I really liked how cute Ueno and her shenanigans were.

Using her high-tech nifty inventions, she tries to get him to think sexually about her, like looking at her panties, groping her, or even hold hands!Naturally, this always backfires on her, but not always how you would expect it.Ueno is a tsundere who can't confess to Tanaka, so she will try to get his attention in ridiculous, overly complex, and hilarious ways. However, this boy Tanaka is so dense, black holes are...jealous of him. Whereas this would usually just make him annoying, here it makes him so annoying, that it becomes funny.Yes, this anime has a crude sense of humor. The very first segment is about drinking purified urine. Others have jokes involving sexual harrasment (that is always a direct consequence of someones actions). But what keeps it funny is how outrageous it can be. The anime has a rather light-hearted tone, and its short length makes it an easy watch.Animation-wise, not much to write home about, as the animation itself is pretty simplistic and limited. The character designs are very decent though, especially those of Ueno and Tanaka, as they complement their personalities.Sure, this type of show might not speak to everyone, but if you feel like watching something easy, but fun, maybe you should give it shot.

All episodes are around 12 minutes long and that is great.With episodes this short you can just sit back and enjoy whatever is going on without everything feeling dragged out.The bigger problem with the anime is that it has a lot of sexual stuff, not enough to be considered echhi but still it has some minor stuff. This wouldn't...be a problem but the thing is, due to the art style, the characters look like kids. So it's really uncomfortable at some points.Still I think watch it if you don't have anything else to watch. It's dumb, it's simple and it's great for when you want to watch something short and somewhat enjoyable. be a problem but the thing is, due to the art style, the characters look like kids.

It seemed like it\'d be a decently funny slice of life comedy that I might get a few cheap laughs out of. What did we get? A short, unfunny waste of time. I figured since I have yet to a review a show of shorter episode time length, I\'ll give this a shot. Without further adieu, here\'s my review on aforementioned show.To start off we\'ll begin with the story, there isn\'t much here due to the nature of Ueno-san but I\'ll elaborate so you guys...can get the gist of it. The basic premise is more or less a group of middle school students in a Science club create new experiments . Ueno subjects the other two, Tanaka mainly, to her concoctions in some sort of elaborate ruse to get Tanaka to partake in lewd actions of affection towards Ueno. Meanwhile, Yamashita is mostly a bystander of the others shenanigans. This repeats for the entirety of the 12 episodes, with each episode split up into two separate experiments. It\'s fairly simple and non-convoluted if that\'s up your alley, but with it being impeccably formulaic, watching one episode is basically seeing all of them.Next up is the characters, with there being three main characters. Ueno is uh, a rather perverse character. As I mentioned before, she has a crush on the male MC Tanaka. Her experiments ranged from trying to make Tanaka consuming her urine to him eating her panties (alright Japan). Anytime her crush is finally about to go through with her experiments she chickens out and REEEEEE\'s in typical tsundere loli fashion. Tanaka himself is either the biggest airhead savant ever created or just so fed up with Ueno\'s shit that he acts like he\'s completely unaware of her intentions. I honestly can\'t pick between the two and I probably don\'t wanna know. It\'s not so much of a dynamic of his personality, it\'s more so of a driving force in the shows ""plot"". Not really much of you can describe about him other than that it got old quick. Yamashita is long-line character in the deadpan trope. These characters are always hit or miss for me, and it\'s on the latter end of that spectrum this time around. She gives me hints of Yuki from Haruhi and Mai from Nichijou. More or less there to play along with Ueno\'s shenanigans, she as well doesn\'t contribute much of anything.Lastly, I\'ll group the art and sound/ost together: Honestly, there isn\'t much to complain about here, it\'s incredibly run of the mill in both categories. Nothing really stands out in a good or bad way; it\'s just there.Pro\'s-Short run time, so even if it\'s not your cup of tea you can finish it in a couple of hours at mostFalls along of absurdist comedy, which I typically enjoy unfortunately not in this caseCon\'s-Jokes are incredibly off-puttingCharacters are quite badFormulaic nature ruins the longevity of the showRecommendations: Takagi-san; a more light-hearted sweeter version of this show without the lewd jokes.Asobi Asobase; A group of middle school girls doing shenanigans in their club-has more mature styled comedy like Ueno-san.Thanks again, for reading my reviews everyone.

But this... is just annoying. Sure each of these episodes in 10 minutes long with 2 short stories, but with zero character development, it gets tiring. I can\'t even imagine watching all of this in one sitting. I would rather watch a lot of more interesting anime from 4-koma anime. It is extremely repetitive and probably the worst anime I watched this season.  The best part of it is that maybe once in a while, it\'s pretty funny, but that\'s kind of it.Overall, light and fun, but...gets old really quick. gets old really quick.', ""*Short Non-Spoiler Review*Not like this anime has anything to spoil though....Firstly, what I liked about this anime:- Kind of funny at times- Had a decent amount of side characters to mix things up- Had animation that was okay for a short animeWhat I didn't like about this anime:...- The tsundere troupe is used here, and it's not cute, but annoying- The story for each episode is somewhat repetitive, since it always follows the same concept, and it gets boring over time- I didn't find any of the characters to be interesting in any wayIn summary, don't waste your time with it, unless if you're looking for something to kill time on, and have nothing else better to do. Definitely not comedy of the season, but you might find something that could make you smirk, at best. - The tsundere troupe is used here, and it's not cute, but annoying- The story for each episode is somewhat repetitive, since it always follows the same concept, and it gets boring over time- I didn't find any of the characters to be interesting in any wayIn summary, don't waste your time with it, unless if you're looking for something to kill time on, and have nothing else better to do.

If you're too busy with your refined taste licking the balls of whatever you deem 'masterpiece', then I recommend you to get out right now, this show isn't for you, this show is for someone who still has a child in them. Don't expect it to exceed your expectation, it won't, just be here for the laughs, turn...off your brain and embrace the sex offender inside you.Story 1/10Is there even? I won't even try to defend this show on this one, I know it doesn't exist, The writer know it doesn't exist, the Sex slave in my basement know it doesn't exist, even the officer spying on me from outside my house know it doesn't exist. It's a slice of life, a resemblance of a story should be given at least a seven, and a decent one should be given a nine, this doesn't even try, so I'll give it a one. But if a show is suppose to be judged ONLY from it's story and nothing else, then I might as well read a novel instead of watching an anime.Art 8/10The animation is simple and expressive, it manages to pull something that shows like Wataten!, Senryu Soujo, and NewGame failed to pull; translating a 4koma format into animation. It uses traditional, tween, and 3D animation, all of them are used accordingly. 3D animation are used sparingly, only on moving solid object which are otherwise hard to animate frame by frame. Tween are used for 'comedic purposes' (?). MOst scene are still on frame by frame though, so if you don't like either of them you'll still fit right at home. The art and general presentation of the show are executed well, no complain here.Sound 8/10I'd give it a nine, but I'll cut a points of for being generic. The show has 1 opening and 6 ending, all of them are great, except for the 3rd ending, this one is especially generic. Sfx, and general sound design are ok, nothing to be said here. The VA fits, one of them even has the same last name as one of the character.Character 7/10Eh... It's ok, we got the tsundere, the dense guy, the robot, the athletic, the Serious, nothing new here. They're generic for sure, but this is a staple of anime at this point so just live with it.Enjoyment 9/10This is what's truly good about this show. It's fun to watch. It's vulgar for sure but I don't mind those. It's perfect for a child or adult acting like one. It's made for High IQ People, the likes of which Un-ironically watch only 2d Porn, registered as a sex offender out of suspicion of pedophilia and general social indecency, and stay at their basement Reeing everyday. All of which are characters very lacking in today's society, shame.Overall 7/10Good, It's an improvement from the manga. It stays true to the original and improves upon it with Voice acting and animation.

It felt like the writers wanted to develop Yamashita a little bit, but they didn't go very far with it.

In each episode the device fails in some way that is spectacular, usually in a fairly predictable way. This anime understands that this type of humor gets old really fast, and makes each episode short and to the point. Each episode is really like 2, 6m episodes in one, as longer than 12m at a time might be a little much at once. ', 'Each ep is only 12 long so it is a quick watch. This show has no middle ground, so you will either like it or hate it. Show revolves around a smart (middle school?) girl who is way to thirsty for the only guy in the show. She makes some advance gadgets and makes him test it to try and get him to like her or simply get closer to him.So most of it is crude humor and not really of shy of getting really weird with the main girl thirstiness for the guy. Most harem anime i have seen have more chill...girls than Ueno. Ueno is like a shy albedo.I liked the show but this is not a show for everyone. girls than Ueno. Ueno is like a shy albedo.I liked the show but this is not a show for everyone.', 'tl;dr: A series of short comedy skits that have decent humor but are somewhat repetitive and have no substance beyond that.This anime is composed of short skits all of which are solely focused on comedy. Each episode is about half length, nine and half minutes if you take out the OP and ED, but each of those episodes is also split into two so each of the skits if four to six minutes. These skits are centered around a middle school science club led by a tsundere girl named Ueno who’s trying to get fellow club member Tanaka to fall in love with her through...the use of various inventions. The English title for this translates the word 不器用 as clumsy, but from what I understand it’s meaning is broader than simply awkwardness of movement as it’s usually used in English, but rather encompasses being prone to screwing things up in general, which is a much better description of Ueno in this anime. She always screws things up for one reason or another, which is where the majority of comedy comes from.There’s some variety to the comedy, though it is still pretty narrow. The majority of the screwups arise from Tanaka simply not doing what Ueno had planned and her attempts at trying to force it just not working. She’s pretty hot headed and stubborn and usually keeps trying regardless of how things continue failing, which is a core part of the humor. There are some instances where she actually seems to be one the track to succeeding, but she ends up getting cold feet and running away, which I found pretty amusing and think that combined with her other somewhat pitiful traits made her pretty likable.The other core aspect to the comedy is that Tanaka is completely dense and despite it being pretty damn clear that Ueno is in love with him and trying to get him to fall in love with her as well, he doesn’t notice in the slightest. This is pretty common so I didn’t find it much of an issue in and of itself, but I will say that I found Tanaka to be a lot more rude than the typical dense to romance anime character so I actually felt pretty bad for Ueno at times to the point it blunted the comedy. And without the ridiculous kindness that usually accompanies the denseness in such protagonists, Tanaka is pretty unlikable, so in the end I didn’t actually have any investment whatsoever in there being any progress, which is a good thing because absolutely no progress was made.There’s some variety beyond that due to a host of other characters of varying importance. The main one is Yamashita, who is the only other science club member and thus always present, though her involvement is usually pretty minimal and generally pretty random. There are also various others that visit the science club to get inventions to help them with whatever problems they’re having, but none of them have enough presence to matter all that much beyond spicing things up here and there somewhat. The inventions too have a good amount of variety, ranging from being based on sci-fi psuedo babble to straight up fantasy. Overall I would say the comedy is decent enough throughout. Still, in the end most of the comedy seemed to veer into being at least somewhat lewd, but not all that much, which resulted in the comedy overall feeling pretty repetitive.The art and animation are pretty weak and overall the anime does feel low budget, but since it’s a series of short that shouldn’t be too unexpected. The bigger problem I think is that the art style really doesn’t work all that well with the ecchi focused comedy. The soundtrack wasn’t all that great but was unnoticeable most of the time so I guess it was okay for what it was. The OP was decent and though there were many EDs most were surprisingly great. I was especially fond of Love Me Science and Cosmo Lumina. the use of various inventions. The English title for this translates the word 不器用 as clumsy, but from what I understand it’s meaning is broader than simply awkwardness of movement as it’s usually used in English, but rather encompasses being prone to screwing things up in general, which is a much better description of Ueno in this anime. She always screws things up for one reason or another, which is where the majority of comedy comes from.There’s some variety to the comedy, though it is still pretty narrow. The majority of the screwups arise from Tanaka simply not doing what Ueno had planned and her attempts at trying to force it just not working. She’s pretty hot headed and stubborn and usually keeps trying regardless of how things continue failing, which is a core part of the humor. There are some instances where she actually seems to be one the track to succeeding, but she ends up getting cold feet and running away, which I found pretty amusing and think that combined with her other somewhat pitiful traits made her pretty likable.The other core aspect to the comedy is that Tanaka is completely dense and despite it being pretty damn clear that Ueno is in love with him and trying to get him to fall in love with her as well, he doesn’t notice in the slightest.

Seitokai Yakuindomo (AKA Sex Jokes: The Anime) is one of my favourite anime. How Clumsy You Are, Miss Ueno is also full of sex jokes, and is almost as funny, but doesn't hit the mark.Anyway- I had just finished watching Watamote, which I found both hilarious and depressing as hell overall (the ending was just terrible, not to mention one of the biggest letdowns I've seen in an anime series in a while), and it got more and more depressing as the story went on, but I enjoyed in overall), so I...decided to look for a comedy anime (Slice of Life is my favourite genre), and I came upon this anime.As I have already stated, I am a real sucker for anime with sex jokes (except for Panty and Stocking, which was terrible), and this anime was LOADED with it. It was absolutely hilarious, and made me feel a lot better after watching Watamote. The art style was great and unique, something I always like in anime, the story was original (heck, a genius inventor trying to win the love of a classmate by designing the most ridiculous machines ever is HILARIOUS), and the jokes were good too. They weren't too in your face, to make things better. HOWEVER, the fan service was a bit too much for me to handle.

So my suggestion is don't overthink it. There was one continuity error, but it's only noticeable if you overthink it. The ending is a bit weak too, but I am almost never satisfied with endings so that probably doesn't mean much coming from me.Art: The visuals are stunning! Have to see it to believe it. The 3-D meshes with the 2-D in a way that no other anime really accomplishes. (For example, the 3-D in &quot;Last Exile&quot; or &quot;Ghost in the...Shell&quot; are good, but a bit too distracting.)Sound: The soundtrack is really neat, from the background music to the SFX to the character's voices. The only quibble I have is I didn't really like the sound of the opening narrator's voice, but luckily you don't ever have to hear it again.Character: All the characters are great! From the chibi-SD girl who is the &quot;Chief&quot;, to the android policeman, to the Diaper King (who manages to be really badass even though his name is &quot;Diaper King&quot;), to the quirky porno director, etc. etc. The characters don't have much backstory, but, again, that's only a problem if you over-analyze it.Enjoyment: Extremely high rewatch value.

Combine all that with a fast pace and the splendid animation and direction and you assured yourself a fine brainless action flick if that is all you want.Now that I mentioned that, let’s talk about the production values. Starting with the obvious, despite being on every major anime database, this is a South-Korean film, which means no generic character designs at all in the medium it belongs to, two ugly punks, a deformed woman, a transvestite, a cute little girl with a fucked up look for a Mayor, and some Smurfs-like creatures for antagonists, oh, and the cyborg, who surprisingly has the least interesting design in the whole movie. All of which made on purpose to look cartoony, creepy and, yeah, ugly. But it does not stop there, at all; the place where the story takes place is also a completely rotten country that looks crude, ugly, broken and dirty, while also having lots of references to Hollywood movies thrown-in there. But what good would all of that be in an action film if it doesn’t have fluid motions? And it does have it, starting with the vivid expressions and movements of the characters and finishing with the crazy but no random camera movements during action sequences; add to it references to Hollywood iconic films and a nice blend between 2-D and 3-D and you got one of the most remarkable visual departments in anime.But just like it happens with A Kite, the sound department is not as good, the sound effects are awesome, as they are reminiscent to Hollywood action films sound effects, but the voice acting and music aren’t special, despite being extreme and fitting with the setting and tone, too much superior competition out there when it comes to this (you know, Panty and Stocking, Dead Leaves, Redline).Speaking about the setting, I realize I didn’t even mentioned what the hell this movie is about, well, take this, a future where natural resources are gone and the government of a certain country uses the excrement of its citizens as an energy resource, while giving them candy-like drugs to people as a reward for all their shit. There, our two protagonists, the ones that give the movie its title, steal and sell said drugs, which ultimately results in them being chased by the police and a terrorist group composed of those people that consumed so much of those candies that they became addicted to them and transformed into some weird creatures…whatever. As you can imagine, the plot is stupid and an excuse for the action BUT is not crap. Is not really evident but the film is actually a satire of post-apocalyptic, action and political films, making fun of all of it clichés while making them into something completely amoral, hell, even the premise is making fun of those titles, a typical post-apocalyptic premise where everything went to shit, low resources, social control from the governments to people, social critique about the greediness of capitalists societies…and everything is literally about shit. I said before that the film references Hollywood action films but forgot to say that does not references only that, but also ideological movements as well, but it does not just show or mention them, but presents them as the worst thing ever.Even the cast is atypical; they try to make a living in this rotten world just like in lots of post-apocalyptic stories…by stealing and selling drugs and being completely unlikable assholes that all they want is money and would betray even their partners for that. You don’t really want them to succeed, but seeing that their enemies are worse, what other option is left to you?And above all that, despite its relatively short duration, it managed to bring a closure to every plot point it presents, not in a really solid way, since the film is still a brainless action flick with lots of bullshit unrealistic things; but a serviceable one.So, in the end, is a satire of post-apocalyptic films with lots of gross humor and very little critique to capitalism shown in the most ugly, stupid and unrealistic but also the most creative, unique and entertaining way. Leave it or take it as it is.For something similar you can check out:-Dead Leaves (Another dumb but very creative action flick with a unique art-style, fast pacing, and toilet and sexual humor).-Redline (Another fast paced movie set in a post-apocalyptic setting that only wants to show incredible animation and action with cartoony characters while not caring much about making sense out of its story).-Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt (A very creative series with cartoony art style full of stunning action, sexual humor and cursing). of their enemies by their own, they have to make every little dirty trick and use whatever shit they can find on the nearby to even start thinking of fighting against deformed gang members and a cyborg police officer, all while defending a porn actress.

I figured that while it had a ridiculous premise when analyzed, I shouldn't put that up for scrutiny - after all, it's not like some of the stuff I like is high art in and of itself. Unfortunately, while Aachi wa Ssipak (which I will from now on be calling AWS) has some things I really had fun with, the majority of it was rather disheartening and had some problems that prevented it from being something that I would highly recommend.As I watched it - I couldn't help but...make parallels between it and one of my favorite works - Hiroyuki Imaishi's Dead Leaves. They're both ridiculous, over-the-top action stories about criminals who solve problems with hyper violence with a unique art style to them, after all. So, in this review, I'm going to be talking not only about AWS itself, but comparing it to a work that does what it attempts to do in a way that I would think is better, and why I think AWS falls short of that.STORY - 5/10AWS has a rather interesting concept to it - in a world where defecation can be used as a source of energy, how would you gain a reliable source of energy? That's simple - by creating a reward. In this world, that reward is Juicy Bars, which a group called the Diaper Gang has become addicted to, as well as the many people on Earth. This creates a sustainable source of energy in their society, but also causes a ridiculous amount of addiction, which makes the world fall into chaos and disorder as people try to get their hands on this addictive substance.However, this is only the backstory of the true plot. The plot itself is rather generic, and the biggest problem with it is that the two main characters - Aachi and Ssipak, of course - have no ability to act on their own in the grand scale of the plot. It feels like everything in this world is happening TO them or AROUND them. Neither Aachi or Ssipak themselves are the ones who impact the plot in a way that is relevant or memorable. This causes the story to feel aimless at times, and annoyingly contrived at others, with things just so happening to work out in a way that benefits Aachi and Ssipak without they themselves doing anything to create this sort of impact on the world.To top it all off, this is a full-length movie - an hour and a half long. The silliness of the scenario and the loud and bombastic stupidity of the world that they live in gets sort of grating after a while, and due to the fact that Aachi and Ssipak don't really do much themselves, it leads to an hour and a half of contrivances and random happenings that just so happen to benefit our protagonists. This also leads to there being, surprisingly, big problems with pacing. For some reason, the movie felt it was a good idea to put what felt like an entire music video into the movie at one point, which really felt odd when compared to some moments where we suddenly cut to big climactic areas or cut back to plot points that feel out of place during the finale.To compare this to Dead Leaves, the latter is half of AWS' runtime. While it's similarly batshit insane when it comes to the choreography of combat, the ridiculousness of the plot points, and the strangeness of the world, the 45 minute runtime makes it so that it doesn't get annoying like AWS does. In return, Dead Leaves has a much less developed plot than AWS does, but in return for this the main characters themselves are the driving force of the story. The characters in Dead Leaves always felt like they had a purpose, a goal, a destination, or a strength, while the convenience-filled plot of AWS makes it feel like the characters have none.ART - 7/10Definitely the most striking part of AWS is its art style, and it's what I enjoy the most about it. The strange proportions, street aesthetic, ridiculous moments of squash and stretch animation during intense combat scenes, and bright neon characters against dingy greys and browns of a dystopian world make this movie pop. It makes the movie quite fun to watch even if it has some plot problems, but unfortunately it doesn't really have a 10/10 look to it.The biggest problem is that, in the latter half of the film, there were a LOT of uses of 3D. This 3D is poor. Really poor. My immersion got sucked out of the movie as I saw set piece after set piece of 3D backdrops that were obviously CG, and looked too generic and ordinary behind the interesting and stylish look of everything else. There's also notably poor animation in moments that aren't combat scenes - they obviously blew their load in this department, because outside of the action scenes AWS has a lot of moments that feel stuff or uninteresting visually.I don't even think I need to bring up Dead Leaves in this topic - Imaishi's art style is too striking, beautiful, and enjoyable to watch to even compare to AWS.SOUND - 4/10I will say right now that I watched the English Dub of AWS because it was the easiest thing for me to get my hands on, and let me just say if I were to put that as a point here on my score it would probably be closer to a 2 or 3. The dub is notably poor - even if there are moments where a joke or two may make you laugh in the dub, that doesn't excuse the absolutely terrible attempts at lip sync in the movie, and the majority of the jokes in the dub fall flat. There's a lot of puns about poop and crap and butts, and that's about it.The OST is also pretty boring as well. While the first 10 minutes or so get you hooked with an intense action scene and a banging dubstep song to bring you into the insane dystopia of this setting, the problem comes when you watch further into the movie. AWS' soundtrack feels like it's only one or two songs. If there are multiple dubstep songs in the movie, they all sound practically the same, and it gets kind of boring, especially when two tracks begin back to back - at this point I am literally giving the movie credit that they were multiple songs, because they all sounded the same to me.In Dead Leaves, there's a slew of multiple different types of music that back it during it's half of a run time. While it is mainly electronic, the OST can be somber, quiet, or even a short and chill rendition of an opera track! This gives the movie itself more of a pop as it continues to change and introduce new songs as the movie plays, unlike AWS which plays a slew of songs that all sound the exact damn same song.CHARACTER - 1/10These characters are the worst. There's nothing enjoyable at all about the ridiculously unfunny, annoying, and irredeemable characters in AWS. They start the movie bickering and they bicker throughout the whole movie. I never felt a sense of camaraderie between them. These characters were absolutely annoying to follow because they never seemed to give a shit about anything but themselves. While the side characters may seem to have interesting quirks, they quite frequently are brushed aside or turned into one-note jokes that get old the first time they happen.Comparing this to Dead Leaves, while the characters are similarly irredeemable criminals in jail for a nonsensical crime spree, what's important is how these characters interact. They grow closer, get feelings for each other, fight to save a group that's behind them, and most importantly they feel like they can do things themselves. It's not like in AWS where the protagonists are strung along by conveniences for an hour and a half.ENJOYMENT - 5/10There were some issues I had with the editing and some times it felt a bit nonsensical and poorly focused at times, I did really, REALLY enjoy the animation during fight scenes. That, and there were some times when visual gags or jokes were legitimately funny to me, so it wasn't all bad. It just had a problem with pacing, escalation, and character urgency that I couldn't shake.Dead Leaves is one of my favorite works of all time. Again, why would I need to even talk about it in this section?OVERALL - 5/10It isn't a total crap-chute. There are times when it can be funny, and the animation is really enjoyable in the action scenes. The world that has been built is interesting and fun as well. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, though. It has a lot of problems with pacing, its tone gets grating after too much run time, the characters are annoying and lack agency, and the soundtrack is pretty repetitive. If you think you can enjoy an hour of crude jokes for 20 minutes of cool animation, you should probably go watch Dead Leaves instead because it's way more enjoyable than this for a multitude of reasons. However, if you're really starving for hyper-crude and hyper-violent animation, you MIGHT want to look into this. make parallels between it and one of my favorite works - Hiroyuki Imaishi's Dead Leaves. They're both ridiculous, over-the-top action stories about criminals who solve problems with hyper violence with a unique art style to them, after all. So, in this review, I'm going to be talking not only about AWS itself, but comparing it to a work that does what it attempts to do in a way that I would think is better, and why I think AWS falls short of that.STORY - 5/10AWS has a rather interesting concept to it - in a world where defecation can be used as a source of energy, how would you gain a reliable source of energy?

The plot itself is rather generic, and the biggest problem with it is that the two main characters - Aachi and Ssipak, of course - have no ability to act on their own in the grand scale of the plot. It feels like everything in this world is happening TO them or AROUND them. Neither Aachi or Ssipak themselves are the ones who impact the plot in a way that is relevant or memorable. This causes the story to feel aimless at times, and annoyingly contrived at others, with things just so happening to work out in a way that benefits Aachi and Ssipak without they themselves doing anything to create this sort of impact on the world.To top it all off, this is a full-length movie - an hour and a half long. The silliness of the scenario and the loud and bombastic stupidity of the world that they live in gets sort of grating after a while, and due to the fact that Aachi and Ssipak don't really do much themselves, it leads to an hour and a half of contrivances and random happenings that just so happen to benefit our protagonists. This also leads to there being, surprisingly, big problems with pacing. For some reason, the movie felt it was a good idea to put what felt like an entire music video into the movie at one point, which really felt odd when compared to some moments where we suddenly cut to big climactic areas or cut back to plot points that feel out of place during the finale.To compare this to Dead Leaves, the latter is half of AWS' runtime. While it's similarly batshit insane when it comes to the choreography of combat, the ridiculousness of the plot points, and the strangeness of the world, the 45 minute runtime makes it so that it doesn't get annoying like AWS does. In return, Dead Leaves has a much less developed plot than AWS does, but in return for this the main characters themselves are the driving force of the story. The characters in Dead Leaves always felt like they had a purpose, a goal, a destination, or a strength, while the convenience-filled plot of AWS makes it feel like the characters have none.ART - 7/10Definitely the most striking part of AWS is its art style, and it's what I enjoy the most about it. The strange proportions, street aesthetic, ridiculous moments of squash and stretch animation during intense combat scenes, and bright neon characters against dingy greys and browns of a dystopian world make this movie pop. It makes the movie quite fun to watch even if it has some plot problems, but unfortunately it doesn't really have a 10/10 look to it.The biggest problem is that, in the latter half of the film, there were a LOT of uses of 3D. This 3D is poor. Really poor. My immersion got sucked out of the movie as I saw set piece after set piece of 3D backdrops that were obviously CG, and looked too generic and ordinary behind the interesting and stylish look of everything else. There's also notably poor animation in moments that aren't combat scenes - they obviously blew their load in this department, because outside of the action scenes AWS has a lot of moments that feel stuff or uninteresting visually.I don't even think I need to bring up Dead Leaves in this topic - Imaishi's art style is too striking, beautiful, and enjoyable to watch to even compare to AWS.SOUND - 4/10I will say right now that I watched the English Dub of AWS because it was the easiest thing for me to get my hands on, and let me just say if I were to put that as a point here on my score it would probably be closer to a 2 or 3. The dub is notably poor - even if there are moments where a joke or two may make you laugh in the dub, that doesn't excuse the absolutely terrible attempts at lip sync in the movie, and the majority of the jokes in the dub fall flat. There's a lot of puns about poop and crap and butts, and that's about it.The OST is also pretty boring as well. While the first 10 minutes or so get you hooked with an intense action scene and a banging dubstep song to bring you into the insane dystopia of this setting, the problem comes when you watch further into the movie. AWS' soundtrack feels like it's only one or two songs. If there are multiple dubstep songs in the movie, they all sound practically the same, and it gets kind of boring, especially when two tracks begin back to back - at this point I am literally giving the movie credit that they were multiple songs, because they all sounded the same to me.In Dead Leaves, there's a slew of multiple different types of music that back it during it's half of a run time. While it is mainly electronic, the OST can be somber, quiet, or even a short and chill rendition of an opera track! This gives the movie itself more of a pop as it continues to change and introduce new songs as the movie plays, unlike AWS which plays a slew of songs that all sound the exact damn same song.CHARACTER - 1/10These characters are the worst. There's nothing enjoyable at all about the ridiculously unfunny, annoying, and irredeemable characters in AWS. They start the movie bickering and they bicker throughout the whole movie. I never felt a sense of camaraderie between them. These characters were absolutely annoying to follow because they never seemed to give a shit about anything but themselves. While the side characters may seem to have interesting quirks, they quite frequently are brushed aside or turned into one-note jokes that get old the first time they happen.Comparing this to Dead Leaves, while the characters are similarly irredeemable criminals in jail for a nonsensical crime spree, what's important is how these characters interact. They grow closer, get feelings for each other, fight to save a group that's behind them, and most importantly they feel like they can do things themselves. It's not like in AWS where the protagonists are strung along by conveniences for an hour and a half.ENJOYMENT - 5/10There were some issues I had with the editing and some times it felt a bit nonsensical and poorly focused at times, I did really, REALLY enjoy the animation during fight scenes. That, and there were some times when visual gags or jokes were legitimately funny to me, so it wasn't all bad. It just had a problem with pacing, escalation, and character urgency that I couldn't shake.Dead Leaves is one of my favorite works of all time. Again, why would I need to even talk about it in this section?OVERALL - 5/10It isn't a total crap-chute. There are times when it can be funny, and the animation is really enjoyable in the action scenes. The world that has been built is interesting and fun as well. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, though. It has a lot of problems with pacing, its tone gets grating after too much run time, the characters are annoying and lack agency, and the soundtrack is pretty repetitive. If you think you can enjoy an hour of crude jokes for 20 minutes of cool animation, you should probably go watch Dead Leaves instead because it's way more enjoyable than this for a multitude of reasons. However, if you're really starving for hyper-crude and hyper-violent animation, you MIGHT want to look into this."", ""its very stupid. you're not suppose to really care much at all about the story which is fine, id you're looking for good writing and story telling this aint it.  the characters can be entertaining sometimes and you would like it if you like watching stupid people. character designs and overall art direction is very unique. it has a good style and good uses of colors and the animation lets it excel at it.

Everything and everyone have a very humorous / creepy look that turns this feature into a memorable watch.- The characters look like Saturday morning cartoons for kids but are in fact very sinister (part of the whole irony thing). The Diaper gang members look as sweet as the Smurfs, yet don’t think twice before chopping your head off and steal your wallet. The mayor of the city looks like a cute little girl but treats people as roaches. Very funny in a twisted way....A thing I didn’t like was that all the stunts in the film were identical, such as the police officers and the mutants. Almost clones of one another, I found it rather lame. If they were all different in some way, it would truly be a blast.- Very detailed, with a constant “everything is rotten, society sucks” feeling. Even the use of 3D blends nicely with everything else.- Frenetic animation in the least. Nothing seems to be able to stand still for over two seconds. During action scenes the camera keeps changing angles like crazy and the screen keeps getting filled with debris or some poor guy’s guts. It is depicted in a very cartoony way and does not really follow the laws of physics but does its job.- The movie does its worst to be as pointlessly violent and gory as possible. It spares no one in terms of showing a gruesome amount of splatter, blood bath, butchering and blowing up pretty much every setting it features.SOUND: Pull my finger- The original version is in Korean, if you care about such things. Beyond that, all characters have distinctive amd exaggerated voices. The punks sound like the retards they are, the villains sound … villainous and the Diaper gang members sound like silly little critters.- The words “shit” and “ass” repeat almost every 2 sentences, while dozens of other profane words are used. They are excused in such an anti-conformistic story and are in fact used in an ironic way most of the time. Still, you may want to keep the moral viewers away from it.- Sound effects are very reminiscent of Hollywood action films, with some attempts at making some sounds artistically incorporated into the atmosphere of the story. Quite good but not great.SCRIPT: We are in deep shit- The story is practically a parody of idealistic scenarios and action films. Global energy resources have debunked to good old manure, which is why everything in the story revolves around shit and people are addicted to lax popsicles, offered by the merciless authorities when someone takes a dump. Mutants and gang members are stealing and trading with these Juicy-bars, so the whole fuss is about exploiting the system for making easy money … and blowing everything to Kingdom Come… The story is a very ironic depiction of today’s advanced societies and their capitalistic greed … and it is damn funny.- For a movie feature, it packs a lot of events. It feels really long and has good pacing.- There are dozens of Easter Eggs, in the form of references to famous Hollywood films and ideological movements. You are made to laugh at how the animators twist everything highly idealistic into a pile of amoral garbage.- The conclusion is not a solid one but it leaves no unexplained loose ends, a thing most anime fail miserably at. Not great but decent.CAST: A bunch of shitheads- The cast is very funny as sons of bitches. Everyone’s motive is “easy money” but that doesn’t lessen their image as “the perfect idiots for the stupidest idea.” The small time criminal duo and their madonna are airheads but that is excused the way they grew up.

What in Earth could possible go wrong! By the looks of it; a lot!Story: 3/10 (Very Bad)From a post-apocalyptic survivalist shoujo manga written in 2011 with 35 volumes and 177 chapters, we get a (possible two) part 12 episode anime adaptation from  Studio Gonzo. This review will focus on the first season. It pretty much boils down that all gouverments worldwide select a bunch of people to put in a cryonic freezer because they know a giant asteroid will collide into Earth, a mass extinction occurs and some humans that were put in the freezer are just seeds...to contineu humankind. First of all, cryonics is at this moment still impossible. Sure, I have consider the Sci-Fi tag section, but when I look at the new wildlife that is represented in the story I have trash this anime since I\'m a paleontologist. Wildlife can\'t adapt and evolve this fast  only if couple hunderd years or so since human structures are somehow slighty intact and since I\'ve seen the documontairies Life after People. That\'s why I have isseus with the story. Wildlife really can\'t adapt this fast when a mass extinctiuon occurs. We\'re currently in a mass extinction right now and countless of species are dying out each day. If you want to see big changes in wildlife just like in this anime, we\'re talking millions of years! The fossil record doesn\'t lie! Don\'t get yourself fooled because some Japanese woman (in this case the original author) thinks huge adaptations in animal and plantlife kingdom happen in just couple hunderds of years!Art: 5/10 (Average)Animation wise it\'s pretty much average 2019 standards I guess. I\'ve seen better animation, but it\'s not horrible iether. But then again, it\'s Studio Gonzo. I know they can do much better, but hey that\'s just me. Yes, the studio that gave us Welcome to the N.H.K. is behind this. Sometimes the animation was at time really bad, but sometimes it was OK. In overall; it\'s a mixed bag for me.Sound: 6/10 (Fine)Voice acting is done well and mainly the reason why I wanted to watch this anime because of several voice actors like Nao Touyama (Karen Kujou in Kiniro Mosaic), Yoko Hikasa (Mio - K-On!) and Shizuka Itou (Sakurako Kujou - Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru) are present in this anime. Still I feel these people should get better roles for better anime projects than this garbage can.Character: 4/140 (Bad)Honestyly, I really don\'t like all the charathers we\'re getting on the screen. They really don\'t stand out and are plain boring. Just your average people. Nothing special. Eh... It really gives you the clear idea humankind is doomed no matter what with the mass extinction we\'re currently facing. Exactly; I\'m talking about overpopulation, human induced climate change, pollution, deforestation, rising sealevels, acidification of the oceans, desertification, ...Enjoyment: 2/10 (Horrible)The more I\'ve watched, the more annoyed I became with this anime. The ammount of bullshit this story tries to shove you down your troat. Now if this was a Comedy, then I wouln\'t mind it, but no, sadly this anime doesn\'t get a Comedy tag. What I found the most annoying that you get a bunch of new evolved species that really shouldn\'t be there in the first place. I\'m talking about a huge mantis Carboniferous size, a therapod like ""dinosaur"" creature etc. If only they got a radioactive movie treatment, then I could atleast see this trough my fingers, but since I understand how evolution works since I\'m actully working with extinct animals and mass extinctions in my daily life, this really a huge letdown. She really should have done her research before writing this crap.Should you read the manga instead? Eh, that\'s up to you, but I don\'t even want to bother with that iether in my opinion.Overall: 3/10 (Very Bad)In overall, I really wouldn\'t recommend this anime unless you really want to see a brainless survival anime without any logic, because emotion is the rule of thumb here if you want to survive. Everyone is equal! Hmmm. Where did I herd that one before? Following your feelings while being is harsh times is the rule for survival here in this anime! In the real world however it\'s the opposite; facts really doesn\'t care about your feelings!No wonder this anime is sponsered by Netflix... to contineu humankind. First of all, cryonics is at this moment still impossible. Sure, I have consider the Sci-Fi tag section, but when I look at the new wildlife that is represented in the story I have trash this anime since I\'m a paleontologist. Wildlife can\'t adapt and evolve this fast  only if couple hunderd years or so since human structures are somehow slighty intact and since I\'ve seen the documontairies Life after People. That\'s why I have isseus with the story. Wildlife really can\'t adapt this fast when a mass extinctiuon occurs. We\'re currently in a mass extinction right now and countless of species are dying out each day. If you want to see big changes in wildlife just like in this anime, we\'re talking millions of years!

But since it as a Netflix Original Anime, (I enjoyed quite a few series from Netflix) I decided to give it a try. Have not read the manga, but I think the story telling and pacing is fine, as I was kept interested throughout that I binged watch under 6 hrs. I will advise to wait for part2 (fingers crossed) as it did ended in an abrupt cliffhanger. Definitely the production will not wrap up like this. Rather than shoujo, it fits in a more in the mature category. ', 'Netflix adaptations tend to be either good or trash.""7 Seeds"" falls into the dumpster category.After watching the terrible trailer, I still had my hopes up, as I heard that the Manga was really good and since I had a genuine interest in the concept. But sadly, even less then half-way through the first episode of the Netflix adaptation, I already despised it.First of all, there are so many stereotypical characters and moments that it feels like I\'m watching a shitty attempt at a comedy anime. Every single one of the characters is just so damn irritating and it pisses me off. I don\'t...think I have ever hated an anime character more than every single one of ""these"" main protagonists. I just don\'t have the slightest interest in any of them, and it just left me hoping that these were are all joke protagonists and that they would all somehow manage to die at the end of the first episode, in order to reveal the ""real"" protagonists that I would be genuinely interested in (sadly this didn\'t end up happening).The animations are also a pile of dog shit, and the Netflix trailer warned us about it. Yet I still decided to keep my hopes up, which ended up being a terrible mistake.So far, I am not enjoying this anime in the slightest and I have decided to drop it right after the ""4 episode rule"".Overall, this anime is getting a solid 2/10 from me. The entire anime is just a joke. Don\'t waste your time with this shit. <3 think I have ever hated an anime character more than every single one of ""these"" main protagonists.

The entire anime is just a joke. Don\'t waste your time with this shit. <3', 'You’ve just awoken years after the apocalypse, stranded on an island. This island is infested by giant man-eating insects, dinosaurs, diseases, and deranged survivors, how do you survive? You don\'t. You cannot survive because you are braindead. You run around screaming in terror because you are a useless, annoying, brainless shoujo protagonist. Sorry, but someone thought it would be funny to put you—a helpless idiot—into horror anime.Yet again, Netflix’s algorithms have shat out an awful anime. This time, it’s a blend of shoujo and horror with visuals ripped straight of the early 2000s. 7 Seeds is a fitting title because it took me 7 seconds...to realize it\'s bad enough to rival Mars of Destruction, at least for the first two episodes. It’s so bad because it tries to be gruesome and scary, but the art is terrible and the dialogue is hilariously stupid. Rather than being shockingly awful, after episode two it just becomes boring. The plot setup is interesting; to avoid extinction during the apocalypse, different countries put groups of people in cryosleep. The premise is good, and nothing else is. Dozens of random people awaken to find themselves on the island, we see the various groups beginning survival strategies, and big bugs eat some of them. In the first episode, everyone is either screaming in fear or at each other, and not even the animators know what the hell is happening. It’s wild, stupid, and it had the potential to be a so-bad-its-good comedy. Detracting from the humor is the infuriatingly annoying main character.Natsu, the first protagonist, is the epitome of a useless shoujo protagonist. For some reason, she tells us how weak, cowardly, and awkward she is. It’s all said in one big long run-on sentence because the show is paced incredibly poorly. We immediately know how useless Natsu is because of how she acts, her pathetic ‘woe-is-me’ internal monologues are completely unnecessary. Who needs well-written characterization when you can just info-dump the main character’s entire personality in 10 seconds?! When a huge manga is condensed into twelve episodes, it really shows. Scenes jump from one character perspective to the next with no transition whatsoever. The tone shifts wildly at the drop of a hat from cheesy shoujo drama to people dying violently. Then suddenly we’re thrown into some random guy’s backstory lasting half the episode. 7 Seeds may have worked as a manga, but this adaptation borders on incoherent.Fortunately for us, the writers forget about Natsu after the third episode. From time to time we’re told how she’s doing as if we care. All Natsu does is silently lust over a generic handsome bishounen. The bishounen is committed to someone else, and Natsu never pursues him out of fear of hurting his feelings. She did nothing for the whole show because she was such a whiny child. For some reason, Natsu and the Bishounen stay with a long-haired dude who smacks her ass in the first episode, he’s a one-dimensional bastard but he sticks around to bully her for some reason. Thankfully, his voice acting in the English dub is fucking hilarious. When he or any character calls out Natsu for being useless, and it sounds genuinely real. You can hear their hatred for Natsu in their voices. For all the verbal beat down she takes, I couldn\'t care less about her. There is no way to sympathize with someone denser than a two-ton boulder, just stop whining and solve your own problems. The second protagonist, Hana, is thankfully less infuriatingly stupid. I call her the second because she gets introduced in the second half of episode one. Eventually, she gets the full protagonist role. Hana is far more adaptable to her environment and automatically better because she’s not an infuriating coward. Even without any worthwhile characterization and a blank slate personality, was a far better perspective to see the story from than Natsu.Aside from Hana, there are dozens of other named characters. By the time you learn someone’s name, three more will be introduced. Any ‘development’ no matter how poorly written won’t matter at all if you can’t remember who the character is, and so few of them do anything worth remembering in the story. 7 Seeds attempts to make its cast memorable by over-exaggerating all of their emotions and reactions, which just makes them more obnoxious. Some of them scream every other sentence, and the rest treat every slightly bad thing like it’s the end of the world. Stubbed your toe? Must be the be fatal, scream about it. Swatting someone away? Oops, looks like I fell into a river with 30mph rapids, better scream bloody murder. Either the dialogue is quiet, monotonous, and boring, or it is over-acted to the point it’s funny. There are some hilarious one-liners in the dub because even the actors know how bad this show is. To make the character acting worse, the audio is so lazily edited; no matter how far apart the characters are, they will sound just as loud as if they were right next to each other.The only character I cared about was the bearded nomad guy with all of the cute wolves, but he became so forgettable I cannot recall his name. Once he shaved his beard, lost his wolves, he became a generic bishounen to fall in love with Hana. Only three of the characters get developed beyond one trait, and the rest don’t even get that much. Some of the side characters exist solely to comment on their surroundings and look helpless when monsters attack. Right as a random girl thinks she will be eaten by big bugs, she suddenly says “I wanted to be a doctor and an astronaut.” Wow so relatable. I am definitely going to cry when she dies violently. Strangely enough, she doesn’t die. After the second episode, very few people die at all; it becomes a boring slice-of-life drama rather than a campy horror. The giant bugs and badass dinosaurs were never seen again. We never learn how the bizarre monster filled future came to be, the writer simply grew tired of them. Instead, the story becomes a generic shoujo about the interpersonal relationships between people we have no reason to care about. There are at least four loosely connected stories being told at every moment in 7 Seeds; each story follows a different group of people in different locations. Trying to keep track of all the locations, characters, and plots is like studying for a test right before class; I couldn’t remember anything because the pacing is so unimaginably awful. That\'s why episode 10 is the least bad out of all twelve. It is still poorly animated, melodramatic, and disjointed, but it entirely takes place in a flashback. There are almost no sudden jumps between character perspectives and distant locations. Rather than having to follow the giant cast, we follow one main character and four side characters. Episode 10 is the only reprieve we get from the horribly written story and whiplash-inducing editing. Each episode ends mid-scene with no closure, abruptly cutting to the ED. From the beginning to the end, the editing is appalling, this even happens at the end of the last episode. Supposedly this is ""Part 1"" of the 7 Seeds adaptation; the ending was incomplete for sure, but it did nothing to set up a sequel.Another effect of the breakneck pacing is a lack of any transition between shots. At one point someone suddenly said, “We’re going to fly together on my glider!” Random, but it sounded cool! Smash cut to them on a glider being slid across the screen on a motion tween, then another smash cut to an unrelated scene. This all happens over the course of FOUR SECONDS. It’s like watching a Michael Bay movie. At any given moment in 7 Seeds is telling multiple stories across multiple locations with little to no connection. It jumps from one story to another flippantly; the editors do not care if you\'re able to follow the sequence of events. All of the characters look similar too, making the many storylines even harder to follow. The character designs generic and everything else in this show is an eyesore.Who would have thought the end of the world would look so ugly? The action scenes, character animation, background art, effects, everything. Monsters slide across the screen on motion tweens, the monsters are just repeated assets sized differently from one another. Close-ups of the characters\' faces look fine. But when they move, or if they’re a bit too far from the camera, they look hideous. The background art is mostly repeated assets and blotchy green colors. Whenever it\'s raining (it happens a lot) the effect is haphazardly slapped onto the screen over a normal shot. It is not integrated into the art in any way. Gonzo has adapted plenty of great stories surpassing their mediocre art. This is not one of them. I can only praise Gonzo for attempting to use 2D art for everything, but the little CGI they used looks bizarre. The CGI ocean is such an eye-sore; if someone is swimming, waves just clip through them. Boats don’t affect the water at all. It’s like someone stuck poorly drawn anime stickers onto an over-edited photo of the ocean. Awful visuals like this are enjoyable ironically, but the inane directing of the action scenes is where the true hilarity comes from. A tiger is about to attack three, newly introduced people. One of them randomly pulls out a baseball, then another grabs a stick and says to through it at him, and somehow it hits the tiger square in the face. The whole scene looked like shit, but it was fucking hilarious. My suspension of disbelief did a 360, rolled down a ditch into a dumpster, then it exploded.7 Seeds straddles the line between being ironically funny and taking itself far too seriously. Horror, romance, drama, shoujo, action, mystery; it wants to be the jack of all trades, but in the end, it is the master of none. The result is a tonally maligned shitfest that isn’t funny, scary, relatable, sympathetic, or entertaining. As for the romance? There is nothing aside from crushes only mentioned in internal monologues and sexual assault. Great. I would recommend this anime to people who want a free lobotomy, those who like bleaching their eyeballs, and basically anyone else who finds pleasure in torturing themselves. Shoujo and horror are two genres that should not be combined, and this dumpster fire demonstrates why.Dear Netflix, please stop making shovelware garbage like 7 Seeds. to realize it\'s bad enough to rival Mars of Destruction, at least for the first two episodes.

I watched this whole anime in a day it was attention capturing. I HATE the way it ends. It\'s too unfulfilling and leaving questions that may not be answered.The art was very nice as Netflix usually delivers. its start is a tad chaotic but seemed to be the point to scramble the watchers as much as the characters.It does cover some rather heavy topics. They do so really well, sometimes the topics seem to be rushed. The series follows two lovers heartbroken to...wake up and not have each other. ""By luck"" They are together in this new hostile world. I do suggest this anime if you like dark anime. It\'s dark like the anime ""another"". probably worse covering purposeful murder, abuse, rape, and mass death.overall very clever but needs more fleshing out. <3 wake up and not have each other. ""By luck"" They are together in this new hostile world. I do suggest this anime if you like dark anime. It\'s dark like the anime ""another"". probably worse covering purposeful murder, abuse, rape, and mass death.overall very clever but needs more fleshing out. <3', 'as a  fan of the manga, i can only say:  READ THE MANGA!!!!!!!!so TL;DR : the anime doesnt do the Manga justice. AT. ALL.As it was mentioned before, too many chapters of the original got stuffed into 12 episodes of half-heartedly done animations.This means the main strength of the original story - character development, depth, details and relationships/interactions within a group in a dangerous environment- got thrown out the window.Many events that would further explain the characters and their motivations, have been left out or haphazardly summarized so all the development and understanding of said characters gets lost to the...audience.The whole life of team summer A has been crammed into one short summary! to the anime viewers they have to come across as totally bonkers. Also the cliffhanger makes no sense, only if there was a season2 or even 3 planned, as it is relatively early in the story. The environment and creatures get oversimplified too, Hanas disease even turns into a bubbly mess? The pacing is really out of whack, when the respective parties have already been traveling for quite some time.Also some of the lines certain characters are spouting are really off. every minute of watching it really heightens the discrepancy between original and adaptation. Its too bad the quality of the original gets warped so badly that it gets classified as shojo. it truly isnt just that.Sure it doesnt have those shonen typical fight scenes, there are no superpowers or villains. its more of a depiction of different young people being thrown together in a tough situation left  to deal with on their own. And all this is completely neglected by the anime.its such a shame really! the manga is so great and detailed, be it  plotwise or character depth or-interactions. It hurts my heart to see this great potential the Manga has being thrown away.i guess at this point its not much more use saying anything more about the anime, for those wanting to know more about the MANGA, read about it on the Mangas page. audience.The whole life of team summer A has been crammed into one short summary! to the anime viewers they have to come across as totally bonkers.

It is the most ridiculous review I've ever written and show that I have witnessed. There is a TLDR at the bottom.As usual Netflix has a talent for flushing out incomplete garbage. But this show was different. The art was honestly pretty amazing, I love the artstyle. I really did! Sound was definitely on point, from music to ambient sounds. Sure there wasn't a lot, but what was present was of good quality.The characters were very interesting and had great developments as well, at least in the main team. Each character had their own unique role and...their own pros and cons. This is extremely fitting with the story.The story is about having people wake up after a cryo sleep that lasted god knows how long. They are the only humans and woke up when earth became habitable again. Since a meteor shower had quite a negative impact on it. Spread over teams each team is placed at a certain location near a vault where they can find supplies to start villages, communities etc in order to populate earth again and in order to survive. To establish a good basic for future generations etc.Honestly it is really a great story since it gives so much room for the character development. And then we have flashbacks highlighting some of the characters certain talents and trauma's.Now I will start with the bad things... and also the reason why I don't recommend this show. You will get tossed around as a viewer. First you watch the story of a certain team, then before it is even finished you will be shown the story of another team. Before it is finished then back to the earlier team. The stories had no significant connection and there were plenty of stories, not just 2. That left me with a foul feeling. So in the hope that it will at least be finished or that you get to see what you had been hoping for you keep watching...Sure the characters get more interesting, but they make blatantly stupid choices suddenly all for the sake of plot twists. Which are extremely obvious. There is no actual reasoning for certain events. Just to throw the viewer (you and me) off. I really hate those kind of things since it is an extremely low quality effort of achieving something. Just like jump scares in horror movies.So while you start to realize the road that this dumpster fire has taken under guidance of Netflix the end is nearing (aka episode 12). One side of the story shows that it will be very promising and that it will be great! And then it is halted, we switch to another team. Then they get to an important point in the story and then we get a cliffhanger as season finisher. At an extremely important point as well. This isn't your ordinary cliffhanger, this is one that will make you hate that you wasted hours by watching 12 episodes just for this.This is an anime about survival and surviving essentially without technology. They don't leave much room for a second season but more like an episode 13 to finish up episode 12. The way they went around with not finishing all the team stories is more like they simply left holes in the overall show. With a second season you can't fill those holes since a second season would be like 11 episodes of flash backs and other perspectives (to complete season 1) and then the last episode would probably finish episode 12... but fact is, all this isn't present.TLDR;We are left with an incomplete show that can't even finish the stories it tells and shows. It gives you an incomplete open ending. Hell it isn't even an ending. Netflix probably forgot to add an episode... that kind of ending. Do not watch this. You will be wasting your time. It is quite a miracle for how this show ended up being ruined given the quality elements it contained... but then again it is pretty much Netflix's standard for their exclusive anime. their own pros and cons. This is extremely fitting with the story.The story is about having people wake up after a cryo sleep that lasted god knows how long. They are the only humans and woke up when earth became habitable again. Since a meteor shower had quite a negative impact on it.

I guess I have been avoiding crappy shows nowadays, but the basic idea of the show catched my attention.Still I would say there is a tiny fraction of the series somewhat worth watching. There are multiple groups, the first one we are introduced to is called \'Summer B\'. These 4 characters we are introduced at the beginning of the 1st episode are okay, they are nothing new, but compared to every single other character they are bearable. Still I can see why people could find them annoying too: Natsu Iwashimizu...is this typical quiet, low profile girl, Arashi Aota is the usual knight in shining armor, Semimaru Asai is this annoying rebellious teen, and the female officer with them is ok too. After ep3 the former 3 depart on their own journey, which is from then is the only part of the series that might be worth watching, they are exploring this post-apocalyptic world, without said characters being mind-blowingly retarded. I would say ep 1-4 are okayish, then in ep 5-9 the group of said 3 characters only get a few minutes per episode, then the second half of ep11. This would be a love story of sorts, and these 3 characters are getting a tiny bit of character development as well.If you value your time and sanity I would recommend skipping EVERYTHING else. Every further introduced group achieves a new high on the retard-o-meter. It is like watching the storywriter gradually losing it. The rest of the characters are either annoying as hell or indescribably retarded. Anything happens makes zero sense, after a while I couldn\'t do else, but laugh at how horribly written everything was. And when these horribly written characters are not doing some retarded sht, we can watch 1,5 episodes of flashbacks of these imbeciles we couldn\'t care less about.So it would be a straight 1, but as I said the ""subplot"" of the 3 characters is somewhat watchable, it is funny seeing Natsu tripping over anything and everyting.

The female protagonists Hana and Natsu play around usual shoujo manga protagonist tropes and subvert them: with Hana supposedly being that overly plucky character that needs to find a sense of balance and learn how to pick her battles, and Natsu being that bullied girl that really needs to get out of her head and learn the basics of human interaction.BUT NOPE. The anime. Oh boy. The anime. It's really obvious that it got animated because...teenagers surviving in a world without adults is a popular genre right now and the studios are trying to cash in on that trend.No care was given to adapting the story at all.

The first part that was released has 12 episodes and moves so fast half the time it is hard to keep up with the story or characters. (Whose bright idea was it to introduce 20 or so characters in the first episode?!) Because of the speed there's really no time to do any real character development. They cut out all of the interesting characteristics of the characters and instead leave us with...a collection of shoujo stereotypes. Thus none of the characters are likeable and you don't really care what happens to any of them.Another huge disappointment is the artwork. Like did Netflix not have a budget for this?

I think the last one to do it was back in 2016, so yeah it’s been a while. The ones that are especially guilty of this are those that I feel have potential to give me something different. 7 Seeds almost was one of those types but it quickly descended into disappointment.Before I tackle the major problem I’m going to get some things out of the way. The art and animation for 7 Seeds started out good if you ask me which is a surprise because Gonzo was the studio in...charge and they are not exactly known for quality anime. However they did not betray my expectations and quickly the animation deteriorated as the series went on. Pity, it was one of the few things I liked. The music was alright, nothing memorable, but I am happy they used the standard length for the openings and the endings. I’ve noticed that when it comes to Netflix’s original anime they have begun to trim the length of the OPs and EDs and sometimes opting to cut them out entirely, so I appreciate that they made it feel like an actual anime series that aired on television.The characters for the series were the beginning of my frustration. At first the main cast was centered around 7-8 characters. With a twelve episode run I was confident that everyone would get adequate development. However as the episodes went on we were introduced to more characters and more and more and more to the point where I could no longer care about any of them. I also found a lot of them to be pretty annoying and overall useless. For a post apocalyptic survival story you want characters that are level headed with the tools and traits necessary to survive. Also the world they inhabit is treacherous yet they feel the need to split up every chance they get. This is a post apocalyptic story of survival by means of cooperation, not a random episode of Scooby Doo.With that out of the way it’s on to the  major problem when it comes to 7 Seeds, the story. Starting off I found it to be incredibly appealing to someone with my tastes. I’m the kind of person who is interested in survival and post apocalyptic themes. 7 Seeds appeared to be centered around those themes making the decision to continue watching ever easier. As time went on though I began to notice something was off. The story had a habit of skipping around a lot. Characters would cover thousands of miles of ground in half a episode. Said characters would then break off and split up covering more ground in an unrealistic amount of time. The characters can say that weeks, months, or even years have passed from the first episode until the last but I’m not buying it. Episodes that feel like they should cover an entire arc or series worth are done and solved in a matter of minutes. Now, I’m no manga reader, so I’m going into this blind, but it feels like they are skipping a ton of material.Part of an anime’s job when it comes to telling a story of the very purpose of the story is to carefully set up the world. The problem with 7 Seeds is that they show us a world that I for one would like to know more about but they then choose to move on without giving the audience a chance to take it all in. This is a recurring theme for 7 Seeds and it’s even more disappointing because what they are rushing to isn’t even worth it.To start off the review I mentioned that it had been a while since an anime really pissed me off. Generally for an anime to really piss me off it either has to be a complete butchering of a manga that I treasure dearly or an ending that is one big middle finger to the viewer. Considering I never read the manga you can probably guess which of those 7 Seeds is guilty of. Honestly, before the ending came about 7 Seeds was not a bad anime. Sure it was rushed to hell and the characters were annoying and they skipped around a lot but I still found it interesting. That was until I saw the ending or lack there of. Bad endings can jeopardize any series, but endings that don’t even end are worse. I’m not talking about the wishy washy use your imagination kind of open ending, I mean the kind where the episode ends and you think there is going to be another episode after it, but there isn’t.

But in this day and age, with so many shows holding similar storylines and executing much better, 7 Seeds simply looks amateur. A masterpiece can build suspense and drama by feeding misinformation to the audience and even the characters, an amateur production on the other half, stumbles to do so properly, making twists look like retcons and story-beats seem meaningless, random, and at worse poorly thought through.Yet somehow, I was not able to stop watching this show to...the bitter end, when I caught myself shouting in exhasperation as its first (and likely only) season ended not with a bang, nor a whisper; not even a cliffhanger, but instead a dead cut in the middle of a scene. No build-up, no send-off, no tease of anything else to come. Just a sudden and abrupt sense of meaningless finality. But it didn't have to be that way.It is clear there is both passion and talent behind this show. Its platform is big, and its source material is not half-bad. It was just that the talent on board was not capable of pulling through with their vision. It was painfully clear at several times that a more experienced director could have done wonders with the effort the art team put into painting and animating, but with the shoddy editing and framing of an amateur, all that effort went to waste. The same could be said for the work of the voice-actors, not only in japanese, but also in english and spanish, which really brought life to the characters, or at least as much as the rigid script and tactless direction allowed them to.If Carole & Tuesday from the same season was a passion project helmed by a beloved and trustworthy star, making the best of the talent and resources at his disposal, then 7 Seeds is the first shot at a serious production from an amateur director who didn't know what to do despite the backing of his staff and producer. My only hope is that this amateur can come back for a second round after listening to the (likely too harsh) criticism of his work, so that he can prove himself and make things right for the source material he now represents. the bitter end, when I caught myself shouting in exhasperation as its first (and likely only) season ended not with a bang, nor a whisper; not even a cliffhanger, but instead a dead cut in the middle of a scene.

Part of it is because I believe the manga has close to 200 chapters with the first 80 some chapters completed in season 1 of the anime. So it's all the good stuff, no fillers and always exciting and new. The issue is that sometimes, some things that happen to different groups will occur off screen (the show has different groups of people separated from each other). While some they do explain, some you're meant to piece together like the group that doesn't see it unfold if that makes sense.The bad, I'd say is certain character drawing seems a little off but that's really a personal thing definitely not something you'd notice, it's small and unnoticeable. I didn't feel it was rushed but it could have benefited from a few more episodes because of the number of characters involved. That's really all the bad I can think off.

Unlike many other shows with higher scores, 7 Seeds features characters who are neither heroes nor villains. They all have their strengths and weaknesses and it\'s interesting to see how they interact with and influence each other.An example of this is Semimaru. In the beginning of the show, he comes off as a bully who is immature, incompetent and stupid (not even ""just because"", but rather because of his difficult childhood). However, as the show progresses, he grows more attached to the other members in his group and supports the girl he...initially bullied.What makes 7 Seeds so interesting as a survival show is that you get to see how the characters deal with the world they have been put in. It doesn\'t rely on superpowers, mindless action, gore, jump-scares, bleak landscapes or melodrama to be interesting, but rather on the mindsets, motivations and struggles of the people in it. initially bullied.What makes 7 Seeds so interesting as a survival show is that you get to see how the characters deal with the world they have been put in.

SO MUCH WASTED POTENTIAL!!!!It's like they gave the voice actors the lines at random without any context as to how it was gonna be used. Less then 25% of the conversations have matching tones. They could be talking about a horrific death and the next line they sound like they won a free ice cream sundae.The story is really good, but you honestly are better watching it in a language you dont understand even remotely and using subtitles. This series could have been 9 or a 10 but it was completely butchered by dialog. If it were me...producing the show I would force the voice actors to watch it from start to finish and then drag their asses back into the recording studio and redo the whole thing after they see the embarrassment they did the show.I have seen worst though but its 2019, this kinda voice acting shouldnt even possible.I do recommend watching it but it's pretty fricken sad when your best episode is narrated by a dead ventriloquist. Seriously I'd recommend it for this episode alone then afterwards you could drop the show entirely if you wanted.

Take it serious and you won't make it past the first episode.The characters are incredibly stupid and probably wouldn't have been chosen if the world somehow got to this point. It's full of unnecessary drama and typical anime edge lords with the bad background. The artwork is nothing special as well as the sound.In short, this is what if would happen if you tried to port over one of Hollywood's teen movies (ex. The 100. The Society.) Everything's just exaggerated, especially the dialogue to the point where you CANNOT take this serious.

Whatever there\'s a lot of minor mistakes and the art+animation are crappy.At the beggining of this anime I felt cringy, the main character was just so not likable that if I was the one making the plot wouldn\'t start the story with her at all, it would be best if they started with the 2o group instead, the one...with the leader asshole guy (won\'t tell much because of possible spoilers), I do understand the importance of the first group towards the story, but I wouldn\'t make them the head figures for the show.The story starts slow and it might look like its just a bad anime, but forward in it starts getting interesting, even with some mistakes still I did like they weren\'t afraid of showing more characters or killing them, or at least tell that they are already dead. With that said, the kill after they encounter the big underground was really lame for the plot. Also if you think this anime is a slaughter, well its not that either, its more like telling the past of dead people.A notice as well, this anime ends in the break of a new climax, so its really lame, you need to pray for it having a 2o season if you want it to be worth watching it.The art and animation is just as you can see in the cover, kind of bad, especially that this story do use some of action. I do understand that the visuals are more connected to the money placed in the production and less of a choice, but it is just not great. Whatever its watchable.Its a good story, but the art, animation and some characters are not well made, there is some moments that you just say ""ok, that happened"" with no emotions and go on trying to forget it.

I would recommend this anime just because I like the second season... but back to my review for this season.A lot of events happen at the same time, so there are some unwanted cuts. With ""cuts"" I mean from one scene with a view of one character to another scene with the view of a character you don\'t even know existed. (Hope you understand what I mean) Which made this anime confusing and boring because you can\'t ""relate to"" or ""feel with"" a character you just met. After there\'s a cut you first get an impression of the characters...in that scene and then you learn a bit more about the character. Character I gave 6/10 (fair). I often couldn\'t understand the reason why the characters did the stuff they did but if you continue watching, you\'ll understand.Still I don\'t like a lot of characters in this anime... they lack personality.BuT wHat abOUt ThE PLoT? The story idea is fun but the actual story doesn\'t have a plot or at least not a good plot. It\'s about living in the future... yes, you do get to know why they are there and how they manage to survive but that\'s it. I gave the story a 6/10 Because there are some episodes that I enjoy (when you get to learn about the past... I cried so that means it was good) AND as I said/wrote the story idea is good (just like ""The 100"" but that doesn\'t matter since the idea is still good).The art I found quite pretty (you got to see the nature). The characters didn\'t look all the same: they had a lot of details that made them unique. I gave the art an 8/10 because I\'m not super in love with the art style but that\'s just a matter of taste... so is the sound. I gave the sound a 7/10.!I did manage to what this anime till the end and I did enjoy it at the end (enjoyment: 7/10). If you continue watching you\'ll understand the anime somehow.

I\'m going to refrain from remitting the summary of the title as everyone can read that in the synopsis section here.If your thinking about watching this and seeing the heinous score its receiving from most of the other viewers its because its somewhat warranted. To...expand on that I thought I\'d pitch a couple pennies into the jar as well.Firstly the story is not very cohesive, the concept is good and the ideas behind it are solid but the execution of it is terrible. The title doesn\'t seem to know what category it wants to reside in so its all over the board trying to hit all the check boxes for all categories.This leads to a very jarring viewing experience and you\'ll either love it or hate it.I personally couldn\'t tell if it was a romance, drama, survival, horror, or what it was. It started out as a survival type apocalypse story, then shifted to a romance, back to drama, then into a horror, threw in some psychological, mixed it all up, added a olive a viola, a martini shaken, not stirred.Next there are way too many characters and the story is trying to tell the entirety of it through all the character\'s experiences as they deal with the situation(s) they find themselves in. If done correctly it can lead to a cinematic experience that will leave you feeling very satisfied, here however it just adds to the chaos the story has already produced with its erratic story line.The characters themselves are very shallow and plain, really nothing to them that makes them stand out as any type of person we as the viewer can relate too regardless of the circumstances. I felt that they were flat and had just the basic personality painted onto them to make them somewhat ""life-like"". Plus the dialogue is dry and lacking any depth itself. Pretty much as run of the mill you can get without making it like your choking down straw.The rest of it was about mediocre at best and really didn\'t cause me to like or dislike it based on the art or sound.Overall, this is a great time killer or something to keep on while your grinding through whatever game your playing, but to pay attention to it or become invested into the story, characters, world and narrative, yeah sorry it\'ll probably let you down. expand on that I thought I\'d pitch a couple pennies into the jar as well.Firstly the story is not very cohesive, the concept is good and the ideas behind it are solid but the execution of it is terrible.

The girl who was about to be slaughtered by mutated bugs decided she should tell the world of her dreams of becoming an astronaut.The story initially came off boring, but after another episode...the mutated land inspired me to continue watching in case it redeemed itself, but it definitely didn't, it had terrible pacing and after some episodes the mutated island of dangerous bugs, plants and other dangers disappeared without a trace, I have no idea why that happened.

Knowing how this author crafts her stories and characters, I could see from episode one how much they must\'ve butchered it.For example, Tamura\'s characters make empathetic decisions...because of the rich interpersonal relationships developed and the humanness shown to every character no matter how problematic.

The second season will be critical if I keep watching it or if I drop it. "", ""I started this anime with no previous knowledge of the manga and practically nothing about the plot. The main reason I even gave it a try was because I saw someone recommend it for those who enjoyed Dr. Stone. Though entirely different, they have many common themes: the near human extinction, rebuilding humanity, the post apocalyptic factor, etc.Midway through season 1, I checked this anime's MAL page and was surprised at how poorly it was received. But I noticed many people dropped the show quite quickly, quitting somewhere between episode 3-5. Personally, I felt it was interesting enough to dive further, and I am REALLY...glad I did.At first glance, the characters may seem overly trope-y and make you roll your eyes. I did too. However, after watching more and more episodes, the characters have FAR deeper personalities than I had expected. Natsu and Semimaru in particular, whom I found particularly annoying, are very much aware of the way that they act and often get hammered down for it by others. THEY DO GET BETTER TRUST ME! I now have a soft spot for the little shit head that is Semimaru hahaha.My favorite character by far is Ango, who for some reason even after he almost r word and k worded Hana, I couldn't find myself hating. It turns out my intuition was right and he isn't just some scumbag of a man. He definitely has one of the most complex personalities and backstories of any other character. By the end of season two, I have high regards for almost every single character in the show, main to supporting I think they are almost all great.When it comes to how the anime cuts from team to team out of nowhere, I found it weird at first, like the cuts really come out of nowhere. One second you're seeing team summer B bonding and collecting mushrooms and berries and then you see team spring getting their shit rocked by the ocean waves. Yes, it is chaotic, but it isn't difficult to keep up with. I find it far more realistic that not all the teams are either doing well or doing poorly, because they are scattered so far apart and have such different tasks.Now for the art, I don't understand what everyone is saying when they say that it's bad. It really isn't! Of course it's no Violet Evergarden or Demon Slayer, but the simplicity of it and the detail put into all of the nature is beautiful. No one has any wacky hair colors or random fangs, they genuinely do look like real people, as they should. Maybe besides Ryo, the typical tanned white haired character, but he is quite easy of the eyes so I don't mind too much. I agree it may be insulting to the manga art, but the characters are clear, have definitive physical traits, and still retain aspects of their original art. It's a very modern look I must say.In the end, I found myself absolutely loving this show and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's highly entertaining and I think it's close to realistic in terms of how normal people like us would act in such a situation.

Yes, it is chaotic, but it isn't difficult to keep up with. I find it far more realistic that not all the teams are either doing well or doing poorly, because they are scattered so far apart and have such different tasks.Now for the art, I don't understand what everyone is saying when they say that it's bad. It really isn't! Of course it's no Violet Evergarden or Demon Slayer, but the simplicity of it and the detail put into all of the nature is beautiful. No one has any wacky hair colors or random fangs, they genuinely do look like real people, as they should. Maybe besides Ryo, the typical tanned white haired character, but he is quite easy of the eyes so I don't mind too much. I agree it may be insulting to the manga art, but the characters are clear, have definitive physical traits, and still retain aspects of their original art. It's a very modern look I must say.In the end, I found myself absolutely loving this show and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's highly entertaining and I think it's close to realistic in terms of how normal people like us would act in such a situation. I hope you all give it a try!"", ""This anime is a prime example of why you shouldn't bother reading, or for that matter taking seriously, any of these long-winded reviews. All of the long-winded reviews are just people trying to prove they have some analytical depth and are capable of writing.Although this show isn't amazing, it's pretty intriguing. I understand that the Manga is deeper, however, given the constraints (time, money, etc..) on anime creators and production studios, they did a pretty good job of condensing the story and still making it coherent yet mysterious.Never compare what something is to what it could have been, that would be to hold it...to an idealized version of something that is non-existent.

Enjoy the series for what it is, a fairly solid short story."", '*No Spoilers*Summary:This review is for Part 1 of 7 Seeds, which was produced by a different studio than the second season (part 2). I will eventually review Part 2 as well, which is far superior to this part or ""season!""7 Seeds (part 1) is an anime adapted from Yumi Tamura’s manga of the same name. The story takes place in the future after meteorites destroy Earth as it is today, and the characters wake up thousands or some unspecified number of years later to a brand new climate, environment, geography, etc. Unfortunately, the adaptation from the manga is very poor and this anime falls flat...with sporadically developed (and annoying) characters and a disjointed plot. The sci-fi aspect is unrealistic due to the nature of the storytelling and certain living creatures that should be extinct (no spoilers). You may like this anime if you are interested in a compelling story (manga) that poorly adapted its source for seemingly no reason. Also, Part 2 is far better than this season, but you need to watch this first to understand the story.Story: 2/10The source material (manga) is interesting with solid pacing and character development coinciding with the plot. The challenge with this anime is that it was adapted terribly. The scenes randomly cut to characters who are on other islands without even explaining who those characters are or where they are. The whole story is jarring while simultaneously being rammed together and cutting out important pieces of character development from the manga. If the anime had stayed true to the manga (which I only read parts of) then it would be a solid 7/10. Instead, it feels like someone took a complex and interesting sci-fi novel and scattered pieces around by randomizing the page numbers and cutting out half the scenes with characters.Art: 4/10The art is slightly below average in Part 1. The backgrounds are generally pretty, including the water scenes; however, the characters’ appearances vary. They sometimes are detailed and other times appear completely 2-d like a Family Guy character.Sound: 5/10The soundtrack, openings, and endings are average. Some scenes have fitting background music, and the voice acting is one of the show’s best attributes.Character: 3/10A major flaw in the adaptation of this manga into an anime is the way the plot is scattered which ultimately detracts from the character development. Half the time, a character is about to make a change and then suddenly the viewer is thrown to some other island and introduced to another character without any explanation. This doesn’t occur in the manga but happens frequently in the anime. In addition, the character arcs in part 1 of the anime are absurd. There are scenes that last less than two minutes and characters just change their mind and magically are all better. The characters in the manga are unique and developed, but the anime completely destroys them, especially in part 1.Enjoyment: 3/10Part 1 of this anime is particularly unenjoyable because of the bizarre pacing and lack of direction. With all the absurdity aside, it is an interesting concept but adapted terribly. It is all essential to watch this before moving on, and Part 2 was much more enjoyable!Overall: 3.4/10(Part 2 is much better) with sporadically developed (and annoying) characters and a disjointed plot.

It feels really rushed and you don't really get to adapt to the anime in any situation.I remember when I was done watching it, I was just...in such an unexplainably bad mood... it's just so unpleasing to watch it and I really don't recommend watching ... in such an unexplainably bad mood... it's just so unpleasing to watch it and I really don't recommend watching ..."", ""This had a lot of potential, based on what people say about the manga.

The list goes on.Not that there aren't good things - there are some decent moments here...and there that might have been in a better version of the series.

That's I guess why the NETFLIX approach and influence of west gave it this genre.The anime is really quite watchable and solid backstory but the skipping does the anime no good.

There is so much wrong with this show that it is difficult to put it all into words. If I could prevent my past self from watching this anime, I definitely would.The most insidious factor plaguing ""7 Seeds"" is the constant, wildly unrealistic string of minor, plot-advancing events. Falling 20+ meters onto a pile of rocks and not being harmed at all, killing tiger-like beasts with a rock and a stick, bursting into fire after lightly touching the flame of a lighter... Normally in an anime,...if an unexplainable event happens a single time, it can be overlooked as a momentary lapse in the writer\'s judgement. When it happens multiple times an episode and is instrumental to the progression of the central plotline, the show becomes a joke.Perhaps even worse than the ridiculous string of unrealistic events are the characters\' backgrounds and dispositions, which make the story impossible to enjoy. The organizers of the 7 Seeds program were so wildly incompetent that they somehow managed to send multiple serial-killers, rapists, and sadists to repopulate the Earth. As if that weren\'t enough, they MADE some of the kids into these monsters before sending them off. How is it possible to be so terrible at your job that you are incapable of simply selecting a decent and competent human being?The production quality is of course also atrocious. There are a handful of nice scenic views scattered about, but for the most part, it is obvious that this anime was created by Gonzo. When is the last time they managed to make something that actually looks good? Maybe the Afro Samurai sequel in 2009? It is amazing they\'re still making anime at all, if ""7 Seeds"" is the best that they\'re capable of.The reason this anime might deserve a 3/10 rather than a 2/10 or 1/10 is because it does have some redeeming qualities. A small amount of the characters are actually respectable, decent human beings who are capable of challenging the unknown in daring and inspirational ways. Also, deciding to keep the focus moving between such a large cast of main characters was ambitious, with a lot of potential upside. Unfortunately, the idiotic decisions routinely made by many of the characters and the repulsively sadistic tendencies of some of the other characters (who are supposed to be upstanding citizens from good families) make the show impossible to properly enjoy.Although I have yet to watch the second part, I would not recommend this show to anyone, under any circumstances. If you want to watch something terrible for comical appeal, go watch ""King\'s Game"" or ""Ex-Arm"". Those shows are at least bad enough to be funny. If you instead want to watch what ""7 Seeds"" tried in vain to be, then a couple good contenders are ""Btooom!"" and ""Dr. Stone"". Just don\'t watch ""7 Seeds"", unless you want to be regretting it for days. if an unexplainable event happens a single time, it can be overlooked as a momentary lapse in the writer\'s judgement.

Like really sturdy ones aswell. And weird how only one group gets a pistol and ammo to it. No other shelter provided that stuff. So if you wanted the people to live in peace then why give one group guns? To me it kinda seems sort of like a Vault-Tec type of deal. Yeah they might save some people but its mostly for testing and shit. I really dont get how it works.To sum up this all over the place review I think this had a bright future. It did.

While the plot is basic and unoriginal, the show does have a nice way of playing out.Overall, the story is pretty decently written, there\'s multiple characters that are unique and developed quite nicely, the artstyle\'s above average and the soundtrack (i don\'t know if there even is one) is ""meh"".If you\'ve been reading other reviews,...I advise you to ignore them.

And I don\'t think this is even debatable. The only reason one is rated poorly, and the other is rated highly, is because one is on Netflix, and the other is a niche show, aimed at anime hipsters ( I watched it till episode 22, then dropped it, then felt like i had to finish it, cause i was already close, and watched the last 3 episodes over a period of a few weeks.

I was really excited because what I had read of the story seemed like it would translate well to animation.Unfortunately, basically every aspect of this anime fell short of that expectation.The overall idea of the story was interesting. The execution of it was TERRIBLE, though. I did not make it far enough in the manga to be able to say if that issue was due to the source material or the way...that it was adapted, but the impression that I got was that the animators condensed the story so much that many things were left unexplained or underdeveloped. The first several episodes in particular really jumped all over the place. Also, I can normally suspend disbelief and ignore a couple of plot holes here and there, but the storyline here was so threadbare that there was hardly anything left that was plausible enough to hold the plot together. Never have I asked ""why is this even happening?"" so many times. And as far as this being a government project to ensure the survival of humanity after the apocalypse, I could not imagine a more half-assed and idiotic way to try to accomplish that goal (well, I guess that if we are talking about governmental projects, maybe that is realistic? Haha j/k).Now if you thought that the story was unrealistic, just wait until we look at the characters.Several of them had potential, but as a whole they were remarkably two-dimensional. The way that they interact with each other and react to things always came across as so obviously scripted and melodramatic that they were not believable in the slightest. Also, why is everyone an asshole? The only character that I liked at all was the guy with the dogs. And, that may have just been because I like dogs.And to round out this bevy of mediocrity, we have the artwork. Bland, poorly detailed, with odd, jerky movements. And wtf is even going with those odd, discolored strands of hair that all of the characters have wafting around them?In short, I can\'t think of anyone that I would recommend this anime to. I could overlook the artwork OR the characters OR the story being weak, but not all three. I wouldn\'t recommend this to shoujo fans since the characters and their interactions are so bland and contrived. I wouldn\'t recommend this to action fans since the action is poorly executed and just jumps around all over the place.

If you read the genre tags I'd say only heed the adventure, drama and mystery ones. I swear the romance ones are there solely because a motivation is living to find/find out what happened to their loved ones. Anyways, decent enough start but depending on how you weigh your annoyance at the characters verses interest in world this may be a decent to terrible show.StoryThe story is generally about groups of people learning to live in their new environment. The story somewhat breaks...into mini paths following the different groups. A core part of the story is the exploration and mystery solving. It is a little hard to follow due to it skipping around which I wish they put better tags or set up the transitions between story threads better. The flashbacks and stories of how characters got to a place are fascinating and probably the best part of the show. The characters are the core part because we need to care and be worried about them in this new world they're experiencing, so your mileage will very wildly depending on how much you can stand the characters in the beginning. If they're grating I don't suggest continuing.CharactersThis sounds bad but just go with what the show is doing, like don't get caught up in learning everyone immediately. It will happen and honestly there are only a handful of characters out of the like 28 total that matter and need their names remembered. I know some people who didn't appreciate the speed in which everyone who was introduced. I think the groups and characters are introduced in a good order and pace it just takes a little bit to figure out who we need to care about. Anyways, just get to know a few and the rest will come.The first group of people are the starting group who are exactly as confused and uncertain as teens dropped into an unknown time and place. As you travel with this group you meet others of varying competence. I can clearly say I don't enjoy everyone but it also feels natural. Debatably, the characters are too surface level, the first group especially. In group one we have the capable woman, somewhat capable but nice guy, the bully and the clumsy wimp. They're not deep especially when first meeting them but I also wonder if that's because we are thrown into the fray with so many questions. Group 2 is full of clearly more capable people. I think it's trying to introduce a few too many ideas at once and getting a little tangled in that. The next groups are more solid but like don't get bogged down with the names.In character conclusion, if you don't like Arashi (nice guy from group 1), Natsu (wimp from group 1), Semimaru (bully from group 1) and or Hana (capable girl group 2) then you may wanna think hard about how much you like the world you'll be experiencing with them.SoundFun op. I think it and the visuals set up intro better than the show's actual opening minutes. Good beat that carries the start of the show. It's got some unique sounds for all the new creatures and good background music for the environments. The background music is quite nice it really sets the mood. I think it needs better balancing when the background music comes in because the music is quite loud for background music but otherwise good.General feelIt takes too long for the show to finally get comfortable and find it's pacing. Like it dips in and out every time it skips to a new group it's gotta find a new rhythm. Very adventure-y but it's gotta stop jumping, it does it like twice an episode and it doesn't work.Mixed thoughtsThis one is hard to talk about cause it sometimes really shows it's age. Like the manga started in 2001 just for reference, not old but like it can really show it. The show doesn't really start off on the greatest of notes, it picks the lovable doofs who admittedly aren't that lovable upon first meeting them. So like not great character moments in the beginning but I'd say as you go through they grow on you. The CG is kinda meh like the shots they use are fine if the object is still not natural but whatever. If the CG is asked to move well then it's probably water and probably real weird to look at too closely.Positives:- Beautiful world boosted by the art- Interesting look into people- Encourages you to discover and learn as the characters do- If you watch it in one go it tends to make more sense. If there were week long breaks the story would have been more erratic and confusing- Easy to bingeNegatives:- The number of characters- If you watch the first ep and find everyone grating I don't suggest continuing- Depending on which group's story you care about you're somewhat stuck waiting for it to come back around- Skips around to different story threads aka groups- Trigger warning [attempted rape (it is treated as a bad thing and it's not til the end (ep 22?) but warning regardless)] into mini paths following the different groups.

The manga is awful, too.The most lamentable point of this anime (and the manga) is the characters. There is no character development whatsoever. They were the most shallow characters I’ve ever watched on anime. It was a plain and straight ride from the beginning. It’s like the author didn’t know where they wanted to take the characters, and by affinity, the story. The characters are very vague and you don’t form a...connection nor a sympathy for them no matter how the story forces you to because they frankly are just, awfully-written. The only breath of relief is probably the wolves guy but even his character got awful by making him just another plot device, and making him fall in love with the protagonist.

This is great considering the large cast.Sound: 6The background is just okay. The themes aren't memorable but not bad. Leans on the good side. Sort of.Story: 6The premise of the show is somewhat overdone -- post apocalytic worlds and survival aren't really new. What makes the show stand out is that this is one of the more realistic scenarios of how a world can end up in a post apocalyptic state. A meteorite is a much more believable scenario than zombies or other...weird crap other shows pull. This is both a plus and a minus.Plotwise, this show is pretty straightforward. There isn't much complexity to it. The goal is simple -- just to survive and live on. That renders this show reliant on other elements to carry it, such as character development and completeness of effort. This bit is a minus.As for completeness of effort... I am aware this show is 2 cour. For the first cour, this show does a lot of setup. How complete that effort is will depend on cour 2. I'd rather not evaluate this here.Some points to note, are that there are details in the past/background setup that are...poorly thought out. This bit is a heavy minus. For instance, why would a shelter of underground people use extra gruesome methods to thin their numbers? Also, some of the biological threats evolved too fast compared to their real life counter parts. It makes the tension seem forced.Characters: 8Most of the cast, especially main ones have heavy flaws to them in some way or another. This bit isn't bad. It gives them room to grow and they do start to, though I can't say they finish here. This bit is good. The flaws of the characters heavily contribute to the overall drama and tensions which makes for a great watch. Unfortunately, it will be in cour 2 where this can be fully judged. However, as a precursor, Natsu and Semimaru do begin to grow and the growth is easily seen in the later half. Some more minor characters also see growth. The only character worth complaining about is Hana, as her tendencies can get on the idiotic side, socially speaking.Enjoyment: 8Overall, this show was a pleasant  watch. It's biggest flaw is that some background events seem very forced and unrealistic which contrasts negatively with the overall realistic post-apocalyptic scenario. Other than that it was fun. It does take a little time to like the characters. weird crap other shows pull. This is both a plus and a minus.Plotwise, this show is pretty straightforward. There isn't much complexity to it. The goal is simple -- just to survive and live on. That renders this show reliant on other elements to carry it, such as character development and completeness of effort. This bit is a minus.As for completeness of effort... I am aware this show is 2 cour. For the first cour, this show does a lot of setup. How complete that effort is will depend on cour 2. I'd rather not evaluate this here.Some points to note, are that there are details in the past/background setup that are...poorly thought out. This bit is a heavy minus. For instance, why would a shelter of underground people use extra gruesome methods to thin their numbers? Also, some of the biological threats evolved too fast compared to their real life counter parts. It makes the tension seem forced.Characters: 8Most of the cast, especially main ones have heavy flaws to them in some way or another. This bit isn't bad. It gives them room to grow and they do start to, though I can't say they finish here. This bit is good. The flaws of the characters heavily contribute to the overall drama and tensions which makes for a great watch. Unfortunately, it will be in cour 2 where this can be fully judged.

Unfortunately, this means that the anime staff completely misunderstood what was good about the manga.The plot of 7seeds is that the world as we know it has ended, and a few (un)lucky souls have lived through it by being placed in cryogenic sort of sleep. But the world they wake up in is full of new threats that they are ill equipped for but must work to survive nonetheless. Basically, it's a survival story. There are dangers, and our heroes must either physically conquer them or think their way out.This...is a pretty basic plot that sometimes gets a little crazy. But honestly? I don't read the manga so much for the plot as for the deep characters and how they emotionally react to their survival situations and grow and develop as people. I adore the characters in the manga and worrying for their well being is suspenseful.But to go back to what I said at the start, 7seeds anime is like a Cliff Notes version of the manga, so instead of getting deeply developed characters reacting to a simple plot, we get the basics of the plot with almost none of the character development. There are 35 volumes of the manga and only 12 episodes (so far) of the anime, so the pace is fast and furious and totally inadequate at bringing the characters justice. It barely even tries. Large arcs with deep development were literally compressed into half an episode. So the plot and characters, which are maybe a 7 and a 10 from the manga, are more like 6 and a 6.As for the aesthetics, the art of the anime is pretty disappointing (especially when compared to the beautiful shoujo art of the manga). Characters are easy to tell apart but look vague and off-model. The backgrounds are occasionally nice.The music is fine, nothing remarkable or terrible. A few of the voice actors are really well cast (Semimaru was perfect). Most others are OK. I wasn't crazy about Aramaki's voice.I didn't think this was as terrible as others apparently did -- certainly not deserving of a 1 -- but all the same I have no idea who I would recommend this to. Someone who's already read the manga but forgot what happened in the first few volumes and needs a quick refresher? That's about it. Anyone who is curious about 7seeds should just skip the anime and go straight to the manga, which is actually worth your time. is a pretty basic plot that sometimes gets a little crazy. But honestly?

It baffles me how an author is able to make a work this incoherent without it being a parody. I'll try to avoid spoiling anything in depth in this review, but I might touch on more general story beats.By far the biggest problem in this series are the characters. Pretty much all of them are one-dimensional. Most of the supporting cast are fucked in the head (psychopath, deranged, rapist, pedophile or a combination of these traits). The rest of the characters is seemingly okay with the behaviour of these people.All of the characters *constantly* make idiotic decisions. If I were...to elaborate on this, I’d basically be recanting the script of the series. For an example, you can look at my forum post for episode 11. To sum it up, these choices include:-\tTrusting a group of deranged psychopaths-\tTrusting a person who tried to murder them a few hours earlier-\tSacrificing yourself for deranged psychopaths-\tNot being able to recognize imminent danger / not having an ounce of self-preservation instinct.-\tGenerally doing dumb or bizarre things, given the circumstances at hand.As you can guess, horrible things happen to them. Yet they don’t seem to learn a single thing from the whole ordeal. This makes it pretty hard to care about anything that happens to them, since they don’t really seem to care either.The only one I didn’t dislike by the end is the first main character. Her personality is that she’s a socially awkward preteen/teen. This means that she doesn’t make many decisions and she doesn’t do anything outrageously stupid (that I can remember at least)I also didn’t really mind the main guy, although a throwaway line seemed to imply that he doesn’t see anything wrong with strangling kittens. I couldn’t help but laugh at this within the context of this series.The plot isn’t much better. Most of the story is extremely contrived (My favorite of these is characters randomly stumbling upon each other even though they’re strewn all over Japan) or relies on everyone being absolute idiots. There is also extreme plot armor. This isn’t even talking about the worldbuilding, which is also generally stupid.The animation quality degrades over the season, but is serviceable. The one good thing about this series is the intro song.I will say that it was pretty funny to watch due to some of the absurdity. (At one point telepathy is randomly introduced, for seemingly no reason other than steering a group of characters). The characters are so badly written, I often wondered if the author is an misanthropist, or if they just don’t interact with other people. to elaborate on this, I’d basically be recanting the script of the series.

The battles of the ancient bakugans and the ancient bakugans give colour to this season. Every character and bakuga has their own stories. Special stories. Exciting.It's the season where talent and parade Cards are the most diverse. Remember the Battle of the Baron and Prince hydron? The Haos lowering gate card was a really nice move. but Nemus changed the element. That's one of the special things about this season. Besides, his rivals were pretty strong. They've lost all their...elemental energy. Spectra, King Zenoheld etc.They were unforgettable. That's all I think about Bakugan new vestoria for now.I really liked the characters of this season.Spectra was an amazing antagonist at the start.He looks so cool and badass that he becomes your favourite.Sure the last villain the King was a little lame.But its still was fun to watch him getting destroyed.Gus was also amazing.Fun think is if you love brawler then you would also love vexos.Because each of them have amazing personality.I m a big Shadow fan.Ace , Mira and Baron were cool new character.Altho i really liked season 1 main character balance(3 male and 3 females).But the new characters are cool addition to season 2.When it comes to battle there were few lame battles but i gotta say most of them were super cool and hype.Spectra Vs Dan is the example of one of the coolest battle in Bakugan.Tho King vs 6 Guardian was a little lame.But most of the battle were hype.Skyress return was hype.Klaus return was also amazing.Overall i have to say Season 2 is good just as season 1.And it worth a shot if you are a Bakugan fan.Hails to Brawler.Bakugan Brawls stand my season 2 review. :) elemental energy.

I couldn't see how they could continue the story after the ending of Battle Brawlers, but I was positively surprised. I was thrilled from the first episode, already liking the new main characters (I didn't really like Julie and Runo anyway) and happy to see Dan, Marucho, and later on, Shun, back. The story of New Vestroia takes a more mature feeling, and there is more than just brawling. Even if I miss Masquerade, there's a lot of interesting villains to replace him.I liked Battle Brawlers, but I LOVE New Vestroia, so if you liked it too, I...strongly suggest you to give it a try, especially if your favorite character is still on the show. And even if he/she is not a main character anymore (if it was the case), don't give up, they all have some cameos later on ;) strongly suggest you to give it a try, especially if your favorite character is still on the show.

The characters don't feel like themselves in this series. We get one girl out of three girls we get in the last series. They tried to keep Dan not stale but he felt too in the spotlight. I mean Dan and Drago seem like the strongest team out of everyone they had and no focus were there except for Dan,Mira,Spectra. The others were much in the background and the music in Japanese was the best out of the series. Ace and Baron felt boring and empty. "", 'Bakugan: New Vestroia  is extremely disappointing.I ended Bakugan hoping for a decent second season that i would enjoy, but sadly, I was wrong.The story is actually not that bad. A new bad guy is here along with a handful of other people from the new Vestroia and out of all of them only a few go to Dan\'s side. Masquerade aka Alice is no where to be seen, but they don\'t talk about her often anyway. And they all have new bakugan excluding Dan. Which is confusing since Drago is the new core. Oh and when I say ""they all"" I mean Dan,...Marucho, and Shun. Thats right, the girls are left out of all the excitement, which bothers me. The original bakugan anime was fair, having three girls and three boys on the team to save the world from utter destruction. But now their literally just girls who sit on the sidelines and cry for our mighty Dan to win. It\'s so pathetic. Runo\'s bakugan; Tigrerra, is stepped on by the new bad guy and Tigrerra dies.

Please.', 'Finally finished the first arc and i would like to share my thoughts on it.New vestroia is 2nd season of Bakugan battle brawler.And i m so glad this series have more then 1 season as i really loved season 1.The story was good but it was not that good.I m little disappointed that Bakugans can be turn with a little crystal like dimension controller.So Vestals(An Alien Race) attacked vesrroia and turned all the bakugans in ball form.Even tho Drago had the power of infinity core he still could not do anything but to ask help from Dan and thats were all of it begins.Now its...fine by me as i was really enjoying it but then we came to find out what happened to 5 main Bakugans of season 1.Hydranoid was turned into labrat and then turned into statue for prince of vestals.Tigrerra was badly beaten by a vestal bakugan and also turned into statue.The rest was already in statue so i dont know how they were captured.That were my complains about this sequel but i still enjoyed this arc a lot.The character designs are cool i really like new outfit of every old brawler except for alice.The new characters to main team are good but not that good.I really wished they had the old team like balance which means 3 boys and 3 girls but there were only 1 girl in whole group which was not to my liking but still was fine.The new team members are Mira ,Ace and Baron.Shun ,Dan and Marucho are the old team member and this time the team name is Bakugan Battle Brawler Resistance.I really like all new members altho Baron needed some development.Mira is the leader with a goal to free all the Bakugans and btw the new 3 members are vestals aka aliens that attacked vestroia.As for the villians we have a team name Vexos that works for Prince of vesrals.The new villians team is good i think and all of the members of Vexos team are unique.We have Spectra the leader of vexos whose main goal is to turn his bakugan into an ultimate bakugan.Spectra wears a mask just like Masquerade and he is one of the best character of this season.The rest of the members are also good and unique in there own way,Now one of the thing i disliked about it CGI animation for mechanical Bakugans.Yea vestals have an advance technology that can create mechanical Bakugans.But this might be acceptable as it was created in 2008 when cgi was not a thing.The characters are great , story is good , art/animation is good.I enjoyed it a lot and i m gonna finish the whole season and will give another full review.Thanks for reading it guys. fine by me as i was really enjoying it but then we came to find out what happened to 5 main Bakugans of season 1.Hydranoid was turned into labrat and then turned into statue for prince of vestals.Tigrerra was badly beaten by a vestal bakugan and also turned into statue.The rest was already in statue so i dont know how they were captured.That were my complains about this sequel but i still enjoyed this arc a lot.The character designs are cool i really like new outfit of every old brawler except for alice.The new characters to main team are good but not that good.I really wished they had the old team like balance which means 3 boys and 3 girls but there were only 1 girl in whole group which was not to my liking but still was fine.The new team members are Mira ,Ace and Baron.Shun ,Dan and Marucho are the old team member and this time the team name is Bakugan Battle Brawler Resistance.I really like all new members altho Baron needed some development.Mira is the leader with a goal to free all the Bakugans and btw the new 3 members are vestals aka aliens that attacked vestroia.As for the villians we have a team name Vexos that works for Prince of vesrals.The new villians team is good i think and all of the members of Vexos team are unique.We have Spectra the leader of vexos whose main goal is to turn his bakugan into an ultimate bakugan.Spectra wears a mask just like Masquerade and he is one of the best character of this season.The rest of the members are also good and unique in there own way,Now one of the thing i disliked about it CGI animation for mechanical Bakugans.Yea vestals have an advance technology that can create mechanical Bakugans.But this might be acceptable as it was created in 2008 when cgi was not a thing.The characters are great , story is good , art/animation is good.I enjoyed it a lot and i m gonna finish the whole season and will give another full review.Thanks for reading it guys.', ""Mild spoilers, nothing too big.This is my first review so please give me some breathing room here. The first season of Bakugan was certainly enjoyable in it’s own right. Fun battles and tactics, good use of the game mechanics, and some interesting characters (especially Alice). Unfortunately, it was bogged down by lackluster pacing, an inconsistent protagonist, and a child-friendly coating that kept most of the darker elements from taking center-stage.This completely changes with the second season: New Vestroia. This sequel takes what season 1 did right and expanded in...each of the areas. The improvements are plain as day, so much so that you almost forget it’s targeted towards kids… or is it? That is probably the biggest reason why this is such a great improvement over Battle Brawlers, the fact that New Vestroia makes it clear that things aren’t going to be as easy to digest as the previous season, a bigger stage for the characters and audience.Airing just over a year after the completion of Battle Brawlers, the target demographic for this series remains largely the same, but with just enough development for kids to realize that this is going to be much different that season 1. The kid friendly coating is still present, but far less prominent overall. Instead of the basic good vs evil plot, this season focuses on the familial and extraterrestrial struggles between worlds.StoryLet’s start with the plot. The story already fairs better from the beginning. Battle Brawlers had a good start, introducing us to the game mechanics right away, but dragged when it came to hooking the audience into the plot. New Vestroia immediately let’s us know just what is happening and what needs to be done to stop it, as well as showing us the changes to the battle system.Afterward, the story builds on it’s new aspects and lore with new twists that provide a darker subtext to the series, more so than that of season 1. What makes it different from season 1 however is the way it’s presented and how it plays out. Every episode has a meaning beyond just introducing a character or playing a match, while the pacing appropriately matches the scene or battle at hand. The story is constantly moving forward without forcing itself through.The focus of the Vestals and their inhabitants of Vestroia is a primary plot thread of the season, with their lack of understanding of the world and the conflict with the resistance providing an engaging storyline that gets better with each episode. Whenever the focus transfers back to Earth, it feels like the pacing slows down somewhat, but also serves as a nice break from all the intensity.9/10CharactersNew Vestroia introduces a plethora of new characters, mainly because… well… aliens are a thing now and they need characters to fill those positions. New heroes and villains are present at almost every turn, each of which bring something different to the table, while returning characters have exceptionally strong development.Let’s start with the returning characters. Dan is back as the main protagonist, and has significantly improved. His personality has been more streamlined with a greater focus on his impulsiveness and relationship with Drago. Marucho is relatively the same, but with some added quirks related to Elfin and Preyas, especially in the second half. Shun and Ingram are probably the strongest duo, especially with how Shun has developed from season 1.The new brawlers are competent and fun additions to the series. Mira is tied to the story in a natural way, and functions as a morally complex individual that is easy to connect to. Baron is fun loving and the classic superfan type, already fitting into the group rather well. Ace is somewhat of a loner like Shun, but lacks the development of the other two. Nevertheless, he remains a competent addition to the cast.The villains are the Vexos, each with a different personality and fighting style that compliments both their attribute and Bakugan. Spectra is the most complex, both due to his own desires and the story revolving around him(plus his design is just really good). Gus is a good second to Spectra, while Miylene is a good background manipulator. Shadow is just pure fun with his Joker-esc personality, and Lync is substantial as a developed child character who just seeks enjoyment. Volt is relatively basic unfortunately, but has some nice moments here and there.Zenoheld and Hydron aren’t very prominent throughout the first half, but get much more time during the second. It is sad to say this, but they are pretty one-dimensional as far as villains go, especially Zenoheld. Hydron does somewhat come into his own during the last portion, but it didn’t really stick with me personally.The supporting cast is about what you would expect. The old brawlers return as background characters initially, but take a more prominent role as the story goes on. Overall, the supporting cast fills the role of secondary characters well, but sometimes they feel purposefully undermined for the sake of spotlighting the brawlers.8.5/10Battles, music and animationThe battle system has gained all sorts of new quirks and additions. Only one gate card is active at a time now, while abilities can be chained together. Bakugan traps make their debut, which would later go on to inspire the battle gear and mechtagons of following seasons.These additions are mostly positive, with each bringing something new to the battle without overcomplicating the system like Mechtaniam Surge did later. The additional usage of multiple abilities makes battles even more intense, with every turn changing the course of the battle dramatically even with the nerf to gate cards.The life gauge is a system adopted from YuGiOh, with brawlers losing when it drops to zero. People can also win Bakugan from opponents now with how the system works. Every battle has a sense of suspense, especially with how vicious the Vexos can be with their battles and Bakugan. There is a constant worry that the battle could end in disaster, especially with how skilled each member of the Vexos is.The animation is an unfortunate black smear, but it has gotten better from the previous season. While many of the character and Bakugan designs are pleasant and downright fantastic, the animation style itself is simplistic and screams kids show. The same can be said for the english voice acting. Japanese is fine, but english ranges from average to bad. The animation does significantly improve during action and battle sequences, especially during climaxes, and it certainly isn't overall bad, but it doesn't compare to other shows of the same genre.There isn’t much to say on the music of Bakugan because it isn’t that memorable. Some tracks amp up during emotional sequences but the overall soundtrack is pretty forgettable outside of action.7.5/10Final verdict: 8.5 out of 10.New Vestroia is an amazing upgrade from Battle Brawlers. The story, characters, and action have all improved dramatically while the music and animation are still very much lacking due to the low bar set by the target audience. If you don’t mind these issues, then I recommend giving this season a chance, especially if the first season turned you off with it’s lack of direction and Dan’s infuriating personality. each of the areas. The improvements are plain as day, so much so that you almost forget it’s targeted towards kids… or is it?

Only one gate card is active at a time now, while abilities can be chained together. Bakugan traps make their debut, which would later go on to inspire the battle gear and mechtagons of following seasons.These additions are mostly positive, with each bringing something new to the battle without overcomplicating the system like Mechtaniam Surge did later. The additional usage of multiple abilities makes battles even more intense, with every turn changing the course of the battle dramatically even with the nerf to gate cards.The life gauge is a system adopted from YuGiOh, with brawlers losing when it drops to zero. People can also win Bakugan from opponents now with how the system works. Every battle has a sense of suspense, especially with how vicious the Vexos can be with their battles and Bakugan. There is a constant worry that the battle could end in disaster, especially with how skilled each member of the Vexos is.The animation is an unfortunate black smear, but it has gotten better from the previous season. While many of the character and Bakugan designs are pleasant and downright fantastic, the animation style itself is simplistic and screams kids show. The same can be said for the english voice acting. Japanese is fine, but english ranges from average to bad. The animation does significantly improve during action and battle sequences, especially during climaxes, and it certainly isn't overall bad, but it doesn't compare to other shows of the same genre.There isn’t much to say on the music of Bakugan because it isn’t that memorable. Some tracks amp up during emotional sequences but the overall soundtrack is pretty forgettable outside of action.7.5/10Final verdict: 8.5 out of 10.New Vestroia is an amazing upgrade from Battle Brawlers. The story, characters, and action have all improved dramatically while the music and animation are still very much lacking due to the low bar set by the target audience. If you don’t mind these issues, then I recommend giving this season a chance, especially if the first season turned you off with it’s lack of direction and Dan’s infuriating personality.""]"
Bari Bari Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5002/Bari_Bari_Densetsu,"[""Part 1 is basically an introduction of the main charactesr and how they unite, and part 2 is mostly driven by development despite being mostly dedicated to the race in Suzuka. I&rsquo;m guessing you need some familiarity with the manga to get some idea of what&rsquo;s going on more directly, maybe such as why Gun races on motorcycles and why he obtained such skill. Gun and Hideyoshi just have your typical rivalry like Inuyasha and Kouga from that respective anime and it&rsquo;s mostly used for comic relief. Ai seems to be more of the token cute girl, and Hiro is there to help Miyuki, while...Miyuki was just the token fan service girl with some descent substance.But if anything is going to stick out to you, it&rsquo;s definitely going to be the ending. I can&rsquo;t describe it, you&rsquo;re going to have to see it for yourself because it totally affected me and took me by surprise. Even though there is limited material, it does a descent job of making you care for the characters and the foundation is good enough to understand their characters and to produce development.Well, the art style does somewhat resemble some of the character designs in Initial D, but during the publication of this manga, Morikawa Jyoji, the creator of one of my favorite mangas, Hajime no Ippo, was a staff membe,r and I really see more of his style in this anime than really the Initial D style except for Gun&rsquo;s character design with the way Shigeno draws diamond eyes to make them slanted in an Asian style and he tends to draw faces at a slanted angle as well. But there are some 1980s characteristics of Gun such as the semi-big hair.The rest of the designs are really just generic and that&rsquo;s it. I mean, the way Shigeno draws his lips sometimes is not yet prevalent and I guess he hadn&rsquo;t established his style like that yet. But the way Morikawa draws the eyes and how he draws rectangular faces at times seem to be more present so I&rsquo;m guessing the way Shigeno did things during this time was a major influence in Morikawa&rsquo;s style. For the races, there&rsquo;s really no novelty environmental factors that really make any impact on the race such as gutter gripping, but what makes up for it is that risk factor I talked about in Wangan Midnight. The races are portrayed accurately with the designs of the motorcycles, the postures, the steering and everything. When you see the races in a more 3rd or 1st person perspective, you can see the road and the rest of the foreground and track zooming in on you as if you were driving yourself. Granted it&rsquo;s 1980s, I think it bring a genuine sensuality to the races.As for Suzuka, you might be able to recognize the name from the Gran Turismo games. What's cool is that it times it does give an aerial view of the course, and you'll be able to recognize it from the course maps.But back to the risk factor, there will be some wicked crashes, so if you want to see some crashes, check this out.Despite this being an unknown anime, the featured seiyuus are pretty big names. Starting with Hideyoshi&rsquo;s seiyuu, Nakao Ryuusei, the voice of Freeza from Dragon Ball Z. He does speak in Osaka dialect, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the authenticity to the aggression and accent as the voice actor of Sendo does in Hajime no Ippo. But I think the voice does contemplate his small size at some capacity like how it did with Freeza. And Gun is played by Tanaka Hideyuki, the voice of Enrico Maxwell in Hellsing and Rayearth in Magic Knight Rayearth, I thought he had a good deep voice, but I thought his performance based on how he was written was of course more one dimensional and I thought he sounded too old. Next Miyuki, our pink haired cutsey fan service racer played by Toda Keiko, who is probably most famous to Gundam fans as the voice of Matilda-san from the original Gundam series. She does an excellent job as playing a more cutsey and innocent girl, but with an adrenaline edge at times.The last seiyuu I want to get into is Ai, played by Jpop sensation Oginome Yoko, who also sings the theme songs. The theme songs are very upbeat in an 1980s manner, and the singing is a little feminine but energetic. Though the music isn&rsquo;t really Eurobeat nor is it really close to the nature of the soundtrack of Initial D, the music ranges from all kinds of beats and styles whether light hearted sounds or intense guitars to set the atmosphere of a funny scene or a last mile race.Well, I found this anime interesting enough to hope that one day I can get my hands on the manga. I would like to know what parts of the manga I was reading as well so I know where I am to understand some of the foundations that are going on. Also, I would like to see one day hopefully a remake of this series because I personally like realistic anime nowadays. I enjoy the careful use of risk factors, and the interactions and relationship developments. But I personally recommend this more for people already familiar with Initial D mostly because it&rsquo;s by the same creator, so you get some understanding of what he does and why. I also recommend this to Hajime no Ippo fans mostly because of the character designs. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t Gun resemble Miyata? And to conclude, if you know where you an get the manga, hook me up.
