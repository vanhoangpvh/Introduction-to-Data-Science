Yakyuukyou no Uta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10554/Yakyuukyou_no_Uta,"['Holy guacamole, it gets better in the ep5, seems like the opposite thing of muzu\'s usual deal: lackluster at first, becomes imaginative, inventive, sensitive and cute as the time passes.Can relate to the wolf of the north guy, he looks spent, crass, and burnt out, though at least he is handsome, while I\'m just lazy, unstable and scrawny instead.11 eps in and it really is shocking, charming and sensuous, but damnit it was a single movie\'s worth of material, not 10 45-minutes episodes. Ep12 is aight, too, I guess. Tetsu carrying the game with tricks until complete exhaustion is actually hilarious, but still...a mid show and not ""one outs"" or such.Ep13 starts to look like some real soulless 60s shit: like when the moment is not important (not some match or dramatic pivot), it is actually uglier than Ashita no Joe tv-1 or such. Very poor for late 70s, in other words.13 also has a badass death scene, but still, I\'m not that much attached to the character, and it was still not worth 13 45-minutes episodes. All in all, I\'m not impressed.Also, Hiura\'s reaction is so edgy and contrived, it had me burst into laughter despite the dramatic moment. But at least the (second? additional?)OP/ED song for those eps are catchy and great.While the ep14 has this cool idea and pretty brutal imagery, the story is still stupid and feels fake and contrived, it took too much a coincidence to pull all that shit out: no one figuring out they have similar scars, then them never meeting each other before, then mom recovering from it and also coming in at a right place and time, then them both going into baseball - all in all, looks utterly stupid and feigned.In the latter half, the show resorts increasingly more to a ""lazy scriptwriter\'s magic wand"" which is the untimely death of a player\'s father. Well, at least they bother to write in the premises and explanations, not just the usual and convenient ""spitting blood for no reason"" anime disease.Alright, in the end of the day, the show really lives up to its name: it\'s an ode to the small people with baseball as a bee in their bonnet.But that\'s it! It could have been quite good, had it been a documentary about players/people pertained and everything that can go wrong in the baseball industry, but as it is now, it\'s pretty much any other baseball anime of the era, but cheaper. Excluding Mitsuru Adachi\'s titles, naturally, because those play in a complete dumpster league of their own. This is by far not GOAT, but still on the opposite side of the spectrum from Adachi.The other issue is Mizuhara cutie, the one tagged as ""leading character"" and the one on the poster, completely disappearing somewhere before the Wolf of the North chapter. I was sure she\'ll be back one of those episodes, but no. She\'s just a clickbait. a mid show and not ""one outs"" or such.Ep13 starts to look like some real soulless 60s shit: like when the moment is not important (not some match or dramatic pivot), it is actually uglier than Ashita no Joe tv-1 or such.

Tsukipro The Animation 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37008/Tsukipro_The_Animation_2,"[""I'll reference the first season but without spoilers. (The review has been updated after finishing the last episode)If you are thinking about starting the first season, do it only if you want to get into the whole series. I think it's a good starting point. If you are planning to just watch the anime and move on, it'll probably not be worth it.If you watched the first season and liked it, watch this too. It's more of the same but around 4 years later. There are also 3 episodes in a yokai alternate universe or something, I don't know what it was but it was...good.About the story and characters: most of the plot comes from long flashbacks which are basically content from drama CDs, but it's pretty good, at least for episodic anime standards. The 4 units take turns, and the last episode is the concert. It does a good job on introducing the units, the dynamics of their characters and their music. With 17 main characters, you can't expect much from each character individually, but the units as a whole have good dynamics. Like QUELL, Eichi and Shu are basically the mum and dad for the twins, I love them. 🤧Animation-wise, there isn't a lot of movement, but the characters are well drawn. The 3D animation though? I think they blew out all the budget there. There's one for each opening and then another one for the last performance in the concert.Sound-wise, I can't say much about the background soundtrack. But the insert songs, unlike in the first season or in Tsukiuta, there are a lot of them, and they work really well. Not to mention the new songs, OPs and EDs, they are really good. And so are the voice actors, with a nice mix of popular and experienced VAs and not so popular (but really underrated) ones. It's probably one of my fav casts for an idol series.Conclusion: quite a mediocre idol anime, but I think it's a good starting point to my personally favourite idol series out there. There's a lot of quality and uniqueness in the music. There isn't anything like Growth or QUELL in other idol series. SOARA and SolidS aren't that unique, but nevertheless, amazing music. And the story in the drama CDs is pretty good too. SOARA even has 2 live action movies.Let me say one more thing before leaving, in my opinion, there was a big gap in quality in the music between 2015 (the first year) and 2016. Just in case someone starts with the oldest songs and thinks I'm lying when I said the music is great. 👉👈Thanks for reading! And I hope this caught someone's attention. I think Tsukipro is really underrated, at least outside of Japan. good.About the story and characters: most of the plot comes from long flashbacks which are basically content from drama CDs, but it's pretty good, at least for episodic anime standards.

Ys,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1276/Ys,"['Let’s face it, when watching a series from the era this show was produced you have to usually endure crude (by today’s standards) animation, poufy hairdos, and campy storylines.  That’s not the case here, except for maybe the poufy hairdos.  I never played the games that Ancient Books of Ys is apparently based on (nor have I even heard of them) but regardless this series stands on its own as one of the truly exceptional fantasy/adventure stories of its genre.The story premise isn’t anything that’s going to win award for originality.  It’s your standard adventurer from another land who comes and is...destined to save the world.  We quickly get laid out the details and our hero, in this case Adol Christian is given a quest and each episode that follows is a fairly formulaic pattern.  New allies are made along his quest which help Adol achieve his goals and make it the final battle with the villain.  While the story is simplistic it does still manage to be interesting and it does give a lot of back story on the people and the land being saved.  Despite being a short series I did find myself caring what happened to it and its people.  The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger as it clearly sets up the scenario for part 2.In any fantasy adventure like this one the action is very important, and there is a lot of it in Ys.  The battles play out a lot like a fantasy RPG game would be expected to.  In order to get a treasure, a boss monster must be defeated and that is pretty much how things play out.  As Adol completes his quests his weapons and armor get better, again much like a game.  The battles though are a bit disappointing though as they become a bit repetitive and basically are Adol getting beat up for a couple minutes until he figures out some new skill or power that allows him to be victorious.Characters in Ys are a win.  Adol gets pretty well developed and we get a few pieces of his past but not a lot.  He manages to grow over the course of the story and is a likable character that you want to cheer for.  The supporting characters are fairly good; some are more interesting than others while some are pretty much just cardboard cutouts to fill the screen.  Dogi is the best and he brings a lot of the comedy moments, makes a good sidekick like you would see in a 80s action movie.Animation and sound are difficult to rate.  I have to remember that this show is almost 20 years old.  I am sure at its time this was considered really good.  It does hold up fairly well, I have seen far worse, later on in the decade but the characters are pretty simple looking and are colored with a dreary and dull pallet.  However some of the backgrounds and terrain are very exceptional.  Your either going to be ok with it or you’re going to think it’s incredibly crude.  The music is very 80s, from the background music and sound effects to the ending song.  The song isn’t that bad and I kinda liked it though.Overall this series is very good.  I think it would have made a great longer series that would have allowed for much more story and character depth.  Fantasy lovers should check this out without fail.  Anyone else who is feeling nostalgic for older anime or likes an enjoyable and short show to watch should also give this a try. destined to save the world.

There are a few minor changes but nothing that would alter the story.As a devoted fan of the games it's only natural that I know and love the story very much. So a 9 on story from me.Art:I'm a huge fan of 80's animation. Always have been. This show looks very much like Maison Ikkoku or even early Ranma1/2. It's very warm and straight forward with bright colors and smooth lines. For me, as I've played the original DOS game and the remakes of the games it was...very fun to watch the story come to life with my favorite era of animation. A  big fat 10 on art. ^__^Sound:The sound is fine. But as the show is rather old the sound does leave a fair amount to be desired. I will say the sound effects are very nostalgic because they're old. But it's not up to the standards of today. A 6 on sound.(Music) There is no music section so I'll just say this here. The music is basically the music from the game just re-recorded and altered slightly for the show. But it's awesome to hear the music in the anime! If I could I'd give music a 9!Character(s):The characters are all the same characters from the game and I love them all.Because it's a show we get to see more character development. Still not a huge amount but it's still very nice. And who doesn't love Adol and Feena and them?The character designs are also very nice, and generally very much like the game.An 8 on character from me.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this hugely as an original old-school fan! It was great to see the game come to life like this. And even if you know nothing of the games it's still a great ride. ^__^ I would recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy.10/10 on enjoyment!Overall:Taking everything into consideration I'll give this anime a 10.It's very fun and anyone can get into it. ^^So I hope you all enjoy watching this as much as me! very fun to watch the story come to life with my favorite era of animation. A  big fat 10 on art. ^__^Sound:The sound is fine. But as the show is rather old the sound does leave a fair amount to be desired. I will say the sound effects are very nostalgic because they're old.

Basically, it's a series of action RPGs that helped define the genre back in the late 80s. It's also Falcom's best known franchise with around a dozen installments at this point but Falcom also doesn't have much else under their belts that's memorable and even their best known games aren't all that well known compared to a lot of other franchises from bigger name companies. Don't get me wrong, though, most of the franchise is made up of quality games. Back in the late 80s, when the series was in its infancy, Falcom worked...with Tokyo Kids (a studio so minor they don't even have a wiki page) to produce OVAs for the first and second games. The first one being what we're going to look at today.Story:Our tale opens with a traveler named Adol Christin trying to book passage to the land of Esteria, a land blocked by a tempest and rumoured to be overrun by monsters. He manages to break through the storm and reach the land, learning that the rumours were true. Furthermore, a young fortune teller named Sarah claims that his coming was foretold and that he can save Esteria, but first he has to go on a perilous journey to find the six books of Ys.Those of you familiar with the game will recognise the plot as will those of you who have never even heard of it. The story isn't exactly original. The whole “destined hero” storyline was really common when the game came out in the late 80s and it's remained so to this day. To be fair, the game was initially released back in 1987 when the technology was a lot more limited and there was only so much they could do with a game's story without sacrificing gameplay and the story itself, though nothing new, isn't badly told and does have some compelling dramatic moments and exciting adventurous moments.The pacing is mixed. The action does flow pretty well from one episode to the next without being overwhelming or rushed, but it's done at the expense of character moments. There's never much of an opportunity to get to know the characters or for the characters to develop since Adol has to move from location to location, action scene to action scene too quickly.Characters:As you can probably surmise, the characters in this aren't very strong. Take our protagonist, Adol. His motivations are really flimsy and he's just kind of a stagnant, generic hero. He doesn't know why he wants to go to Esteria and he supposedly doesn't believe the prophesy about himself, but he does exactly what the prophesy demands from him because... moon prism power. There's really no development between his doubts and his deciding to follow the path of the prophesied saviour. It just switches from one to the other without explanation. Our antagonist, Dark Fact, is just as bad. The only motivation we get from him is that some people are short-sighted and careless but that's a really weak justification for him to try to destroy everything.Art:The art is pretty good. It definitely shows its age, but you can tell that a lot of time and effort went into the character designs and backgrounds. That being said, the action sequences over-use motion blurred backgrounds and the final battle sequence is kind of weak and anti-climactic.Sound:I have no complaints about the acting. They got some strong actors. Adol is voiced by Kusao Takeshi (who also voiced Cless in the Tales of Phantasia OVA.) It also features the vocal talents of Takayama Minami, Honda Chieko and Hayami Show, to name a few. The music is just really good.Ho-yay:There is no ho-yay, or romance at all really.Final Thoughts:Ancient Book of Ys is a decent enough anime, if you want a simple adventure. Unfortunately, the characters are weak and the story has been done much better before and since. You should definitely see it if you're a fan of the game. If you just want a quick fantasy adventure it'll probably appeal to you too. Otherwise, there's not much of a reason to watch it. My final rating is going to be a 6/10.

The progression and pacing all seemed on the money when it comes to everything important that needed to be covered in Ys 1. Obviously for anime purposes they couldn't make the authenticity of the video 100% accurate because certain scenes would probably have been more boring if that was the case. Example when Adol is venturing through the tower of Dahm he is accompanied by Dogi, Luther...Gemma and Goban. In the video game Adol is by himself going in as Goban never came, Gemma was already locked in there (which was kind of right in the anime) and Dogi who was in there and didn't know who Adol was until he freed Adol when he was imprisoned by breaking through the wall of the prison he and Gemma were in by accident in the anime but on purpose in the video game. Obvious changes that I can list on and on but majority of them didn't hinder the authenticity of the actual story so it is mostly forgiven. One episode in particular I have to give some points to is episode 5 which is the episode where Adol meets the Tree that gives him the silver armor the info dump in this episode was presented (imo) better than the actual video game making it more understanding when it came to the origin behind everything in the story.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodThe art and animation in this 1985 anime adaptation of a 1987 video game is not bad when you take into consideration of the time it came out. Majority of anime that came out in the 80s had this art style and animation which doesn't bother me, it's the art style and animation of the 80s and if you know that going in there you wouldn't be disappointed or disgusted unless you expected it to look like the cover picture on MAL or the don't like old style art style and animation.Sound (9/10) GreatThe sound for the anime is probably the best thing about this anime. I'm going through the Ys games and the only one I've completed is Ys 1 and another which isn't worth mentioning right now. All you need to know is as someone coming fresh out of Ys 1 and watching this anime I love the fact that majority if not all of the BGM that is played in the anime is remix BGM of music found in Ys 1. Every BGM that played during parts in the game plays during the exact parts in this anime and it's great from a adaptation quality stand point. The only reason I can't give this a 10 is the fact that I was watching the english dub version of the anime. And certain names aren't pronounced correctly as far as I know. Like Ahh-dol (As far as I know it's Aye-dol) and they go back and fourth between Dark Fact and Dark Factor those where the main two that threw me off and the voice acting is a bit dated but not bad when it take into consideration that this is from the 80s.Characters (8/10) GoodCharacters in the anime adaptation of Ys 1 is very good. Giving a personality to Adol a character which (if you only played the game) would never know how he is from a personality standpoint since he's presented to the player with a personality similar to a created character aka a personality that is hard to define. It is interesting to see how Adol acts since I personally didn't know until watching this anime and I felt they did a good job he isn't annoying, generic or boring which am grateful he isn't. Other characters since we know how they act in the video CAN be judged from a authenticity standpoint and everyone in the anime I felt was adapted perfectly except one character. This character is Dogi and I've only played Ys 1 (and Ys: Memories of Celceta which he's not in). And only going off of Ys 1 Dogi didn't really give off the same personality that he did in this anime. In the video I saw him has the muscle behind Adol sure but he never really gave off ANY signs of comedic relief in the video game. And in the anime he is obviously the comedic relief and this isn't a bad thing because at the end of the day it wasn't bad or annoying it was actually quite entertaining which I'm not TOO mad about it. BUT from an authenticity standpoint I felt it was incorrect characterization but it is what it is.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodI enjoyed the 7 episode anime adaptation of Ys 1, especially the music that was played in the background. Nothing more to be said it wasn't dragged on longer than it should have been either which is good since the video itself isn't that long to begin with.Overall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.75/10) Good+I felt this 1989 adaption of the 1987 video game Ys is a good adaptation with a few changes to make it have that anime feel but not enough to straw it away from being considered a good adaption for when it comes to an anime made two years after it's video game in the 80s because back then and even today anime adaptations of video games aren't done well. Gemma and Goban. In the video game Adol is by himself going in as Goban never came, Gemma was already locked in there (which was kind of right in the anime) and Dogi who was in there and didn't know who Adol was until he freed Adol when he was imprisoned by breaking through the wall of the prison he and Gemma were in by accident in the anime but on purpose in the video game.

Majority of anime that came out in the 80s had this art style and animation which doesn't bother me, it's the art style and animation of the 80s and if you know that going in there you wouldn't be disappointed or disgusted unless you expected it to look like the cover picture on MAL or the don't like old style art style and animation.Sound (9/10) GreatThe sound for the anime is probably the best thing about this anime. I'm going through the Ys games and the only one I've completed is Ys 1 and another which isn't worth mentioning right now. All you need to know is as someone coming fresh out of Ys 1 and watching this anime I love the fact that majority if not all of the BGM that is played in the anime is remix BGM of music found in Ys 1. Every BGM that played during parts in the game plays during the exact parts in this anime and it's great from a adaptation quality stand point. The only reason I can't give this a 10 is the fact that I was watching the english dub version of the anime. And certain names aren't pronounced correctly as far as I know. Like Ahh-dol (As far as I know it's Aye-dol) and they go back and fourth between Dark Fact and Dark Factor those where the main two that threw me off and the voice acting is a bit dated but not bad when it take into consideration that this is from the 80s.Characters (8/10) GoodCharacters in the anime adaptation of Ys 1 is very good. Giving a personality to Adol a character which (if you only played the game) would never know how he is from a personality standpoint since he's presented to the player with a personality similar to a created character aka a personality that is hard to define. It is interesting to see how Adol acts since I personally didn't know until watching this anime and I felt they did a good job he isn't annoying, generic or boring which am grateful he isn't. Other characters since we know how they act in the video CAN be judged from a authenticity standpoint and everyone in the anime I felt was adapted perfectly except one character. This character is Dogi and I've only played Ys 1 (and Ys: Memories of Celceta which he's not in). And only going off of Ys 1 Dogi didn't really give off the same personality that he did in this anime. In the video I saw him has the muscle behind Adol sure but he never really gave off ANY signs of comedic relief in the video game. And in the anime he is obviously the comedic relief and this isn't a bad thing because at the end of the day it wasn't bad or annoying it was actually quite entertaining which I'm not TOO mad about it. BUT from an authenticity standpoint I felt it was incorrect characterization but it is what it is.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodI enjoyed the 7 episode anime adaptation of Ys 1, especially the music that was played in the background. Nothing more to be said it wasn't dragged on longer than it should have been either which is good since the video itself isn't that long to begin with.Overall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.75/10) Good+I felt this 1989 adaption of the 1987 video game Ys is a good adaptation with a few changes to make it have that anime feel but not enough to straw it away from being considered a good adaption for when it comes to an anime made two years after it's video game in the 80s because back then and even today anime adaptations of video games aren't done well."", '“Ys” is an enjoyable, albeit by-the-book, high fantasy adventure that feels like it was lifted straight from a video game (it was based off of one, so that’s understandable).This 7-episode OVA centers on a young man named Adol, who is driven by destiny to fulfill a prophecy and become a hero to a nation plagued by monsters. He must collect the magical six Books of Ys, which contain records of the nation’s past, to do so, while making friends and fighting monsters along the way.The plot progresses logically, and has a satisfying conclusion that sets things up nicely for the sequel. However, the story is...formulaic to a fault, and plays out almost exactly like a video game. For instance, a character asks the hero to go into a cave to retrieve a magical artifact for them, which the character then uses to “unlock” something else to further the plot along. The fights are repetitive; the hero slashes through the “mob” characters easily, but always gets his butt kicked during the boss fights until a critical moment when he remembers something someone told him, and then he’s suddenly able to defeat the boss. The antagonists’ motivations are stated, but not explored, so they feel somewhat unrealistic. There are a number of twists and revelations throughout the series, but they’re so predictable that you can see them coming from a mile away even if you’re only halfway paying attention. The characters are all basically archetypes, but they do get some (predictable) development.The dialogue can be repetitive; the antagonists declare that humans are foolish at least a dozen times, for instance. Most of the conversations are reminiscent of video game dialogue. Also, while the writing is mostly solid, there are a few inconsistencies here and there.Regarding technical aspects, the animation is serviceable, although there are lots of still shots, off-model characters and even some blatantly recycled scenes. With a number of jumpy scene transitions, the direction is subpar. The character designs and art are “classic”; not unique, but pleasing to the eye. The voice acting is just average.The soundtrack is a mix of ‘80s rock music and orchestral fantasy-type music. The ending themes for the first two episodes are instrumental, but starting from the third episode we get “Endless History,” which is a fantastic (in all senses of the word) rock ballad, and one of the highlights of this OVA.This series does not have much in the way of objectionable content; it’s pretty family-friendly for the most part. There’s some human vs. monster violence, and a little blood and some deaths of minor characters that aren’t that graphic.Overall, despite my criticisms, I actually enjoyed the series and consider it an easy (or should I say “Ysy”?) watch. Your enjoyment of the series will likely hinge upon whether you are okay with formulaic plots or not; if you are, then “Ys” is definitely worth watching. formulaic to a fault, and plays out almost exactly like a video game.

It's a waste of time and the only thing that saves it is good art and sound.I could break this up and talk about each individual aspect, but I honestly didn't like this OVA enough to care.  The only thing that saves this score is the sound. Acting is very good (English dub) and even better than many, car sounds are good and well done. The acting only suffers sue to the poor scrip writing and change of the two main characters when compared to the original series.The...story is bland and that's because it dumped the charm of the original series and movies by changing the main characters to Nina and Rei. Quite honestly, this would have served as a filler in a full fledged show and not even a good one at that.I know both Nina and Rei are supposed to be quite a bit younger than they are in the series, but neither acts like was previously established or in any way consistent with how they would become.I actually wished that this show would end at one point. Looking back, had you replaced Nina and Rei with the original crew, it might have been quite salvageable. Had you given me a reason to care about Nina or Rei, maybe I could feel different about the story. However since none of that ever was achieved, we're left with a stand alone OVA that had no bearing on the original series and is better off skipped. story is bland and that's because it dumped the charm of the original series and movies by changing the main characters to Nina and Rei.

Digimon Xros Wars: Toki wo Kakeru Shounen Hunter-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11385/Digimon_Xros_Wars__Toki_wo_Kakeru_Shounen_Hunter-tachi,"['What the fuck were they thinking when they made this?I can\'t ask a more direct question than that.Digimon Hunters is very easily the worst Digimon series, it\'s pretty much bile. It succeeds in nothing but destroying amazing potential, wasting a good cast of characters, tarnishing a franchise and having a catchy opening song. Never again will I ever be so excited for a series only to end up this disappointed. Let me walk you through this so you don\'t have to:Digimon Hunters takes place a year after the ending of Xros Wars. Bugramon is dead, all the Digimon are back in their own world, and...Taiki is back to being a baller. All of this changes when Taiki\'s stupid friend Tagiru gets handed a Digivice by a cryptic old man, and then bam, Tagiru now has ownership of the unruly Gumdramon and is about to face ""great danger"". Taiki and the newly reformed Yuu get their partners back eventually, and Shoutmon looks like goddamn Ryoma from Getter Robo. The trio run around stopping evil Digimon from kidnapping and possessing people across the city while traveling to DigiQuartz, a post-apocalyptic alternate dimension that\'s shrouded in mystery. Then a new trio of rival Digimon Hunters appear, and our heroes must both combat and join forces with them under the watchful eye of the old ""watchmaker"".And that\'s the first few episodes. Digimon Hunters probably starts off better than any other series besides Adventure 01, setting up a good cast of new and returning characters, a cool setting and a great premise. After that, nothing fucking happens. All of the Xros Wars cast appears again for very short, worthless cameos, the logistics of the setting crumble as Digimon just sort of run rampant and the public doesn\'t care, and none of the characters get any significant development whatsoever.Like, I don\'t even understand. This was the thought process I had while following this show:Episodes 1-5: Holy god this will be the best thing since Tamers, it\'s Xros Wars 02, omgomg the animation, the music, omgEpisode 6-10: Haha alright, this is pretty cool. Yeah. I bet the story will kick in at episode 12 or so.Episode 11-15: Aha, nothing\'s happened yet, but there\'s so much set up...!Episodes 16-20: What the hell is happening in this series. Why has nothing progressed at all. Why...? Wha..? That doesn\'t make sense, but okay...Episode 21-25: Alright, fuck this.Slowly, the great premise cracks, breaks, shatters, turns to dust, and then you inhale the dust and it tears your lungs up.Taiki and Yuu are nerfed to hell and back, and are almost never present. Most episodes are just Tagiru and Gumdramon screwing around. Shoutmon\'s reign as Digimon king is pretty much irrelevant. Damemon\'s personality is mostly gone and his relationship with Yuu is flat and lifeless.The old man who was the impetus of the whole plot isn\'t present for 95% of the show.None of the enemies in the series are intimidating in the slightest, and more often than not get beaten by the hero Digimons\' lowest forms.The whole ""people getting possessed and kidnapped"" plot never progresses or gets more threatening. In fact, it just becomes a trivial annoyance after a while.Akari, Zenjiro, Nene and Kiriha are all but completely non-present. Akari and Zenjiro are foreshadowed to get their own Digivices and partners in the opening, but it doesn\'t happen until the very end when it doesn\'t even matter.The three new main characters, who have really cool Digimon and character designs, get no development. Ever. They\'re never successful as villains or useful as allies, and there\'s no reason for them to have ever been in the show at all.It\'s miserable. It\'s garbage. And then it ends at 25 episodes.Oh wait, I forgot the best part, the whole overarching story to this show involves the previous 5 main characters showing up: Tai, Davis, Takato, Takuya and Masaru. It\'s foreshowed for literally less than 15 seconds at one point, and then completely dropped, and then they show up near the end. They just... show up. Nothing they do is explained, they\'re just ""there"". For no reason. Even though it makes absolutely not even one bit of sense at all on multiple levels. And they\'re gone. End of show.There\'s dropping the ball, and then there\'s filling the ball with cement and shooting it with a cannon into your own feet. This show is the latter. Fuck it.

Basically, it follows second season of Xros Wars with some time skip, it introduces a few new characters and gives slight cameo to old ones (including other Digimon series). Is that just a last resort trick to bring more viewers to terrible series or just a cherry on top of amazing anime? That’s for everyone to decide on their own and, hopefully, this review will help you with it.Story:...5/10No story until about episode 22 but, instead, we get random Digimon of the week action. They are over average, thus the rating, but for anime series that always has been going for an interesting story this feels like a huge let down. Maybe they tried to aim this at younger kinds but the fact is that they lost majority of long-time Digimon fans.  Every episode follows this pattern: A wild Digimon appears, brainwashes a kid to do bad things, the main gang find it out and (nearly all the time) Tagiru hunts it. That’s it. Episode over. Plot itself is exactly the same thing but with more characters.Art: 8/10Art looks interesting, nothing amazing but overall very good. Not many problems (animation or fluency) and character design is loyal to previous Xros Wars seasons. Although characters of the week are usually dull, there are exceptions to this.Sound: 7/10Nothing memorable but nothing terrible either. I had no problems with this but the fact that I can hardly recall any interesting songs from this season lets me down.Characters:  5/10Aside from characters of the week (which appear again only if they are hunters!) the 6 main characters are quite interesting. Tagiru, the current lead character, is seriously annoying and, for some strange reason, everyone lets him hunt all Digimon they encounter. Not to mention he seems to be interested solely in the hunt and nothing else (and becoming digiworld superstar, as stupid as it sounds). Then there’s Taiki and Yuu, both from previous seasons of Xros Wars, they didn’t change much from the end of previous season season. Last but not least we have the rival trio that have both interesting characters and design, although after first few episodes they get a slight cameo here and there. Characters from previous seasons appeared in a few episodes but they were there more for a marketing than anything else because their role in the story was nearly equal zero.Enjoyment: 4/10I find this season rather boring and unlike first 2 Xros Wars seasons when I could hardly wait a week for new episode, sometimes I forget to watch this  (although I’m a huge Digimon fan). I really dislike the no-story setting it has and the fact that the creators force Tagiru to be the star. Everyone does nothing and watches Tagiru beat and hunt the Digimon of the week. Ratio of others hunting on screen to Tagiru is about 1 to 10. Not to mention that the plot in the last few episodes was as cliche as can get.Overall: 5/10This anime is no good unless you specifically love episodic anime. Even in that case it's watchable when you’re bored but hardly otherwise.

It's not interesting and nothing happens, but it's not overtly painful, just boring and unimaginative.This season continues the original Xros Wars tradition of Super Evolution and DigiXros, something I was never too big a fan of because it's different and I don't like things that are different...I kid I kid. I may not be a fan of DigiXros...and how it meshes with the established Digimon levels, but hey it's not my place to judge on that.The new protagonist Tagiru takes the reigns from Taiki, in a move I suspect was meant to pay homage to the way Adventure handed the reigns off in 02. Only one problem, the show begins a trend of not understanding the most important parts of the things it tries to pay tribute to (COMPLETELY RIP OFF), and getting them completely wrong. For you see, the reigns aren't actually handed over. No. Taiki soon is back with Shoutmon, leaving Tagiru as some sort of crony.Ever wanted a show to focus on and follow the life of a henchmen? Don't care about the established boss or superior leader? Want to see how a run of the mill day goes, but with Digimon?What's that? You said no? You want kickass action, a topnotch protagonist and a deep engaging story?Well then you might see why the first 23 episodes are painfully boring and banal.The formula for episodes 1-23 go something like this:Evil Digimon shows up and starts wreaking havoc and kidnapping humans, no one cares or makes a fuss, Tagiru bumbles around with his partner Gumdramon, they finally manage to subdue the baddie, roll credits.Now there are 3 opposing hunters and Taiki and Yuu are there, but the show does nothing to develop their characters at all so I won't even bother describing them.Now let's begin the PAINFUL BETRAYAL THAT IS THE LAST 3 EPISODES my lovelies...You see, in these last three episodes, the season realizes they have no bug baddie, and need to set something up QUICK!So what do you think they do?What's that? You said they pulled something out of their ass?Ooooh if only!Nope!They pulled something so far out of their ass, they pulled it right out of Tamers!I could only sit there and seethe with impotentent rage as the Quartzmon plot unfolded in some parody of the masterful D-Reaper final showdown. From the digitization of the human world, to using a loved one as a power source, to so much of it but without any of what made Tamers so amazing.Oh but it get's worse.This season has no lovable or memorable protagonist, so guess what?That's right they start spewing the protagonists of each season prior into the show, even taking some of the most loved characters from Adventure and Tamers and throwing them in as half minute cameos too.To understand how bad this season is, you should just go watch the Redlettermedia reviews of the Starwars Prequels.The way they compare the garbage that is the prequels to the original trilogy, showing how the prequels had to try and steal whatever imagery you hold dear from the originals is a fair comparison to how this show sucks in anything you might have loved about Tamers, Adventure, 02, Frontier, and Savers and tries to make you think it's as cool as those seasons.Except by trying to rip them off it only exposes how little creativity or depth it has.I wept a little when I finally realized what this season had done.I don't know how they intend to salvage the franchise from something like this, because this was a horrible blow... and how it meshes with the established Digimon levels, but hey it's not my place to judge on that.The new protagonist Tagiru takes the reigns from Taiki, in a move I suspect was meant to pay homage to the way Adventure handed the reigns off in 02.

Also, they destroy the concept of Chou Shinka, using one of the greatest evolutions to dealing with some low level digimons and not using much of Digi Xros (concept very well worked in the two other season). The only tthing that can save this season is the feeling of nostalgia in the final arc. In the overall, the anime is too MEHOBS: sorry about any...mistakes in the grammar, english isn't my mother language. Hope you enjoy mistakes in the grammar, english isn't my mother language. Hope you enjoy"", 'Just to be clear: Digimon fan since I was 7 years old. I\'m 28 years old now and I\'ve watched (and played) all of the Digimon media available to this point in the series. Also, since this is the last series of a trilogy, my criticism will refer to a lot of the things from the past 2 seasons.One of my main issues with the Digimon series as a whole is the whole Goggles Kid thing is GOD. It\'s a concept that got old by the time Digimon 02 was released. This shows a huge amount of lack of creativity and fear of innovation....I mean, most Digimons were introduced in past seasons and those that are new either were created by children that watched the shows back when it was airing on japanese TV (I\'m not joking) or they\'re old Digimon with new color schemes. Or... they\'re just regular stuff with eyes. It\'s really difficult to take this trilogy serious, starting with the fact that one of the main Digimon is a mechanical piece of poop. Literally. It would make sense if this show was trying to be a parody of the series but it\'s not. To prove my point, SPOILERS  - there\'s a scene where a Digimon is made of literal food. What in the NANI were they thinking?????????Similarly to the previous seasons, the story moves at a solid pace but the 4/5 of the series it\'s just random events happening. It\'s similar to the pace of Sailor Moon.I felt that the animation got worse for whatever reason but the sound retained it\'s quality which is pretty solid.In terms of content, I felt that they tried to copy Pokemon in the sense that you can catch whatever Digimon you can/want but you may only use one each time. If they\'re running out of ideas, might as well just stop doing these poor excuses of nostalgia traps.The characters don\'t act as normal people would at all and that hurts the immersion aspect. Imagine 50 kids being abducted in a few days and instead of reporting it to teachers, police or any other responsible adults... they rely on other kids. I mean... what the heck????? Not only that but sometimes humans can see Digimon in the Real World and other times not, without any explanation about it. Same lack of logic and continuity in terms of memory loss after each Digimon incident.Once again there is no balance at all between the main trio, it\'s always the same Goggles kid, the same Digicross routine and attack pattern. Some rare occasions we got to see new Digifusions and strategies but very rarely.SPOILERS:1) in final episodes, we get a treat! We get to see most of the main cast of every main Digimon series giving our current heroes a hand. Except... we don\'t see everyone and it\'s all about the same goggle boys and their Agumon or similar Digiboys. And to rub salt on the wound, Masaru which is the worst Digimon protagonist ever gets to show off not once but TWICE. Forget about seeing anybody else but the main Digiboyz in action2) during this cameo-fest, you see an impossible scenario: Digimon Adventure heroes and Digimon 02 heroes have the same age. The show acknowledges this and states something along the lines of ""Taichi is older but for right now accept that we\'re the same age although it\'s impossible... just go with it, please"". Imagine a SEQUEL basically saying that it\'s not canon. It\'s impossible to take this trilogy seriously when it disregards the Digimon timeline.3) Episode 24 - the real world fused with the Digital one and all humanity\'s endangered. For a very stupid reason, it\'s necessary for the remaining hunters to battle each other to decide which one will go 1-on-1 with the final villain. In the hellish scenario where every human could die in the next few minutes, most hunters refuse to fight because ""I don\'t want to see my Digimon get hurt"" or ""I\'m not strong enough, someone else do it"".  I\'m sorry... what have you been doing for the last 20-something episodes???? Is this your first day??????? Not to mention that this trilogy has been feeding us this ""friendship is strength typical shounen BS"" but at the end it does a U-turn and screw team-work.5) final fight is a joke with so many twists and turns and who cares anymore because everything leading up to that point is garbageIn conclusion, this season was the worst Digimon series I\'ve ever watched and I\'ll say it again: I\'ve watched and enjoyed everything up to this trilogy.

This poor excuse of a Digimon anime gets a 5/10 from me.', ""okay first review let's gofirst and foremost, before watching digimon hunters, i had never seen a full digimon episode before, or at least that i can recall. my friend is an active member in the digimon fandom and suggested that i watch this, and it was the season that was airing at the time so i decided to give it a shot. recently, this season of digimon ended. to say the least, i wasn't very pleased, mainly because a very good idea for a plot had gone to waste. before you go on i'll give a mild spoiler warning -- i'm not sure if i'll...actually include any but i'll try not to. additionally, it's late, and my memories are kind of vague, and i did not watch most filler, so i apologize for any missing or incorrect details.STORYthe plot idea was pretty good. i liked it a lot, and as i said before i was very sad to see it just sort of get thrown in the trash like it did.it definitely is a proper sequel of sorts -- you have a new goggle boy, tagiru, who is soon introduced to digiquartz, which he can access by time shifting, which is only possible because of his xros loader. his partner is gumdramon. you also have the goggle boy from the original xros wars, taiki, and another original xros wars member, yuu. together, tagiru, taiki and yuu explore digiquartz.at first it starts off sort of slow; the viewer is mainly just watching filler, with some plot development every few episodes. it definitely starts to pick up at some point, but some of it is kind of confusing; it only really starts getting interesting when the old clock maker gathers all the hunters to defeat and capture a powerful, destructive digimon.it calms down a little after that, but then picks up again, but then it actually became very rushed, ESPECIALLY during the final two episodes. i feel like the entire thing was just sort of an excuse to try and gather all the leaders together, maybe make some fans scream (i am one of those fans; i sounded like i was getting murdered) -- i don't want to call it a bad fanfiction, but it might as well have been that. if you want nostalgia, then go for this series, but if you're new to digimon, definitely do not watch this as your first season like i did.as for the art and music: the art is pretty okay, quite a few derpy shots in the background if you're paying attention to the right episodes (which aren't exactly a flaw; anime wouldn't as be good without those). the opening is one of my favourites out of all of the seasons i've watched as of now, definitely one of my favourite anime opening songs in general. the rest of the OST is also very enjoyable.overall 4/10 for story.CHARACTERokay... this was one of my biggest problems with hunters.i feel like taiki, yuu and... everyone, pretty much, except for, like, tagiru, gumdramon, and ryouma, were there just to look pretty. -especially- ren.pretty much no one in the entire show got any character development. tagiru and gumdramon had some good development; their partnership got its own episode, which i was very pleased with. respectively, tagiru and gumdramon in themselves were very enjoyable -- while they didn't receive the most development ever, i still liked them a lot.ryouma was also a very interesting and enjoyable character despite being shrouded in mystery for a good portion of the show, though again, he didn't have the most development. i was very disappointed when astamon only really even played a role in the final two episodes, and even more disappointed by the fact that ren hardly served a purpose. he was such a good character,  but he basically got one or two episodes, then was trashed immediately.many of the characters seemed useless because of their significant lack of development, and in fact, they pretty much were. what kind of upsets me a little bit is that they gave them all very interesting personalities but hardly did anything with their actual character.overall 3/10 for character.so overall, i give digimon hunters a 4/10.if you're currently watching digimon (all the seasons, like i am): i would make this one of your last priorities.also, a note: you do NOT have to watch xros wars at all to get a good grasp of what's going on. it isn't like adventure 02 in which certain things make more sense if you watch 01 first. actually include any but i'll try not to. additionally, it's late, and my memories are kind of vague, and i did not watch most filler, so i apologize for any missing or incorrect details.STORYthe plot idea was pretty good. i liked it a lot, and as i said before i was very sad to see it just sort of get thrown in the trash like it did.it definitely is a proper sequel of sorts -- you have a new goggle boy, tagiru, who is soon introduced to digiquartz, which he can access by time shifting, which is only possible because of his xros loader. his partner is gumdramon. you also have the goggle boy from the original xros wars, taiki, and another original xros wars member, yuu. together, tagiru, taiki and yuu explore digiquartz.at first it starts off sort of slow;

It\'s a sequel with a time skip where the previous protagonists are older, and introduces newer and younger main characters. The story is pretty simple. It appears to be Pokemon-like ""gotta catch \'em all,"" but of course with a bit of twist in the last couple episodes. The evolution system has been reworked with limitations, thus creates interesting combos when the characters are sharing their digimons so they can digi-cross effectively. A neat twist from the previous formula. It works, and it keeps the fan service going.The main character, Tagiru, is akin to Daisuke from 02....Even his digimon, Gumdramon, is similar in appearance to V-mon. Well, now you realize where the writers got their idea. One of the problems with sequels having new protagonist while the previous protagonist is still in it, is that the old protagonist might overshadow the new. It\'s happening here. Tagiru\'s personality is too simplistic to replace Taiki, and Taiki himself is still in the show and play a part in it. Then of course, there Shoutmon with his cross X whatever. To make things worse for Tagiru, the previous protagonists from all previous Digimon series were brought over. Sure, they\'re only there for a short time, but it feels unnecessary. It\'s like they want to sell more toys and merchandise by re-kindling nostalgia, at the expense of the new main character. This doesn\'t work well for Tagiru\'s digimon, Gumdramon, either. Sure, he got to digi-cross with many different digimons, but many of them are just one timers, and his main evolution doesn\'t go much further (compared to Shoutmon\'s multiple crosses). Oh well, at least Gumdramon is cute. Forget about the supporting characters. They don\'t get much development either, nothing like Kiriha\'s and Nene\'s in the previous series.Overall, the series seem to be tuned down a notch from the previous Xross Wars. Just like 02, there are too many characters around, too many hunters. Add on the cameos of all previous main protagonists from previous Digimon series, it feels mismashed. At the end, they pretty much step Tagiru up by default. There\'s no sense of achievement compared to Taiki\'s own struggle on the previous series.Overall, it\'s a meh. I actually was more interested in seeing the cameos (it\'s good to see Guilmon again, Masaru punching a big digimon, and the old evolutions). This 3rd season felt more like a filler season, just to extend the Xros Wars franchise a bit longer. Even his digimon, Gumdramon, is similar in appearance to V-mon.

This 3rd season felt more like a filler season, just to extend the Xros Wars franchise a bit longer.', 'There will be a spoiler mention later but I\'ll warn before we get to it. Also, this review can be read without prior knowledge of the Xros Wars (Fusion) series though it being the sequel to the 2nd season of Xros Wars, it will may have spoilers for the last season or two.So, I\'ll be honest. I waited years to watch Seasons 1 & 2 of Xros Wars and right as i was about too, a Dub was announced for it, called Digimon Fusion. So, I watched it and it\'s 2nd season. The 1st season was not that good and got better around the...half point, but I considered dropping it. Glad I didn\'t. The 2nd season was awesome and i waited years till recently hoping for a Dub but, the writing was on the wall, a dub was unlikely to happen especially given certain actors would need to be brought back. (In other words, would cost more to Dub) I also think (don\'t quote me) that Fusion did poorly in the US, which would further explain why Digimon Hunters (Xros Wars Season 3) didn\'t get a Dub. Maybe it will in the future but I doubt it but love to be wrong.Anyway, that brings us up to speed with the series, now is Hunters any good? To my delight yes it is, very good in fact. While 2 or 2.5 episodes were stinkers for me, I enjoyed the majority. Does it have problems? Yes, it does, namely 1 thing goes unanswered involving someone who forgot the gang nor was it even brought up and the biggest thing you may\'ve heard is, until the last 3.5 episodes, the plot revolves around the gimmick of hunting Digimon and the real plot is set aside with slight hints in a few episodes here and there (Emphasis on few and slight hints). BUT! Despite this, the ""Digital Monster of the week"" format worked really well. Some say there wasn\'t character development but that\'s not true. Its just harder to notice for some characters unless you\'re paying attention. Sure its not big or major character development for anyone but its there and each ""Digital Monster of the week"" episode we see has plenty of life lessons in it and more; over all it was enjoyable and a blast and one of the better Digimon anime out there if you ask me.Now the good news is, you can watch this by itself, no need to even see the first two seasons of Xros Wars before the third season being Hunters. YES there will be spoilers for the first two season if you do this and YES you will lose out on context and such for some things but the Hunters anime does a good job of mentioning what happened in the last two seasons when it brings up anything/someone from the past two seasons and something that happened in the past. By the way, it\'d been maybe 5 years? years either way since I last saw Fusion (Xros Wars) and i finished both seasons and sadly forgot most of it (Can\'t say those seasons were memorable, but that doesn\'t mean they\'re bad and it\'s prolly the same for Hunters too given the format) yet despite forgetting most of it, I wasn\'t lost for long as Hunters explained most of what I forgot for the characters and plot it brought up. That said am sure it would\'ve been slightly more enjoyable if I could\'ve remembered the last two seasons better.Now let me rate the Hunters anime... a solid 7.5 out of 10.0 and I really don\'t feel it deserves the low score on MAL that it has, especially if you don\'t worry about the plot too much and just enjoy the ""Digital Monster of the week"" format the Hunters anime has as you\'ll get to the plot at the end, until then, enjoy the anime for what it mostly is and yes, there is a reason why it\'s like this and is explained in the plot towards the end.Oh and I forgot to mention but I LOVE the OP music and didn\'t skip it but like once or twice.Also, out of the new human characters, Airu is my fav~Now about that spoiler I mentioned, we\'re coming to it but know what I\'m about to say has no bearing on anything I said already nor did it affect the rating as this is concerning the end of the anime plot and the rating stayed the same both before and after those 3.5 episodes. Alright, stop reading now unless you have seen the anime and thanks for reading, hope it helped you and hope you enjoy the anime if you watch it. :)Ok so, having the old cast (Not all, but a good many) return was pretty awesome, sadly I was already spoiled on this years ago and never forgot it (and would\'ve been reminded even if i had) so i knew it was coming. It was not only awesome to see them again but sweet speculating the plot of what was coming as the Watch Maker and his role is where you start speculating, especially at the point the old cast i mentioned are teased around the half point given what happened up to that point and in the episode. Also, even though I watched the entire Digimon series\' anime up to this point English Dubbed, watching the Sub wasn\'t that bad nor was I confused by any name differences for the old cast. The Japanese Sub was really well done too. Double Kudos to the fact Taiki (Mikey) Kudou\'s VA is the same VA who plays Conan Edogawa aka Shinichi Kudou in Detective Conan. Guess one truth really does prevail ey you two Kudous? (They both have the same last name and voice in both their anime, coincidence or not? Who can say lol)I really do hope someday we get a sequel to Hunters as it was clear they may\'ve been setting up for a sequel with how the Hunters anime ended (It has an ending but more can be made given how it ended) and I\'d love to see the cast again, especially Airu and her Digimon. half point, but I considered dropping it. Glad I didn\'t. The 2nd season was awesome and i waited years till recently hoping for a Dub but, the writing was on the wall, a dub was unlikely to happen especially given certain actors would need to be brought back. (In other words, would cost more to Dub) I also think (don\'t quote me) that Fusion did poorly in the US, which would further explain why Digimon Hunters (Xros Wars Season 3) didn\'t get a Dub. Maybe it will in the future but I doubt it but love to be wrong.Anyway, that brings us up to speed with the series, now is Hunters any good? To my delight yes it is, very good in fact. While 2 or 2.5 episodes were stinkers for me, I enjoyed the majority. Does it have problems? Yes, it does, namely 1 thing goes unanswered involving someone who forgot the gang nor was it even brought up and the biggest thing you may\'ve heard is, until the last 3.5 episodes, the plot revolves around the gimmick of hunting Digimon and the real plot is set aside with slight hints in a few episodes here and there (Emphasis on few and slight hints). BUT! Despite this, the ""Digital Monster of the week"" format worked really well. Some say there wasn\'t character development but that\'s not true. Its just harder to notice for some characters unless you\'re paying attention. Sure its not big or major character development for anyone but its there and each ""Digital Monster of the week"" episode we see has plenty of life lessons in it and more; over all it was enjoyable and a blast and one of the better Digimon anime out there if you ask me.Now the good news is, you can watch this by itself, no need to even see the first two seasons of Xros Wars before the third season being Hunters.

Tamer's story was touching and intellectually interesting.  The Young Hunters' story is mediocre at best.  I watched the entire series in one day, and though I enjoyed it (it has digimon), it is mostly filler.  Of the 25 episodes, about 7 matter to the overarching story.  Thankfully the last  4 or so episodes are a digimon fan's wet dream, but that still left 21 episodes of meh.Tl;drIf you like digimon, watch it.  If you're neutral to digimon, tread carefully.  No matter what, don't marathon this.  There is...too much filler to enjoy it that way. too much filler to enjoy it that way."", 'This season of Digimon Xros Wars is something that should not exist. This is perhaps one of the worst sequels to any anime that I have ever seen. Not only was Digimon Xros Wars originally a slight bastardization of the original concept of Digimon that spanned from Digimon Adventure to Digimon Adventure 02 to Digimon Tamers to Digimon Frontier to Digimon Savers, this season of Digimon Xros Wars is a bastardization of the previous 2 seasons of Xros Wars.Story: 4The story is downright awful when it comes to its concept and its execution. Digimon are back in this alternate realm known as the DigiQuartz and...are feeding off of negative human emotions. Now, a bunch of random children are being given Fusion Loaders in order to capture these Digimon. I’m sorry, but this does not seem like Digimon Xros Wars Season 3 to me. It seems like a completely different anime that features characters from the original Xros Wars as well as the concept of DigiXros. It is a completely different scene from what we were originally introduced to in the original Xros Wars. Children are collecting Digimon like it’s Pokemon now, what is up with this? That’s the general concept, but now let’s get into the story revolving around our main characters: Tagiru Akashi and Gumdramon. Unlike the other “Hunters” (which is what they are called), he cares for other individuals more and so, he seeks to help those who are being used by the Digimon who’ve entered the DigiQuartz, making him the usual hero at the end of the day. The sequence of each episode is usually: Human gets tricked by Digimon, Tagiru and Gumdramon find out about this and go after the Digimon, Gumdramon Super Digivolves into Arresterdramon, they fight, Tagiru DigiXroses Arresterdramon with one of his other Digimon, and they win and capture the rogue Digimon. It is that same mundane, repetitive process over and over and over for each episode. They all follow the same lazy and uninspiring formula. Of course, Taiki Kudou and Yuu Amano are also there as characters from the previous seasons of Xros Wars to help out as well, but they are treated as side characters more than anything. Now, it is revealed near the end that the DigiQuartz was created by a Digimon to try to take over both the Digital World and the Human World (as per usual), so everybody gears up to fight back, but Tagiru is the hero at the end of the day because he is the Main Character. Everything about the story is so boring and really repetitive. I’m not sure what could even be changed to make it more interesting, even if only slightly.Characters: 2We basically have 2 characters because the rest of them are never given the same amount of screentime. Tagiru and Gumdramon are 2 of the worst characters that I have ever seen. They are your average rowdy, hard-headed, loud, obnoxious, and straightforward Shounen characters. They basically have no character development at all and stay the exact same from beginning to end. Sure, Gumdramon is able to mature (very slightly) in order to Super Digivolve, but this practically resulted in no changes to his overall character which is very disappointing. Taiki and Shoutmon were already pretty mature in Season 2 of Xros Wars due to the insanely high stakes back then, but they’ve matured even more in this season. They are basically treated as the GOATS when it comes to Digimon and Hunters. Another character that gets much screen time is Yuu who has long since been the child manipulated by Dark Knightmon back in Xros Wars Season 2. He has matured much, similar to Taiki, but he also is very serious and sometimes comes off sad due to the death of Damemon back in the previous Season, and haven yet seen him once again after the rebirth of the Digital World after Shoutmon becomes king. However, Damemon does come back which is pretty obvious because he and Tuwarmon were in the OP since Episode 1. The other hunters are barely given any screen time and are generalized to be pretty much the prideful, showoff veteran Hunters. As for the villains, the only villains were basically the enemy Digimon, and they were pretty terrible. All of them pretty much were very prideful and manipulative in order to feed off of human negative emotions (which is not something new). As for the final villain Digimon whose name I will not say to avoid spoilers, bro, he was only shown in a single Episode (being the last one), so there isn’t much of him at all. Overall, the Characters are absolutely atrocious. There is no originality, no real development, and the screen time wasn’t shared between all of them enough to warrant them even having their traits be shown.Digimon (Portrayal): 3I already dislike Xros Wars for basically getting rid of the whole Evolution Level concept (Egg, Baby, Rookie, Champion, Ultimate, Mega, Super Ultimate). This meant that Rookie Digimon were beating up Ultimates, Champions slaying Megas, and all sorts of weirdness that otherwise should not even be possible because the difference in power between each Evolution Level is massive. In Xros Wars Season 2, we were introduced to Super Digivolution. This allowed for a given partner Digimon to Digivolve into what is basically an Ultimate Level Digimon which was the case for OmegaShoutmon and ZekeGreymon. However, this is not the case anymore because we have Gumdramon Super Digivolving into Arresterdramon who is a Champion Level,  Dracumon turning into Yaksamon which is also a Champion, and Damemon turning into Tuwarmon which is also a Champion. I understand that Evolution Levels don’t exist in Xros Wars, but seeing “Super Digivolution” not making an “Ultimate Level” Digimon is strange for someone who understands the Evolution Levels. Thus, you still get things like Rookies beating up Ultimates (ex: Shoutmon vs. Sagomon) and Champions beating up Ultimates (ex: Arresterdramon vs. MetalTyrannomon). Another change would be how DigiXros works. You can only have 2 Digimon out at once, so you can basically only Fuse 2 Digimon together. This is a good change as you can’t just go nuts on Fusing Digimon, but it does make larger Fusions harder to access such as the Shoutmon line. Also, let’s talk about “Superior Mode”. The only 2 Superior Modes in the Digimon Universe are Shoutmon X7 Superior Mode and Arresterdramon Superior Mode (not including any Xros Up). When there used to be only 1 Superior Mode which was only possible by Fusing every Digimon in the Digital World with Shoutmon, it seemed sacred and really cool. And then Arresterdramon got it too. Like, Tagiru and Gumdramon barely worked for it. Gumdramon basically matured (very slightly), realizing his past and having been punished by Sanzomon, and was able to “unlock his true potential” and got a Superior Mode. Literal Bruh moment. This Season of Xros Wars just makes the previous ideologies of the concept of Digimon even more worthless, basically bastardizing the original concept and the concepts brought up in the previous 2 seasons of Xros Wars.Animation/Sound: 5I have no issue with the music and sounds. It’s the animation that I have an issue with. The closest thing I can compare this steep drop in Animation quality to is Pokemon XY&Z vs. Pokemon Sun & Moon. But even that wasn’t that bad. The difference between the Art and Animation from Digimon Xros Wars Season 2 and Digimon Xros Wars Season 3 is like night and day. The quality just dropped to near rock bottom. It is indescribably bad.Overall: 3If you are a fan of Digimon, you can literally pass this up. Xros Wars Seasons 1 and 2 were decent, but this was just plain awful. It reuses the same formula for every episode while basically giving the Main Characters no development over the course of this 25 Episode anime. If you do want to know what happens after Season 2 of Xros Wars, you could watch this, but I expect you to be sorely disappointed because even the recurring characters are portrayed terribly. There is a single memorable part of this anime which was the fact that characters from the other Digimon timelines make a cameo due to plot reasons. I feel like it was put there for fanservice reasons only because of how somewhat minor it is, but it is definitely cool seeing Taichi, Daisuke, Tatsuya, Takuya, and Daimon standing side by side. I sincerely do not recommend watching this. are feeding off of negative human emotions. Now, a bunch of random children are being given Fusion Loaders in order to capture these Digimon.

I sincerely do not recommend watching this.', 'Unbelievably miserable conclusion to the Fusion anime :( If you asked me what made the first two Fusion seasons likable, I would bring up the great protagonist cast (and especially the likability of Taiki,) the constant feeling of progression towards a final battle, in terms of a constant power progression with Xros Heart\'s army growing and maintaining a consistent, clear end goal, and the clarity of the stakes - every episode reminded you that the enemy was an army hell-bent on destruction. Laying out all those traits like that, it feels like this third season betrays everything that made Fusion likable in service of a...bland fan-servicey cash grab.First of all, Tagiru is just...not likable. The series repeatedly paints him as a foil to Taiki, but, like, in a super negative way. It is legitimately hard to root for him for 90% of the series - he\'s constantly stupid, loud, and unhelpful. The only episode I thought was actually resolved by his own strengths as a person is the FlameWizarmon one. Every other episode, it felt like his attitude and character actively gets in the way of Taiki. The show constantly goes out of its way to nerf Taiki so that Tagiru can do anything. The rules in DigiQuartz, compounded with the fact that the protags essentially are choosing not to just form Shoutmon X4 every single time, feel like the just betray the first two seasons totally. Even the FlameWizarmon episode only happens because Taiki actively lets Tagiru have his moment. There\'s helping your underclassman shine, and then there\'s coddling him to no end and doing 90% of the work while he gets to capture every Digimon, and it\'s so clearly the latter that none of what Tagiru does feels compelling or interesting. He\'s lazily handed the ability to ""save the world"" at every possible turn and it feels wholly undeserved every time, with the ending feeling especially stupid. Tagiru a flat bland abstraction of the Digimon protagonist that got shoved into the lead role because...idk Taiki was too much of a Mary Jane and they decided they wanted a super flawed guy to be the lovable hero this time? But it doesn\'t work if he\'s constantly just Taiki but worse because you decided to keep Taiki in!! He\'s just clearly the least likable character of the main cast and it makes watching much worse. Honestly, the bit with the goggles at the end felt like lampshading the Digimon Protag archetype more than anything - anyone can do it with some vague amount of ""determination"" and some goggles.One of the worst parts of Hunters is that it\'s an episodic Digimon of the Week series for 20 whole episodes. Other series started off on the episodic stuff to get their legs before laying out the Plot, but Hunters does not give you even a drop of the Plot before it happens. 19 episodes of running around catching Digimon and then boom, The Plot Happens and its the Biggest Digimon Ever. It\'s such a lazy ripoff of the Digimon formula that it hurts - there\'s no interest taken in telling a new story, or exploring the new characters. You get a bunch of defeating the villains of the day followed by the final big battle with absolutely no transition. The plot that does exist is stupid - Quartzmon\'s whole backstory is muddled and uninteresting and the wrap up sucks.  Gumdramon stays the exact same power level the entire show up until the Plot as well - half the episodes it feels like he doesn\'t even get to explore a new Xros. More than anything the plot highlights how much this show is a cash grab, just lazily rehashing the tired formula and trotting out the fan favorites in a pathetic last gasp for the Fusion franchise. The show gets even worse from there, with the ending being one of the most botched fan-service attempts I\'ve ever seen. Even given how horrible the main legs of the series were I could have maybe gotten some enjoyment out of seeing the protagonists of all of the other, actually good series come together. Getting all of the protagonists and their strongest digimon is a great sell only.... it last for two minutes? And don\'t we get to see any of the classic Digivolution sequences? Every protag giving it up for Tagiru at the end makes no sense - where do they all go to? The protags are all paraded out so that you can point at the screen and soyface that you recognize the characters without a hint of the actual nostalgia they desperately tried to bait.Overall the show was just such a horrible blatant attempt to trot out the franchise\'s corpse for one last ride to farm money, making baffling choice after baffling choice. It\'s hard for me to see this as anything more than 25 episodes of putting out lazy plotlines with the minimum required effort for anything - storytelling, character development, even power scaling which is one of the core interesting parts of any Digimon story. This will be a waste of hours of your life to see the same shitty protag/digimon pair deal with the dumbest problems ever and then get hailed as the strongest protagonist of all time because Digimon Formula without a single attempt to innovate or do something new, and even the hint of fan-service to excuse the inanity is botched so horribly bad that it feels insulting. Would not recommend! bland fan-servicey cash grab.First of all, Tagiru is just...not likable. The series repeatedly paints him as a foil to Taiki, but, like, in a super negative way.

Cutie Honey,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1661/Cutie_Honey,"[""This anime deserves a review. I am a fan of seeking out older anime and watching it. This anime, as far as I am aware, is one of the original Magical Girl series. Where a girl transforms into different clothes/armor/etc to defeat her enemies. It's a simple concept and this is a simple show. It's your basic Monster of the Week fair. Ultimately leading to Cutey Honey taking on the ring leader at the end. Each enemy Cutey faces is interesting, but most don't have too much development. The death scenes can be quite brutal with a fair amount of blood.The problem with the show...is it isn't finished. I'm sure the manga finished it, but not here. Cutey defeats a main enemy, but not the main ring leader. By the time the show reboots with Shin Cutey Honey you just have to assume that somewhere along the way the main ring leader was taken out. It puts a damper on an otherwise fairly entertaining show.Watch 2 or 3 episodes at your leisure and enjoy the funky beats. Just don't watch too much or you'll get burnt out due to the repetitive nature. I found the show entertaining. I think you'll feel the same way. is it isn't finished.

I\'ve always get the hots for sexy characters that know they\'re sexy and want to be sexy! And, there\'s still so few anime with a shonen theme and a respectable female lead.I find the character\'s places to be balanced to where they need to be. The others help Honey, but they don\'t steal the spot light with how helpful they are. Honey takes down the enemies alone, without anyone jumping in to rescue her. Something way too...common in modern anime.I thought the show would be more science-y, given the setup, but it\'s a lot of magic. The deaths are more real, than expected from the rest of what\'s going on.the only things that disappointed me were 2 characters died that didn\'t have to, and it ends on a cliffhanger. And, sometimes there are those ""IYA!"" moments, but that\'s an ecchi thing. common in modern anime.I thought the show would be more science-y, given the setup, but it\'s a lot of magic.

And, sometimes there are those ""IYA!"" moments, but that\'s an ecchi thing.', 'In the time before time, there was an anime called cutie honey... I\'m kidding.This is probably the oldest anime I ever saw. It aired in 1973 (nineteen seventy three). As a result it is pretty much unlike anything I\'ve ever seen, and the closest thing to it, at least visually, is the first season of Sailor Moon. The anime is also based on works on Go Nagai, who is responsible for Devilman, Devilman Lady, Getter Robo, Mazinger, and many other things.The age of the anime is noticeable in every its aspect - story, characters, visuals, art style and music. It aired before anime became...very popular and well kknown, and as a result it looks much simpler and much more naive than ANY modern title. The art style is quite different as well, with drawings being flat, and backgrounds being extremely abstract and colored in manner resembling old cartoons like Woody Woodpecker or Pink Panther.It is still a very nice anime, in the end, despite silliness, strange (by modern standards) style, simplistic story. The music is nice as well.Detailed breakdown below:Story:The story is very simple and strictly follows ""monster of the week"" pattern. It also holds world\'s record at fastest character introduction - it managed to cover honey\'s backstory in 5 minutes or even less. Haven\'t seen anything like it. The story revolves around honey fighting a criminal organization, which wants a certain item Cutie Honey has, and every week sends another female monster after it. The monster always is some sort of hybrid creature, always female, always called ""something - CLAW"". The structure of every episode is the same every time as well - introduction of the monster, fight, followed by iconic transformation sequence, and brief wrap up. Overall the whole thing almost looks like a kid\'s movie (with a script written by another kid as well), that is until heads start flying.In the same naive fashion anime displays its characters, it easily introduces dismemberment and occasional death. Some deaths are quite gruesome, and after happily jumping around in another costume, cutie honey may lop off someone\'s head or limb with her sword. This doesn\'t happen often, mind you, but happens. Which reminds the viewer, that, in the end, it is an anime, and not a western cartoon.The story does not really have an overarching plot, and largest portion of it could be thought as more or less independent episodes, if next monster weren\'t introduced at the end of episode, although things change a bit at the end of the series.Locations, circumstances, people, interactions are simplistic, and remind of a kid\'s movie, and as a result are not very ""believable"", but still fun to watch. In the end the story is mostly about Cutie Honey prancing around switching costumes and killing bad guys.Art:Art is unusual by modern standard. Characters are very ""flat"", meaning their visuals look like something half way between modern anime and, say, old cartoon like Woody Woodpecker. They don\'t really move about well, deform during movement, and anime does not really portray ""depth"" anywhere.The backgrounds in scenes resemble abstract painting, or old backdrops occasionally used in western cartoons. Pink Panther or old Cartoon movies. Basically, it is collection of shapes, usually drawn using flat color. Basically, coloring of backdrops is not dissimilar to, say, south park, although, lines in backgrounds are fluid. Hopefully it makes sesne.Most of the mechanical objects are not very well drawn, and barely have any detail on them. Main character - Cutie Honey  - is amazingly cute, but some of the other characters are not. One of the side characters have a face that looks like a.. an undead peanut. Can\'t describe it in any other way. ""Bad guys"" always have evil face, fangs, ""evil grin"" and slanted eyes. Very different from modern anime.I would say that overall drawing style shares some similarities with very old titles - for example, it may slightly resemble the very first episode of Urusei Yatsura, and the very first episode of Sailor Moon... I\'d say more similar to Sailor Moon, which had ""swirly glasses"" character.Sound:Music is amazing and catchy. Original intro is something you\'d want to sing along to (""Kono goro hayari na onn-nano-ko..."") and will get stuck in your head. There\'s also a constant ""whispering"" theme that usualy plays when an episode displays this week\'s villain. (you\'ll recognize it when you hear ""Shi.. shi, shi, shi- shi... SHAAAA!"" in background). The anime doesn\'t have too many soundtracks, however, and seem to be reusing about 5 tunes total.Characters:Characters are pretty much symbols. They have specific role or function and are completely defined by it. Cutie honey\'s role is to kill bad guys and look cute while wearing outfits, for example. They don\'t really develop anywhere, and don\'t have much of personality to display, they pretty much only do one thing they were designed to do. Honey occasionally tries to act seriously, but it always comes off as awkward and strange.... then again it is sorta in line with ""naive old anime"" feeling about it.Enjoyment:It was an interesting and a very refreshing experience. The anime is unlike pretty much anything that is released nowadays, and it was nice to see something from time when plots were simpler, grass was greener, etc.Overall:I recommend to check it out, if you have opportunity. For historical opportunity, or to see what anime used to be in 1973. However, if you\'re looking for anything serious, the anime might not be the right choice, becasue despite its occasional attempts to have serious or dramatic moment, it may look silly... but then again, it is Nagai GO material, and some of his older works may come off as a bit direct/naive by modern standards.So, for something more serious, a good candidate would be original Sailor Moon, which starts off with similar formula and somewhat similar old art style, but then becomes much more dramatic. very popular and well kknown, and as a result it looks much simpler and much more naive than ANY modern title.

Cutey Honey is based on the manga of the same name by Go Nagai. It is regarded as one of the very first magical girls.The story in Cutey Honey is quite simple. Kisaragi Honey is just your average catholic schoolgirl (not). One day she returns home to find that her father has been killed. An evil organisation called Panther Claw is responsible for his death. His dying message reveals that Honey is actually an Android that can use transformative powers thanks to the Atmospheric Element Solidifier that is located...inside her body. The Atmospheric Element Solidifier is also the very thing that Panther Claw killed Honey's father to get a hold of. Now Honey has sworn to become the warrior of love Cutey Honey, and to get revenge on her fathers killers. Cue monster of the week.This show is little more than a monster of the week show, with the added benefit of fanservice. Cutey Honey is silly and over the top. Seing Honey not just defeat her enemies, but also kill them every episode was a nice change for a magical girl. However, the silliness runs dry quite quick and the show becomes much more of a slog. Pair that up with less than pleasing visuals, almost no animation, and backgrounds that look like they were painted by children, the show has really shown just how much of a product of it's time it is. It's an interesting watch as a historic piece, but as an entertainment piece it is honestly not good. inside her body.

Lucky you.Story:There is not much of a story, more like an excuse for the show to exist. Panzer Claw want that device (whatever it does) from Honey, she wants revenge for her killed father. Later on we get a second motivation for the heroine, though it neither changes her goals nor her attitude, so I don’t really know what the purpose of that scene was. Besides the first and the last, Cutey Honey is a monster of the week anime, with pretty much nothing important happening in the other 24 episodes. Not...only that, all these episodes are also basically the same. You can do this formula and still be interesting (see Sailor Moon), but boy was this show boring. You can easily skip 16 to 18 episodes and you will not miss anything. This is basically Filler - The Animation. The fights are not even entertaining or anything, it’s just a huge waste of time.2/10Art:I don’t hate old anime. I can look at something in relation to the time it was released and realize that it may have been good-looking back then or the top possible quality. I never understood people who said everything old is shit. Everybody who refuses to watch pre-2010 anime with that justification should be put on death row. With that off of my chest, Cutie Honey looks like shit. It ran about the same time as (still) pretty shows like Alps no Shoujo Heidi and even later than Attack No. 1, so I can compare it to its contemporaries and say this with certainty. The animation is awfully lazy and it just looks bad more often than not. The character designs of the villains are ugly as hell and even the normal humans are off-model way too often. This show also features next to no backgrounds, though this is more due to its age, so I’ll give it a free pass for that. If you don’t believe me, look at Honey’s pantyshots. Half the time they look like fucking diapers!2/10Sound:The only highlight of this show is the pretty cool psychedelic soundtrack. Only Honey’s character theme gets a little annoying after 20 episodes, but it’s not bad or anything. The voice acting is not bad either, though obviously the sound quality is far from what you may be used to from modern anime. The opening song is catchy and stylistically very different from the J-Pop of today. The ending was very cool, being a full blown ballad that reminded me of the chansons of the 60s and 70s. I also liked the fact that these songs were actually about the show instead of basically nothing like so many others.8/10Characters:I thought Honey was a stereotypical fanservice babe like so many others, but it turns out she is a very cynical and violent girl, mocking and occasionally mutilating her enemies. That’s kinda cool, but it doesn’t really fit her father-avenging motive she keeps bringing up. Maybe that’s just an excuse so she can do all these mean things? Would put a whole new twist on the plot. Her companions are really lame “perverts”, though they’re somewhat likeable. Many of the side characters were either totally useless (the little girl with the crush on Junpei) or extremely annoying (Alphonne), so there was not much entertainment gained there. The villains were, as mentioned, hideous, which is weird seeing how big their titties are. Am I supposed to fap to them or not? Whatever the case, they sure as hell weren’t very developed, not even Sister Jill. I got the impression that they were merely evil for the sake of being evil. And what exactly do demons need to steal art for?3/10Enjoyment:If Cutey Honey was shorter, it would have been much more bearable. Sadly it drags on and on and on with nothing coming of it. Watching the same badly animated, meh written episode over and over again was very tedious, something an anime should never ever be. I don’t know how the remakes turned out, but I am pretty sure that they would be worth watching a lot more, even if it’s just for sake of looking a whole lot better than this. I know, I can’t expect a show from the early 70s to be a masterpiece, but come on.3/10Overall:3.6/10 only that, all these episodes are also basically the same.

Watch the rest, it gets comfier.What is this series?Getsuyoubi no Tawawa, or Tawawa on Monday, is the anime adaptation of Himura Kiseki\'s doujinshi series with the same name. It\'s fundamentally a compilation of episodic short stories revolving, usually, a main average couple and a mundane event.The purpose of Tawawa, both in its doujinshi and anime form, is to work as a healing antidote against...Monday Blues. That\'s precisely why the main characters are Japanese salaryman, new episodes were released on Monday, there\'s Monday on the title, and the original drawings are all in monochrome blue.The situations take unrealistic twists, the girls are unrealistically perfect?This is an escapism series. That\'s the point.But there\'s no plot, it\'s just fanservice!Well no shit Sherlock.The original drawings, which this series is based of, were posted on Himura\'s twitter (@strangestone) and were mostly without dialogue until serialization was considered. They are supposed to be cute and heartwarming, not tell the greatest love story ever told.And yes, there\'s still a solid, concise and well-developed storyline. Which shows Ai-chan and Salaryman\'s relationship evolving as well as the other characters.Way more than you\'d expect from a 5min ONA (Original Net Animation) doujinshi-inspired short story.What is Tawawa?Tawawa is the name of the train station central to the story, where Ai-chan and Salaryman first met. All the stories happen somewhat near it and all the characters are living relatively close to each other, as to say, in the same prefecture.Tawawa is also slang for ""dropping"", ""overflowing"" obvious reference to the amusingly huge racks of the girls appearing on this series.Then why is this worth watching or special whatsoever?It\'s up to you.Sometimes a little break from reality can be nice. Especially if it\'s accompanied by cute soundtrack and neat VAs. Maybe it\'s not your thing, but the short stories are undeniably sweet and will add an extra sugar on your life.This series in particular could be regarded as special for the future of doujinshi and ONA/OVA adaptations because it marks an accomplishment.Himura has been growing in the doujin scenario for a while, selling a bunch of volumes on Comiket, but receiving a GOOD anime adaptation of his work like this one is opening the door for many future works to come.

A story about a model - fine. Flat-out pornography - also fine. Contrived...sexual situations that would never, ever occur in reality - not so fine!Getsuyoubi no Tawawa seems to think its viewers are so lacking in an attention-span that they cannot even complete a three-minute episode without the heroines' breasts hitting a dude in the face or bursting through their shirt every thirty seconds or so. The main heroine is so lacking in other qualities that she is known merely as I-Chan - so named after her colossal cup size. It is as if the show just surrenders to the notion that anime is synonymous with these tropes and is incapable of being interesting without. If it were deliberately trying to be sexy or pornographic there would be little issue, but instead it attempts to be cute and heartwarming. And so it is. And therein lies the problem.Little about Getsuyoubi no Tawawa's story makes it seem like the typical ecchi anime. It develops the relationship between the protagonist and their respective heroine in a fairly cute and innocent way, even if there may be a bit (a lot) of sexual tension along the way. Every character within the anime is a genuinely kind and decent person, and it is palpably clear that they have feelings for the other with regards to more than just their body. It feels less an ecchi anime and more a romance. If it were longer, that could possibly have become more a reality than a feeling. But as it stands, it is a confused story, unaware of its potentials, unsure of what it wants to be.I can appreciate how the anime deals with primarily adult characters. It illustrates the tedium of the salaryman, their life being dull and tiring enough that merely having a cute girl to talk to the on the train every week is enough to make one happy. It understandably does not go much into depth with regards to their working life (aside from the occasional after-work drinking), but giving the audience a glimpse into their life and something to identify with still does a lot in making the romance more meaningful than all the impromptu bra explosion does. Sure, it would have been better yet if the main heroine was an adult, too, rather than another wretched high school student, but there's only so much one can ask for in today's anime industry. Joy.It is also worth mentioning that while most anime with a short run-time are of relatively low production-quality,  Getsuyoubi no Tawawa looks and sounds quite decent. Its cute, heart-warming piano pieces do well to give emotional weight to an anime that really should not have any. And I was absolutely sure, based on how cute she was and how well she performed the role, that the main heroine's voice actor was someone renowned, but was pleasantly surprised to find she is a new face in the industry altogether. There's certainly worse anime to debut in.Same can be said for Getsuyoubi no Tawawa as a whole, really. It could be worse. But it could also be much better. sexual situations that would never, ever occur in reality - not so fine!Getsuyoubi no Tawawa seems to think its viewers are so lacking in an attention-span that they cannot even complete a three-minute episode without the heroines' breasts hitting a dude in the face or bursting through their shirt every thirty seconds or so.

It develops the relationship between the protagonist and their respective heroine in a fairly cute and innocent way, even if there may be a bit (a lot) of sexual tension along the way. Every character within the anime is a genuinely kind and decent person, and it is palpably clear that they have feelings for the other with regards to more than just their body. It feels less an ecchi anime and more a romance. If it were longer, that could possibly have become more a reality than a feeling. But as it stands, it is a confused story, unaware of its potentials, unsure of what it wants to be.I can appreciate how the anime deals with primarily adult characters. It illustrates the tedium of the salaryman, their life being dull and tiring enough that merely having a cute girl to talk to the on the train every week is enough to make one happy. It understandably does not go much into depth with regards to their working life (aside from the occasional after-work drinking), but giving the audience a glimpse into their life and something to identify with still does a lot in making the romance more meaningful than all the impromptu bra explosion does. Sure, it would have been better yet if the main heroine was an adult, too, rather than another wretched high school student, but there's only so much one can ask for in today's anime industry. Joy.It is also worth mentioning that while most anime with a short run-time are of relatively low production-quality,  Getsuyoubi no Tawawa looks and sounds quite decent. Its cute, heart-warming piano pieces do well to give emotional weight to an anime that really should not have any. And I was absolutely sure, based on how cute she was and how well she performed the role, that the main heroine's voice actor was someone renowned, but was pleasantly surprised to find she is a new face in the industry altogether. There's certainly worse anime to debut in.Same can be said for Getsuyoubi no Tawawa as a whole, really. It could be worse. But it could also be much better."", 'This is definitely more of a \'healing\' anime than other shows with that description. Way more painful too.Some might call this escapism, if they do I think they\'re missing the point. The term \'escapism\' should only be applied to works that allow us to delve into our fantasies rather than tickle our imaginations. Tawawa is soothing only because we have to distance ourselves from what is happening on screen in order to fully enjoy it. Because there is the realization in the backs of our minds that, no matter what, we\'re never going to get a cheerful titty monster of our own, we can...laugh about how wishful it all is without becoming invested at all in the fantasy. All the while, however, we can still get some happiness out of it.  Happiness, of course, tempered by the all too apparent truth, a truth that this anime makes no attempt to obscure. Half of the pleasure in watching this show comes from its affirmation of the gloominess in the real world. Cynical-optimism I\'d call it. This really is the best therapy you could ask for after a long day. If anyone on here actually has a stressful job, they should be watching this.The faceless (and sometimes voiceless) males in Tawawa are only a little closer to having their dreams come true than we are. Save for perhaps button-man, the titty goddesses are just as (seemingly) unobtainable.

The last episode is mellow, but upbeat and it knows what buttons to push and when to relieve. Aired right on time for a lonely Christmas.To enjoy Tawawa beyond a superficial level you\'d have to have the right mindset and life experience, because, let\'s be honest, a Japanese salaryman will get more out of this than the average MAL 14 year old, who, when reviewing would probably use the term ""fanservice."" laugh about how wishful it all is without becoming invested at all in the fantasy.

""Maybe the show is about working and the troubles that comes with it? Maybe it\'s an office drama with tight and exciting deadlines that HAVE to be met. Maybe it\'s a slice of life comedy series NOT set in high school?""Maybe it\'s a show that only drives the point forward that anime was a mistake.The story is actually decent (And by decent, I mean 4/10). A guy meets a girl on the subway...(by her smashing her tits into his face nonetheless) and they become acquainted with each other. Each episode has a setup, so that he always meets the girl on the subway once the day is over. They made something that works. It\'s not something groundbreaking, but it works.The animation is the only thing good (good is a broad statement) about this. If you\'re going to have a show about cute girls, you\'d better animate the girls well. And so they did. Tits swinging when they walk, subtle details with the hair, sakuga when they whisper in his ear. Gotta give credit where credit is due.Sound is fair. There is nothing remarkable about the soundtrack, the voice actors or even the sound effects.Pathetic. The word pathetic that is tied together with the ""1"" score is a perfect summary of the characters in this anime. The main character is a bland canvas for the working man to cast himself upon. Faceless in the most literal way. No personality other than works hard and doesn\'t date, just like most of the Japanese people that this show is aimed at. Gotta know the target demographic.Each episode introduces a cardboard cutout, big titted, happy go fucking lucky character that in some divine way manages to get into contact with the main character. There is no personality, there is no character development. Each girl is particularly crafted in order to satisfy each and every niche the viewer might have.The enjoyment in this, is (for me at least) very low. Sure, I love tits as much as the next guy, but if it\'s the only thing that this show has to offer, then porn can do marginally better.Overall, the show is pure and simple a way for the working Japanese citizen to sit back, relax and just try and place themselves in a better place. So in order for you to enjoy it, you have to take your expectation and set them WAAAAAY low.Yes, lower than that.

No one is going into this show for the plot; so, why not just turn your brain off and enjoy the amazing visuals this show provides. The plot, though, is simple and clean. Two big breasted women, one a high-schooler and the other a Mommy Dommy Goddess spend their days with an older man they are in love with. The former protects the girl from harassers on the train while the latter is her coworker that does projects with her. Analyzing this plot is like trying to seriously analyze Dora the Explorer. Like seriously, let us men (and women) enjoy the...big boobs? And no joke, these oppai are amazingly big. Not super realistic, but who cares? They are enjoyable to watch. My only big complaint is that one of Ai-Chan's friends gropes her with no hesitation, but that's a cliche I actively dislike. It's hard to fill out the required texts for a review with this show. The episodes aren't that long either, so you can easily get through it in a day if you are so determined. Would recommend if you are horny and like big mommy milkers. big boobs?

Seriously, I mean it.Ok, as top review already pointed out, this series was originally a series of pointless artworks drawn by Himura Kiseki on his Twitter account (@strangestone), Monday Morning Offering, as he named it. It\'s basically just girls, with a huge set of breats, in all kind of poses wearing pretty much just a pair of skimpy bikini or other provocative garments to be something for working salarymen look forward to on Mondays.But then,...in the 33th one of the series, Himura seemed to start developing a story around a girl later known as ""Ai-chan"" or the girl at the station.

Gigantic boobs. Oh so it\'s just mindless fanservice, you might say but no. Don\'t let that cloud your judgement. Yes each episode is around 4 minutes long and most of that time is spent on close ups of boobs but keep an open mind when watching this. Like I said, it\'s only around 4 minutes long for each episode, making this twice as long as 2 usual anime episodes so there really is no reason to expect anything great like Steins;Gate or Cowboy Bebop. Obviously that\'s an exaggeration...but you get my point.The story is divided up by pairs of 2 main characters and each episode focuses on one of the pairs. The first pair seems to be of a business man who, by chance, meets a very busty and clumsy highschool girl. They become friends and  the setting is usually of a train but there\'s also a maid cafe so keep that in mind. The other pair seems to be that of a once again very busty woman who appears to be working at an office with her senpai. Other pairs are present but they don\'t get as much screen time as the 2 explained above. I would say that I liked the green haired girl the most. Unfortunately she was one of the girls who got less screen time.So what makes this likable?Well the boobs. And how simplistic it is. It just makes you feel happiness and comfort, watching these characters interact with daily life but at the same time those characters are also ""perfect."" Not much is shown than that. So don\'t look at it like your usual 25 minute, 12 episoded anime. Just look at it like what it\'s supposed to be shown as. A short episodic treatment of sorts. To cure the sadness of a Monday like the top reviewer has said. Because that\'s all this anime will show. That isn\'t a bad thing though.ArtMoving on to one thing that surprised me. The art. It was actually well done. The characters all look generic but they were shown clearly. It was also really clean. Every detail looks so nice and smooth. Like glass.In conclusion, just watch this without any expectations. Just enjoy and you\'ll like it. So thanks for reading and get to watching :)P.S. I really should\'ve reviewed this right after it finished airing but it\'s okay.

As long as this review helps anyone.', 'Translated as Tawawa on Monday, this series was adapted from a series of weekly illustrations by Himura Kiseki, meant to inspire and give salarymen and students alike something to look forward to when they return to the weekly grind on Monday.That said, I think that we have to keep that purpose in mind when you look at this series: its intent is not to tell a deep, compelling story or make you bust out laughing, but rather to relax you, and put a small smile on your face. It\'s a ""cute girls doing cute things""-type of series (iyashikei), and very deliberate and self-aware of that...fact—which I as a viewer appreciate.Story:The water tread by the plot is pretty shallow (though not to the narrative\'s detriment; episodes are only three minutes, what else do you expect?). Tawawa (mainly) follows two different salarymen: one (known affectionately as Onii-san) meets a big-breasted schoolgirl by the name of Ai, they develop a relationship, and that\'s dandy. The other (Senpai) is more or less glued to his likewise busty junior (or Kouhai). There are other girls—Ai\'s volleyball-playing friend, a personal trainer, and a dentist (all of whom are buxom as well) to name a few—but the Onii-san/Ai and Senpai/Kouhai duo are the most recurring.Art:As someone who\'d previously read the doujin compilations and found them charming, I think the animation team did a decent job of replicating the feel: Ai, Kouhai, and the other girls look soft (in a literal/physical and figurative sense) and touchable—which they are. The ""camerawork"" focuses mostly on their busts, but again, what do you expect?Sound:I don\'t have anything remarkable to say as far as sound goes. Both the guys and girls sound much like one would expect them to. It\'s good in the sense that there\'s nothing really bad to write about.Character:I\'d like to re-emphasize the 3-minute episode format, and say that, obviously, that isn\'t much time to develop a profoundly deep character. The girls are cute and kindly, the guys are often fatigued and bedraggled, with seeing the girls being a highlight of their (Mon)day.Enjoyment/Overall:Though it\'s difficult for me to distill something as multifaceted as a show (yes, even one that I can watch the entirety of in half an hour and some change) into a mere number, I can say that I most certainly enjoyed my time (the aforementioned half hour) with Tawawa. Does it live up to the goal that it seeks to accomplish? Most certainly. It\'s short, it\'s cute, it\'s upbeat, and after each episode came to its conclusion, I found myself with a quaint little smile on my face.It\'s important that we take series like these at face value, just like this series itself does.  There is no epic story, nor is there a heavy-handed moral aesop or philosophical teaching to instill in the viewer, just 12 3-minute slices of a slow, idyllic every day life ready for us in the wildly uncertain real world to enjoy whenever we need it.If you\'re someone who has a hectic day-to-day life (like I do), or otherwise dissatisfied with your Monday, I recommend you take some time to sit down, relax yourself, and unwind a little with some of Himura Kiseki\'s Monday Morning Offerings. fact—which I as a viewer appreciate.Story:The water tread by the plot is pretty shallow (though not to the narrative\'s detriment; episodes are only three minutes, what else do you expect?).

It is just a few glimpses at the life of the salaryman and the girl you read about in the synopsis, or a few other ""couples"" (or maybe I should just say character pairings, as they do not all necessarily take things as far as to be called a couple) where the girl is pleasantly gifted in a certain area.Despite the focus (camera or story-wise) on the girls\' chests, it is not particularly ""ecchi""...but kept cute and pure, it has a bit of humor and I find it very nice.Unfortunately, I have read the manga (but not the original twitter version), and so I can not help but compare. As such, the anime falls very much short of what it could have been. You see, such minute skit anime are often derived from a 4-koma manga. But this manga is nothing like that. Maybe the tweets started out like it, and it sometimes still feels like it because it interleaves very short fragments of the stories of the different couples. Yet those fragments actually combine well to deliver a good progression and development. When combined, they are just not short enough for this anime format. As a result, the anime skips over or changes a lot of details. If you just watch the anime, you won\'t notice or care, but if you\'ve read the manga the differences will seem significant enough to disappoint. For example the episode where the main couple meets was much different, the episode where Ai-chan changes her name was conflated with a completely separate manga scene where she turns 16, the episode where kouhai-chan first mentions her senpai\'s cat\'s massages references a completely skipped scene, etc.And it\'s not just the episode length that\'s a bad fit for the manga, but the episode count as well. There just isn\'t enough time to cover any progression in the anime version like this. I guess for this reason one of the manga couples - the one with the most development - does not even appear in the anime at all.It is still a good anime though.

It's pretty good overall, and has some funny bits even.I personally really love the main character. The other characters are decent, but underdeveloped compared to the main.Honestly,...if the episodes were just a bit longer to include a bit more plot and character development, I would have given it an 8.

The premise was intriguing, the art was both pleasant and consistent, and the singing performances were truly dynamic; but the way everything played out storywise just didn\'t do the voices or the art justice to me. One dimensional characters, frustrating plot holes, breakneck scene pacing-- every week I kept watching just to see if any of these would improve and they just didn\'t. For these reasons I don\'t personally see this anime as worth watching.Some problems I had in detail.Clearly Hu Li and his entire family were dealing with some very lasting damage from a traumatic event-- and it never goes...into as much detail as I would have preferred, which confuses me because this event supposedly shaped his character and career choice enough for his brother to unconditionally resent him, the one person keeping them both off the streets and putting food on the table.Hu Li\'s arrangement as a ghost writer/singer. So he has to not only sneak past the backstage security to get to the sound booth every performance, but the rest of the team also gets to be angry with him when he\'s running behind schedule? Why not just give him a backstage pass with the rest of the production staff and say he\'s got some other job related?These so called ""damage fees"" the record label demands from Hu Li and the way they just seemed to pull a number out of the air. And then nothing is questioned-- this is so so unrealistic.The lack of responsibility from SKY even after their identity is revealed. Why didn\'t Hu Li demand, or hell-- even SKY themselves to step up-- and be accountable for the mysterious fee quantity fabricated by the record label company after the big Night FOX reveal?SKY\'s actual intention for even DOING all this. Still a mystery, for no reason.I could go on but I\'m sure you get the point. I hope this review is helpful to you. into as much detail as I would have preferred, which confuses me because this event supposedly shaped his character and career choice enough for his brother to unconditionally resent him, the one person keeping them both off the streets and putting food on the table.Hu Li\'s arrangement as a ghost writer/singer.

One thing that I was always shocked by is the art and the character designs. They were both pretty top-notch 👌I do admit that the story overall was interesting. Sure there were some plot twists and I was wrong about some of the stuff (as in predictions on what happens). However, there...are obviously loopholes in the story which makes it a no-bueno 👎. *Small Spoiler, skip to the next paragraph* Can someone also tell me why that dude legit sang the same song for most of the episodes?

Trying to get an anime to have a full story in that amount of time is very difficult and I believe that they tried their best but in the end, however it just came off as rushed. No-bueno 👎Basically if you have some spare time and you like to hear some singing then go for it. However, if you are hesitating to watch this show don\'t even bother, you probably won\'t enjoy it.

Although the other characters are lackluster when compared to him.The plot is simple and enjoyable; you don't need to think that hard to grasp the story and the themed song is pretty good.I was looking for something to take a break from other serious animes I've been watching, and this anime served its purpose well.So if you like animes with underdogs, hidden identities and stuff you will totally enjoy this one. "", ""Honestly, I'm not a person who goes for music anime but the synopsis of this particular anime got me curious. I did see the poster and was kinda hoping to be BL and it did have its very hopeful subtle undertones.When I started it off, I was kinda dejected about it being only 12 episodes with 13 mins each but the first episode got me hooked and I finished the whole anime in a span of 3 hours. I didn't want to leave it. Each episode was left on a cliffhanger. So it made me want to watch moreThere were tones of sadness and...seriousness but the bright colours kept it mellow and the emotions can be well felt, that was the entire turmoil in the MC's mind. It was really fascinating to guess who the culprit can be.Also the MC kinda reminds me of my favourite character Todoroki Shouto with his scar and two toned hair.The downfall i only felt was the repeated music through out the anime (exception of last episode) so the MC didn't feel that special as the other characters made it to be. And also the end didn't leave me quite satisfied, i was really expecting a bit more. even though i really liked the last song.Over all I really liked this anime a lot.

It\'s not outstanding and life-changing, still, I had fun watching it until the end.Of course, I already knew what was going to happen in a certain way, and you figure it out without trouble at least 4 episodes before the last one. That didn\'t bother me, I don\'t think that everything has to be groundbreaking to be enjoyable. Sometimes you just want...something light and easy to digest to watch before you go to bed after a day of work.Although, it ended like it\'ll have a second season. I would like it to have a sequel because some little things weren\'t resolved, like the situation with the idol girls. If it doesn\'t get a second season, though, I won\'t be completed disappointed and heart-broken, it\'s not like it needs to for you to go on with your life, the way it ended made it almost completed enough to be a safe ""the end"" to the story. something light and easy to digest to watch before you go to bed after a day of work.Although, it ended like it\'ll have a second season.

Such a great concept destroyed by a rushed anime of 12 ten minutes episodes.The whole concept of a young ghost singer who adopt a persona to do his own work in the background is an amazing plot for a music anime, but oh boy calling it that would be way too generous. With as little as 2 different songs sung by the main protagonist and having to hear that same decently good song over and over for 11 episodes becomes irritating.The show could have been saved with a good or funny story, (like K-On!, which has something like...5 or 6 songs accross 2seasons, but the music is more of a side theme behind the slice of life/School girl theme.) but it is in no way enjoyable. Quite the oposite, it is as cliché and cringe as it gets. This scenario is what any 14 years old teenager in crisis would come up with for a story. It brings nothing new or original to the genre.I would suggest everyone to stay away from Kitsune no Koe/Voice of Fox.

The reactions of the protagonist and other characters are just so moronic, and unrealistic that it takes you completely out of the story. That's not the main focus of a music based anime, but it certainly diminishes the rest of it.On a more important note, for an anime that sells itself for being in the music genre, it takes a full 10 episodes before we hear more than 2 songs. Additionally, the same main piece is played over and over until...the last two episodes. I expect, as would be seen in a similar competition, ATLEAST 3 different songs by the protagonist, not speaking to the other competitors.

As you already know from the synopsis, it's about office workers and their routine life, and its targeted audience is the office workers as well. Basically, if you've ever experienced office life, you are likely to enjoy the show. Some of the episodes really resembled my office life and at some point i found myself laughing at the situations that were making me angry /...nervious / uneasy in real life. So actually the show helps to deal with stress and to take things easier.If you have no idea of office life at all, try this show - it'll give you an unforgettable experience.As for the story, there's not much of a plot. It's a sitcom, so every episode deals with a specific situation, like staying up late to redo a failed task, lunch break, making a presentation for your boss, your office looks etc. Some of the episodes are connected, but mostly not.The main weak point of the show is its art and character design. Though it is a comedy and parody, and such kind of shows tend to have poor art, i still don't like it. The art it very-very simple, and James' and boss' design makes my eyes bleed. So i wish they put more effort in art and made it more detailed and pretty.The characters are not really deep nor well-developed, but each one of them has his/her specific features and their personality is shown pretty well.It's a pity that the show got 6-something ranking on MAL.

"", 'Hello, peoples of the anime forum, I am Hedo and this is my very first review on the site.Story:If you\'re a fan of the long drawn out stories with back stories, adventure and romance. Then this probably isn\'t the anime for you. If you\'re like me, a simple otaku with simple tastes for nice slice of life anime where the plots are simple and easy to follow, then you have certainly come the the right place.each episode is maybe a four to five-minute short about the office life of Moon and his friends. Office humour for everyone! I was pretty taken with it I...must say, since this is the kind of thing I tend to go for.Though I did feel a somewhat longing for more. I feel I would have been happier with a proper twenty-something minute long episodes. But that\'s not how it rolled and because of that I\'m only going to give story an 8. That sounds fair. I think. Hope..Art:This is where some people might be put off of this anime. The art is rather simplistic. But I don\'t know, it seems like recently a lot of the slice of life anime I watch seem to be using the same art style, almost like they could all take place in the same world.I\'ve kinda been feeling like I\'ve fallen into a rut and it\'s gotten to the point where I\'m starting to check out anime simply because they got an interesting looking art style, and that may or may not be the reason behind checking out this anime.I did love the art style, it felt like a breath of fresh air for me.though that being said, it might be a deal breaker for many.I\'m gonna go ahead and give art a ten(*ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ Don\'t hurt me.Sound:That opening. Song. Was. Amazing. Not even kidding here. I could listen to it over and over. I\'ve already downloaded it for my cell phone.As for the sound of the overall show, I had no complaints with the voice acting, Though I guess when I first heard Connie\'s voice, the first thing I thought was, ""Well her voice sounds kind of generic.""You know that female voice you hear sometimes at the end or start of an anime that\'s like introducing the sponsors or what not? Or the voices in some Japanese TV ads? It kinda reminded me of that voice. But that had only been my first impression of the voice. It was fine.I\'m going to give sound a 9. I really did love that OP.Like oh mah gawd. On repeat for hours.You know, even if you don\'t check out the anime you should most certainly go for that OP. Like seriously.Character:I wouldn\'t say any of these characters were properly developed. Though at the same time we do get to know them and they are interesting characters.But that being said, none of these characters seem to grow or change through the series all that much. They pretty much are who they are.Rating 4Enjoyment:I think it\'s clear at this point that I seriously loved this anime, I was watching the episodes up one after another I liked it so much.So I\'m giving enjoyment a 10.Overall;Sure is had its flaws, but it really wasn\'t going out there to be this big epic anime.

L/R: Licensed by Royal,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1456/L_R__Licensed_by_Royal,"['""This anime might be another hidden gem!""Such thoughts were bothering me while watching first episode of Licensed by Royal. It had all the elements that is necessary for a popular series. Unfortunately L/R didn\'t make any use of them and turned into something that is nonsensical.Story: The biggest flaw of this anime is its plot. Starting episode 2 there are lots of plot-holes left. Story doesn\'t help characters to develop. There\'s hardly any intense in it. Only final episodes get a bit serious and dramatic, though it leaves an open ending which definitely was not an appropriate solution. Having said that, action scenes still...looked entertaining and the jokes were quite hilarious.Characters: It\'s true that we hardly get to know the main characters Rowe and Jack. There is not much talk about their past, but still they were memorable and the things that made them stood out from such generic, laid-back characters were the dialogues, which really worked between two of them. However directors didn\'t make a good use of this and ended up with a half-developed cast. The question is: was it really necessary for such a mediocore, entertaining series to flash out all the characters? Wouldn\'t it be just a waste of time ? It\'s up to the watcher.Art/Sound: Another problem with this show is the pale looking designs. The faces are undetailed, They barely show any emotions. On the opposite note the music is marvelous. The opening theme, sung by Billy Preston, is catchy. It\'s probably one of the best anime theme songs from the past few years. Almost all of the songs used in each episode have lyrics, and it\'s a very refreshing change from the generic synth incidentals we get in other series.Overall Licensed Royal could have been equalized with Cowboy bebop or even The Big O if the directors had put more thoughts into writing the script. It is a nice thing to sit through if you need to kill some time. There are plenty of fun moments and the two main characters are extremely likeable, but that\'s really all it has. looked entertaining and the jokes were quite hilarious.Characters: It\'s true that we hardly get to know the main characters Rowe and Jack.

Well, what if I told you that the ride on the beach is the feeling you’ll experience while watching this particular spy series?Now you might be asking, “Wait, there’s a way to make a show about spies relaxing?” and if you did ask that, I wouldn’t blame you. Stylish, over-the-top fight scenes interposed by panty flashes from bombshell beauties is the modus operandi for anything related to spies in entertainment. As a devotee to the James Bond franchise, I know that immortal one-liners, uberviolent stories with egotistical despots, and eccentric gadgets are the name of the game for spy films. Thanks to Bond, Jason Bourne, the Mission Impossible franchise, and others of their ilk, it’s natural to assume that any TV series or movie centered on spies will be like the others.However, there is one show, an anime as a matter of fact, that abandons the conventional elements of spydom and its name is Licensed by Royalty (better known as “L/R”).“Go where no one’s gone before”, sung by soul legend Billy Preston, is the opening theme for L/R. Chill and even-tempered with spontaneous bursts of energy, the OP exemplifies the tone of the series… at least for the first half of the series. L/R is the one student in class that forgets about assignments, constantly daydreams, and often asks for bathroom breaks, all with an exceedingly goofy grin on his face. Rarely in Licensed by Royalty is anything taken seriously. When the protagonists have to recover a valuable artifact, they screw around until the last minute. When a gaggle of obnoxious reporters clamor at the door of the spies’ headquarters, sculptured cherubs douse them in water emitting from their penises. When the protagonists are caught by one of the series’ villains, they stare into the camera and simultaneously declare, “We’ll be right back after this!” It’s such a shame that L/R’s quixotic dreams of originality were tarnished by the later episodes.From the beginning, L/R is grounded in reality, the central storyline perpetuating the spy stereotypes, its fate pre-destined. Ishtar is a dead ringer for England while Cloud 7 might as well by MI6. The purpose for the agents of Cloud 7 is to protect Ishtar’s royalty at all cost. Where this series lacks in structural novelty, it more than compensates with its authenticity. The story is set in the 1960s, a time when England finished recovering from the aftermath of World War II and was progressing into a cultural powerhouse. In L/R, you can see the excesses of success England possessed for years, and yet this series never fails in depicting the country as one that still needs to exert its power and showcase its status more than ever. WWII is never mentioned but its effects on L/R loom large. What really deserves a round of applause is how the characters in L/R actually sound British. Anime, both subs and dubs, is notorious for having people in different countries sound exactly the same (The closest this medium gets to vocal diversity is an Osaka dialect) so for L/R’s cast to speak like they’re from England is truly amazing.Unfortunately, the aunthenticity of L/R’s English dub is among the cast’s only saving graces, Practically every character has the same body type, tall and slim, and their facial features scream low-budget. Sometimes the noses look realistic and sometimes they only consist of two nostrils plastered onto a face. Blinking apparently is difficult to animate for eyes that look exactly the same for virtually every character.  Even if Studio TNK had bothered applying effort on its character designs, L/R’s cast still wouldn’t have been noteworthy. Dez, this show’s token mad scientist, has an average of 1.5 lines per episode while Claire, Cloud 7’s female “agent”, literally exists as a romantic interest that cooks and cleans, and Noelle, the red-headed town darling, is arguably the most forgettable of them all (her singing sucks, by the way). Perhaps L/R’s characterization flaws are due to focusing too much on the protagonists.The eponymous L/R, a team of two with great prestige and their own fanboys, they are Jack Hofner and Rowe Rickenbacker. Jack is a clean-cut diplomat, the by-the-book professional that excels in the art of disguises. He by far receives the most depth in the series, what with his hidden past and tragic love affair and all, but he comes across too much as a poor man’s Bond instead of his own person. Personally, I feel that Rowe is the more interesting of the two. Whereas Jack is meticulous and stiff but feigns nonchalance, Rowe is completely relaxed, preferring to let everything hang out in the open. Jovial and loquacious yet highly perceptive, he often concedes the spotlight to Jack but is more than capable of being the man in charge if necessary. Actor JB Blanc, who did such an excellent job as Monster’s Roberto, once again delivers his laid-back, even-keel voice, along with adding a carefree charm in his faux-British accent, and he absolutely nails it as Rowe.It has been apparent from the beginning but the later episodes reveal a long-standing classism feud between Ishtar and Ivory Island (the Ireland to Ishtar’s England), and the bombings from a terrorist known as “Angel” forces the issue to surge to the forefront. Much can be criticized about L/R’s second half, from its frustrating open ending to how the identity of the show is completely dismissed, but what I enjoy about it is how L/R provides multiple perspectives on the issue. An Ishtar tycoon makes it his duty to let the citizens of Ivory Island know their place while the father of a famous baseball player spreads the word on Ishtar’s downward spiral into corruption; while some of Ivory Island’s denizens have become accustomed to their harsh treatment, others are beyond pissed at the entire dynamic. The bubbling tension reaches a boiling point in a climatic speech by Noelle, where she integrates everyone’s individual opinions into one and, with sweeping dramatic flair, reveals the mastermind behind it all. The speech does a brilliant job of tying everything together and it even causes L/R’s second half to be worthwhile.Licensed by Royalty, in the end, follows the example of spy films that preceded it. However, I refuse to hold that against this hidden gem. L/R is one of the most relaxing journeys I’ve ever experienced and, even when it adopts a serious streak, it never fails to be watchable. Among other works with overblown expectations, L/R manages to simultaneously be ambitious yet realistic; it doesn’t attempt reaching the heavens but, at the same time, L/R never settles for less either. Really, that’s all you can ask for in what you watch. and envision the picture I laid out for you. I’ll give you a second to immerse yourself in the moment.(Twiddling my thumbs)Are you finished?

Among other works with overblown expectations, L/R manages to simultaneously be ambitious yet realistic; it doesn’t attempt reaching the heavens but, at the same time, L/R never settles for less either. Really, that’s all you can ask for in what you watch.', 'Licensed by Royalty was never a show that really appealed to me. I saw the trailers on many Geneon DVDs over the years, and always went “meh so what”. Sure it had that cool factor, but I never figured it had much more then that going on. No one else seemed to watch the show, and those that did never seemed to have wonderful things to say about it. So I skipped over it, like I’m sure many of you did. Big mistake. But recently I needed to add a little to my order to get free shipping from Rightstuf, and well I took a...gamble with L/R. And well that little gamble paid off. There’s a lot going on in this little show from 2003.In an alternate 1960′s, or maybe the present that just seems like the era of peace and love never truly went away (the series never actually makes it clear which it is), exists a top-secret agency known as Cloud 7. Cloud 7′s role is to protect the royal family of the country of Ishtar, a fictional version of the United Kingdom. Cloud 7′s top agents, Jack Hofner and Rowe Rikenbacker, go by the code name L/R, but who is the L and who is the R? Licensed by Royalty follows Jack and Rowe as their missions lead them from protecting the national treasures of Ishtar from would-be-thieves, to helping people trapped in a cable car in the capital city, to eventually protecting the royal family from a terroristic organization known only as Angel. The first few episodes have no overarching plot, but drop enough hints that when the plot does take off it all makes sense. Eventually the series also deals with a little girl named Noelle from the country of Ivory (Ireland) who may or may not be the long lost princess. The early episodes that have little to do with the grander storyline all have a mystery or twist in them that is not revealed  (usually dramatically) until the end. Much like the wonderful Case Closed/Detective Conan our heros usually have it figured out before the viewer does, and Rowe and Jack usually make a big reveal at the end of each episode that always got me. After awhile I was expecting a twist or mystery or some big reveal when the episode was almost over, and still was tricked. The show intentionally misleads the viewer, with plenty of red herrings, and shows you its left hand, while discretely maneuvering its right to where it really matters without you noticing (like any good magician). It is quite a smart show in how it keeps what is really going on in each episode hidden until the very end. Once the plot really kicks in this happens less often, that is until the dramatic ending which will have you guessing how it will all really end until the very last second. **(Spoiler) ** The plot also contains a bit of British vs Irish nationalism (à la The Troubles in Northern Ireland), but just like in real life the real bad guys are not any ethnic group or religion, but multinational corporations. I felt this aspect of the series worked quite well. **(spoiler end)**The intelligent and wonderfully written mysteries and twists are only part of this series charm. The other giant draw here is the great characters, and how they play off one another. Jack Hofner is the playboy part of the duo, who is still quite serious about his job, yet gives off an aura of cool. Rowe Rikenbacker on the other hand is much more laid back, and not nearly as much of a philanderer as Jack. Jack, to me anyway, was the more relatable and interesting character. He is the director’s favorite and more likable of the two. Jack looks happy the entire series,  always smiling and joking around, but really he keeps his emotions hidden inside, unlike Rowe who wears them on his sleeve. Did I mention that two spies are not above donning silly disguises if it will get the job done? Their boss’s codename is Mister, who is an always serious, cold, and cunning kind of guy. You are never exactly sure what Mister is thinking or what he knows. Claire Pennylane is the secretary of Cloud 7 who ends up (out of necessary) getting involved in missions despite not truly being a field agent. Her lack of experience shows, but she’s usually smart enough to work her way out of any problems that arise. She is a bit of an spaz at times, but she has a heart of gold. Claire is not entirely interesting as a character, nor is she very well developed. Dez is the agencies go-to tech guy, pretty much he’s the one who makes all the super cool gadgets Jack and Rowe use. He’s a generic wacky scientists, who is definitely out there, but a very likable guy. Dez is not exactly a unique character, but he’s always funny. As the series progresses the two agents end up having to be bodyguards to a cute, but resourceful little Irish girl named Noelle. Although Jack is my favorite character, Noelle gives him some real competition. She is a very sweet and cute girl that you just want to hug. She’s strong willed, smart, and crafty, but she’s still a child and the show never forgets this. There are little nuances like the fact she hates shoes and loves to go barefoot, or the nursery rhyme she likes to recite that make her character very lifelike. Jack and Rowe end up having to protect her from various mooks throughout different points of series. The differences between how Jack and Rowe care about her is important. Rowe cares for Noelle very deeply, in a fatherlike manner, and he’s much closer to her then Jack. They become true friends. Jack on the other hand  stays at a little distance from her, perhaps never truly warming up to her, but he still clearly cares for her even if he hides this a little. The series really shines however when the characters play off one another. It is Jack and Rowe’s interactions and chatter that really makes this show noteworthy, and it is something you will have to see for yourself. Some of the best moments of the show are not the cool action scenes, but Jack and Rowe teaching a lesson to a rude British businessman and his nearly-as-rude associate .There are some real funny moments that I won’t spoil, a great running gag or two, and plenty of fun moments. But it’s not just a comedy as there are serious spy action scenes in every episode. There’s also the few, but jaw-dropping, scenes that can only be described as crowning moments of awesome that really blow you away. The series also has plenty of heartwarming scenes throughout. Not to mention the show is sometimes just plainly the definition of cool. Between the great personalities of the lead characters, their amazingly exciting job,  all their neat gadgets and wicked cars (1,2), and the 60′s-ness of it all, you’ll be taken aback by the cool factor many times. The atmosphere and mood is just dripping with style. And like I said this is not at all a dumb series, it is very intelligently written and the twists and turns are top notch. But all this coolness and intelligence would be wasted if it didn’t have a look and sound that matched it. Luckily for us the powers that be at TNK blew one out of the ballpark. The series opener is easily one of the best of the decade, although it’s easy to see why when one merely looks at who the singer is. Billy Preston, who some called  ”the fifth Beatle”,  sang the opening theme song (side note: John Lennon at one point really considered making him a full time member of the band but Paul McCartney said there was enough drama with just the four of them). Preston worked with the Beatles on some of their best albums ( Abbey Road, Let it Be, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band) not to mention putting out a few classics of his own. The rest of the soundtrack follows suite, with a totally 60′s British/American-rock inspired score. This all melds perfectly with the 007/spy nature of the series. The look of the show also does not disappoint. Character designs are unique (Noelle is to die for),  the backgrounds look good, and the animation is top notch.With all these things going for it a poor dub could have really stopped the show dead in it’s tracks, but New Generation Pictures got a hold of this one, and they live up to the high standards I hold them too. NGP got many British actors to work on the show, and those who are not British put on authentic sounding British accents, clearly trained a little by the Brits on staff. And the Irish (well Ivory) character’s have great Irish accents too. But more then excellent accents, the show has top notch acting and brilliant casting. Freddy Douglas’s voice is just sly and playful enough to play Jack perfectly. I could not imagine another voice coming from that character. J.B. Blanc (ADR Director) brilliantly cast himself  as Rowe and the emotion in his voice makes Rowe very believable. Heather Klinke, who I sadly haven’t heard in anything else, plays a convincing and cute little Irish lass that is so adorable, but fits the character altogether. The timing on all the gags and jokes work quite well, and not even one actor in the show has a bad line. Dare I say it, but this is one of those shows that everyone (even sub fans) should watch in English. The British and Irish accents totally makes the show work, as these are supposed to be British and Irish people, and the acting is really excellent throughout.Geneon put this out on DVD in late 2003 and early 2004, and the artbox for it (which I own) is quite nice to look at. The only extra worth mentioning is on the last disc, and it is an interview with both the director and producer at Otakon 2003. The director, Itsuro Kawasaki, notes that the first episode is by far his favorite, and hey it’s my favorite too! Itsuro Kawasaki wrote the script for episode one himself, and said he “added everything he wanted” in it. This extra care really shows, as episode one comes together incredibly, both as a brilliant way to introduce the main cast, and showcase what the show will be doing for the next 12 episodes. They pulled out all the stops for this episode and the mystery in it is brilliant. The rest of the interview asks both the producer and director their impressions of Otakon 2003, their favorite characters, favorite episode(s), the main appeal of the show, and to describe any problems that happened during production. All of this is very interesting, and I wish shows being released on DVD/Blu-ray today had extra features like this on them as it is very insightful.The show is a fun, yet somewhat serious spy show that is throughly entertaining. It is very smart, and at times it can be a little sexy. Each episode will have you guessing who the real bad guys are or what that guy is really up to, yet also has well choreographed action scenes too. There’s great character interactions, and good running gags throughout, not to mention it sounds and looks good too. Sure some of the side characters are not well developed or sort of generic, yes yes the bad guys motives and characters are rarely explored, and yeah it may not be a title that stays with you forever. But, let’s not make perfect the enemy of good. I for one am upset it took me this long to watch Licensed by Royalty, and hope others give it a chance.(review originally posted: http://predederva.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/licensed-by-royalty/ ) gamble with L/R.

I for one am upset it took me this long to watch Licensed by Royalty, and hope others give it a chance.(review originally posted: http://predederva.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/licensed-by-royalty/ )', 'I randomed Licensed by Royal in a game to watch a series with some friends. I watched it in full and this is the review of my experience.The story was bland. Plot didn\'t develop until around episode 7 if I remember correctly. It is as if the series started off with episodes written randomly which were then turned into some haphazard story line. Towards the end of the series the plot started to get more interesting, a lot of twists and turns were introduced but there was definitely nothing to write home about in this series as far as story goes.The art was typical for...anime of its time. Nothing incredible but it wasn\'t the worst I\'ve seen.Apart from the repetitive sound stages for fight or getaway scenes, the sound was pretty well done. The opening and closing songs were fairly decent and the general use of the music in the series fit the story well.Characters didn\'t have depth, bottom line. We don\'t get much of character back stories nor do we learn anything about newly introduce characters other than their minor affect on the plot. Rowe and Jack were pretty funny at some parts and were portrayed well as the ""cool"" guys.I didn\'t find much enjoyment in this anime. Overall I wish I didn\'t random it in my game, I could have done without watching. However, it wasn\'t the worst thing I have watched and could have been a lot better with a more solid and linear plot.A lot of the art, music, and characters reminded me of Cowboy Bebop, save the time and watch it instead. anime of its time.

In fact, that's part of the whole point.Licensed by Royalty has arguably one of the most foolproof setups for a great show, but somehow manages to botch it up. Even so, it is worth checking out at least once, just to experience the superbly nostalgic atmosphere it creates.The thing that catches your eye right away is that it doesn't feel like an anime to begin with. Rather, it conspicuously looks and feels like those oldie Brit spy-fic series they used to churn out back...in the 60's. Right from the out-there spectacular opening score, the atmosphere has an unmistakeably retro feel - the cars, the music, the 007-esque booby-trapped safehouse, the Blimps (I'm not kidding - they really do go that far). It also has two extremely likeable leads that take you along for a jolly ride through this world. What it does not have, on the other hand, is a plot that can make you care - or at any rate be taken seriously. If you're fine with that, then this is the show for you.This show really is all about the setup - an undercover agency appointed by the Royal Family of Brit- I mean Ishtar, that works out of a Victorian safehouse in downtown Lond- oh, never mind. As you can see, this is the perfect setup to push any number of spy tropes, props, humour, aesthetics and what have you besides - you can see the great potential right here. The safehouse, for example, is one heck of a cool place to work out of. The show is full of such evocative flourishes, and the resulting nostalgia factor is just off the charts.Taking you along for a ride through this world are Jack Hofner and Rowe Rickenbacker, the eponymous L/R. The two have somewhat contrasting appearances and mannerisms, but underneath surface-level details they feel more or less like the same guy - a laid-back and carefree spy-guy just riding the wave with effortless skill and style - and there's two of them. But it actually works brilliantly - they feel like twin brothers who are taking the piss out of each other all the time, but know each other thoroughly and are supremely well-coordinated. That they don't seem to have much depth to them is something you couldn't care less about - you just want to go along for the ride with them. The supporting cast are almost downright stereotypical, but they're still well-designed (and well-acted) ones at that. Again, the objective here seems to be more of evoking the right atmosphere than anything else, and on that level it finds it mark perfectly.Perhaps the best thing about this whole show is the English dub - one of those truly rare instances where the dub is far and away better than the original source. In keeping with the retro-Brit atmosphere, the voice cast is meticulously British-sounding, and they have even gone to the trouble of getting the regional accents right (at least broad imitations, but even that's unbelievably painstaking work for an anime of this scale and scope).Unforturately, what they don't have is a serviceable plot to carry this setup. Perhaps an episodic format would have suited this show much better, given its initial light and carefree tone. Instead, what you have is a straight-faced plot, but so filled with holes and ultimately so unengaging that you just stop caring at one point. I've heard it gets even more preposterous afterwards, but like I said earlier you couldn't be bothered at this point. Once it stops being fun there's really nothing left worth sticking around for, unless perhaps you don't mind going through the rest of it with your brain switched off (which is arguably the best way to watch this show).No, I'll tell you what this show REALLY needed - the animation and writing team from Cowboy Bebop. These guys were sitting on an utterly brilliant concept, but they needed somebody who could understand, appreciate and execute that concept with the required expertise. That would have created the perfect show, and for that matter the perfect successor to Bebop, with Jack and Rowe filling in for the Spike and Jet tag-team (and making more co-operative partners besides).

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well."", ""I started to watched this because I like the first season so much but sadly this anime is disappointed. It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with.

It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course.

I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes.

And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here?

And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either.

And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters. episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God!

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best.

The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well."", ""I started to watched this because I like the first season so much but sadly this anime is disappointed. It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier.

There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well. to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog!

There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters. episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog!

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well. to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters.

The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters. episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

It made me fall in love with the classical music and its characters, it's beautiful and quiet love story.This one is even worse than the average otome game reverse harem adaptation; even Kamigami No Asobi is doing a better job of keeping me interested this...season.The music is more like a background than something important to the characters even though it supposed to be the center of their lives. There are no memorable performances, nothing to really strike the chord. Even the ones that are supposed to be outstanding only make me want to push fast forward button.The animation is poor, it's like the performer is a bad actor that pretends to play the instrument for the camera.No character development or relationship development. Too many characters are introduced all at once and we only get a passing glance at them, but don't actually have the chance to get to know them and, as a consequence, start liking them. They are flat, cliché and not at all engaging.The storyline is jumping ahead at the breakneck speed. It looks more like a collection of scraps from the different points of the timeline.All in all, while I may have been a bit harsh some places, this is still nothing but a disappointment. season.The music is more like a background than something important to the characters even though it supposed to be the center of their lives.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once.

It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well. to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good.

It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre. It made me fall in love with the classical music and its characters, it's beautiful and quiet love story.This one is even worse than the average otome game reverse harem adaptation; even Kamigami No Asobi is doing a better job of keeping me interested this...season.The music is more like a background than something important to the characters even though it supposed to be the center of their lives.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience.

For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters. episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

There are no memorable performances, nothing to really strike the chord. Even the ones that are supposed to be outstanding only make me want to push fast forward button.The animation is poor, it's like the performer is a bad actor that pretends to play the instrument for the camera.No character development or relationship development. Too many characters are introduced all at once and we only get a passing glance at them, but don't actually have the chance to get to know them and, as a consequence, start liking them. They are flat, cliché and not at all engaging.The storyline is jumping ahead at the breakneck speed. It looks more like a collection of scraps from the different points of the timeline.All in all, while I may have been a bit harsh some places, this is still nothing but a disappointment."", ""I saw the original La Corda D'Oro anime when it came out in 2007, but it took me a LOOOONG time to finish it. I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once.

The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well. to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good.

It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once. It doesn't really show the beauty of violin and other classical music like the first season does and of course the male characters is not ikemen as the first season. Less romance in this anime.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre. It made me fall in love with the classical music and its characters, it's beautiful and quiet love story.This one is even worse than the average otome game reverse harem adaptation; even Kamigami No Asobi is doing a better job of keeping me interested this...season.The music is more like a background than something important to the characters even though it supposed to be the center of their lives.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos!

The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters. episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos!

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that.

It looks more like a collection of scraps from the different points of the timeline.All in all, while I may have been a bit harsh some places, this is still nothing but a disappointment."", ""I saw the original La Corda D'Oro anime when it came out in 2007, but it took me a LOOOONG time to finish it. I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well. to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music.

Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that.

Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters. episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music.

It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best.

I grouch about the mediocrity of them but still watch (or at last try to watch) every single one.With this one, episode 6 is probably as far as I go.Wow, such a disappointment. The original La corda d'oro was, for me, one of the best in it's genre.

I can't remember why. Maybe it was due to school or lack of interest. But I completed it along with the OVA. I don't remember much after that. I have the first six volumes of the manga, and read more at my local library. But it didn't strike a chord with me much, and to this day, I still don't care for it. Actually, I wasn't intending on watching this. But when I found out it was going to be 12...episodes long, I figured I might as well watch, since I needed to watch a short anime before the summer ends. It has good qualities, but they're all overshadowed by blandness, over exaggeration, and other problems.The story's about Kanade, a girl who, along with her two childhood friends, transfers to Seiso Academy so they can compete in the various musical competitions. That's mostly it. The story's just about her ensemble practicing and partaking in the music competitions. There are some moments where they have fun and take breaks, but they don't really do anything to really develop the characters and make them more well-rounded. This is one huge flaw of the series: the characters. Their designs are generic, and their overall characters are really bland, only having one or two personality traits besides an obsession with music. One character (who looks like a rip-off of Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club, seiyuu and all, but with purple eyes) doesn't do anything except play piano and act like he's in love with Kanade, which really turned me off. One thing I do, however, like about Kanade, the main character, is that unlike the main character in the first series, who was just handed a magical violin from a fairy, Kanade has been practicing the violin for years. Isn't it great to have main characters who are good at something?! But even then, it doesn't save her from being bland and underdeveloped. There is one character who I ABSOLUTELY loathe with a passion: Myoga Reiji. Why? Because he spends 99% of the series either talking down on other people and blaming Kanade for something so stupid, lame, and exaggerated that I can't believe people thought this kind of character would work. He's driven and passionate, yes, but he's only defined by his hatred for one other character, and for the stupidest, lamest, dumbest reason ever. That's NOT how you write a character! It really doesn't help that he, like the rest of the cast, seems to believe that music defines his existence.Speaking of which, here's another problem I have with both the series and the characters. While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out.

I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music.

While it's great to like something and be passionate about it, there's a fine line between being passionate about music and acting like it's the only thing you live for. Here? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts like not winning the music competition is tantamount to having absolutely no reason to exist, like devoting their lives to music defines their very existence! It's like these people are absolutely obsessed with music to the extreme! I may like drawing and writing, but I don't act like drawing and writing are God! And not only that, because everyone acts like winning the competition is like reaching Nirvana, everyone's reactions to their losses and everything else comes off as extremely forced, superficial, and melodramatic, complete with exaggerated expressions, and I don't mean the kooky, cartoony kind either. Because people act like music defines their existence, they make the biggest deals out of the littlest things, like Reiji's reason for hating Kanade. Without giving away spoilers, I'm sure he felt offended by what Kanade did, but he really didn't have to take it so personally to the point of threatening her, holding it over her head, treating her and others like garbage, and acting like she's some kind of arrogant glory hog! He needs to get over it, as there are better reasons to hold a grudge against someone, and his reasons are petty.But these aren't the only problems the show has. There's only twelve episodes, and there's so many characters that there isn't time to develop them. I know nowadays anime are mostly commercials for manga or light novels or games, but that's still no excuse to not utilize the story and characters. While I do admit the anime has a great soundtrack as I'm a fan of classical music, sometimes I feel like certain BGMs during scenes get abruptly cut off when transitioning from one scene to another, making it feel like the creators couldn't use pieces that actually felt complete in its designated scene and just used BGMs that went over the scene's duration time. It just felt really jarring to me. Not only that, the story doesn't have very much scope, and the characters' unhealthy obsession with music just makes it come off as superficial. The lack of development for the characters gives us no reason to care about them or their plights. Also, the animators can't seem to decide how long they should make Kanade's skirt, which makes her body look really oddly proportioned, even in the opening sequence. They can't seem to decide if they want her skirt to look short like most anime skirts even though it's not a miniskirt, or if it should go to slightly above her knee, like in the promotional picture. Not only that, you know that magic ring she has around her neck? It basically serves no purpose to provide visual Deus Ex Machinas for the audience she plays for, and the illusions it shows are all real to the audience. It makes no sense, and although it has an explanation, it's still flimsy and forced.This isn't to say the anime is outright bad. For example, I was pleasantly surprised by the voice actor choices in this anime. It reuses a lot of actors from the first La Corda anime, but this anime does interesting things with the actors. Instead of having them play the exact same type of character, it makes them play against type. For example, Jun Fukuyama voiced the woozy, quiet, and spaced out Keiichi in the first series, while in here he plays the loud, opinionated, hot blooded Kyoya. Reiko Takagi, the voice of Kahoko in the first series, uses a much higher voice for Kanade. Kisho Taniyama does the voice of the stoic, blunt, and cold Len from the first anime, while in here he plays the loud, flamboyant, and also blunt Chiaki Togane (the blonde guy who plays the electric violin). Masakazu Morita plays the cheerful, friendly, and outgoing Kazuki in the first anime (who actually appears in this anime along with Len as cameos! The reason being that this anime takes place eight years after the first anime) while here he plays the scary looking, delinquent-like but shy Hozumi. It's always fun to see voice actors go against their typecasting every now and again, even within the same franchise! Not only that, the anime has done a lot of research regarding classical music and instruments, even electric violins, which aren't shown in the first anime. It's always nice to see different kinds of instruments, both old and modern.This show is mostly bland. It could have been worse. If you like classical music, check it out. But don't expect a well rounded story with well developed characters."", ""I decided to watch this because I had watched the first two seasons. I was curious to see how this would turn out. I would say it was similar to the previous seasons.The plot was focusing on the competition and it was about Kanade getting back her love for music. As opposed to the first season, where the main character was able to play violin because her instrument was magical, I preferred this one, where the main character was a violin prodigy to begin with. It felt like everything she achieved was through her own hard work and it made the story easier to relate...to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good. It made the universe of the story coherent with the previous one. Some previous characters even made a small cameo appearance.The music selection for the competition was classic, of course. I liked the arrangement they made to these pieces, notably Winter by Vivaldi and Danse Macabre. It made the performances enjoyable. Ave Maria has been played as well. I find that this piece was an important one in the first season and for it to be used again in the third season created a nice bridge to link them together.The characters were somewhat annoying sometimes. I think their development occurred a little late. For a major part of the beginning, Kyouya just seemed to display a lot of misplaced anger without any clear explanation about it and it appeared redundant after a while. Kanade is shown as being naive and somewhat weak. I easily got nervous watching her, wondering if someone would say something that would make her hesitate again. Myoga Reiji's grudge against Kanade also seemed a little redundant. The nature of his grudge was easily predictable, but the whole back story could've been revealed a little bit earlier. We could see Kanade remembering fragments of it, but instead of repeating the same sequence for the entire serie and then throwing the rest at the end, it would probably have been better if they showed a little more each time as the story progressed.Overall, this anime was fine, but it wasn't the best. The plot was too similar to the one from season one. The characters also made me cringe a few times. Still, if you liked season one, then you might like this spin-off as well. to.The art style was the same as from the previous seasons, which is good.

It is not good as the first season. It doesn't make me excited to watch the next episode.Too many character introduced at once. It doesn't really show the beauty of violin and other classical music like the first season does and of course the male characters is not ikemen as the first season. Less romance in this anime. Maybe this is the big factor why I don't like it.I'm too expect this anime is good as the first season but sadly I disappointed. This is the...first and last I watched it.
