Kurenai Sanshirou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4439/Kurenai_Sanshirou,"['Exploring all the quirks of this anime never ceases to amaze me. You see commenting on Kurenai Sanshiro is like opening a Matryoshka, a Russian doll, every time you uncap a doll you find a smaller doll inside it and so on. Likewise for Kurenai Sanshiro, aka Judo Boy, each info leads to another and so on.So this is no brief review but I humbly believe the anime deserves these clarifications.First of all Kurenai Sanshiro was never licensed in USA, this might explain why English reviews about it are so scarce.  However the anime aired in foreign countries under the name...""Judo Boy"" (France, Italy) or ""El Rey del Judo"" (Spain, Chile). Consequently there is no English dub for this anime. So I will mostly talk about the French dub. Now for the loyal readers who didn’t run away screaming ^^, let’s get to the meat of this review:STORYThis is the tale of a young man on a quest to avenge his father. Sanshiro arrives too late at the crime scene only to find a glass-eye lying on the ground near the body of his father. This is his only clue: Sanshiro knows the killer is a one-eyed man.Needless to say you can expect Sanshiro to face a sizeable amount of baddies with eye-patches in those 26 episodes ; ). Remarkably for such an oldie, the anime is quite brutal. People die left and right in Kurenai Sanshiro, especially the weak. In other words Sanshiro has the Death’s Touch, often when he shows up in town you can sure bet someone will kick the bucket (friend or foe ^^).ART & ANIMATIONEven though Judo Boy aired in Europe during the 80\'s, the original Japanese broadcast actually dates back to 1969. So don’t expect anything jaw-dropping or perfectly smooth. Still this a Tatsunoko Production we’re talking about, so the Character Design and the Art Style truly stand out. Characters are full of life and their looks feel relatively realistic (their face, their clothing, etc). The anime displays vibrant colors which is surprising considering the age of the show.DVD BOX SETS AND DUB1- Japanese DVD Box Set: Japanese dub only, goodies included, mono sound.2- French Simple Edition: French dub only, no goodies,3- French Collector Edition: dual-audio Japanese-French, goodies included (illustrations, informative booklet). If you’re a Frenchie this is the recommended edition. Now a note on the French dub:The French dub is legendary, ‘nuff said. First because the French voice cast was made of the most talented actors of the industry of the time (Philippe Ogouz, Francis Lax, Jacques Balutin, Gérard Hernandez, Georges Atlas, Daniel Gall, Claude Chantal, Amélie Morin…) Seriously the list goes on.The undeniable highlight is late François Leccia who voiced Sanshiro. He has voiced a multitude of roles in his lifetime, but for anime fans his voice will always be tied to the main characters of Judo Boy and Albator 84, aka Captain Harlock SSX. There’s sincerity in his tone that makes all the characters he voiced forever likable.Finally there’s the French opening sung by Michel Barouille. Endowed with a superb baritone voice this singer delivered a very solemn/martial rendition of the song, which stayed engrained in the minds of an entire generation of French kids, just youtube it and try to remove it from your head if you can ^^,MANGAKurenai Sanshiro was based on a manga of the same name drawn by Ippei Kuri. For the record Ippei Kuri was the brother of Kenji and Tatsuo Yoshida. The 3 brothers founded the anime studio Tatsunoko Production.  As far as the drawing goes, the manga is nothing earth-shattering. There is a lack of dynamism in some pages that is typical of the era, but the narrative is effective.In 2014 a quality edition of the manga was released in France by ""Isan Manga"" under the title Kurenai Sanshiro. This French-speaking collected edition (+370 pages) contains the complete story of Kurenai Sanshiro drawn by Ippei Kuri. Also as a bonus are added a few short stories of Sanshiro (unrelated to the main story) that were drawn by his brother Tatsuo Yoshida. Surprisingly the drawing of both brothers is quite similar.ANECTDOTES/ORIGINS1- ""kurenai"" means ""crimson"" (red),2- The red jacket (uwagi) that Sanshiro wears when fighting was given by his mother. And when Sanshiro wears it he becomes almost invincible. On second look this gimmick is quite reminiscent of…Superman. Indeed Clark Kent too wears a red outfit -a red cape- when he turns into Superman. It was given by his mother too,3- Sanshiro is not a judoka, he’s actually doing Jujutsu. So why this anime was translated as ‘Judo Boy’ in Europe for crying out loud? To find out please read the next anecdote ^^,4- The whole anime is a tribute to the movie ""Sanshiro Sugata"", directed by Akira Kurosawa in 1943. To cut it short (I swear I’m trying hard ^_^) the main character named Sanshiro too, hehe what a coincidence, gives up on training Jujutsu only to learn Judo. And believe me the physical resemblance between the actor Susumu Fujita and Sanshiro from Judo Boy is totally stunning: the square jaw, the frank and inquisitive look and the bushy eyebrows, they totally nailed it. It was Akira Kurosawa’s first movie, it’s a decent watch but don’t expect anything of epic magnitude like ""Seven Samurai"" or ""Kagemusha"",5- Akira Kurosawa being so idolized in Europe (for good reasons I feel) the people in charge of the European distribution of the anime probably made the link between Kurenai Sanshiro (the anime) and Sanshiro Sugata (the movie), this might explain why the anime was translated  as ‘Judo Boy’ in those countries.CONCLUSIONKurenai Sanshiro is an old show that stands out, first visually then for his dramatic story. If you like animes where characters travel around then Judo Boy might please you: during his journey Sanshiro will visit quite a few places (Mexico, China, France, USA...) and each episode has a different storyline to keep viewers entertained. As a character Sanshiro is unforgettable, not only he’s charismatic but there is probity in him that makes him tremendously likable.Now if you’re one of those anime fans who only swear by HD, then maybe this watch will cause you severe bleeding damage ^^. However if you care about the old stuff then by all means take a look, you might find it to your liking.Now it’s time to close this review, \'cos if we keep on digging like this then we’ll probably trace back to Jesus or the Big Bang even (but I truly could go on about Kurenai Sanshiro ; ) So this is goodbye.

Kiitarou Shounen no Youkai Enikki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33244/Kiitarou_Shounen_no_Youkai_Enikki,"['The title of this series of anime shorts speaks for itself – it’s a show about a boy named Kiitaro, and the memories that he makes meeting lots of different Youkai. The first episode of the show has a slightly different feel, but the other episodes all involve Kiitaro meeting some Youkai and having interactions with them which reveal something about their nature.The show is light-hearted and comic in tone, with Kiitaro ending up in some silly situations either from misunderstanding the youkai, from the actions of the youkai themselves, or his main companion the Zashiki Warashi Suzu.I will say that there’s a surprising amount...of somewhat sexual humour in the series, with repeated upskirt jokes and things of a similar nature. To me it didn’t feel like it added anything to the story or my understanding of the youkai. It felt rather out of place in what was otherwise a very light and cute series.The episodes have a short section at the end actually talking about the youkai and what they’re like in folklore. This was interesting to me as a short primer, as while I’m aware of youkai as a general concept, I’m not familiar with many specific kinds of youkai, so finding out a little about them was interesting! Obviously a 10-15 second segment can’t give you a lot of information, but it does give me enough so that I can find out a bit more.The visuals are of a high quality for a short series (it’s certainly not a show which looks like it was animated in Flash), with detailed backgrounds and colourful character designs.  There’s no dynamic action sequences and the characters movements are kept pretty simple, but I was surprised with how good it looked in comparison to other shorts, even if it would be pretty standard for a full-length series. The ED is animated in a style which is reminiscent of traditional Japanese painting, which seemed apposite for a show about what could be called traditional Japanese spirits.There’s numerous different ending themes played throughout the series. None of them really stood out to me strongly enough to form an attachment to them, but it was interesting hearing different tunes to the same visuals each episode. The soundtrack mostly features some traditional Japanese music which suited the theme of the show.Overall, I found this series to be charming and generally funny. I’m definitely glad I checked it out!

People is not giving it much appreciation!Story: 5/10I can give a 5 at most since there is not much a of story behind this short anime.Its about a boy called Kitarou with supernatural senses, who gets kicked out of his household and suddenly wanders off and becomes the master of a youkai home. The show features his daily encounters with different youkais and his interactions with them.I strongly believe that the story could have been more strongly improved with some good twist here and there but sadly its...just meant to be a feel good comedy show which becomes the main weakness for this show.Art: 7/10What I can give credit to this show is that the animation was pretty well done for just a short 4 mins anime. This was the main drive for me to actually finish this anime. I really loved the art style and in a way, I could see that there was earnest effort by the animators and producers in trying to give some ambiance and life to the anime.Sound:6/10The anime only has ending themes but it varies throughout the 12 episodes run. About 4 or 5 were used i think? I liked the variation to the songs, there were quite catchy in a way but still it sounded a bit too electronic so It was just decent for me. The background music for anime was okay, nothing special as well.Character: 6/10All the characters in the show are somehow the usual cast of a slice of life show. You have the tsundere chracters, moe ones, abusive ones , pervy ones. Lets just say they are pretty generic but for me they were fine since It was just 4 minutes and seeing some funny and wacky interactions between main character kitarou and his youkai companions such as a cute zashiki warashi, a kitsune( fox), a yuki onna. For me it was pretty peaceful to watch their fun interactions even for a just a few minutes.Summing Up:Overall, this anime gets a 6/10 for me. I feel that if the anime had a longer run time, some very interesting story could have been churned out for it but sadly that was not the case. But nevertheless, I found it to be a rather fine watch, nothing special, nothing to hate about it as well.The best thing about it is the great art style which makes the show quite watchable. So if u have time to spare, this anime can certainly fill up some of it. 48 mins at most spent on this anime, u can minus 10 to 12 minutes if u want to skip the ending song, well thats just a good 36 minutes to finish this short anime.Thats it for my appreciation of this anime! Ta Ta! just meant to be a feel good comedy show which becomes the main weakness for this show.Art: 7/10What I can give credit to this show is that the animation was pretty well done for just a short 4 mins anime.

Ta Ta!', ""*Spoiler Free*Enjoyment Rating: 7Kiitarou Shounen no Youkai Enikki, or Kiitaro's Yokai Picture Diary, is a short and straightforward anime. If you're into watching short time duration anime and increasing your anime list entries, then here is an anime for you. As one can expect from the title alone, the anime is about meeting and interacting with yokai (supernatural monsters, spirits, and demons from Japanese folklore). Don't be fooled by the first episode or first half of the series, this anime is laid back and somewhat dull but there is some good story by the end.*Story Rating: 7As anyone can expect from a four minute episode...duration anime series, there isn't much that this series is able to expand on since the main goal of the anime is to bring up a new yokai each episode. Personally, I found the first half of the anime to be very dry and dull even though the anime attempts to introduce new and different stories each episode. Still, by the end of this anime I found it to be satisfying to watch. The second half of the anime contained more plot and development as it concluded on an end that most people would expect from a human-yokai relationship anime.*Art and Sound Ratings: 6.5There was not much to this anime that I personally found unique. Sound did not stand out very much for me. In terms of art, I found the female characters (when in their human forms) to be the eye catchers of this anime. My favorite character art design was for Yukimusume.*Character Rating: 6For a very short anime, it's to be expected to see countless static characters that get little development. Still, I think this anime chose the more unique types of characters from the cliche character tropes found in most anime. Although screen time distribution was short, I feel like this anime focused a good amount on characters that the creators knew would be most popular with audiences.*Overall Rating: 7I personally give this anime an overall rating of 7. The shift during the second half of this anime was the main factor that influenced my decision to give this anime not a 6 but a 7. It's a good anime to binge watch if you want something short and to put as an entry on your anime list. Enjoy the comedic moments shared by the more prominent yokai and the protagonist near the end. duration anime series, there isn't much that this series is able to expand on since the main goal of the anime is to bring up a new yokai each episode.

Each episode Kiitarou runs into a yokai or two, we get a snippet of info about that specific yokai with some slapstick thrown in. Episode ends.In a void this show is ok... But if you know what it is this will downgrade it to abysmal.What it really is can be seen in the name and character design. This is a knockoff of a Japanese classic manga and anime (Gegege No Kitaro) down to the MC having the same clothes, hair cut, yokai radar...strand of hair.Up until the last anime adaptation of the show in 2018 - 2020 (this was the 6th adaptation, the show has been going on since the 60s!) Kitaro was known to be creepy and kindda ugly or malformed so the show makes a point of saying ""oh no, I\'m the handsome Kitarou.""If it had something to say that would have still been ok but it\'s really creatively bankrupted to were it just distills things from the old show into five minute vignettes without context or reason to cash in on characters recognition. strand of hair.Up until the last anime adaptation of the show in 2018 - 2020 (this was the 6th adaptation, the show has been going on since the 60s!)

It\'s neither kan (complete) nor zen (whole).Really, the only reason you want to watch this movie is just for the first 10 minutes of the movie which provides new background content that helps set the plot of the anime series. Beyond that, the movie is a just a horrible compilation of the series with emphasis on the action and aerial dogfighting. Cutting a nearly-four-hour series and trimming it into half  the runtime is not exactly the...best move if the aim is to create a compilation.If your aim is to get into the series for the first time, just watch the first 10 minutes of the Kanzenban movie and then proceed directly to the first episode of the TV series. best move if the aim is to create a compilation.If your aim is to get into the series for the first time, just watch the first 10 minutes of the Kanzenban movie and then proceed directly to the first episode of the TV series.']"
Lu Shidai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31233/Lu_Shidai,"['This anime has potential but the poor quality of the art, animation, voice acting and the bad pacing makes it not as enjoyable. It has potential but it still needs a lot of polishing. I could see people watching this but it\'s subpar when compared to other anime of the same style and it doesn\'t bring much new to the table.The scenes were made by different people so you sometimes get really nice drawn art and sometimes you get something hideous. Besides that the constant change in art style is very distracting in my opinion.For not being Japanese it really tries to copy the style...of main stream Japanese animation and style of comedy but it falls short due to the incorrect timing and relatively bad voice acting.Besides the art style the pacing is what bothers me the most it\'s hyper all the time and the lack of pauses where they should be makes one go crazy or lose attention and makes the delivery of some jokes that requires normal speed development with fast punchline, fail.The is no good ambience or proper set up of the scenes due to the fact it\'s so hyper and that it lacks the ambient music to set the tone.Character designs besides the main character are statically good but there is no char development which wouldn\'t be much of a problem on a comedy/parody anime except that it doesn\'t justify the unique design of some characters which lets you wondering why is this character dress in this way; why this character is x when they are all ""y"". of main stream Japanese animation and style of comedy but it falls short due to the incorrect timing and relatively bad voice acting.Besides the art style the pacing is what bothers me the most it\'s hyper all the time and the lack of pauses where they should be makes one go crazy or lose attention and makes the delivery of some jokes that requires normal speed development with fast punchline, fail.The is no good ambience or proper set up of the scenes due to the fact it\'s so hyper and that it lacks the ambient music to set the tone.Character designs besides the main character are statically good but there is no char development which wouldn\'t be much of a problem on a comedy/parody anime except that it doesn\'t justify the unique design of some characters which lets you wondering why is this character dress in this way; why this character is x when they are all ""y"".']"
Ling Yu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36291/Ling_Yu,"[""So my Review is  overrated 10/10 . I will mention some flaws but i have taken it out of the scores. My genuine score is a 7.5/10.This is like a gem of an anime hiding here . I don't really do anime reviews but since this one lacks it i am gonna write a brief review for new comers to know if this worth a watch.Just to begin with this is a anime about cultivation yes and romance although i am not sure if they will make it harem or just leave it at multiple love interest. i hope its the latter. The light...novel was a full on Harem with multiple marriages (not a fan of this genre personally).It does skip a lot from the web novel but i think thats really good , cause the novel is just to long to make an anime off with every detail. This comes from a person who has completely finished reading the light novel so you will have to trust me on that.To point out the novels story begins from even a different point of time and the anime begins from somewhere entirely different.Novel Spoiler****And according to novel Qin Lie and Ling Yu Shi are married at the beginning but separated.Spoiler End***The things i like include that i like the the modified story (at least into 3rd season).I really like the music and sounds.Chinese voice are not bad and effort has been put into it.I think the most it lacks is length of an episode is to short to begin with out 15 min(length of the ep is like 10 min). It makes sense because longer animations take far too much money and time to make.A lot of people complained that the story is to hard to follow if you dont know the web novel. Its hard for me to write from that prospective but i feel the authors are trying to build the world. And actually am glad they have not really build the world just yet , as the web novel consist of a lot of worlds and they can only pick one of the worlds and make an anime out of it. Which perhaps is leading to a flaw of plot holes.I love the fact that they make the story fast and a lot of action is included with that romance obv.

It makes sense because longer animations take far too much money and time to make.A lot of people complained that the story is to hard to follow if you dont know the web novel. Its hard for me to write from that prospective but i feel the authors are trying to build the world. And actually am glad they have not really build the world just yet , as the web novel consist of a lot of worlds and they can only pick one of the worlds and make an anime out of it. Which perhaps is leading to a flaw of plot holes.I love the fact that they make the story fast and a lot of action is included with that romance obv.

Another anime where toxic female lead is a must. Ruining every single anime they appear in.Sadly it is rare to see writers make a good plot. Dont understand why it is required that the male lead gets put down by some trashy female, wanting a relationship and therefore treats him like garbage. Is there any realistic scenario where that happens? A guy falling for a woman cos she a bitch.Usually donghua treats the lead better than the japanese authors.Please someone explain why he it is impossible for a female lead to be nice towards him... ', ""Before I go onto the actual review, I'd like to quickly mention that this is probably not something that you should be watching if you have photosensitive epilepsy. There's lots of instances of high-speed flashing visual effects in this anime that I found extremely irritating, with the worst instance being in the intro where there is red and white flashing.Ling Yu's story is very hard to follow as it doesn't give much of any background as to what's happening, to the point where it almost feels you're watching the 2nd season of this show while skipping the first. Everything also moves way too fast (likely...due to the episodes being so short) and this also makes things more confusing. This show really felt like it could've used one or two extra episodes to set everything up.There also doesn't feel like there's much if any character development, again probably the fault of the short episode length and total episode count. Maybe the only character who I'd say changes at all over the duration of the show is Tang Siqi, but even then she barely changes at all.Then there's the visual effects, which I've already talked about at the very start of this review. The lightning in the show flashes in a way that frankly sometimes hurts to look at. Instead of doing something that could be tolerable, like having the lightning be full opacity one frame and then slightly transparent the next or something similar to that, you have brightly coloured lightning that's at full opacity one frame, and gone the next.All in all, Ling Yu was frankly kind of disappointing.

This one is about some mysterious tablets, Hitler, New York, and ancient gold from Babylon. And aliens. Before I get into what\'s bad about this movie, there\'s always something worth the watch in every single Lupin special. Something about every single Lupin...special or movie will make you laugh out loud and this one was no different.ANIMATION: The cons? This is such an old school cartoon. Complete with random stuff popping up with zero explanation, suspension of belief, and hokey, Road Runner and Coyote style gags. Another con was the art. The animation is not great and I can see why it was never released in America.Even worse was the story. In the start, Lupin and Zenigata essentially put on a show for every American tourist stereotype ever in the audience. There\'s a motorcycle race between the two of them that goes in and around this giant face decoration thing. This lasts for almost 15 minutes (no exaggeration). I feel like there just wasn\'t enough effort made in making this movie.CHARACTER: The characters are horrendous. Old school, hokey, pink jacket era characters, story, and animation. We\'ve got pimps and a cast straight out of Sanford and Son. Lupin wears a ""hip"" version of his green coat. Then we get a full minute of an old lady doing a strip tease. And she\'s the most detailed of any of the characters in this movie. There\'s this scene with a Miss ICPO pageant in which the special manages to insult half a dozen countries as well as women in general splendidly. I don\'t know why I\'m surprised, considering how much Monkey Punch seems to hate women (I say this based on some of the main characters\' open sexism as well as the numerous rape and almost-rape scenes in the original Lupin manga.) Goemon has sliced all sorts of things in the past. Satellites in space from the earth. A water spout. Numerous clothing articles. Things that ""cannot be cut."" In this special, he slices a bolt of lightning.ENJOYMENT: This brings me to the enjoyment level. Suspend your belief, push yourself back into the \'80s, and don\'t expect much except easy laughs.

The story is essentially a bunch of set pieces strewn together and just gets crazier as it goes on. It never really makes any sense. What does make sense is that the comedy of this show is pretty great where things you'd never dream of happening happen, so it stays entertaining for as little sense as it makes.As for the animation, some of the...animation is reused in scenes but hey, what can you do. For such a silly movie it's amazing anybody bothered animating it to begin with. The sound is funky and fresh but not something super memorable. I recommend this movie if you enjoy the other Lupin the Third shows or if you enjoy a lot of silliness thrown at you at once. This show and Lupin the Third simply show that character and humour are sometimes worth more than a coherent story. animation is reused in scenes but hey, what can you do.

If you're a fan of wackier, more 'out there' Lupin stories, then this will be right up your alley. Personally, however, I don't much care for the zanier Lupin stories. The gags don't really land, and when they do, they only manage to get a small chuckle out of me. The subplot with the old woman and Lupin wasn't particularly funny or interesting, though the direction they decide to take her makes sense in the end.The art is consistent with the Pink Jacket era of the 80s....It's all over the place, and you'll be lucky if anyone looks on model for five minutes. One nice thing is that the characters personalities themselves are all consistent, and everyone acts like how you would expect. The usual cast of characters is very nice.

"Kyou, Koi wo Hajimemasu",https://myanimelist.net/anime/8560/Kyou_Koi_wo_Hajimemasu,"[""I see a lot of people raging about this series on the forums and the review section, so I'm here to give you my two cents.Kyou, Koi wo Hajimemasu is a difficult OVA to recommend. For newcomers who have never read the manga will find the first episode (and probably the rest of the OVA) to be confusing. Why, you ask? Because the first episode starts at the first major climax of the manga. Which I believe in the manga starts at chapter 15, so all anime viewers would be missing 14 chapters of background content of the first episode. If you do want to...watch the OVA be prepared to be completely mind blanked at some scenes.But this is the true nature of the OVA of Kyou, Koi. The OVA is suppose to cater to the manga readers and draw the anime watchers to read the manga. Which effectively worked for me again. (Since I dropped the manga and plan on reading it again for the second episode of the OVA.) How do I know this? Because the OVA was bundled with the ninth volume of the manga in Japan. So it was not set to sell to the mainstream audience, but only to the manga followers who continue to read and support the manga.J.C. Staff is at the helm of animating Kyou, Koi. (J.C. Staff is also animating another shoujo alongside Kyou, Koi called Kaichou wa Maid-sama. But Kaichou wa Maid-sama gets a whole TV series to go through the manga.) The art is decent and stays true to the manga, which was a good thing. Obviously, J.C. Staff did not plan on having a big budget to animate this OVA, because it was just going to be an extra bundle to a manga volume. But I was surprised at the background art, which were drawn very well considering the small budget they had to use.Soundtrack and voice acting wise, I thought were pretty good. Lots of piano/orchestra music fitting the shoujo setting of the anime. And Itou Kanae voices the main female lead in the OVA. Who is also know for doing Himamori Amu in Shugo Chara. Coming right from another shoujo is Namikawa Daisuke, who is fresh off the shoujo scene from voicing Kazehaya from Kimi ni Todoke. He voices the main male lead, but instead of playing a cheerful character like in Kimi ni Todoke, voices a rough serious character instead in Kyou, Koi.Overall, I did enjoy this OVA, since it was literally a copy and paste of the manga. Except with added color, voice acting, animations, and background music. But again what makes this OVA so hard to recommend is because it was specifically made for the manga readers and will be a total loss for the anime only watchers. So here's to me hoping that J.C. Staff will do a full adaptation of the manga if they find out the OVA did well. But I'm not keeping my fingers crossed, since it seems to be such a small chance.*Second episode of the OVA comes out bundled with the tenth volume of the manga, so expect that to not follow the time line of the first episode of the OVA. watch the OVA be prepared to be completely mind blanked at some scenes.But this is the true nature of the OVA of Kyou, Koi.

When I heard the manga was being adapted, I put aside the manga and said I\'d watch the anime. I\'m really sorry that I bothered.Story- 6. I couldn\'t even tell what the story was at first. It started with a  boy on stage, skipped to the main girl cutting his hair, then skipped to her...being madly in love with him and trying to make him smile. I guess in general, I got the drift of what was happening, but it wasn\'t anything special.Art-6. It was decent, but at a really special moment, they stop the frame like a picture, making it seem like they just took the manga pages and threw them on to a television screen. This sometimes happens in other animes, but in this one it happened more than once, so it got annoying.Sound-5. At first, everything sounded okay. The main girl leads voice sounded fine when she was talking and her face wasn\'t on the screen. Then, her face appeared while she was talking and I thought, ""That voice belongs to that face?"" It just didn\'t match. Music was simple, and ending theme was a dumb song thrown in with a bunch of manga pictures.Character-4. Girls who are in love with the guy first get on my nerves.

I remember when I first watched Honey x Honey Drops as an OVA (before reading the manga) and it was just smut, but after reading the manga I realized that's how it played out at first lol.Anyway, when I watched the first episode I was not happy that the first couple of minutes kind of just badly summarizes the first part of the manga. It...doesn't even explain Tsubaki's talents as a hair stylist, old fashioned feelings, or the challenge going on between her and Kyouta, but it skips right to the first real climax of the series. Alright...I want to complain, but the anime at least held true to the actual manga regardless of what is skipped. Even the second episode is fairly consistent with the manga and done fairly well.I loved the manga. This OVA is OK in my book compared to the other one I just watched. I don't love it, but if you've read the manga, it may be worth looking at, but overall, it's not a must see. It's a shame they don't do a proper anime for this manga. It would be a very sweet shoujo series, especially since this manga by Minami Kanan is strangely the least smutty LOL doesn't even explain Tsubaki's talents as a hair stylist, old fashioned feelings, or the challenge going on between her and Kyouta, but it skips right to the first real climax of the series.

I usually give *everything* a chance but this..  It's just.. I'll let my review explain to you all my feelings towards this OVA.Art:I found the art lovely. The usual Shoujo, but I loved it non-the less. The animation as well was nice. I love that kind of animation style instead of the newer style they have been releasing with the newer animes. But, this was probably the high-point of the anime. 8/10Sound:The Actor's that were choose for this anime...was picked well. I was content with emotions put in, the OST, and the SFX's. It fit quite well. 6/10Story:I was lost. Honestly, I believe this is suppose to be a love story, right? A story that takes a while for the main people to develop, right? Seriously. If it was, I am disappointed. The story was too fast paced and skipped way too much for my enjoyment. It had it's cute moments on it's short scenes. But, my main issue is that I could *not* follow what was going on at all. Which, I did not enjoy at all. So, this story was not enjoyable to me at all. 2/10Characters:Character's were cute. I'll admit it. But, because they shoved a season's worth of development into one OVA, it was too fast and skipped too much development as the story then. People like myself who never read the manga got lost to what was happening with the characters. I did not enjoy seeing them one minute hateful and the other loving just because they skipped important events threw the manga. I didn't like. 3/10Over All:Honestly, I don't believe it should of been an OVA either. My reasonings behind this is because that this was way too fast paced to fist into one single episode. I really didn't enjoy this because how much it skipped over too as I stated before. So, if you've read the manga and willing to watch this and piece things together, go right ahead. But, I would *not* suggest this to anyone who hasn't read the manga like I did. Overall: 4/10.Thank you for reading. was picked well. I was content with emotions put in, the OST, and the SFX's.

After a terrible first meeting, the girl fell in love with the guy sometime later but was rejected by him. What follows is a story on how the two eventually becomes closer to each other. The story is quite simple and cliche, but being a short 2 episode long, the OVA manage to flesh out enough story details to make the story convincing and watchable at least.The main highlights of these OVA are the still animation scenes which are rather breathtaking, artistic and...beautifully rendered but this are quite few. The same thing cannot be said on the animation with movements though as it lacks fluidity, the environment is somewhat bland and poor in details. The character designs are passable and likeable as it features narrow faces, pointy chins and hair lines that are too many which clearly indicates that this is a shoujo anime. In general, the production values are quite low.The OVA is kind enough to provide an Ending theme song which is quite good to listen and a couple of well orchestrated soundtracks which fits fairly well for overall mood of the story.In the character side of things, nothing much is revealed other than the fact that main characters are of good standing being honor students. Voice acting is fairly well done as it features well known voice actors such as Itou Kanae as the female lead Hibino Tsubaki, and Namikawa Daisuke as the male lead Tsubaki Kyouta.Overall, my impression of this short OVA is quite positive since I have a natural inclination on romance stories that are fun to watch and not overly dramatic.  ""Kyou, Koi wo Hajimemasu"" is quite difficult to recommend to other viewers because after a quick look around the origin of this OVA, I found out that this is actually just a bonus item for a shoujo manga bearing the same title so its target audience are the manga readers who have a good understanding of the overall story. So if the viewer is a manga reader then this is a highly recommended OVA, but for other viewers like me who haven\'t read the manga or have no intention of reading the manga, it is still watchable, just don\'t expect great things. beautifully rendered but this are quite few.

Very sweetly done :) - BEAUTIFUL "", ""This is my first review.Please note, i have not read the manga, so i shall be writing my review based on the anime i have seen.I have never been more frustrated at an anime in such a away- this had so much potential to become something more, yet it lacked that extra bit more.One of its major flaws was rushing into the 'major climax' of the story between the 2 main characters, Tsubaki & Kyouta. With no explanation or plot development, BANG, it's almost like the ending started before the beginning. To be fair there was a short narrative beginning, but it would have been...great to watch it develop, to see how it got to this point.There is little if at all any character development, so there's nothing to help explain the character's actions and what led them in doing so, which i think is a shame because it just turns into a typical romance cutesy anime, especially in the seconds OVAThe sound i thought fitted in very well with the anime & i thought the seiyuu performances were very good.The anime wasn't bad but it was really those still-shots that really stood out- beautifully made.The second OVA doesn't follow the OVA, and so they are best treated as 2 separate OVAs, so it lacks some continuity and flow. I feel like they could have done a whole season's worth instead of trying to cram so much, yet deliver so little into 2 20 minute OVAs.Ultimately i did like this anime, there was something charming about it that sucked me in.

It didn't let the characters build up. If I hadn't read the manga first then I would have had no idea what was going on. It missed loads of key parts and didn't do the manga justice.Second of all the voices were all wrong for me.... :LAlso (I'm only on episode 1) they completely lost the idea of her fixing hair and Sakura, her...sister!So therefore I thoroughly feel the anime is a waste if they only did 2 episodes!

It was very confusing for me (who has read the manga) in the beginning, trying to recollect everything that had prefaced the starting point of the OVA.Story (4/10): This OVA bounced around a bit, skipping over so much of the essence of the manga. Even stand-alone, the viewer would be confused and left and 20 questions of who, what, when, where and why. It was very focused on the dramatic element and that alone. They did try to have some flash backs so you got the idea of what lead up to...the scene, but it was still lacking.Art (8/10): Clean, clear and enjoyable. Really kept to the original artwork which was nice. Expressions and movements could have been better but overall it was acceptable.Sound (8/10): Seiyuus fit the characters really well.

A couple of comments in the movie makes no sense if you have no idea who/what the characters have been through or done.Enjoyment (7/10): I gave it a 7 because I knew what was going on and what happened before the OVA, so it was just like watching a few scenes animated. I enjoyed that.Overall: This OVA could have been so  much better if it was a TV series. The manga has deeper elements to it, and the interactions between the two main characters are lovely.

Natsu-iro no Sunadokei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/622/Natsu-iro_no_Sunadokei,"['So I was bored in a free period at school today and I decided to randomly go through MAL pages until I hit something vaguely interesting.  I happened across a page on the producer of this and saw this...it sorta piqued my interest, so I watched it.I am so happy I was bored enough to find this gem.Natsuiro no Sunadokei, in my opinion, is what a romance anime should be.  I really hate romance anime where the guy is a perverted idiot and the girls are stereotypes who throw their fanservice-prone-selves on him either willingly or unwillingly.  Thankfully, Kou has a brain...and a heart, and it\'s not a harem, although there are some light complications in the love web.  Obviously, they couldn\'t make a huge mess with only 2 episodes and an overarching plot about time travel, so I\'m glad they didn\'t try to overdo that part.The time travel thing is very well done--it shows itself and then doesn\'t overstay its welcome, letting time flow for most of the part where you would like it to.  This is the kind of anime you watch if you want to feel connected to a guy or a girl in love, since it\'s quite easy to do both here.The sound...well...the OP and ED songs are forgettable but the bgm is pleasant.  Voices are pretty good.  I must say though, this doesn\'t really bring down my score of it much.The thing that I thought was great is that, like the other guy who reviewed this, it didn\'t feel like ""just another OVA"".  I really felt like I didn\'t waste my time with this at all.  In fact, I don\'t even wish this were longer--in a good way, of course.  It didn\'t just leave off with a rushed ending or anything; it actually had a fulfilling end, and I won\'t say what happens because it rides on that, but...you\'ll be satisfied.

The female cast could be described as archetypal. We have got the main love interest who is the school idol type , but in addition is humble and shy, we have got the clingy childhood friend that has got a crush on the MC and in addition we have the antisocial athletic/ tomboy type who happens to be just introverted in fact. Other characters that get mixed in there to make the story work are: a biology teacher who for some reason knows stuff about time travel, that one fodder guy who helps the protagonist on any occasion and the most essential one,  the time patrol ditzy chick who accidentally triggers the entire plot.Having covered all the sections that make for a complete review, my verdict would be: if you have seen a lot of anime , this short title won't satisfy you in any way, unless you just seek to watch something time wise that is neither bad nor particularly great. If I would've watched this years ago, when my list contained 200 titles at most, this OVA would've received an 8/10 , but for now it doesn't get past a 6/10 in my agenda. the premise, but no revolutionary ideas involved in the process either hence why I gave it a 6 in this department.The animation is quite consistent for that time given and I could deem it as the highlight of the OVA, particularly the female designs are detailed and diversified according to their personalities; they even change their outfits over the course of these two episodes.In the sound department I have no complaints or praise words either, the voice acting wasn't gritting my ears, I appreciate that they didn't offer me a hard time wearing headphones; the theme songs are as generic and forgettable as they can get, so you can skip these at ease.As for characters, we have got a typical MC, he's the average guy who isn't precisely bland either, but just acts according to the quest he needs to fulfill: saving the girl he likes from an unfortunate future. The female cast could be described as archetypal.

Nekojiru Gekijou Jirujiru Original,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1062/Nekojiru_Gekijou_Jirujiru_Original,"[""Don't let the looks fool you, this is no simple children's show. While the setup is the same, this show has very mature humor and even a decent amount of death and gore. Anyone who doesn't mind somewhat dated animation and dark humor should be in for a real treat with this series...and it only takes about 30 min to watch the entire thing.Animation - 7The art is pretty old fashioned as well as simplistic since it's portrayed similar to a children's show, but I think it adds to the appeal. The simplistic style lets the viewer take in everything that's happening on the screen...easily, allowing for maximum enjoyment of the content. When comparing this animation to a show like Chi's Sweet Home, there is quite a bit of difference so I felt a 7 was justified.Sound - 10The sound is approached in a very simplistic way similar to the animation. The tunes are very simple, yet catchy and the sound effects combined with the background music does an amazing job of capturing the atmosphere and mood at the moment.The voice actors are really amazing in this show. Nyako's voice is just spot on to how I would expect a female adolescent cat to sound and I love the feline accent she gives to words like nani by saying nyani. While her little brother Nyatta doesn't actually speak much, he is a very prominent member of the brother/sister tag team and constantly chimes in with a timely &quot;nyaa&quot; to show his agreement with Nyako. All of the voice actors are really dead on and capture the character whether it be a bum dying in the street, a wacky old scientist, or a matronly mother. I gave a 10 for sound because honestly I can't imagine any part of it being done better.Character - 10While there really isn't any character growth to speak of, I don't consider this a negative since the show revolves around the interaction of a multitude of unique characters in short episodes. Nyako and Nyatta are very enjoyable to watch as a team. The duo is very curious which leads them into various situations which often become more and more wacky due to Nyako's easygoing nature and often very disastrous due to her child-like innocence. The father never actually says a word in the series, but his actions speak louder than words and provide many moments of entertainment. The same goes for Nyako &amp; Nyatta's mother who pulls off an aloof nature combined with the natural desire to supervise her children. She is very accepting when a woman throws dumplings in her face, but quick to admonish her children for giving pudding to a pig.Story - 8This series is comprised of several short episodes, each about a minute long. While there is no overarching plot, each individual episode is amazing considering how much is stuffed into it. Each episode focuses on Nyako and Nyatta and their experiences such as going to a haunted house, hunting with their dad, or stealing a garbage truck. Often these episodes show what happens when children apply the lessons they learn to the real world often with devastating consequences such as when little Nyatta believes the etiquette for taking a bath also applies when someone is drowning in a lake.Enjoyment - 10This show really appealed to me and its dark humor had a smile plastered across my face for the duration. The fast pacing of each episode means that there is basically no excess to be found, the fat has been trimmed and what's left is an ingenious combination of mature and dark humor that is only made more hilarious by the child-like presentation.Overall - 9 easily, allowing for maximum enjoyment of the content.

The duo is selfish and cruel, beating up anyone who gets in the way of their fun.As a result, these episodes often feature brutal mutilation and death, especially when the much-maligned pigs are involved. At first, this type of bloody gag comedy is fresh and funny, especially considering the cute and childish animation aesthetic.However, very quickly, the humor starts to feel over-used, boring, and worst of all, predictable. The first two times pigs get killed, it`s funny, but...by the twelfth time, the audience is sick of it. It`s almost like the creators had two really funny ideas, and then decided to use each one multiple ones, because they had nothing else. A one-dimensional joke can only work so many times.It should also be noted that Nekojiro is 27 1-minute shorts. There\'s no music, and the simplistic art is precisely what appears on the database page. Those categories don\'t apply or affect the series in the slightest. Hence, overall, Nekojiru is one of the weaker brutal humor shows I`ve seen.If you want a black comedy with more variety, funnier jokes, and far more violence, check out ""Metalocalypse"". by the twelfth time, the audience is sick of it.

This appeal of deviance explains the popularity of ""Happy Tree Friends"". But that\'s not what Nekojiru is about.Childhood is not as sanitary as western media would have you believe. Nekojiru comes from a place that is thoroughly childlike and innocent. Children are morbid and curious, brutal and cruel, innocent and nonjudgmental. Children like to kill bugs, and ask...difficult questions. Children grow up with flawed adults and observe their world without a sense of right or wrong. Nekojiru shows the world unsanitized through the subjective experience of a couple of children. There is no judgment, only brutal observation that happens to be really funny. It shows real things without saying ""This is wrong"" or ""This is right"", and the main characters experience it in their raw and childlike (innocently horrible and horribly innocent) way. This sort of matter-of-fact voice is refreshing to me. At times it seems cruel and brutal, but really it\'s no more cruel and brutal than the reality of things, and, like a child, the show has no qualms about personifying those animals and/or unlucky persons which it later turns out were standing on the wrong side of the food chain and/or society. This curiosity might be called morbid, but on the other hand curiosity is innocent, and it is only from a standpoint of resigned knowledge that personifying a pig that is to be slaughtered might be labeled morbid. Maybe a dash of black humor and a bit of childish exaggeration.This work probably isn\'t targeted at children. Like most works worth a damn, it\'s not targeted at any demographic. All it is, is a real expression of the subjective experience of the world through childrens\' eyes. It\'s really kind of adorable in its childishness, and completely hilarious. All in all, it\'s more akin to Beavis and Butthead (in its observational humor. particularly in chapter 18) or Calvin and Hobbes (in its freshly subjective child\'s point of view) than to Happy Tree Friends.This show also has some really great delivery and overall voice work.

It\'s an everyday thing around here, with people dying and other evil deeds to be seen at sight.

You can get the “VR” experience of your life without spending hundreds of dollars for a device. There is no doubt that the future will belong to the virtual reality and with the anime ""One Room"" Studio Zero-G fulfills this dream even for us poor anime fans who are only willing to sell their other half of kidney for their waifu figure.After the first two seasons, “One Room” is finally back with a third season.

As a VR fan, I have a lot of fun looking at everything from the POV perspective. There is no question that this series is very special.

After two whole seasons, I think this has been one of my favorite ones. I really enjoyed the first arch of the show and how well it developed its characters compared to previous girls.The art is always one step above average and it should be since the episodes are only a few minutes long.The sound choices were not distracting and pleasing to listen to when they were the focus.There was a...surprising amount of character development for a short show.I enjoy these episodes because they are unique.Overall I would give this season an 8. No other show does something like this and perceivers in developing this genre. surprising amount of character development for a short show.I enjoy these episodes because they are unique.Overall I would give this season an 8. No other show does something like this and perceivers in developing this genre."", ""The first forum post on this season was about how unexpected it was, and people agreed. However, if you read my season 2 review you would have known this to be completely expected and only inevitable. The One Room franchise returns for its 3rd instalment, with zero g remaining at the helm of bringing kantoku's work to life. The franchise could be perceived as being many romantic stories throughout Japan, but given its self insert POV nature, i cannot do this. Thus, at the end of the review I have created the official 100% accurate One Room chronological watch order, based on 0 evidence. Before...we get there, the new season gave us 5 girls as opposed to the usual 3, lets run through them (spoilers of course):Kotokawa Akira: The opening arc brings us back in time to our school days, with fellow gardening club member Akira. A blonde girl with an accent, Akira struggles at making friends due to her parents occupations moving them all around the country. The time we share with Akira growing carrots and being stuck in school during a storm together might just lead to a blossoming relationship. Watch to find out ofcMomohara Natsuki: The lolicons were well happy with this, imouto returns after being absent during the second season. You return to your family home briefly for a catch up with your imouto, who is the same as ever. The episode ends with her discussing the possibility of moving in with you in Tokyo in 1 years time, so mayyybe see you in s4 for that one.Nanahashi Minori: We are reunited with another previous cast member for a singular ep, Minori and yourself running the hot springs for a day while her father/grandfather are away. another nice little catch up to show that one room doesn't forget its cast.Orisaki Saya: The second new cast member of this instalment, Saya is introduced as a drunk, lonely office worker who wakes up hungover in your bed. This arc takes place back when we are applying for university, so she offers to tutor us. The arc focuses on her help, but also her two large distractions we cant help but notice. This arc was an eye tracker challenge i'm sure we all failed, but she was fun.Hanasaka Yui: The face of the franchise, the one that opened its first season and concludes its 3rd. Yui returns and is now working, which shows the time difference between S1 of her applying to uni, and S2 being her uni arc. Our relationship with Yui has come far, with her even banging out some super flirty cards for couples. The season concludes with you and Yui being married, and finally leaving your One Room, the room that has seen so much over these few years, this could truly be the conclusion of the franchise.You: As per, gotta review our development. We are certainly improving, but still oggling like a madness. With a heightened focus on romancing all the girls this season, as opposed to 1 or 2 in the previous instalments, its safe to say we're a bit of a harem protag. The final ED card of Saya's arc displays this perfectly, as it would appear (spoilers) we Smashed (but considering Yui exists, we dashed too). The final arc shows we have grown into a proper man, a husband and a father. Big up us one last time.Art- The art remains great, still easily recognisable as a Kantoku work and Zero-g do well to maintain the consistency of the style typhoon graphics and themselves had previously presented, and having consumed every Zero-G anime (bar idolmaster chibi), its safe to say visually this remains one of their best.Sound- Again, the same remarks i made in the S1 and S2 reviews could be made here, with the ED songs being largely forgettable (even moreso due to 2 of them only appearing once), but the voice acting was great, with the new voices, especially Saya's, being made perfect for their characters and is near unrecognisable to some of the voice actors previous works.Enjoyment- 10Overall- The 3rd instalment of the one room franchise remains true to itself, with a more overt and intense focus on romantic developments, while continuing to elicit bonk behaviour and cringe across the globe. But is this the finale? Natsuki appeared to suggest it is not, but the final ep would serves well as the conclusion of the franchise. Should they make another and continue with this current 5 girl format, I could see one arc for imouto 1 year older (perhaps even meeting our wife Yui), 2 eps being allocated for catching up with Moka from S1 and Mashiro from S2, the next 4 going to a new girl at your place of work and obviously rounding off with Yui, focusing on parenthood and work. However should this be it, i have no regrets, and the franchise capped off with an actually good finale. And finally, the watch order :1 Akira- 2nd/3rd year of highschool2 Saya- applying for uni, so end of highschool3- Minori (S2+S3) job while at uni (she's a high schooler so this age is the max before you're self inserting as a nonce)4- Moka- idk where to put her tbh, but i feel uni age is good5- Yui (S1)- you're still at uni, helping Yui enter6- Yui (S2)- You've graduated and work, Yui at uni7- Imouto (S1+S3)- she visits while you're a working man, you visit her after8- Yui (S3)- both workers, married10- Mashiro- Lavish apartment block not the same as before, must be where us and Yui moved to in s3, so this is the last girl.You know this was helpful. we get there, the new season gave us 5 girls as opposed to the usual 3, lets run through them (spoilers of course):Kotokawa Akira: The opening arc brings us back in time to our school days, with fellow gardening club member Akira.

Big up us one last time.Art- The art remains great, still easily recognisable as a Kantoku work and Zero-g do well to maintain the consistency of the style typhoon graphics and themselves had previously presented, and having consumed every Zero-G anime (bar idolmaster chibi), its safe to say visually this remains one of their best.Sound- Again, the same remarks i made in the S1 and S2 reviews could be made here, with the ED songs being largely forgettable (even moreso due to 2 of them only appearing once), but the voice acting was great, with the new voices, especially Saya's, being made perfect for their characters and is near unrecognisable to some of the voice actors previous works.Enjoyment- 10Overall- The 3rd instalment of the one room franchise remains true to itself, with a more overt and intense focus on romantic developments, while continuing to elicit bonk behaviour and cringe across the globe. But is this the finale? Natsuki appeared to suggest it is not, but the final ep would serves well as the conclusion of the franchise. Should they make another and continue with this current 5 girl format, I could see one arc for imouto 1 year older (perhaps even meeting our wife Yui), 2 eps being allocated for catching up with Moka from S1 and Mashiro from S2, the next 4 going to a new girl at your place of work and obviously rounding off with Yui, focusing on parenthood and work. However should this be it, i have no regrets, and the franchise capped off with an actually good finale. And finally, the watch order :1 Akira- 2nd/3rd year of highschool2 Saya- applying for uni, so end of highschool3- Minori (S2+S3) job while at uni (she's a high schooler so this age is the max before you're self inserting as a nonce)4- Moka- idk where to put her tbh, but i feel uni age is good5- Yui (S1)- you're still at uni, helping Yui enter6- Yui (S2)- You've graduated and work, Yui at uni7- Imouto (S1+S3)- she visits while you're a working man, you visit her after8- Yui (S3)- both workers, married10- Mashiro- Lavish apartment block not the same as before, must be where us and Yui moved to in s3, so this is the last girl.You know this was helpful.""]"

What do you do?A: Call the cops to come and help?B: Call an adult to come and help?C: Call your other friend who is in a wheelchair to come and help?If your answer is C, then you will probably love this movie. If it isn\'t then you will probably enjoy watching this show to laugh at other dumb things the characters did.2: You find your stabbed girlfriend on the streets in the arms of your best friend (not in that way, get...your minds out of the gutter). Your girlfriend is losing blood and your friend who can\'t walk (because he is a cripple but is still trying to carry her and save her) is holding her too tightly. What do you do?A: Rush over and help carry her?B: Call an ambulance?C: Ask your friend in an angry voice why he is holding his girlfriend like that?If your answer is C, then you will probably love this movie. If it isn\'t then you will probably enjoy watching this show to laugh at other dumb things the characters did.Ni No Kuni is as cliche and over dramatic as it gets. So much so that I called every single plot point and surprise twist reveal. Cliche doesn\'t necessarily mean bad, but it does lead to a lack of enjoyment when you have seen everything it does done better in other movies. Nothing is really bad but nothing is really good either besides for the art. It will entertain kids though and that is enough. This movie was made by an animator employee of Studio Ghibli, Momose Yoshiyuki, and while you can tell that by the animation and sound (by another Ghibli employee), it fails to do what most Miyazaki films do, and that is to touch your heart. That is probably because of the generic script from Akihiro Hino. The script is definitely the falling point of this movie.Story:Ni No Kuni is about two friends named Yusuke (Yuu) and Haru who both like a girl named kotona who suddenly gets stabbed and when they to rescue her they end up in the middle of traffic and get transported to a fantasy world. The only difference is that they got transported before they got hit by a vehicle. In this world they find that there is a princess named Astrid who looks like their Kotona and is in critical condition just like her and they need to try to figure out the connection between the two girls and the two worlds, and they need to find a way to save both of them since they are both injured.Art:The art and animation are the best things in the movie. It almost looks like a Ghibli or Ponoc film. The art is pretty and clean and the animation is smooth and explosive.  The CGI actually looks pretty good in this movie.Sound:Nothing of note here. It fits in and does its job but there is nothing memorable about it. It is slightly surprising since the music composer is done by Joe Hisashi, otherwise known as the musical composer for pretty much every studio Ghibli movie. The soundtrack is good and keeps me invested in the atmosphere of each scene but it is one of his weaker works. My personal favorite songs of his are ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (the Totoro song) and ""Carrying You"" (from Castle in the Sky). I saw the movie in English on Netflix and the dub was good. The British-like voices from the other world annoyed me a bit but everyone was well cast.Characters:There is nothing unique about the characters. they had emotions and names and faces but besides for one being in a wheelchair (for only part of the movie), there is nothing that I could say about the characters that would distinguish them from other characters. Haru was just a badly written character for most of the movie and the other leads were just generic characters with no motivations besides for protecting those they love.Enjoyment:While I can\'t say that I didn\'t enjoy it, I might have enjoyed it for the wrong reasons. I laughed at some of the stupid things that the characters did throughout the movie like what I wrote in the opening paragraph. There were a lot of other times that dumb things happened. Dumb, but entertaining to watch.Overall:I enjoyed the movie and that is what counts the most. But overall the movie just suffers from a bad script. For what it is, from the studio behind Pokemon, studio OLM, kids will enjoy it and it is for them that it was probably made. Unlike with Ghibli movies, this movie didn\'t have a lesson or moral to give over, and that may actually be its biggest sin.Score: 8 (Good and had some great elements, but I wouldn\'t rewatch it).I don\'t think it deserves an 8 but I enjoyed it too much (for whatever reason) to give it a 7. your minds out of the gutter).

The 2d animation was good but the CGI was downright awful. Models looked worse than videogames from two generations ago. It's hard to get into specific details without giving away spoilers but the world history and logic created in the games are completely shattered in this movie. The timeline is all mixed up. The story is often predictable. I think as a stand-alone movie it would be ok for someone who hasn't played the games but as someone whos put 30+ hours into Ni No Kuni 1 and 2 each this movie feels like an...insult that hurts my perspective on the series as a whole. insult that hurts my perspective on the series as a whole."", ""What we have here is Level-5's attempt at making a movie, and on the surface, it looks promising. Ni no Kuni is a game series that got started in the early 2010s, and it was famous for one thing: It was the first video game that Studio Ghibli worked on. No, really. Level-5 actually brought Ghibli on to animate various cutscenes and had Joe Hisaishi make the music for it. Needless to say, everyone who played it really liked it. I've been wanting to play the game myself for years, but it was on the PS3, which I could never afford. It did get re-released...on the Switch, so I wasted no time buying it, but I never got to sit down and play it yet. Getting back on track, Ni no Kuni eventually went on to get a sequel game and, as of last year, a movie with an original story. When I heard about the movie, I was really excited! But then I actually got to watch it.Good lord, I've been disappointed before, but this was just...painful. I really want to like this movie. I really do! It does have a lot going for it at first...and it crashed and burned. Hard. So what's the story? Well, it focuses on three kids: Yu, Haru, and Kotona, who are great friends and spend a lot of time together. One day, Kotona is stabbed by a mysterious pursuer. Haru and Yu try to save her, but when they're nearly killed in a car accident...they wake up in another world called Evermore. But Kotona is missing, and the princess of this world they're in happens to look almost exactly like her. In their quest to save the princess and find Kotona, they learn more about Evermore and what it has in common with Earth, but the friends' loyalty to each other get tested and strained when their actions in Evermore have consequences in the real world. Yu may have to make hard choices, especially when Haru begins acting strangely when Kotona's situation gets more complicated.Sorry if my summary of the story isn't that great. There's a lot that I can't mention without spoiling the entire movie in the process, so I'll try to hold back as much as I can. But man, do I really want to rant about this movie! However, I don't want to be too negative, so I'll go over the positive aspects of this movie first: The animation is quite good. The world's overall look is really breathtaking, the character designs are varied and interesting, the fight choreography is top notch, and some of the fight scenes were actually pretty clever in some ways. I also really liked Yu as a character. Not only is he NOT an overpowered bland isekai protag (And he has no harem. Thank God!), he actually has a backstory, has good chemistry with his friends, and is smart and competent. He could have benefitted from more depth and had more flaws, but I'm happy with what we got. Plus, having a main character in a wheelchair who is portrayed decently well, doesn't bemoan his disability, and isn't solely defined by his disability, is pretty cool. His friend/adopted sister Saki was pretty awesome too. She got some great moments in the movie, both in the real world and in the other world. I kinda wish we had seen more of her.Unfortunately, those are the only good things I can say about the movie, because the rest of it really doesn't fare well. While I admit I haven't played the games much, they delve into the world the kids go into in a lot more detail than the movie could even scrape, so what little we see of it is just kind of there. The setting isn't developed well enough to make its audience feel invested in it, even with the animation making it look as beautiful as possible. And that's only the tip of the iceberg in terms of this movie's many, many problems. With how well loved the games are, and how the movie is telling its own story, you'd think the creators would be able to do them justice and create an intriguing story out of it. Unfortunately, the movie is little more than a generic fantasy isekai movie, with the main kids trying to save their girl friend and the princess who is a damsel in distress. The villains are so cartoonishly evil that you'd think they'd have come straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon, and the real big bad is so obvious that you can tell who it is straight away. The whole movie follows the same story beats and cliches that have plagued other stories for centuries, and doesn't really do anything new or exciting with them.And that's not even getting into the characters. Other than Yu and Saki, every single one of them is extremely bland and one-note. Kotona's the energetic girl whose life is in danger, Astrid is the damsel in distress princess who tries to be more active, the main villain is the chessmaster manipulating everything who hams it up when exposed, but all of them pale in comparison to Haru. Seriously, watching him made me feel like the writers really didn't know what to do with him most of the time. He starts out as the cheerful friend archetype, then gets needlessly angry at Yu for little to no reason (Case in point: Early in the movie, when he sees Yu with an injured Kotona, he doesn't ask if he's alright or offer to take them both to the hospital, you know, like a good friend would. He yells at him for holding her in an intimate way, takes Kotona away so he can run her to the hospital, and JUST LEAVES HIM THERE! Knowing that Yu's in a wheelchair and can't move! Dude, what a dick!), his motivations are laughable and poorly developed, and he's constantly being a reckless idiot who can't stop to think (Which Yu actually calls him out on in the movie!). Any development he gets is really unnatural and rushed, like the writers couldn't agree on what to do with him. Honestly, as a character, Haru is the biggest dark spot on the movie, and the other characters, while slightly more tolerable, are still too bland to really connect with on an emotional level, since the movie's only under two hours long. There's a lot of characters to keep track of, and I think the movie would have fared better if it had cut a few of them out to give the writers more wiggle room to strut their stuff.Speaking of writing, I'm not even done with that portion yet. Late in the movie, a lot of stuff happens, but most of it is characters spouting about random plot points that were never mentioned before, are barely explored when they're introduced, and they just appear without rhyme or reason. Like, at one point, Astrid mentions that the only way to defeat a villain is some magic sword, but her father tells her it's been gone for years, and later, we see the sword again because some old guy gave it to Yu, who can activate it even though he has no reason to be able to do so at that point, and all is suddenly happy happy joy joy. Can you see how badly planned and written this sounds? Basically, the only reason the sword is even used again is because the plot demands it. Furthermore, there are a ton of other plot threads that get little to no deep exploration, such as an old man who Yu met when he was a kid. We never know his name, we never know who he is or why he's there, but when the story writes itself in a corner, he appears and gives the heroes the tools they need to save the day, and then leaves again. He's basically a Deus Ex Machina in human form, and that's not good writing. Seriously.I don't have much to say about the soundtrack, as its Joe Hisaishi, and from what I've heard, he re-uses tracks from some of the games. Again, I haven't played them, so I can't judge them on how well they fit into the movie, but I kinda feel like Hisaishi overused his orchestra to the point where the BGMs were so loud during certain scenes that they just got obnoxious. And at other points, the music swells and gets dramatic, then suddenly just stop. Oh, and the CGI made no effort to actually integrate with the animation. My God, close-ups of various monsters walking through rugged terrain don't even try to blend in with the 2D animation, making them stick out like a sore thumb, even worse than how Granblue Fantasy did it. It's jarring and takes you out of the movie. Think looking through a closet of all black clothes and a random pink dress suddenly flies in front of your face and blinds you. That's how bad it is. It's especially obvious when important characters, who are traditionally animated, are the focus of a scene, while obviously CGI soldiers flail around in the background, their limb movements all herky jerky and the texture so computerized that you can tell they're not even trying to make them mix with the scenery.So yeah, the movie's not great. It's poorly written, the characters are bland, the story is cliche in all the worst ways, the CG is terrible and makes no effort to try to be less jarring than it is, and any drama it tries to pull off comes off forced and artificial. But in all honesty, if Ni no Kuni had been just a generic isekai movie, I wouldn't have minded. It would have been just a generic but still serviceable movie...but then the ending happened. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is absolutely one of the most awful, badly written endings I've ever seen in any form of media, not only by just how out of nowhere the final twist is, but how little sense it makes, and how it completely spits on everything the movie previously established all for the sake of forced drama that didn't need to happen. Seriously, I haven't been this infuriated at anything since the Card Captor Sakura: Clear Card anime's just as God-awful ending, and this one stoops to a whole new level of bad writing. I mean, you really have to TRY to be that bad.I really don't want to hate this movie. I really don't. If the writers had made more of an effort with it and smoothed out all of its issues, it could have been a fine movie capable of standing on its own merits. Alas, what we wound up getting was a complete mess with a God awful ending that ruined an already flimsy premise to Hell and back. So don't waste your time with this one. on the Switch, so I wasted no time buying it, but I never got to sit down and play it yet.

Well, at the end of the movie I regret it.First of all, let’s mourn screenwriting. I would need a couple dozen hours just to talk about all the mistakes...of logic, coherence or just ways that a scene could be improved, that’s the magnitude of lack of work in screenwriting, I like to believe that they gave the guy two weeks to work on a one-and-a-half-hour movie’s storyline, and that’s why a teenagers’ fanfic of 100 chapters of the forbidden relationship between Naruto and Sasuke in the high school would have less mistakes than this movie’s.I’ll be superficial and direct, it is bad. The things that aren’t wrong are just unoriginal. It’s just sad how the budget of this anime got trashed solely by the storytelling. Everything else was kind of acceptable, even the story’s mistakes were forgettable, but in the near 1:20:00 mark the storytelling got downhill without control, like the script creator just gave up, maybe it was too difficult for him to rise the climax and then end the story, so he made it poorly without care or giving a shit.If you are the type of person that doesn’t care about the story being completely illogical, in a script building way, then this might be a good movie for you to watch, if not, don’t see it or you’ll end up like me: angry, sad and disappointed. of logic, coherence or just ways that a scene could be improved, that’s the magnitude of lack of work in screenwriting, I like to believe that they gave the guy two weeks to work on a one-and-a-half-hour movie’s storyline, and that’s why a teenagers’ fanfic of 100 chapters of the forbidden relationship between Naruto and Sasuke in the high school would have less mistakes than this movie’s.I’ll be superficial and direct, it is bad.

So when Kotona, a girl in our world, is about to die, it seems like the only way to save her is by killing Astrid, a princess in the other world. So the two main characters, Yu and Haru, go against each other to defend the girl they fell in love with.The first act is pretty solid, introducing the cast, the two worlds and apparently the main conflict of the story...set in trailers and whatnot. The problem starts when the second act begins and things escalate way too fast. In less than ten minutes of screentime, Haru and Yu go from best friends to enemies and go to freacking war against each other. It felt extremely rushed and poorly paced and really hard to believe those seemingly best friends could go to war with each other.Things only get worse when the final act rolls around and not only we get a giant exposition dumped into the audience to explain the true villain of the story and why everything was happening in the first place, but we also get a lackluster final battle and resolution to everything.Overall, the wasted potential of a more gray story where the protagonists must fight each other for a believable reason is lost, replaced with a very cliched and overuses narrative.Art: 4The 2D art and animation are overall decent enough, with the addition of some really bad and distracting 3D animation thrown every now and again. The biggest problem comes when characters have to move around, like in fights, which are poorly made and animated and very uninteresting to watch. Characters also felt very stiff and showed little to no emotion, either by facial expressions or body language, so they ended up looking like clay dolls with very poor movements.Sound: 4The sound design and music do their jobs, but there's nothing in there that catches your attention either. You will probably forget all the songs very quickly and sometimes even forget they are playing. As for the sound design, they are decent and do their job well enough, so no real complains there.Character: 2There are no interesting characters here, either because they have absolutely no personality, flaws, conflicts or are just plain stupid.Yu is a really generic and boring character, having nothing interesting aside from being unable to walk. And even that is not used fully, as upon arriving into the other world and finding out he can walk normally, he doesn't react at all to it, despite never having walked for as long as he could remember. If you watched Avatar (the giant smurfs one), you'll remember how Jake reacted when he, a disabled guy, first walks with his Avatar. And he hadn't spent his whole life unable to walk around.Haru is just plain stupid and I can't say anything else without giving spoilers. Kotona does nothing aside from almost dying, so we don't get to spend much time with her. Astrid is the only somewhat interesting character, yet she does pretty much nothing over the course of the movie.And as for the villain, he is really bad, only being introduced for real almost at the end, despite some very weak foreshadow to who he was. His motivation for being the villain felt weak and uninspired and came out of nowhere as well, so more negative points.Enjoyment: 2As I said before, the initial premise the movie hooks you with, two friends fighting each other for different beliefs, is a really strong one. Yet the execution of it is really bad and useless at the end when the third act begins.And this is more personal, but I hate it when the story lacks internal logic. Like, why wear armor if a sword can still kill you as if you didn't have it in the first place? Why make walls to protect you kingdom when someone can get a bloody rhinoceros-like creature to smash it without any trouble? These and many other moments take away my enjoyment way too much and become distracting at times.Overall: 3In short, this movie is a piece of hot garbage like no other I've ever seen before. It's less due to being a bad movie (which it totally is), but rather thanks to the utter disappointment I felt while watching it thanks to the very strong premise it makes you think you'll get. set in trailers and whatnot.

It's like, trying to be Ni No Kuni, but it is not.The 2D animation is good(as you expect when you consider it's heavily inspired by Ghibli's work), but the CGI is very bad.The sound is good, many soundtracks are from the original games, and...most of the time fit well.The characters... are complicated. I enjoyed them at the beginning, they made me want to continue watching to see how they end up, but it seems they became less and less important at the end.I felt it lacks a bit of exploration of the world, Ni No Kuni's world-building is fantastic and it makes you want to see how much this world is so different and magical, the different creatures and places. But this doesn't happen here, as it is almost kingdom and citie landscape and as for creatures, it has a tiny creature that follows the characters around, but it was completely unnecessaryI like some of the references to the games, life the flying boat, Evermore, King Tom, Oliver outfit, Mornstar, the puppet spell, and some themed songs of the games. It gives the feeling you're still watching Ni No Kuni, even though it doesn't look like it.Overall, it is an enjoyable movie, it is for sure flawed and misses some of the game logic so it doesn't look a Ni No Kuni film, but the characters are enjoyable and the story isn't really bad, just don't expect to be enchanted to this movie as you would be from the game story.

This nearly two-hour shambles of a feature length animated movie is, at best, a mediocre isekai. For those of you who are familiar with modern renditions of the isekai genre this should be off-putting as-is. If not please continue reading.This is quite frankly an absolute monstrosity of an attempt at art. The story is non existant aside from some poorly executed tropes mixed in with your standard quid pro quo of two best friends fighting for the same cause on two different sides; the resolution of which is...lackluster and abrupt to the point of rapidly removing the viewer from any semblance of suspension of disbelief that may remain after the first hour of drivelling nonsense.The art is mediocre at best, awful at worst. The CGI is jarring and poorly done. I won\'t dwell on this point, it\'s objectively lacking.The sound is the high point of the anime in that it doesn\'t actively cause me to want to gouge my sensory receptors out with a rusty spoon. 2/10The characters are terrible, cookie cutter ""no-one-knows-why-he\'s-one-this-side"" main character and ""basically the same"" secondary. The girl/main love interest serves as nothing but a plot device and is so underdeveloped that I finished this film with little to no idea of how she behaves or what she\'s like. The main villain is... there I guess.Enjoyment: no.Overall I give this anime feature length film a solid 1/10 because there are no 0s here. It is a waste of time. I have not played the games it is based on but to be frank I consider this and any other piece of art to be a work of art in and of itself and this is quite frankly a draft at best. Perhaps the fans of this game would enjoy it more but I am wildly incapable of justifying such a position as it is quite frankly an almost-two-hour void where a movie should be. It is terrible. If you have nothing better to do I suggest you watch a two bit hentai and at least get some form of gratification from your time because you clearly won\'t get any from this disaster. lackluster and abrupt to the point of rapidly removing the viewer from any semblance of suspension of disbelief that may remain after the first hour of drivelling nonsense.The art is mediocre at best, awful at worst.

In response you:A) Use the 3mo of time to test the theory before jumping to conclusionsB) Agree with you friend and go back to the other world...to save the princessC) Suddenly go into a fit of rage and vow to murder the princessIf your answer was C, You'll love this movie. If not then be ready to facepalm so many times that your face becomes a hand.Anyway, Not the best movie but great fun if youre watching with a friend and want to poke fun at a movie <3 It had good potential, especially with the ending. to save the princessC) Suddenly go into a fit of rage and vow to murder the princessIf your answer was C, You'll love this movie.

Sorry it\'s so long.tldr: This movie is not very good. If you think that this movie will be full of fun references to the games, it doesn\'t have much in that regard. I would not recommend unless you love the series that much.Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is one of my favorite games of all time. I love the characters, the world, the music, and of course the art. This movie however, does not encapsulate anything about the game series at all and leaves a lot to be desired. I know this...movie is not an adaptation of the games, but it tries to add a lot of references to the games so I\'m not sure I can count these as completely separate entities.Spoilers ahead if you care.First off I want to say that while earlier I did say that nothing encapsulates the games, however that isn\'t necessarily true as the art style really does feel Ghibli like. The reason why I gave the art an 8 is solely because the 3D elements are kind of atrocious. I am extremely biased against 3D elements in most anime, but in this movie especially they were super out of place.This section is a very long explanation of the plot with all of the major plot details, don\'t read it if you\'ve seen the movie, and don\'t read it if you want to see the movie.I guess read it if you don\'t fall in either category.Now let\'s talk about the movie itself. I actually don\'t mind the start of the movie with the main characters Yu and Haru hanging out with their mutual love interest Kotona. I just watched this film and I had to look up the girls name lmao. Anyway, Yu and Haru are supposedly best friends but it just seems like Haru is an asshole to this disabled kid, and he just puts up with it I guess? Kotona gets chased by a monster man and then gets stabbed. Haru blames Yu and then they get hit by the Isekai truck and transport to NiNoKuni, the other world. This is where the movie immediately goes south. This movie has very very strange pacing. So almost as soon as they show up in this other world, they are able to see Kotona\'s look alike, the Princess Astrid. Astrid is afflicted with this cursed shadow dagger than stabbed Kotona and then Yu just pulls it out and all is well. This kinda sucks, it really gets rid of this initial tension too quickly and makes me think that Yu can do anything. (Spoiler he can.) I\'m not sure why the writers decided to make both of these characters suddenly the most important people in this world but I guess whatever. I\'ll try to sum up the rest of the movie in the next few sentences so bare with me if I miss some details, not that they matter imo. So Yu and Haru become suspects of being these Black Banner guys and everyone believes it, so the two jump through some fire and discover they can travel between the two worlds. In Tokyo, they find out that Kotona has cancer now! Both boys are sad and Haru decides randomly that if you save someone in the other world their counterpart will die, when that literally has no basis whatsoever? Anyways, they get attacked by the stabber from before, Haru is sent to the Black Banner HQ and very clearly manipulated to become a dark knight general guy. This next part is fucking insane, so Yu is brought to the king and the high council wizard guy, and they say ""hey, you\'re probably a bad guy cause you saved the person that the bad guys are trying to kill."" He says ""no that\'s fucking stupid."" They say, ""oh okay then you should be her bodyguard so that you can kill your friend and that way you can prove that what you say about being from another world is true."" And then they just give him a sword and armor to protect the princess. Even with the big reveal at the end, this still doesn\'t make sense, but I will get to that later. Then the CGI monstrosities come rampaging through the fields and just walk through the walls of the city, why haven\'t they done this before...? A lot of people fight and the bad guy keeps saying to Haru, ""hey killing people is how to save a loved one in a way, don\'t forget, but if you do I will say this again in around 15 seconds so don\'t worry about it."" Haru believes him and starts to attack Yu, they fight, the lady connected to Yu\'s big sister is about to be injured, and because they are in danger from each other, Yu and Haru transport back to Tokyo. They are mad at each other, Kotona is dying of cancer at an extremely rapid pace. Yu suddenly remembers that his sister\'s soul partner is about to die so they run to where she is and protect her from the stabby assassin who turns out to be a big spider. Yu discovers something while fighting the spider and then their car plummets into the bay and they transport again. Not sure how the sister survives this but whatever. Finally the climatic battle begins. Yu says to the high council wizard guy, ""hey you\'re clearly the bad guys cause obviously."" He responds, ""no."" Yu says, ""Well I smelled the dagger smell when you grabbed my hands earlier so that proves it."" He responds, ""wait what the fuck magic has a smell?"" The princess then says, ""yeah it does you should know that, that\'s your fucking job."" He then pulls off his cloak and says, ""Haha it was me all along. You guys were so fooled."" Haru shows up and says he knew because the bad guy was fishy, except he blindly followed the bad guy. Oh also the bad guy is the bad guy from the Black Banner, and he also happens to be the rightful heir to the throne because he is the older brother of the King. The brother was mentioned like once and they mention the war that he died in like 300 times, but without any context, ""Beladon"" means fucking nothing to me. They then explain what happened to both this prince guy and Beladon. After that last bit of exposition, the fight begins, Yu gets stabbed, Haru and Astrid try to ward off this evil ex-prince wizard evil man but can\'t. Yu then is visited by the old man from the beginning of the movie, who is referenced by Yu throughout the movie because he knew about the other world and shit. It was an interesting allusion at the beginning of the movie because he was trying to cast Gateway, a spell from the game. This old man is wearing the same outfit as Oliver from Wrath of the White Witch. He gives Yu his walking cane and says that he finally was able to pass it down, and then goes back to the hospital where he started, even though he was desperately trying to get to the other world again. This cane is actually the great sword Mornstar that was destroyed while it was used to obliterate Beladon. Yu is healed of his stab wound, and he and Haru eventually kill ex-prince wizard man. The princess informs them that they were only able to travel to this world because of the evil guy and that the portal is their only way back. Yu wants to stay but the princess also says that visitors will die if they stay too long???? fuck this. Haru and Yu go through the portal, but at the last second Yu lets go and travels who knows where. Haru is back, he was in a coma for a month, Kotona is cancer free and as he mentions Yu, everyone forgets who Yu was. Then Haru comes to the realization that Yu was in fact, Haru\'s counterpart the entire time. He explains how that\'s possible and the movie ends.Okay so that was more than a few sentences. My bad. So my majors problems with this movie are the decisions made by each character. I don\'t honestly care that the plot was predictable. I knew from the start that the wizard council guy was evil, it was obvious imo.The characters in this movie have some of the strangest thought processes I\'ve ever seen. Haru immediately makes decisions that have literally zero basis. Everyone else besides Yu has like their own headcanon about how the soul link thing works too. Everyone just decides that, ""Yeah I guess saving someone means killing them in the other world."" Like what, why the fuck would you think that ? Every time you see people die in the fantasy world, they die in Tokyo! These characters just throw out all encompassing rules non stop and none of them are true, or they are just not applicable in the situation. Astrid\'s stupid fucking Royal Aegis is the weirdest choice in this movie. They explain more than halfway through that anything that tries to hurt her, is reflected upon the attacker. So if you thought Yu and Haru did it why don\'t you check for the same wound that she had? The wizard guy wants the magic that is inside Astrid, so he plans for Haru to kill her, not a bad plan, he would take no damage and be able to take her magic. Except the fact that apparently, nothing can kill her except for the knife that her dead mom made to stop her protection spell... But right at the end, Astrid is being squeezed by the Power Rangers giant version of the villain so that he can kill her. Wouldn\'t that kill him too? Would that kill her anyways? Why bring up the knife if it never comes back? What\'s the point of the protection spell if it doesn\'t reflect anything? Why would you try to kill the princess yourself at the end if it did kill you? You wouldn\'t get the magic because you\'d be dead!One decision that really is the worst is that Haru is a douchebag the entire movie. Not once does he do something on his own to be selfless or a hero, or even the protagonist. He is treated like the bully character throughout, and at the end, is suddenly treated like he and Yu were the same. No he\'s fucking not, he used his friend to get better at basketball, then ditched his ass, and then when his girlfriend is stabbed, he blames Yu for not doing anything when he was trying to call the ambulance??? Like my man is in a wheelchair what is he supposed to do? Also one thing about the wheelchair... why the fuck is his disabled in the Tokyo world? What point does it serve if he was actually from the other world and he can walk there? Why can he walk there but not in Tokyo even though he is from the other world? The villain isn\'t disabled when he travels to Tokyo, why is Yu the only one to have that problem? Back to the point, Haru is just a prick the entire film and the only thing he does to redeem himself is have Yu carry his ass to the end fight, and he steals the finishing blow. God just like thinking about how everything went down is frustrating, it feels like a fever dream.I think the writing of this movie is like very safe on the surface, except when they try to add in some much lore. Like I said previously, Beladon is mentioned so often, and the brother is foreshadowed too, but I don\'t know what they are talking about so I don\'t care. When they explained I still didn\'t care because it\'s so lazy to just relegate everything to off screen lore and then explain it in the last 10% of the movie. If they dumbed down the plot and the details, I think this movie would be not that bad.One last thing before I stop thinking about this movie for the rest of my life. The references to the games are pretty fucking lame. They mention a couple spells and show off a statue of King Tom, and the old man might be Oliver. That\'s it. If you\'ve seen Detective Pikachu, the references in that movie were fun to spot because they were abundant and each to find. In this movie they\'re sparse and hard to find at that. There\'s almost no mention of names in this movie aside from Gateway. Even the spell used at the end, Puppet String is just shown rather than spoken. The old man, who I assume to be Oliver because of the clothes and having Mornstar is a weird addition because how did he get to Tokyo? He\'s from Motortown and I don\'t know about you, but that doesn\'t sound all that Japanese to me.I really can\'t say that I enjoyed this movie all that much. I had more fun writing about it here than actually watching it. If I had to give it a rating, I\'d say a 4, because if you turned your brain off it\'s kind of fun I suppose. I kind of enjoyed the game references, but they weren\'t many. The only really fucking awful stuff was the CGI monsters and when I did pay attention to the plot. Sorry if I mentioned something earlier on and didn\'t expand on it, I\'m too tired to read through this. Hope you enjoyed, might write some more reviews in the future. movie is not an adaptation of the games, but it tries to add a lot of references to the games so I\'m not sure I can count these as completely separate entities.Spoilers ahead if you care.First off I want to say that while earlier I did say that nothing encapsulates the games, however that isn\'t necessarily true as the art style really does feel Ghibli like.

The princess informs them that they were only able to travel to this world because of the evil guy and that the portal is their only way back. Yu wants to stay but the princess also says that visitors will die if they stay too long???? fuck this. Haru and Yu go through the portal, but at the last second Yu lets go and travels who knows where. Haru is back, he was in a coma for a month, Kotona is cancer free and as he mentions Yu, everyone forgets who Yu was. Then Haru comes to the realization that Yu was in fact, Haru\'s counterpart the entire time. He explains how that\'s possible and the movie ends.Okay so that was more than a few sentences. My bad. So my majors problems with this movie are the decisions made by each character. I don\'t honestly care that the plot was predictable. I knew from the start that the wizard council guy was evil, it was obvious imo.The characters in this movie have some of the strangest thought processes I\'ve ever seen. Haru immediately makes decisions that have literally zero basis. Everyone else besides Yu has like their own headcanon about how the soul link thing works too. Everyone just decides that, ""Yeah I guess saving someone means killing them in the other world."" Like what, why the fuck would you think that ? Every time you see people die in the fantasy world, they die in Tokyo! These characters just throw out all encompassing rules non stop and none of them are true, or they are just not applicable in the situation. Astrid\'s stupid fucking Royal Aegis is the weirdest choice in this movie. They explain more than halfway through that anything that tries to hurt her, is reflected upon the attacker. So if you thought Yu and Haru did it why don\'t you check for the same wound that she had? The wizard guy wants the magic that is inside Astrid, so he plans for Haru to kill her, not a bad plan, he would take no damage and be able to take her magic. Except the fact that apparently, nothing can kill her except for the knife that her dead mom made to stop her protection spell... But right at the end, Astrid is being squeezed by the Power Rangers giant version of the villain so that he can kill her. Wouldn\'t that kill him too? Would that kill her anyways? Why bring up the knife if it never comes back? What\'s the point of the protection spell if it doesn\'t reflect anything? Why would you try to kill the princess yourself at the end if it did kill you? You wouldn\'t get the magic because you\'d be dead!One decision that really is the worst is that Haru is a douchebag the entire movie. Not once does he do something on his own to be selfless or a hero, or even the protagonist. He is treated like the bully character throughout, and at the end, is suddenly treated like he and Yu were the same. No he\'s fucking not, he used his friend to get better at basketball, then ditched his ass, and then when his girlfriend is stabbed, he blames Yu for not doing anything when he was trying to call the ambulance??? Like my man is in a wheelchair what is he supposed to do? Also one thing about the wheelchair... why the fuck is his disabled in the Tokyo world? What point does it serve if he was actually from the other world and he can walk there? Why can he walk there but not in Tokyo even though he is from the other world? The villain isn\'t disabled when he travels to Tokyo, why is Yu the only one to have that problem? Back to the point, Haru is just a prick the entire film and the only thing he does to redeem himself is have Yu carry his ass to the end fight, and he steals the finishing blow. God just like thinking about how everything went down is frustrating, it feels like a fever dream.I think the writing of this movie is like very safe on the surface, except when they try to add in some much lore. Like I said previously, Beladon is mentioned so often, and the brother is foreshadowed too, but I don\'t know what they are talking about so I don\'t care. When they explained I still didn\'t care because it\'s so lazy to just relegate everything to off screen lore and then explain it in the last 10% of the movie. If they dumbed down the plot and the details, I think this movie would be not that bad.One last thing before I stop thinking about this movie for the rest of my life. The references to the games are pretty fucking lame. They mention a couple spells and show off a statue of King Tom, and the old man might be Oliver. That\'s it. If you\'ve seen Detective Pikachu, the references in that movie were fun to spot because they were abundant and each to find. In this movie they\'re sparse and hard to find at that. There\'s almost no mention of names in this movie aside from Gateway. Even the spell used at the end, Puppet String is just shown rather than spoken. The old man, who I assume to be Oliver because of the clothes and having Mornstar is a weird addition because how did he get to Tokyo? He\'s from Motortown and I don\'t know about you, but that doesn\'t sound all that Japanese to me.I really can\'t say that I enjoyed this movie all that much. I had more fun writing about it here than actually watching it. If I had to give it a rating, I\'d say a 4, because if you turned your brain off it\'s kind of fun I suppose. I kind of enjoyed the game references, but they weren\'t many. The only really fucking awful stuff was the CGI monsters and when I did pay attention to the plot. Sorry if I mentioned something earlier on and didn\'t expand on it, I\'m too tired to read through this. Hope you enjoyed, might write some more reviews in the future.', ""As an avid lover of the Ni no Kuni series, this movie was dreadfully disappointing. They did a great job at reusing some of the game's original soundtrack, and the movie itself was visually quite nice to look at (for the most part) but the actual plot was terrible. The only reason I sat through the whole thing was because of my love for the games, otherwise I would have dropped the film before the 30 minute mark. The storyline eventually became so haphazard that I put the film on 1.5 speed just to try to get it over with.If you're someone who doesn't...care much for following a coherent storyline and just want to see people run across cool landscapes, then feel free to watch the film. If you're hoping for a worthwhile addition to the video game series (or even a random good movie to spend your weekend enjoying), then don't bother wasting your time. care much for following a coherent storyline and just want to see people run across cool landscapes, then feel free to watch the film.

Because they're equally dumb. Why a dude in a wheelchair has the be the one with common sense being a real hero while they make bad decisions. Meh. Loved Astra though. She was a highlight. She wasn't anything special specifically. But she was just a refreshing character. She was literally the most normal person outside Yu. The fights were good.

I did hate Haru from beginning to end, the only thing that raised this movie from 5 stars to 6 is Haru letting go...of Yu to let him live his own life, free of his annoying character. of Yu to let him live his own life, free of his annoying character."", 'Who dosent like dimentiontravling? I do, and if you do or not, i would still recommand watching this one!!!Story is Nice and interesting,And when you think you understand and figurer everything out of the story they strikes you down with the biggest plottwist at the end.With love, fighting, magic, Sword this movie has IT all!Some things i find a little weird and dissapointing is the power of the Princess. Like, where Did IT go ?

But besides the 3D models i really liked everything else, the backgrounds are good, the character design is nice and the way they did the wheelchair makes me happy because its obvious they did their research.However the main issues i have are about the plot, while...it starts very good and keeps it for a little, when is going to the midde and end part it...falls a little, the plot twist at the end (the one about the main characters) feels....rushed, too rushed, mostly because it doesn't really make sense in a lot of ways and after thinking about it i'm pretty sure they decided that without really checking what they stablished with the whole ''traveling to the other world'' thing.I won't say i'm dissapointed, but i was expecting a bit more since this is based on a ghibli property.Regardless it wasn't that bad, its a solid ''fine'' for me it starts very good and keeps it for a little, when is going to the midde and end part it...falls a little, the plot twist at the end (the one about the main characters) feels....rushed, too rushed, mostly because it doesn't really make sense in a lot of ways and after thinking about it i'm pretty sure they decided that without really checking what they stablished with the whole ''traveling to the other world'' thing.I won't say i'm dissapointed, but i was expecting a bit more since this is based on a ghibli property.Regardless it wasn't that bad, its a solid ''fine'' for me"", '*SPOILER WARNING**There are multiple major spoilers in this review don\'t read it if you haven\'t watched Ni no Kuni*The story definitely suffered do to lack of character development or even an explanation of what types of people the characters are especially Kotona the only thing I can tell you about her personality is that shes on the track team.Which isn\'t a personality trait....Another problem is that at times the explanation of characters backstories was rushed especially the main villains.In the middle of a confrontation he just stops and starts explaining himself.Nobody tries to take the princess to a safer location nobody tries to attack him they just stand around and listen to is story.The story of how Haru and Yu met was a bit rushed as well.Haru\'s character was also a big problem for me, of the bat when he sees his girlfriend ( with a stab wound keep in mind) in the arms of his paralyzed friend trying to help her the first thing he says is ""why were you holding her like that"".Not even 30 minutes into the movie and his ignorance is already showing.Not to mention he definitely killed a couple of people during the war in ni no kuni and when he found out he was wrong he didn\'t even feel remorseful he just shifted the blame toward the doctor guy.The ending was decent enough and I really like the foreshadowing about Yusuke\'s name when he first met Haru I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that after watching the movie.Last but not least the ending theme.I would not have finished the movie if I didn\'t know moil by Keina Suda was the ed.I was expecting a bit more from this movie since it was a Ghibli film but it was an okay movie over all.

Not unlike your other random Isekai, this time we have reason to follow our two MC, Yuu and Haru as the way finder to save Kotona and princess Asha.The story is about Yuu and Haru witnessing Kotona (Haru girlfriend get stabbed by random people). Haru who panic just try to lift Kotona and bring her to hospital, but because he got panic he almost get hit by truck. Luckily Yuu fortunate enough to save both of his friend but he and Haru got transferred to other world.Filled with unexpected event Yuu and Haru got separated from Kotona. So they decide to find Kotona but only find it Princess Asha is the splitting image of Kotona. Kotona get stabbed in their original world and the princess Asha got curse with curse dagger too. Coincidence? I think not. So what will happen if Yuu and Haru help princess Asha, find out by watching these movie.Even with your friends and experiencing the same event sometime we arrived at different conclusion.

The second half on the other hand left a lot of loose ends and added points that felt really contrived, predictable, and unneeded.If you have watched a lot of Ghibli films and thought to yourself: ""What other studios can produce movies that have the Ghibli feel?"" I would point you to this movie. The art-style, pacing, and dialogue are very reminiscent of The Cat Returns and Whispers of the Heart. It does use some more modern animation techniques like 2D characters in a moving 3D environment, but overall that Ghibli vibe was...present throughout the movie and it made it feel a lot more poetic.My more detailed critiques of this movie can\'t really be described any more without devolving into spoilers, so here is your warning.SPOILERS AHEAD (Mostly negative rant):What the first half of the movie sets up is an interesting isekai mechanic, a strained love triangle, and a flip-flopped power dynamic going between worlds. These ideas really cemented in my mind that if the film addressed these points and made some very nuanced character development, the movie would be an easy 8/10. Instead, the film decided to abandon a lot of those themes and ideas and instead wanted to use the power of friendship to slay the villain and sing kumbaya. To top is off, I wouldn\'t have cared really until they decided to throw a match in the house before leaving with saying that....SPOILERS.... The two male protagonists are actually the same person from the 2 different worlds... Why. I understand they have a lot of the same hobbies and liked the same girl, but the film establishes very clearly that the people that are similar between worlds look similar. These two have blue and brown hair, different eyebrows, and different eye colors.Another thing I thought was done poorly was how predictable plot points were. Villains are obvious villains, side characters will come in exactly when you think they will, and ideas that are ""subtly"" introduced are actually easily going to be the deciding factor in the whole ending showdown. When there was a lot more intrigue and interpersonal conflict in the first half of the movie it felt very unexpected and eye-opening at times, but since none of this was utilized, it makes the latter half of the film have no real meaning. present throughout the movie and it made it feel a lot more poetic.My more detailed critiques of this movie can\'t really be described any more without devolving into spoilers, so here is your warning.SPOILERS AHEAD (Mostly negative rant):What the first half of the movie sets up is an interesting isekai mechanic, a strained love triangle, and a flip-flopped power dynamic going between worlds.

This entire movie's script.Ni no Kuni is one of those shows that I happened to find on a whim, just looking for something to watch on a lazy Netflix day. I had no attachment to the game franchise nor have I even heard of anything related to it before then, but the description seemed like any trash Isekai that I can shut my brain off and still enjoy, but it turned out that even trash has tiers and unfortunately, Ni no Kuno fails to stand out even among the lowest of the low.Story (6.5/10):I wish I can...skip this portion entirely, we all know, it's not Ni no Kuni's fault, but the entire Isekai shitfest is practically the same, only with different names and powers.This story starts like every other, two friends travel between two worlds in order to keep their other friend alive, simple enough, but the complications really add a bit of sugar to this dull piece of work.The plot, however, feels a little more quirky and interesting when the threads are laid out, how the two main characters are related, and how their actions in either world affect the other. But it still was not enough to save it from its cliché infested progression that had me fall asleep mid of the movie.Art (8/10):I don't know whether I should be proud of the recent seasonal shows or disappointed in this movie, cause I'm trying so hard to note a moment that showed the slightest marvel animation but I can not. It was averagely animated, easily looks like any typical modern show which by the way is great in their own way, but for a movie? That was very underwhelming. The character designs look nothing interesting, very generic looking, and can be swapped by any background filler character without anyone noticing, not even themselves. Yuu, however, looks like your classic Ghibli prince and that's it. There was also a use of horrible CGI at times, but not too much that it completely ruined the experience.Sound (7/10):Nothing to complain about here, but also nothing to admire. Following the same steps of the story, it was not memorable in the least, the voice acting I thought was decent, the musical scores were fine but too special that sticks to memory.Characters (6/10):Again, walking out reeking of disappointment, the story starts out very solid for an Isekai looking at the characters and their motives, however, shortly after everyone just stops trying. Yuu is a very boring Mary-Sue type of character that feels like he's reciting a 1000 pages inspirational quotes repository, and Haru is a jealous end that tries to create drama and lengthen the story for the sake of it being long enough to be featured as a movie. Character development is very minimal, almost non-existent, and includes only Haru, as for everyone else, I've seen more interesting wooden planks in my backyards.Enjoyment (7/10):I can't describe this being anything more than average, so much so that I'm starting my own average Isekai metric system in which Ni no Kuni is the core of the measure. The premise is very interesting and holds a lot of potentials that it left me kinda lost in thought thinking of how the movie could have been if they did not screw everything up.Overall (6.9):No matter how average this movie was, and no matter how little I consider rewatching it any time soon or ever, I would probably jump back on it with a group of friends for how easy and simple to get into it and still grasp everything happening despite talking over every scene and fool around instead of focusing all of your attention on it. Other than that, if you're coming from the game franchise, that could be an entire another discussion that I'm not able to project. skip this portion entirely, we all know, it's not Ni no Kuni's fault, but the entire Isekai shitfest is practically the same, only with different names and powers.This story starts like every other, two friends travel between two worlds in order to keep their other friend alive, simple enough, but the complications really add a bit of sugar to this dull piece of work.The plot, however, feels a little more quirky and interesting when the threads are laid out, how the two main characters are related, and how their actions in either world affect the other.

It is a decent way to spend your time if you have nothing else to do but there are far more fun things to do.The character design immediately screams ghibli into your face, the bg and animation is rather good. You will definitely enjoy the visual aspects of this, even the cgi blends in well. Music didn't do much for me, although I feel this way in 90% of all anime.Let's get into the main parts of this movie though: the characters and the plot. I...would like to know why someone thought that the basic plot of it would make an enjoyable movie. Without spoiling anything: It's self insert isekai and the 2 male mcs like the same girl. Yeah, we all have seen this a billion times so what did this anime do to set itself apart? By making the characters act annoying and unlogical. What I liked about it was that one of the mcs is disabled, he's in a wheelchair and in the beginning it shortly shows the daily struggles involved with this. This was probably my favourite part of the characters/ story. After the interesting beginning it very quickly got very bad. All of the characters make absolutely nonsensical decisions, which could be excused it it was once or twice but it's almost as if they try to make it as stupid as possible. Once they get transported to the other world they just dissociate and seem to forget or not care about the things that happened minutes ago, instead they take it easy. This is where it just gets boring because we have seen this a billion times already. Also the one male mc is super strong and smart bc he's our self insert character. Then suddenly without giving us any believeable reason one of them starts to act even more illogically and the entire plot gets ridiculous. I am not someone who likes to drop shows, especially movies but at this point I was just on my phone and texting, pondering if I should turn it off. I stuck with it out of lazyness to get up and at around half or 2/3 of the movie it gets pretty good and interesting. I think this just seems like this because of the contrast to the horrible parts shortly before though. The ending pulls some kind of plot twist out of the hat that was not set up at all and felt really unnatural.To sum it up I don't regret watching it but I also would say that there are better things to do with your time. would like to know why someone thought that the basic plot of it would make an enjoyable movie.

And no, I’m not talking about the games—I’m only vaguely aware of their existence. There’s a particular sequence in the first half that wonderfully emulates that Ghibli-esque magic I’ve been craving for years; the film’s got that familiar art style, marvellous Hisaishi score, and engaging fantasy premise—all that’s left is for the writers to, well… write? Virtually everything is insanely rushed, to the point that I might assume that this is a recap movie for a long-running series. The story is rapidly pushed forwards by lousy exposition...and narrative contrivances, making the second half feel like it was written in a mere afternoon. All the pieces are there, but in a desperate attempt to tie them all together in a roughly 100 minute movie, no gaps are left for the story to breathe.

Pingu in the City (2018),https://myanimelist.net/anime/38262/Pingu_in_the_City_2018,"['Guess who’s back, back again? Pingu’s back, tell a friend…I guess we should start by addressing the elephant in the room. There’s a lot less hype and discussion around this second season then there was the first. This is by no fault of Pingu, but rather the fact that he’s seen as a “dead meme” among the majority. The “Pingu is 10/10” trend was misunderstood as a ‘meme’ by many who didn’t actually bother to watch the show. Once it ran through the traditional lifecycle of a meme, Pingu faded from public interest, despite the show itself not dropping in quality at all.True Pingu fans...are watching and enjoying this second season, and I would highly encourage anyone who isn’t to jump in with us. While watching the first season is recommended, this second season is a rare thing for second seasons of anime—you can start here too! Pingu and his family and friends are very simple characters who often engage in episodic adventures—as such, the Pingu franchise is a hell of a lot easier to jump into rather than something like, say, the Fate franchise. (It’s also a lot more fun.)A lot of children’s shows try new directions in later seasons. Some of them don’t go too well, such as when The Fairly OddParents introduced a useless baby, a useless dog, and a useless neighbor girl. Pingu in the City knows better than to try to fix what isn’t broken. Pingu is still exploring the world around him, taking the viewer on his daily adventures and exposing younger viewers to potential career options once they grow up. (That’s more than my school ever did for me.) Adult viewers are likely to smile and feel a sense of nostalgia, considering how well Pingu captures that familiar childhood exploration of an unfamiliar world where everything is new and exciting.In conclusion, while some unaware anime fans may be bewildered by the second season’s spot in the top airing anime this season, I would be willing to argue that this is, in fact, an underrating. Pingu in the City has maintained its comedy and whimsical world, keeping it open for all ages to enjoy. I highly encourage any potential viewer to give Pingu the true recognition that it deserves. Don’t assume it’s a “dead meme” just because /r/animemes moved on. are watching and enjoying this second season, and I would highly encourage anyone who isn’t to jump in with us.

In fact, one could say I am some sort of meme connoisseur, shitposter with endless stamina, collector of rare pepes, and in generally aware of all sorts of obscure coaxed snafu/moviescirclejerk epic. However, when I see one of the goofiest cartoons from my childhood rebooted and then turned into some sort of beyond childish and completely dull version of the original, I am not calling it the best thing evertz for the sake of lulz. Especially when it not-so-obviously is not it. --- I asked 3 natives if this if grammatically correct way...to present what I want to express here, and all of them said a different thing, but basically: it sucks.~~Story~~The story types are limited and highly similar to each others. Pingu is doing some newly discovered thingies that vary from painting to helping firefighters, and being very useful while doing so, but then he either a) fucks it up and tries his best to fix it, or b) alternatively some asshole appears and rekts his hard work in some way. Sometimes he himself is the asshole when he gets to boss around kids younger than him. It\'s pretty fun. Especially when watched once a week and the word ""fun"" being the opposite of what it really means.Some of the episodes feel like the first cognitive psychology test made to a few months old toddler where he/she is supposed to make a triangle, ball and square go in the right holes. The story writing can feel braindamaging-ly cringe. Some other stuff is far more reasonable and occasionally even entertaining. Typically it is just overly childish nonsense that has no appeal or charm.~~Characters~~Pingu is just being a real nerd here, getting interested over nothing or mad because someone teases him, only to become happy and go ""noot noot"" 2 minutes later. Real mood swinger this guy. The original cartoon Pingu was totally different and much more reasonable than this kid.Great many side characters are either teasing him ""ho ho ho Pingu you nerd"" laughing at him (not with him) when he does something stupid or alternatively laugh at him when he does an ordinary thing but doesn\'t fuck it up, unlike usually. Occasionally other characters get mad at him because he fucks something up, or just tease him until they change their mind and actually help him instead because friendship or something. Part of the cast exists for the purpose of cheap provoking just to eventually show that they are ""good guys"" after all. Nice lesson I guess, good thing it\'s repeated till nausea and has nothing new to say.~~Animation~~Some scenes are neato. I especially appreciate those scenes where our characters waddle away, waddle waddle. It\'s cute. The original cartoon was actually entertaining to watch and serves an adult audience as well with its animation trickies, but this one is just overly childish nonsense. It\'s real basic stuff, not fluid at all, really just a try hard attempt to stay inside a small budget and follow the safety route. Inferior version of the original in every way and offer practically no reasons to appreciate it.~~Sounds~~Noot Noots, inaudiable dialogue. Outside the waddling, the sounds are pretty much filler, Noot noots are practically the only thing keeping the series on surface at this point despite getting old decades ago and being the most annoying thing already in the original cartoon.~~Conclusion~~I was team Pingu during the Shingeki no Kyojin opening wars in 2013 solely because this version of the cartoon didn\'t exist back then. Now I would have to choose something else. The original Pingu is still entertaining to watch and doesn\'t have nearly as shitty characterization.

Part of the cast exists for the purpose of cheap provoking just to eventually show that they are ""good guys"" after all. Nice lesson I guess, good thing it\'s repeated till nausea and has nothing new to say.~~Animation~~Some scenes are neato. I especially appreciate those scenes where our characters waddle away, waddle waddle. It\'s cute. The original cartoon was actually entertaining to watch and serves an adult audience as well with its animation trickies, but this one is just overly childish nonsense. It\'s real basic stuff, not fluid at all, really just a try hard attempt to stay inside a small budget and follow the safety route. Inferior version of the original in every way and offer practically no reasons to appreciate it.~~Sounds~~Noot Noots, inaudiable dialogue. Outside the waddling, the sounds are pretty much filler, Noot noots are practically the only thing keeping the series on surface at this point despite getting old decades ago and being the most annoying thing already in the original cartoon.~~Conclusion~~I was team Pingu during the Shingeki no Kyojin opening wars in 2013 solely because this version of the cartoon didn\'t exist back then. Now I would have to choose something else. The original Pingu is still entertaining to watch and doesn\'t have nearly as shitty characterization. I am not going against that one, but this blows.', 'Although I have only seen some clips of the anime, what I have seen is simply beautiful. This sequel to the original Pingu clearly surpassed my expectations.Story: Pingu in the city is a beautiful slice of life, giving a very in-depth analysis of moving from the point of view of a child.Art: The show manages to faithfully replicate the art style of the beloved classic with CGI animation, showing that CGI in anime can look goodSound: Noot?Character: The main character, Pingu, is a very interesting character, the audience has a very easy time relating to the emotions he feels.Enjoyment + Overall: A beautiful show, you...should watch! should watch!', 'Review in brief:Pingu in the City returned in 2018 with more jobs, a more focused direction, and overall more heart. By better utilizing the strengths of its own quirks without overly distancing itself from the old claymation series, Pingu in the City has become a solid comedy, a great slice-of-life, and a proper successor to the original Pingu series.Review in full:Inevitably this review will see comparisons to this anime\'s first season and my review of it. To summarize, the first season clearly took cues from the old claymation series but was too formulaic and rigid (both in writing and in production values) to take full...advantage of its roots, its new setting, or its theme of urban exploration. There were moments when it took detours into more imaginative ideas and possessed a genuine charm, but much of the time it settled for being a fairly standard series of computerized shorts that only had stronger than usual characterization to separate it from any other kids\' show.Almost all of the above points are fully addressed in this second season. The whole season takes a looser approach to what it had attempted before, which is exactly what the silly yet charming kids\' show Pingu in the City was trying to be needed. The cycle of ""Pingu observes job, gets job, does job, has job-related conflict"" is broken down and recycled into much more dynamic approaches in getting Pingu to explore the jobs in his city. Sometimes Pingu takes jobs upon himself to solve problems he encounters, or discovers that something he had already been doing can be a job. Some of his jobs don\'t have conflicts and it\'s just about him mastering a skill or discovering multiple facets of what appeared to be a single task. His sister Pinga and his friends occasionally join him too, giving Pingu in the City a sense of community to help fill in the emptiness the first season struggled to fill.More importantly, Pingu takes on a much greater variety of jobs this time.  A considerable number of his jobs, ranging from working an assembly line to hairdressing, are unique to their episodes, even with the complete absence of some of the more worn jobs Pingu took on last season.  They often lead into one another too.  In one episode Pingu becomes an artist, the next episode he becomes the art itself! (no, really, it\'s one of the funniest episodes of the series).  Meanwhile the reoccurring jobs Pingu maintains enter completely different fields when they return, such as Pingu doing detective work, traffic directing, and patrolling during his stints as a policeman.  This variety gives Pingu in the City the exploration aspect it was missing before.  Now Pingu is everywhere he can be doing anything he sets his mind to, living out many a real child\'s imagination and dreams on-screen for them to witness.  Jobs aren\'t the only thing Pingu explores either, and this season doesn\'t limit itself to the city for long.  Pingu goes above, below, and all around his new home on what can truly be called adventures.Robby the Seal is no longer the only non-penguin in the anime, as Pingu makes a few strange new friends on his little expeditions, some of whom even come to visit him later. They aren\'t the greatest characters to grace the slice-of-life genre or even just this season of Pingu, but they flesh out the setting just fine. Meanwhile the returning cast is as quirky as they were before, and Pingu & his family get a lot of touching moments that really show how close-knit they are, something slice-of-life anime is often lacking in. Some episodes, like the one where Pingu\'s parents are sick, do more to flesh out the dynamics of Pingu\'s family than entire seasons of other anime in the genre. Through all of this, Pingu once again establishes himself as a strong main character who defines his show via his well-meaning impulsiveness; quite the feat in a TV Short series made simple for a young target audience.I still wonder why the ""city"" was emphasized enough to be put in the title when the whole show could have taken place in Pingu\'s old village.  Sure, it would be a little odd for there to be a fish cannery or the amount of cars & trams Pingu\'s city has, but it wouldn\'t break suspension of disbelief or anything close to that (the trams could just swapped be for buses anyhow).  Pingu leaving the city frequently makes Pingu in the City seem to spite the city it names itself for, and the anime improving itself by distancing itself from said city still creates an odd thematic dissonance.Even the production values got a subtle boost between seasons.  Though the expressiveness of the original claymation series\' animation isn\'t fully reached, this season of Pingu in the City gets closer than the last season by being looser overall and by using some of the old series\' more popular model poses including stretching while reaching for things and a squished physique for sitting.  The coloring is also more saturated, making the CG visuals look more like the claymation aesthetically and giving the show a slightly more fun-loving appearance.  While the sound quality is still merely passable, it is used more effectively.  A number of episodes center around the sort of lively music that would be at home in a city (perhaps the one element of the show I\'d say fits the city setting well) and other episodes noticeably present more fitting music/ambiance than the same three or so general-purpose pieces from the first season.  I still wouldn\'t likely listen to any of it for its own sake, but it\'s still a step up.Now, being a kids\' show first and foremost, I\'m not going to pretend that just about everyone 13 and older will have a blast with Pingu in the City (though I do believe most of you would like it more than you\'d guess by the cover).  The humor can be varied and quirky but is still largely simple and is sometimes predictable.  The plots are also simple and, despite each episode being 6 minutes long without the OP & ED, flow rather slowly to ensure that kids who aren\'t experienced enough with stories to pick up on tropes & complex cues can keep up and easily digest it all.  There are also a few dud episodes that are more comparable to the first season than the majority of this one (the jazz band episode was everything the idol episode should have been).  Yet most of the episodes in this season carry that distinctive charm a handful of the first season\'s episodes had.  It possesses that warm, tender essence that only a well-made slice-of-life can offer.  Pingu has been a celebrated claymation series, and now Pingu is also one of those rare slice-of-life anime that doesn\'t rely on moe schoolgirls and high school clubs to put a smile on the viewer\'s face, and that\'s something everyone could use a little more of.Verdict:Pingu in the City set out on a path of true discovery this season and in turn it discovered itself. At the same time standout and familiar, this season of Pingu in the City rises above the memes that saw it receive a bizarre 15 minutes of fame to become a hidden gem of a slice-of-life at a time when it seems those sorts of shows are stagnating away and being replaced with power-fantasy isekai and idol anime. There\'s some things it wouldn\'t have even considered doing as a kids\' show, but overall I can recommend Pingu in the City in its entirety knowing that this season builds up upon the last and the anime as a whole delivers something you can\'t simply be too old to enjoy. advantage of its roots, its new setting, or its theme of urban exploration.

Well, scratch that, what if they ended up enjoying it as much as we did, and so as a tribute, they produced a new season of the show. Several millions of years later, yet another more advanced life form arrives at earth and manages to get by the remains of the last inhabitance of our poor planet, and ended up finding out about the new season of Pingu in The city. Actually, scratch that, I way off topic I should just stick to the review.- Story (7/10):Fascinating how simplistic but very reflective are the problems discussed in this show. The episodic nature of the show remains as strong as ever with this season with a better topic to discuss, stuff like stealing, lying and all sorts of basic bad habits that the kids should be aware of and avoid are all adapted into their own respective episodes that go ahead and with a great effort show numerous examples of their causes and consequences and always ending up with a wholesome wrap up at the end of said episode.As we've come to know, all episodes are extremely short, spanning around 7 minutes including both the opening and the ending which leaves us with a limited content that at the end of the day doesn't fall short on delivering the message. The show really teaches a lot of daily ethics that we forget about most of the time showing examples of their effects on a personal side (Everything related to Pingu) and on one's surroundings (Everybody else).- Art (7/10):Beautiful spot motion that's simple enough to carry on the moral of the episodes. Its childish visuals still strikingly apparent but it was always meant to be that, you can't really complain about the fluidity of the animation of the alteration of the anatomy concerning body proportions, because at the end of the day, they are all just penguins that tend to have way more flexibility on their bodies than a world-class renowned gymnast.- Sound (7.5/10):I think at this point we can all live by their constant span of “NOOT” and would never take anything else for a replacement, even if it was legit voice acting with big names taking on the roles. The dialogue was never relevant as the moral of the story was always the message, the actions that we physically do will never be excused by simply spitting some words, perhaps that was the reason for having all of the Penguins noot all the time.- Characters (7/10):There was never a character that makes you go nuts on consuming all of those latest figurines the moment they show up, it's just Pingu, the dude that's all of the worlds is centered around. The show features a full sized city populated with a lot of Penguins of different treats and professions and never neglects a single one of them as all of them have episodes they shine on which is always appreciated. Writing up characters and never referencing again was always a bad thing, and “Pingu in the City” addresses that greatly.- Enjoyment (8/10):The joy of watching “Pingu in the City” was always from anticipating what's the next ethic the episodes are going to tackle, I don't think binge watching this series works in a good fashion as watching it weekly does have its effects if you're planning to live by the great advice the show provides, a week worth of time between every episode could also be an opportunity to adapt to the moral lesson you just learned from Pingu.The factor of wholesomeness is also something worthy of mentioning, I'm rare to find a show that genuinely helps you relax, it doesn't require any extensive processing to get and is just there to entertain you whenever you've nothing else to do.- Overall (7.3/10):Recommending this to an outsider of the series might lead them to doubt your mental health in many ways, and it's sad to think that this is what the general public thinks of this show, no, it's not for a specific age demographic and was never meant to be, learning good moral is a great thing to live by and you could at least be appreciative to this new kid in the block that's willing to help up shape a genuine person out of you. spit it overflows many good shows as victims of lackluster and low following.Remember the thing about the futuristic civilization that will come to earth to find some copies of Pingu's first season and get a wrong idea on us as a capable life form?

Pet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37522/Pet,"['This is another title from Studio Geno, which until now has always brought great anime, even though it is a recent studio, and I can say that Pet is probably the best one ever made by him.Pet is one of the best animes of this season, the anime production surprised me a lot, all the elements that were created to give the illusion of the mind according to the work are incredible, it is easy to understand the mystic that happens here, thanks to the script of the anime, which maintains a great evolution until it reaches the final episodes.After understanding the rules imposed by...the anime, the story begins to develop, working and linking each of its main characters that make the plot roll almost like a suspense. The characters are not exceptional, but they are useful in the context of the work.The anime lets us look at the two sides of the coin, and go on to formulate how everything can end. We see characters being deceived in front of us, others being manipulated for their own interests, whether for good or evil.Pet is certainly the most wronged anime of that time, and deserved more recognition. the anime, the story begins to develop, working and linking each of its main characters that make the plot roll almost like a suspense.

But it is a kind of challenge someone like me can genuinely appreciate. Unlike many anime that hold your hand and make you sit through 10+ minute long exposition dumps with nothing happening, Pet is going to methodically tell you things when relevant,...and allow you to use that knowledge to understand the characters even more. Pet in that sense is a breath of fresh air, it is a show about adults—for adults.Even so, I\'ve seen a staggering amount of people on the internet still absolutely flabbergasted as to what exactly is going on. Eventually I think there needs to be a Pet messiah that will succinctly explain the world in a way that those who don\'t have the ability to make the connections the show requires you to can understand. But because of that, a show like Pet can only dream to be above a 7 by the end of the season since so many fail to understand it, which is a crime if I do say so myself.The characters are complex in their own ways so far, all getting their opportunities to further expose another layer as to how exactly people like them exist. The nature of their job as psychics inherently means they have their own trauma they need to cope with in order to function normally, let alone use their powers to manipulate others with backstories as potentially dark as their own. Of course not every character is perfect, especially a certain annoying one, but that doesn\'t mean one doesn\'t look forward to when their backstory is revealed.The art and animation are nothing exemplary in fact a bit of a foil to the term. It is a bit ugly, very modern anime but without the time or talent to polish the gem into something astonishing or even great, it gets the job done nonetheless. That doesn\'t mean the whole show is roughly animated or looks bad, there are some pretty well crafted transformation sequences that leave even a jaded man like me impressed. Pet feels like a passion project, an attitude that emanates through its directing, which while not perfect at times, definitely doesn\'t leave one bored or bewildered. In fact it can be intoxicating, with some episodes leaving you desperately wanting more.Pet is genuinely creative, a show trying to say something interesting with its narrative and characters.

I am really ashamed that there are people ignoring this show just because of its art style etc. This is a must watch show from the director of Baccano and Durara. I knew from the beginning that the story will be explained episode by episode and before they will play with your mind. It is a rare kind of show and unique also weird in a good way. I have my most favorite character from this show Tsukasa. This is years old manga yet it...had the ability to amaze us just like Dororo. This woman(author) deserves the popularity because of her works. I will indeed rewatch this show again for better understanding because I feel there were minor lack issues but not the major one. I hoped that director should have done more better directing for this anime to be the best one but any ways I am fine.Story-9It is a mind tripping anime but it will remove your all stress in the end. The story was just great and beautiful in its own ways.Art-8Well I don't actually care about the animation style that much because I am a story lover but the thing is that there were some scenes that weren't animated great just like some expressions. I don't get this why but although they did a good job animating the water scenes and mostly the finale scene I hoped that would have been amazing if the whole series was animated like that. I think the budget was low or some kind of issues. It was decent for me.Sound-10:Tk never fails to amaze us. The openings and endings were really amazing and also matched with the anime if we look at the lyrics. Also the major thing about this show which I personally loved was the voice acting of the character Tsukasa. Others had fine voice acting but this Tsukasa one was really legendary. Probs to this guy and deserves the seiyuu award.Character-9:Loved every character and their designs. Their ideas and their weird good attitude. Amazing just amazing!Enjoyment-9:It was great ride for me but I don't know about the taste of action lovers if they will watch the anime carefully and by focusing.To the starters don't miss even a single scene and understand it carefully. This show is just mind blowing just watch it. You are locked down right? Get out and watch it today if you can and also have a nice day and nice sleep.

Thanks for reading this review of mine and sorry for childish kind of english because I am still learning english."", ""Pet:Compelling psychological thriller, with bizarre, mind-bending scenarios, flawed and interesting characters, and satisfying twists and turns the whole way through. It's mature, surreal, unique, and shamefully underrated.Even so:  6/10Many people will drop it after episode one, because the narrative withholds too much information. That's understandable. And many others will drop it because the characters are unlikable. That's fair, too. The show focuses on some selfish and ugly people, and that can be hard to watch. But I think the story is worth pushing through those things.Honestly, though? I kinda wish I'd dropped it, too.Not for the reasons above, but because Pet's visuals are so...VERY disappointing. I sense a very troubled production schedule. The characters are often off-model, butchering some really cool-looking original designs. The color choices can be jarring. And even if things were rough behind the scenes, I doubt there was any strong artistic vision to begin with. So many scenes are framed in a boring way, sapping all the tension away, the characters' expressions lack nuance...It looks like ass, is what I'm trying to say.It sounds like a petty complaint. But in this medium, visual storytelling is important. Pet has an interesting story to tell, but so often fails to deliver. Because outside of a few key moments, what I'm looking at is just so...... bleh.STORY:  8/10ART:      4/10SOUND:  6/10  (sound design is actually VERY strong in the first half of the show)CHAR:    7/10ENJOY:   6/10Overall: 6/10I'd say read the manga, but the series is obscure enough that I can't find an English translation anywhere.

Sorry."", ""I know it's too early to give an impression on this anime and I wanted to wait till the show is finished airing, however I really want to make this review and give people a proper idea towards this unique show, so hear me out.I'm aware that this is not everyone's taste but before judging it after watching only the 1st episode and even dropping it, give a chance to have a proper look on it, because everything is explained in a very unique way (for exaple: ep 1 is all explained in ep 2 from a different view/perspective, which I find it very...unique and rare in anime in general) and then slowly the show gives hints and even clear answers by itself, but it also means that we should pay enough attention and make our brains on use. This is that kind of an anime that makes you understand even better after rewatching it, and for me honestly it worked just fine, especially that I've got so invested into the story. Indeed, the plot is very confusing at first and that's the purpuse of the anime but it's not that hard to understand it after all.Personally I got SO interested since the first trailer came out and I became addicted to it (also because of the first 30 seconds of the op that appeared in the trailer). The trailer looked nothing like some other anime out there, and the visuals are so unique that makes you want to see more of it, of the weirdness.'Weird' is normal nowadays, so I don't get why people would judge it so easily because of its weird concept, but isn't this what people want NOW?!I find the entire dark concept of the mind manipulation, a refletion of our reality where the world is mean and want to control over our 'bodies' that affects us emotionally and every aspect of the outside view comes first from our mind.STORY: 10/10I've seen nothing like this before in anime and a topic about mind manipulation is something pretty much taboo that not many people are brave to expose and discuss, because it's perhaps a delicate subject that has no right and wrong answers (?) This is a reason why this anime caught my attention from the very beginning.Indeed it's hella confusing at first, but now, looking closely, ep 1 is actually a full pack of answers that we didn't see at first. That's why it's WORTH rewatching the episodes before going into the next one!!ART: (8.50) 9/10I've never seen anything from Geno Studio before so I was a bit sceptical about it. Gladly, it prooved me wrong and indeed the art style is different but pretty much pleasing for the eye. However I can see some lack in the art style when it comes to animation. The initial art is a bit distorted in movement and different angles and makes the jaws look a bit predominant, not like I'd mind but I thought it's a fault/mistake from the creators. Although, this art style appeals very well to the dark concept of it, making everthing look disturbing (THAT'S WHY is rated +17 duuuh)Sound: 10/10If I could, I'd give 1000/10, I fell in love with the opening, NOT because ''ooh it's the Tokyo Ghoul's op singer'', NOT because ''ooh it's TK, then it must be good'', I JUST LOVE IT THE WAY IT IS! Yes, I love TK's song and I admire his voice, even though I'm not a huge fan, BUT I'm absolutely obsessed with this song and his range in it. I spammed all the videos on yt that has to do with this OP (lmao). Speaking of opening, the fact that Tsukasa is lip syncing the lyrincs of the song at the beginning is SO COOL & UNIQUE, have you ever seen such a thing in anime openings so far?! The ending song is also STUNNING just like the opening. An anime like this deserves 100% two badass songs like these.Characters: 10/10I can't express how much I like that these characters are so diverse and unique on their way. Everyone is struggling with sad backgrounds having a big need for love and respect between each other. It kinda gives a gay vibe to it(but has nothing to do with with gays, so don't worry homophobes, it's safe), because I totally support the strong bond between Tsukasa and Hiroki despite their 'pet-owner' connection/relationship. Shout out to Geno Studio for making Tsukasa SO HANDSOME!!!Enjoyement: 10/10I could give it more that 10, my hype for this anime started in summer 2019, so as expected, I'm enjoying it so far a lot. The fact that every episode makes you want to know how it will end up, the whole investment that gives, is incomparable. Its mystery is really on point, and combined with weird and disturbing visuals keeps me excited every week.PLEASE SUPPORT THIS ANIME AND DON'T JUDGE IT AFTER WATCHING ONLY THE 1st EPISODE!

It\'s this element of mystery that creates a niche for the minority (like myself) to really appreciate by flexing our human brains and figuring out the connections behind all the terminologies and why the entire situation exists in the first place.This review will have spoilers (in the terminological sense), but I will try my best to keep it as plain as possible:""Peaks and valleys"", or so do the ancient Chinese martial artists have a psychotic way to enter into their enemies minds and trying to manipulate their good and bad memories respectively, the ""Peak"" being visible and the ""Valley"" being hidden to the extreme.""The Company"", wanting to use this to their benefit, opposes this idea to make these same martial artists to do their bidding for them, or so call the human-slave binding, or what\'s effectively called a ""pet"". In any case, think of it like a mafia group using these ""pets"" into doing their business unconsciously, with the ""Crusher"" as the master to wipe off their enemies ""Peaks"" and replace them with ""Valleys"" so to kill their subconscious minds.For the ""pets"", they have an ""image"" where they can make ""babies"", objectively creating another kind of their own and together with the ""peaks"" of others, help share a bond together to create something new. But for people whose ""images"" are easily broken, a ""lock"" is created so as to stop enemies to pursue manipulating the ""peak"" and keeping their minds safe from harm, especially useful to the weak and easily manipulated.The story takes place in a conspiracy of times where (as mentioned) the Chinese martial artists have proven their track record over using ""peaks and valleys"" to crush their enemies, and the hidden organization ""The Company"" is attempting to do the same, for mafia-related reasons. At once, characters seemingly unrelated to each other are now connected to this rabbit hole of a gargantuan plot device, the mindless naïve characters seemingly pointing hands at each other whilst fighting to survive in this rough organization.As for the characters, as complex as they can be, their minds easily being targets at thinking for the well-being of one another, you can take it as a cluttered mess, or (after watching the entire show in a binge) a toxicated relationship that makes sense at the end of it all.Hiroki and Tsukasa, the primary ""pet""/master terminology, both are characters easily woven into this toxic plot that has one naïve boy with his ""image"" working for an easily manipulatable master ""crusher"", being friends at the start and slowly progressing, mind-numbing counterfeit that has one saving the other out of this mess. More than a rough relationship, it\'s one that has gone through thick and thin for one party to realize what\'s up and salvage before it\'s too late.Hayashi the ""Peak Giver"", he is the one who started the chain of events down the rabbit hole that was once useful to ""The Company"" for creating ""babies with images"" and was labelled a traitor to be taken down, regardless of his contributions and being a free man who wanted the best for the organization. Really kinda feel bad for this man whose intentions for the good have gone so wrong.And like Hiroki, Satoru who was once a family\'s child, taken in for an experiment and being labelled a ""pet"" immediately, it\'s not hard to see one\'s loyalty for the Father (Hayashi) who breathed life into him, only for an unfortunate series of events that has him being used by other people. The classic example of being a parrot in other\'s eyes.Overall, there is a lot in common with the characters, but the way that they\'re utilized isn\'t bad it all, not the best, but for what it\'s worth I can give it that.As is with Geno Studio\'s presentation, I\'d imagine this to be a total psychedelic experience from start to finish. All those weird colour palettes and foreboding graphic imagery that proves the topsy-turvy visuals (especially in the ""peak and valley"" psyche minds), it was definitely something that takes time to get used to, and definitely is NOT for the faint of heart. Visuals are mediocre in the real world, but in the psychological world they do get to be freaking bold (as is the case with imagery) depending on the mind states of the characters. Overall, not the best, but decent at best.Sound-wise, while the OST doesn\'t really rock the soul, I truely dig TK\'s OP as one of (if not) the best this season. Same as is with Tokyo Ghoul, this song might not be as bombastic as the former\'s but regardless it\'s a banger of an OP with the overly display of confusing but best psychological visuals of how much the characters are mind-controlled to their demise. The ED is just fine of the many representations (in different languages) of mind perception. As the anime community will say: ""Anime doesn\'t make TK famous, TK makes anime famous.""In all essence, Pet as a show is a niche, a very unique, creative show taking a spin on the mystery-psychological genre, and it\'s just sad that not many people are taking chances upon trying this show. Not much a Pet messiah, but at least I hope that this review will push you to binging the series in one go (and that\'s the best way to experience this show) and experiencing a mystery draw that\'s unlike anything out there. ability to control and manipulate minds, on the context of you the audience, having to pay ABSOLUTE attention to what\'s going on in the surroundings and not spoon-feeding you with information right-away (which unfortunately the major of the anime community these days don\'t appreciate such shows where exposition is everything you need to know, and there and then done).

It’s been an interesting season so far. We’ve got plenty of cute girls doing cute things, spirits, the next edition of, “I can’t believe it’s not hentai,” magical girls that are probably going to die in gruesome ways and whatever the f**k Dorohedoro is supposed to be. What a time to be an anime fan. So as the first review of the new decade, I want to talk about the hardest anime to formulate an opinion on this season, Pet.Pet is a strange anime. It’s storytelling and aesthetics remind me of the works of the late, great...Satoshi Kon. Or, if want a more recent example, last year’s horror mystery series, Boogiepop. Much like Boogiepop, the show isn’t exactly an easy show to get into as it isn’t a show you can just sit down for half an hour, watch it and move on. It requires your specific attention; breaking down all of the subtle messages, themes and mysteries the show provides. It ain’t an easy show to follow and is worth going back to specific scenes. So has it actually delivered that?So far at least, the show has done an alright job at giving us an idea of what the show is like. As the story and setting goes, every human has a “Peak” and a “Valley.” A Peak is a moment of pure happiness and is that person’s most cherished memory. A Valley is something that should be locked up and harbours all of your worst memories. Now I tell you this because some humans have the ability to manipulate the minds and memories of other humans for their liking. As such, certain individuals, only known so far as “The Company” use these powers to manipulate targets that they get assigned to. Our two main leads, Hiroki and Tsukasa are employed at The Company to deal with these targets by manipulating their memories or destroying their minds.The term “Psychological” really does apply to this show. No doubt the first episode I imagine left a lot of viewers confused as to what the f**k is going on. Only to get explained in the next episode. It goes for a show then tell structure by the looks of things as it want the viewer to guess before giving us the answers that we seek and the full extent of these powers our characters have, for better and for worse. No doubt that method of this storytelling is intriguing as it isn’t always straightforward with what the show is trying to say. Is that a good or a bad thing? Well it depends on how much you want to pay attention to it.  Same about the characters really, we don’t know anything about their backstory or their agendas at the moment. All we focus on at the moment is the now. Which leads to something that I want to point out that is both clever character writing and a rather constant irritation in my opinion. Hiroki has a rather annoying personality. He’s very emotional and stubborn and never seems to act like a grown up. But it seems intentional. The way he acts, he talks, how the story unfolds and how he is treated. It’s almost like he is a dog waiting for his master to come back. A “pet” as it were. Which when you think about it with the way Tsukasa acts, calm and rational, it definitely makes you think.Now to make sure that this preliminary doesn’t got for too long, I’ll quickly go over the animation and sound. So far the animation has done its job and actually has looked good in some places. It hasn’t looked sloppy so at least that’s a positive. Same with the ost. It’s varied depending on who’s mind our characters enter although there is a great emphasis on calm, jazz music which I always like. The ost shouldn’t get in the way of a story like this because it would a distraction otherwise so it’s good they didn’t do anything bombastic. And of course, any opening with TK in it is always good and they help deliever a very good opening here with its style and visuals.So should you check out Pet if you haven’t already? Well depends on how much you want to commit to it. You really have to pay attention of what the show is trying to say and explain to get the most enjoyment out of it. It’s a very niche kind of show that would only be enjoyed to it’s fullest by people who are willing to break it down, speculate and come to conclusions. But for me, it doesn’t have a charm to it that makes it enjoyable. For example, with Boogiepop, the supernatural horror aspect of it made it more intriguing than it was and the world building through different perspectives was interesting enough for it to be enjoyable. Pet lacks this at the moment and I’m struggling to get invested into this show. Without a hook, it lacks something. And I feel that could be the show’s downfall in the long run.First ImpressionStory: 6/10While there are still plenty of questions that need to be explained or hinted at badly, the way the show delivers it’s story is very intriguing so far.Characters : 5.5/10I would say that the character writing has been good so far but some of their personalities can be irritating.Animation: 7/10Does its job and looks good doing it.Sound: 7.5/10Stays in the background while also setting an atmosphere. Done well.My personal enjoyment: 4.5/10It lacks a hook and charm that makes me want to dig into it more with each new episodeOverall score: 6.1/10 Recommendation: Consider it. Satoshi Kon.

While it has a massive interest factor with it's concept of the mind, it's been presented so far in the most weird ways, that's just feeling like a trip to look at sometimes. Not that makes it bad by any stretch. Since it makes it stand out in it's own way. But even still, there are a few things that are good that are going for it.The opening song is honestly one of my faves of the season. It's really a great listen. The sound is great for each scene too, they really set it....They also do well with the transitions. Every frame, every bit of art looks well detailed and pleasing to the eye. Even if it can get disturbing looking at times.For characters themselves, I guess it's different? Like we're introduced to our main cast, and what we're presented with, it's different, I'll give it that. Really seems they were going all out with something different and creative, I'll give the anime props for that.Overall Pet can seem like one big acid trip. But has very much a ton of interest from me, and hopefully you too. I'm curious to see how further the story goes throughout this journey. So give it a shot! They also do well with the transitions.

When I first watched the first episode and was greeted by TK's amazing opening song (hadn't heard the dude since watching Tokyo Ghoul a few years back), I was immediately heavily invested with this series. I even thought Hiroki and Tsukasa were pretty likeable bois, having the power to brainwashing people based on their sins. It does give you the big picture of what every individual went through in a LSD type of sense...However I think as...soon as I watched episode 5 , the story was kinda missing and becoming vague to the point on what we are actually concentrating here. Yeah I know, this anime series is meant to confuse us viewers but I felt it was dodging the important points on what's the main goal of each main characters here? Maybe I'm the only one missing the point of this anime? Who knows?Anyways I honestly thought I had high hopes for this anime series, the music, the characters, the Japanese voice actors and the art were just so so good, why oh why did they waste these on a very vague as well as a badly developed storyline?!?!

Pet is unique in a world of clones; it develops slowly and the characters are quite deep. For the first 3-4 episodes it was just good enough for me to watch the next episode, but only barely.I had no idea who the kid from the first scene was, or much of what was happening. There were breadcrumbs here and there, but not enough to have any real sense of who, what, or why. Fortunately, episodes 5-7 have done very good at answering many of my questions without massive...exposition dumps. The characters backstories are starting to fill-in, all the while new questions are being raised with answers to hopefully come.I've upgraded my opinion from a 7 to 8, but it's hard to know where it'll settle until this ends.

I was willing to see some interesting concept about psychological manipulation, much more of a thriller in a Code Geass style, and what I found was completely different- in a mostly positive way. I'll try to analyze the main points of why I think Pet deserves a 9 (or maybe an 8 if you're more moderated that me), and how does the anime get to be one of my favorite ever.Story - 9As far as Pet doesn't have the magnificent and impactful plot of some other animes such as Code Geass, it still does...pretty well by setting a very well-based worldbuilding that- at least from my point of view- the anime actually took time to explain and explore, concerning the concept of peaks and valleys and how their interdependance is the fundamental relation of our psyche. Thus, by manipulating them we can either change the whole memories of a person or cause it to have a breakdown. It's really appliable to our lifes in a sense that what we usually preserve in our memory for a long time are harsh and significant feelings, and our perception of life mostly depend on these important experiences.From there on, the plot develops with Hayashi suddenly going back to Japan to escape with Satoru while the Company tries to eliminate him and the consequences this has on our main characters. I will not spoil nothing here, but it manages to keep you interested until the end of the story, that is really satisfactory.Art - 6Well, Pet definitely had a rushed and instable production. There were some chapters by the middle of the anime (7 and 8, I think), where the series really appeared to be some kind of new abomination from Studio Deen. I can see that there were some factors involved, such as preventive measures due to the coronavirus that affected anime studios, lack of budget for this scenes and some character designs changing drastically in order to take the mission assigned by the Company. But actually there are only few high quality scenes, while the character design is sometimes inconsistent. I would expect more from this director, but it's pretty obvious that the production faced some big problems.Sound- 8No further considerations about this topic. The Op and ending are great and the OST kinda fits with what's happening on the screen, but it's not on the level of other titles of this season such as ID:Invaded or Eizouken. Seiyuus are very expressive as well, they made a great deal with their voice acting.Character - 10I truly don't want to spoil some possible new watcher (even if considering how the anime is underrated I don't think many people will get to know it), but Pet has probably the best character development I've ever seen in a twelve chapter anime, specially considering that it isn't mainly focused on drama - even if it ends being a shitload of times better in this aspect than in the action part-. I wouldn't say that I relate to the characters and I thank God because of that, but the way the anime portraits the feeling of Hiroki, Satoru and, specially, Tsukasa, really touched me and I find it wonderful.Enjoyment - 9Well, Pet might not be hyping at all, but it was a pretty nice time that I have trying to unravel the way the world worked in the first episodes, and then watching the unique relation between it's characters. It really deserved this 9 out of ten.Overall - 9If you get to see my list, you'll notice that I actually have more tens than grades below seven. I'm a guy that really likes to see the good part and enjoy what I'm watching, so, with some exceptions, my rate will be always above the average. Anyways, you can trust me when I say that Pet is really worth-watching and that, if you can get involved in the complicated plot of the first four episodes, then you'll certainly have a good time with it.PD: I'm sorry about some English mistakes that I may commit, since it's not my first language.

In this review, I will explain why Pet is one of the best anime in years.Story: 10The first chapters of Pet begin by explaining what the trajectory of the other episodes will be like. That people have peaks and valleys, in which people called ""pet"" will be able to manipulate people\'s memories. During these 13 chapters, we see the evolution of many characters, such as Tsukasa, which begins with the objective of destroying Hayashi\'s mind, since they were orders from the company, and...also destroying Satoru, already as Tsukasa\'s personal objective. In itself, the story is worth it, really.Art: 10The artistic drawings that this beautiful anime gives us is beautiful. How well the landscapes, rivers, key moments are represented, everything is great.Sound: 10For me, the best part of this great anime. Already the opening of Pet (the group is Tk from Ling Tosite Sigure), is for me the best of the year, without a doubt, since it reminds me a lot of the first opening of Tokyo Ghoul. And then the ending (the group is Memai Siren) is also great. Then we move on to anime, where the sound effects, the music, everything. It is perfect.Characters: 10The characters, a very important point to capture the attention of those who watch any anime. In my case, the Pet characters are well designed, look Tsukasa, who for me is the best. But then there is Hiroki, Satoru, Hayashi, Jin, Katsuragi, etc. They are all well designed.Enjoyment: 10It is true that, at first, I had my few expectations of Pet, since on YouTube they had meaningless trailers, but, thanks to fate, Pet was an anime that I enjoyed too much. I even saw each episode twice, because FUCK, it was beautiful. And it became for me and many, THE BEST ANIME OF THE YEAR.Overall: 10 also destroying Satoru, already as Tsukasa\'s personal objective.

It gets a bad reputation due to the slow and complex startup. Also, I feel like this show tries to set itself up as how the character\'s use their powers for evil. It may be quite confusing at first, but the show isn\'t really about how the characters use their abilities, it\'s about how their lives and relationships were affected as a result of gaining their powers.Plot  - As stated above, this show isn\'t about how the characters complete tasks by manipulating memories, it is about how the character\'s lives has changed. This is a very good thing,...because the explanation for ""images"" (power used in this show) and ""pets"" (image users) is explained gradually and can be hard to pick up on. Also, I can\'t really explain the plot because it gets more and more complex as the show progresses so I would just be spoiling everything if I did that. (minor spoilers ahead) I\'ll just say it branches out from a murder cover up. The plot development was really enjoyable however,I felt that at a certain point, every episode was a lot better than the last. It was very confusing at first, but I find that figuring out what was happening was part of the fun, at least for me. Definitely one of my favorite plot lines I\'ve seen, and the end of the show is also one of my favorite conclusions.Characters - This is where the show shines. like I\'ve said a lot of the show looks at how the characters deal with their situation in a psychological way, and as a result grow as people. Most of this happens within the last few episodes, so it\'s hard to mention without literally spoiling the last 3 episodes. But beyond their actual development, the characters and their relations were very fun to watch even if the show could be dialogue heavy at times. This show has one of my favorite casts of characters I\'ve seen in awhile, even though at the beginning of the show they come off very bland.Aesthetics (art, animation, sound) - The art was pretty good, although not the greatest I\'ve seen. The CGI, which isn\'t around a whole lot, was horrible. Sometimes laughably bad. But everything else was pretty well done. The show seemed to have a somewhat more realistic art style, at least I think so. Everything else looked solid, although the color palette could\'ve been darker. As for sound, this show was glorious. The voice actors nailed it, especially Hiroki, and the noire style background music complimented the story very well. But the best part is definitely the opening and ending themes, each of which are now some of my favorite songs of all time. I listen to them to an almost unhealthy amount.Overall - This show was very enjoyable, especially with its\' entertaining and well developed cast, and the very complex storyline. As for the confusion and poor explanation of concepts, just remember, it isn\'t exactly the main part of the show, and it\'s eventually explained anyhow. Also, the show gets better in episode 9 (or at least that is when it really got going), although it\'s still pretty good beforehand. I think if one can keep an open mind and pay attention, this show can be a great watch. Truly a hidden gem among hidden gems. It was truly a masterpiece I absolutely love! because the explanation for ""images"" (power used in this show) and ""pets"" (image users) is explained gradually and can be hard to pick up on.

Here are the questions I had.Who are the good guys, who are the bad guys?The series just had characters show up without explaining who they are.Characters such as Mei Ling are not explained what her power is.One episode they may seem to be good, the next episode seem to be bad (Tsukasa and Katsuragi).It’s confusing because we do not even know who the main character is/are. What is the...company? An evil organisation?Who is the CEO? Is being asked to join the company as an employee good or bad?What is the whole plot of the show about?The series did not provide the characters objective or give any purpose. They just pit a bunch of people who are supposed to have mind control or psychic powers against each other.What are the meaning of the terms used?Words such as “babies”,”lock”,”image”,”peak giver”, “door” and “valleys” were constantly used without a proper explanation as to what they mean.Dialogues in Chinese were hard to understand, I am Chinese and I don’t understand what the characters were saying.To summaries, after completing all 13 episodes, I still did not know what this series is about. The only redeeming thing about this horrible series is it’s op and ed which is by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure. 1/10 company? An evil organisation?Who is the CEO?

It isn't a slow-burner by any means , and releases information in a way that makes the viewer think .I think it has an excellent storyline , and character motivations are often explored with different points of view . The anime itself keeps various pieces of information vague , thus keeping the watcher engaged . It is absolutely a pay attention anime , to every single second . It can be a slow starter , but is jam-packed with valuable information. The first episode may throw you off , but it will redeem itself.The...details are innumerable , and though the art itself can come off as 'ugly' to some viewers , it will most surely be forgotten when watching the story . I find that some scenes are animated excellently , however , facial expressions at times can be lacking. I almost think that the different art style is refreshing , compared to the very generic animation in most amines nowadays . It isn't a soul eater by any means , but the art style won't hinder your watch very much .I am definitely excited to see the characters develop in future seasons . So far , we have seen an incredible amount of growth in certain characters , and some are starting to find their own values and morals . I have seen criticism of the characters not being likable , but I find this to be more so a parallel of real life and human interaction  . You don't often meet a person who you like straight off the bat in real life , it takes time to learn about them , everyone is morally grey and have their flaws. Characters were complex , and have seemingly started their own individual arcs. Tsukasa in particular , is an interesting study , and I would love to find video essays about him.One particular aspect of the show I loved was the fact that it didn't contain many (if any ) typical tropes that usually come with anime , and has an AMAZING OP to boot . I loved the element of mystery that was so deeply entangled at it's very roots , and the fact that it was difficult to guess what would happen next , elevated the viewing experience. details are innumerable , and though the art itself can come off as 'ugly' to some viewers , it will most surely be forgotten when watching the story .

Obviously others animes like Darwin\'s Game (influenced by Mirai Nikki) are great, but, in my opinion, not much animes has the same originally than Pet. One thing that like I found excellent is it opening, sung by Toru Kitakima, of band Ling Tosite Sigure, the same band that sing ""Unravel"" Tokyo Ghoul opening that always have partication in animes psicological themes. The opening express the subconscious thought color mix...with cool colores and negative colors (The fisrt type represent the psicological angustiation of characters and the second represent the confusion of the world thought characters vision), and the way that the colores are exposed in theopening represents the subjetive, deep, psicodelical and psicological world of mind. When I saw this opening in first time, I remember 2001: A space Odissey movie  when the astronaut David Bowman, after almost die on HAL 9000 attack, finds himself on a journey on misdt of time and space, psicological space that has likeness with the memories manipulation in anime.Pet didn\'t have the same formate than other isekais animes because the manipulation power of the characters is used by real motives that existe in real life, like criminality, not any competition games like the most magic games animes. I\'m not criticising isekai anime, also because I like works as Sword Art Online and No Game No Life, but the anime market is full of this genre that is prohibited on japeneses light novel events due to its huge amount produced.

Like as showed in anime, the world of memorie is a place that the fisic laws are completaly inexistent, and the matter, as like the memories, is manipulated, when, for example, Hiroki turns into fish or Tsukasa decrease in size, and the representation of subconscious like an omnipotencios state express how the human mind is abstrate and infinite.

Only the time, however, will tell us.', ""Pet is a difficult one to explain... experience, and overcome.Story 10/10:It has a convoluted story that will either be the immediate selling point or the dropping point of any new viewer. What's interesting for me is that it is somehow similar to the season's ID: Invaded but tackles the mind through a different avenue. I am admittedly a huge sucker for anything that deals with psychology and thus will come from a viewpoint of encouragement from that angle. This one is heavy in dialogue, but not unnecessarily so. Rich in content, though it sometimes passes the line of being overloaded or being too stressful to...watch. Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy it in the form of binge. It's beautiful in all its complex inception.Sound 8/10:OP will be an immediate catch for fans of that genre (just check it out). I'm personally more of a fan of the ED, and one I did not skip. As for how the anime itself dealt with sound design, it was cool. I've noticed particular highlights with dramatic backstories more than the intense scenes, which is weird in hindsight. Then again, intense scenes in this anime is different, due to the nature of a psychological approach. Nothing too jarring for my ears, which is a huge plus for immersion in this type of anime.Character 9/10:I think I've rarely enjoyed a full season of anime with more nonconventional characters than the ones filled with tropes. Pet also showcases an amazing set of characters that are unique and strong in conviction. There would also be a point where the one to root for would be unclear, and that is a definite plus for me for this kind of anime. I was definitely satisfied in this aspect. It means there were strong setups for characterization that solidified their motives and tendencies.Art Style 4/10:I did say Pet was also hard to overcome... mainly due to this aspect. I have to be honest. Pet's art style is ugly, and was certainly difficult to start with. There were some scenes where the visuals (more than the animation itself) were actually beautiful. This is in part due to the nature of the mind and its conceived images, which the anime actually handles well as something distinct. I'll still be hesitant to suggest the anime, solely because of the art style. With the nature of its heavy themes, art style IS a major factor to pull viewers in. It definitely could have been better.If the idea of a psychological anime is your thing, I strongly urge you to try this one! I don't think this will be the kind of anime for anyone who isn't into the genre. ID: Invaded is a better execution of psychology overall. I'd gladly take you there, but know that Pet could have been something as great and immersive as ID if it had less jarring attributes. watch. Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy it in the form of binge. It's beautiful in all its complex inception.Sound 8/10:OP will be an immediate catch for fans of that genre (just check it out). I'm personally more of a fan of the ED, and one I did not skip. As for how the anime itself dealt with sound design, it was cool. I've noticed particular highlights with dramatic backstories more than the intense scenes, which is weird in hindsight. Then again, intense scenes in this anime is different, due to the nature of a psychological approach. Nothing too jarring for my ears, which is a huge plus for immersion in this type of anime.Character 9/10:I think I've rarely enjoyed a full season of anime with more nonconventional characters than the ones filled with tropes. Pet also showcases an amazing set of characters that are unique and strong in conviction.

Let\'s be honest here, there isn\'t a lot of thriller anime out there, and the ones out there that do exist tend to be trash. Pet definitely surpassed my expectations on many fronts, because it was actually quite a good watch.Well, first of all, before I talk about the actual plot and characters, I\'ve got to talk about the most interesting aspect of this show: mind controlling powers. It\'s the obvious focal point of this show, and if it didn\'t exist, this show would be a disaster. However, with the addition of this unique...plot point, Pet gets elevated to a level that is well made. It\'s not a  ""quirk"" nor is it just a random bestowed ""power."" It\'s a power as much as it is a curse, and balancing the way you use the power is difficult and one bad move can lead to mental disintegration. It\'s basically the most important thing in the show, and it gets discussed about the entire time. I personally love it. Figuring how the powers work, how people cope with the powers, how people can control it, the extent of the powers, and how it evolved from the very first generation of ""mind control users"" was very entertaining.Anyways, lets move on to the plot. The beginning is very strong. I couldn\'t find any fault in it. It eases you into how the mind control power works, and the story associated with it is also very in depth and makes so much sense and cohesion. I didn\'t feel like I was rushed into the introduction of the powers because of this beginning. Afterwards, it kind of devolves into a ""evil organization"" trying to control people with mind control powers. Pretty much the most used trope of all time. The only anime I can think of right off the bat is Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, which was just...terrible, so being able to see it done well is a good change. The plot is kind of complicated in that it focuses on characters that have varying levels of what is going on, but  it still keeps an overall simple and linear style. This relatively simple plot, to me, is just playing it kind of safe. That being said though, it still made me wonder what was going to happen and kept a steady level of suspense.The fact that this show focuses a lot about mind control powers makes me think that there\'s going to be some mind games, some psychological warfare, and some intricate plots. While some of these do come up a little bit, it isn\'t the focal point of the plot for the most part, which really disappoints me. Instead, characters kind of get their information by almost sheer luck and plot armor. There isn\'t a lot of depth to the plot in that respect, which is honestly a shame. The finale was alright, the very end was very well made, but the events leading up to it are kind predictable. In the end, the plot playing it safe, focusing more on the mind control powers and the emotion control of characters, which i guess is fine. I\'ll just leave my final note that Satoru is definitely the weak link in the plot. He kind of just goes along with the plot to ensure it makes sense. He exhibits basically no awareness at all for most of the entire story and is being led along like a baby. The fact that he was introduced to be pretty intelligent is just a fat lie. Other than Satoru, though, the other characters are well made. You\'ve got cynical, childish, and regret-stricken characters with completely different motivations that change throughout the series that truly make the story come to life. Of course, all of the important characters have the mind control powers, so you really get to know their mental state of mind and motivations throughout the entire series.Lastly, and it\'s not TOO important, but there is quite a lot of Chinese being spoken in the anime, and holy crap. The Chinese is literally garbage. It\'s gibberish. You could have told me, a fluent Chinese speaker, that the Chinese spoken was Tibetan and I would have believed it. At first, I thought it was just a weird dialect because I truly could barely understand anything. ""Oh, it\'s probably Cantonese or something."" Nope. By episode 8. EIGHT. I figured out that it was Mandarin because there was this one kid who spoke actual Chinese. Everyone else on the show clearly did not know Chinese at all and were just reading off a script. Is it that hard to hire a few Chinese voice actors? Come on now. It\'s been done before. The anime was just lazy. Just like how broken English is cancer to my ears, so is broken Chinese, and it\'s not like it was just a few lines of Chinese. Almost every single episode features a lengthy amount of Chinese, so it just doesn\'t make sense.Well, anyways, disregarding my personal gripe about the Chinese in the show, Pet is executed well. It features mind control powers that make a whole lot of sense and has a lot of depth. Characters are done well. Plot plays it safe, but it isn\'t bad. It\'s a thriller with supernatural powers that isn\'t convoluted, incoherent, and terribly paced. So it gets a pass for me. plot point, Pet gets elevated to a level that is well made.

Pet is an amazing show that takes a couple episodes to get going, but once it gets going, it really gets going. The pay off at the end for having got through the first two eps will be well worth it and I highly recommend watching this.It’s not a show that spoon feeds you information and requires you to piece things together as you watch. So, you’ll need to actually pay attention and not be distracted on your phone or anything. The storytelling is really well done and revolves around a gang who utilises people who can...enter and alter peoples’ memories for committing crimes, stealing information, etc. The thing is, these “pets” as they’re called aren’t necessarily treated right and begin to harbour suspicions about their employers.The story is extremely well written and consistently through me for loops throughout which is quite rare these days. Normally, I find stories predictable and am able to deduce what’s going to happen, but with PET I was actually shocked at the end. The characters are very well developed and have their own unique quirks and characteristics that add to the story.There are some slight yaoi undertones to the series between the two main characters, but it’s nothing too extreme so even if you aren’t into yaoi series, you should still be able to enjoy this.The art and animation are very good in the show as well. Because it’s not a battle shōnen, there’s no major sakuga or crazy level animation, but when it’s needed, it holds up. The voice actors also all deliver really powerful performances that I felt made the characters and story come alive.In conclusion, Pet’s easily the most slept on show of Winter 2020 and it’s absolutely criminal. It does start slow, but once you get into it you’ll understand why that is. Give it a chance and you won’t regret it. Pet gets 8 peaks out of 10 from me. enter and alter peoples’ memories for committing crimes, stealing information, etc. The thing is, these “pets” as they’re called aren’t necessarily treated right and begin to harbour suspicions about their employers.The story is extremely well written and consistently through me for loops throughout which is quite rare these days.

With violent imagery and dark subjects its not for the faint of heart. One thing to know, and I cannot stress this enough, THE FIRST HALF OF THIS SHOW IS A 5 AT BEST. Everything really picks up in the second half of the show but it was a real struggle to get through the first 6 or so episodes. After then however it improves massively with every episode topping the one before it. by the final episode, there series goes full circle from starting out dull...to ending at a breakneck pace with an unexpected emotional touch at the end, even though I did not find myself connecting well with the characters.I\'d say the second half of the show was so good that it would earn a 9 from me. All of the problems seem to go away and it\'s when the plot gets the most interesting. It\'s just the flaws of the first half with it being extremely complex for no reason, very slow, and having awkward directing holds the show back from realizing it\'s true potential.-Other Notable things that I want to say:The art/animation was really well done throughout the show with often psychedelic color schemes.All the characters are very flawed in one way or the other and it just really all comes together in the final episodeThe concept of people altering memories in the synopsis, is just that a concept. Trying to avoid spoilers here but, the whole story revolves around the cast and their involvement in a gang-like group called ""The Company"". There are almost no other characters in the story that are not in The Company or work with The Company.There is so much more to go in depth with about ""Pets"" but its Super Spoilers so I\'m going to leave you in the dark like the show does for a good 6 episodes :)Also the OP and ED really fit this show, edgy and not for everyone, but good for those with the acquired tasteAll in all I liked this show. I recommend this show but only if you know about its flawed start and how it can be very dark. My recommendation is for this show I think it\'s best viewing is its second viewing. My reasoning for this is by the end of the show when you now understand everyone\'s motivations and intentions the first half is surprisingly more engaging and almost exciting to revisit earlier episodes to see what you missed. Which makes it appeal only for most hardened anime fans. to ending at a breakneck pace with an unexpected emotional touch at the end, even though I did not find myself connecting well with the characters.I\'d say the second half of the show was so good that it would earn a 9 from me.

After watching about 4 episodes, I felt like dropping the series. Because I couldn't see where the story was heading. Also I had some misunderstanding about the relationship of Tsukasa and Hiroki. At first I thought it was gay romance. But, as the story went I really understood their bonding. I don't want to spoil, but lets put it this way. There are many other people who has the same feeling and it's not due to romance.The biggest plus point this show deserves is that it has a unique, interesting and original story which is a rare thing...in anime because after you watch about 4-5 hundred shows you don't really see a new and unique story that much. Most of the animes out there are repackaging of old stories and tropes.This show gets better with each episode. Stay put for at least half of the series, then you will really get to understand the world and setting that the story is grounded in. Until that you won't really appreciate it.As I said in the beginning I was planning to drop this show, but after I have finished watching it I will give it a solid 8. Very good anime. Want to see more animes like this.Yeah, I have to agree with others that the art department was a downer. But, how many shows with fantastic art quality did we not drop because the story was cliche? I will tell you of one anime that I was watching just before this show -- Fire Force. I watched that show up to 12 episodes of the total 24 of the first season. The art was good, the audio was great, but the story was shit. You could tell how unoriginal it was. I had to drop it. A lame story is the worst thing you want in an anime. Compared to that Pet is much greater show. You just have to be patient for the 5-6 episodes. Slowly understand the setting of the world, identify the main characters from a few distractions in the first 1 or 2 episodes. Then when you get a grip in the story, you will start wanting to watch more of this show. And the pleasure will increase gradually with each episode.

Then when you get a grip in the story, you will start wanting to watch more of this show. And the pleasure will increase gradually with each episode. And when you reached the final episode you will wish for a second season while knowing that the ending was great in itself."", 'I may be biased.  As I watched this anime I got the feeling that the author was trying to come up with an anime based on lower spectrum autism, and having a child in the spectrum myself, I honestly loved it.So hear me out on this autism metaphor.  The premise of this show is that there are gifted people who cannot make memories of their own because they are unable to separate the emotional turmoil in their head.  Once they are given the tools to do so, however, they unlock, what I can only call psychic powers.So, even though...it hit a soft spot for me, I have to be real.  The execution of the story is a bit sloppy so that unless you are taking notes you might get lost.  The animation is honestly holding this anime back.  I also think, for a psychological drama, it has too many characters which means none get to fully shine.I would still recommend this anime for people to watch.  It has an original concept and that is something anime sorely needs. it hit a soft spot for me, I have to be real.

But I do believe this can be a good or bad thing depending on how it has done. It is not done in a nonsensical fashion instead it is a deep storyline that requires you to piece puzzles together and pay upmost attention. This style of storytelling does limit its potential audience as I believe this does not appeal to a large target audience which is understandable.The story was at points unpredictable...and made you think, did that just happened, or what is going to happened next? It had me constantly questioning what the MC next goal was and where his true intentions align. Certain sectors of the show did seem to spring by, but I believe this is due to the depth and symbolism that you have to pay attention to, so it seems as though time is disappearing.The ending was solid, it gave an actual conclusion to the story and you see everything unfold and it was quite an emotional rollercoaster. The story had me emotionally attached and I was intrigued at what next was going to unfold.Art 8/10The art has a nice flare to it, it looked fluid throughout and the art during the valleys/peak looked beautiful. Whilst I don’t think this is a game changer or masterpiece, it lives up to modern expectations and shines.Sound 9/10Oh my, the opening theme, stunning. It is by the same vocalist as unravel in Tokyo ghoul, and it shows. Certain points in the show were enhanced by the usage of suspense tracks throughout the show. Overall solid, there really is not too negativity to say about this.Characters 9/10This is a show that has phenomenal characters in it, with a varied cast with good in-depth storytelling on all fronts. This offered a wide range of attitudes and personalities in the show, mainly being the contrast between the two MC. Whilst it always asks for your attention, it is worth it. The sudden realisations that happened at certain points after finding out about backstory is phenomenal. You find yourself disliking a certain character then you find out reasoning behind actions. Whilst this does not make it all okay, it opens your eye to maybe not judge someone on face value. The MC offers a varied personality showing multiple angles to his thought process and more importantly his internal monologues. They are some of the best VA and scripted pieces I have listened to.Enjoyment 9/10I personally loved the show as you can see from my review, I do sense there will be a large portion of people who dislike it due to the complexity of the story or other reasons they may have. For me it just wanted me to think more and try to understand the story and unravel the characters personalities even further. I will definitely be re-watching this show in a year or so to refresh it in my brain and maybe see if I missed out a certain aspect. Even without re-watching it I do feel that it will still be a memorable show.Overall 9/10This is worth a watch if you’re into complex stories or you’re just intrigued about the story itself.

I found it so sad the fact it\'s not well known and not very liked and actually, I can understand why but at the same time I feel people should give it a chance even if it is kind difficult to understand and enjoy plot because all the accelerated psychological matters.Nowadays, it\'s very rare to bump into an anime series like this, so emotionally dedicated and heartbreaking (in the most beautiful way.) The characters traumas, relationships and developing are so exquisitive exposed that you worry like...hell for them. I love how they managed to explain the links between abandonment-protection and abuse-love, and how a little kindness can save a person that would make save another one in the near future, only in just 13 episodes...The ""villain"" Katsuragi is so human (his backstory that we get to watch at the end is really sad and heartwhelming, I didn\'t expected it at all! So that was an enjoyable surprise) I just cried how unfair it is he finished like that at the end. Hayashi is the good person that makes bad decisions but always trying to do all he can with all he knows. Satoru is sensitive but strong, he keeps moving forward because he has hope even if he is hurt. And omg, I let Tsukasa and Hiroki at the end because they are the very SPECIAL to me, they are the core of the series; It had been so long since I didn\'t watch hella pure pair like this two.Tsukasa is fragile because he comes from the abandonment but Hayashi showed him love for the first time so of course he loves him too but more from the deep down, that\'s why he gets corrupted and obsessive, and here is when Hiroki comes in, oh my, you see the way Hiroki sees Tsukasa and it gives you goosebumps, it\'s an odd love like, it can be from a maternal love as a romantic love, from a brotherly love as a platonic-idyllic one. Even though, Hiroki\'s love is the purer because even when he was very obsessed with Tsukasa at first, the more the story continues, we realize that Hiroki just wants Tsukasa to be happy and nothing else, he only wants both to be freely together, he doesn\'t want to hide him or to hold him back, he wants him free.Hiroki is doing what everyone in this plot should had done since the beginning; go beyond the possesive-obsessive broken love from the inconditional-genuine pure love. Hiroki got to fight alone carrying with the weight of Tsukasa\'s coldness and indifference in a wise and brave manner (he wants to save him even if Tsukasa don\'t need him or love him anymore), even getting along with Satoru who Hiroki was so jealous from at first TuT, and this is why Hiroki and Satoru (because he also is obssesive-love free) reach the promise land (the gorgeous dream-like place at the end of episode 13) and Tsukasa stayed behind because he is still trapped inside that suffering spiral of crooked love but he deserves to get to that land too, remember that Tsukasa\'s love comes from a pure form and he is always fighting albeit he is wrong and Hiroki understands it perfectly; he is the company and influence Tsukasa needs, he is not alone. So I hope we get to see them reunited there one day, it must be.Well, the rest I didn\'t mention here is much as good as what I did mention hehe, I love all the characters even the less important ones, they where just necessary and that\'s cool. I love Jin, the characters design, the sceneries, the psychological-surrealistic stuff and the music are terrific!

For some reason I was expecting something like Bungo Stray Dogs... man this anime is the EXACT OPPOSITE! This is why you should always go into anime\'s without having any expectations.Let\'s get down to the anime basic. Story; You follow the partners Hiroki and Tsukasa working odd jobs for the ""Company"". Hiroki no longer wants to work for the ""Company"" that decides what to do with his life, so Tsukasa lets him open up a shop and work for himself. Little did they know...this would screw things up for the both of them. Hiroki becomes depressed without his Peak giver and Tsukasa ends up damaging himself in his own way. That\'s what I got from the story. Till the very end, everything revolved around these two making stupid ass mistakes. Art; the stye for this anime was beautiful. The inside of everyone\'s Peaks, minds and what I\'d like to call the deepest/darkest parts of their minds HELL looked amazing. Sound; You can\'t go wrong with a little TK <3 the whisper of his voice gives me goose bumps and chills. Characters; They didn\'t really build up the characters backgrounds till the end of the anime, but one thing they made me feel was sorry for every single one of them. This anime just reminds me to never touch the human mind and memories if i\'m ever given the chance.Overall, it was an anime worth watching. I wasn\'t expecting a Psychological anime, but man did this mess me up. I really want to know what Satoru and Hiroki end up doing, so I might pick up the manga to find out. this would screw things up for the both of them.

Didn\'t regret watching, but probably wouldn\'t watch a 2nd time if nostalgia bias didn\'t exist. Probably had a good message, was a guilty pleasure, or the story was solid.The last three episodes of this anime was definitely a roller coaster, and in a good way, too. It makes me hope that the story will continue if it finished that strong. That\'s as far as I\'ll go with spoilers. The previous 10 episodes were kind of just okay though.So I do have more praise for this anime than I do nitpicking. I have to remind myself that a 6 isn\'t necessarily...bad. The difference between a 6 and a 7 is ""Do I want to watch this for a second time?"" and the answer here is no. I\'d like to see if the story continues, but I feel like I got it the first time, and that\'s good enough for me.So what do I start with? The good or the bad? Well, the OP is by TK from whatever the hell band, so that\'s a plus. The world this anime is set in is also interesting. The idea of an evil company using people to alter people\'s memories and kill them. It\'s something different, at least to me. So the originality is basically solid is what I\'m saying.It\'s a mystery story, and the story unravels very slowly. That may be a knock because it took me until around episode 7 or 8 to really get invested into the story.   By then the climax was already in place, and it really took me for a ride.There are twists! And good twists as well! Not like, ""oh, so this was the real enemy!"" but like, ""Ok! I didn\'t expect that."" And yes, it was mainly near the end of the anime. But it was effective in wanting you to see what will end up happening.I enjoy that none of the characters are really idiots. They make wrong choices in the sense that they thought what they were doing was right or necessary, but each character is highly intelligent and perceptive. When you have a bunch of characters that are put against each other that are smart, it creates an atmosphere of curiosity. Who is going to outsmart who? Who is going to come out on top? I didn\'t predict the ending this anime had, and that\'s good. Being able to listen to a characters inner thoughts while they\'re interreacting with another person was well done.So why would I watch it for a second time? It just didn\'t capitate me like that. The story was solid, animation was solid, but it didn\'t blow me away. I\'m not coming out of this anime thinking, ""wow episode 4-7 was awesome!"" I can only say that for a few episodes, and even then I may be gassing some of those up. It\'s solid. That\'s all I can say. But would I want to watch this again with future wifey? Nah, I\'m not wasting her time. And that\'s where I stand on this being a 6.It\'s fine, but it aint that good. bad.

Kokkoku, Golden Kamuy and Pet are masterpieces. Each anime has different stories but gives this similar dark vibe.Now about Pet, when I watched the trailer on Youtube I thought to myself ""this looks so cool, I\'m definitely going to watch this"" and surprise surprise Pet didn\'t disappoint me.But I must say the first episode was kinda confusing so I didn\'t catch the story at first but it became clear to me when I watched episode two.I don\'t want to spoil everything but one thing I can tell you is Pet won\'t disappoint you.Everything about this...anime is perfect, the story, the art, the opening (it\'s my boy Tk from ling tosite sigure) and the ending.I know everyone has their own preferences but please don\'t let this masterpiece go unnoticed.Anyway if you have nothing to watch, you should watch this anime.

I quite enjoyed all of the story by the end, and I also think that the ideas behind the show are quite interesting. At about episode 5, or 6 I felt like I fully understood most of the rules and terminology in the show when talking about things like peaks, valleys, doors, and locks, and around that episode mark is when the larger picture...of what is happening and has happened to our main characters comes into play. At that point I would also say the show becomes more enjoyable because we learn more about the world and characters and how their pasts affect the present. Even though there will not be a season two most likely due to the fact that the manga has been done since 2003, it is unlikely any new material will be made by the author, but if more is made, it would be pretty easy to continue the story based on the ending of the first season.In conclusion, I'm sure this anime is not for everyone, and after looking at the reviews on MAL it's a bit sad that its rated that low, but I would say for someone who likes mind-bending stories with inception like qualities and some mystery, this would be a great show for you. of what is happening and has happened to our main characters comes into play.

The drama behind the characters how they are all intertwined, how they are in the end the story would end up for them. This is exactly how a high octane thriller drama would be good.

Fantastic music, great art, mysterious story, and the story picks up and takes off. However, near the end of the first episode, for me at least, this all fell apart.For whatever reason i thought this would be a sort of team of misfits...a unique story with maybe some philosophy thrown in on how human memory is so relied on but so unreliable. Nope. 100% got smacked in the face with character default A...and character default B. i will not go into details in case this is a spoiler.Like a lot of shows that try to do the trippy ""dream-world"" type mind thing (i know SUPER general but remember, no spoilers and this is not at all a spoiler trust me) it spends way too much time explaining why things are done in this specific world instead of explaining why i should care why it is doneDon\'t get me wrong, ""I"" am not important. But generally, a story is told because there\'s something to be shared, and in this show....it feels more like a foreign soap opera but i\'m just not from that galaxy so i have no idea what the hell all the drama is about.Also, it is a huge pet peeve of mine when a show tries to sound super smart with made up words and philosophy that ONLY relate to this fictional world BabyCOUGHlon...so to see whiny boy that wants to shelter and stoic emotionless prime husbando that wants solve.....i sigh and go walk my dog.I guess this foggy cloud of a review is due to my excitement after looking into this story and what it would have been.

It tries to explain to you many things in a short period of time but if you can't process it at their speed then you are left confused through the entire show. It was really hard for me because i'm not an english speaker and can only watch it with english subs and even english speakers are confused.I had to look up the meaning of some concepts this show had so I could...better understand the show but that's a downside considering that I had to do that instead of rewatching the episode.Also, I don't think this show is meant to be watched week by week but don't quote me on that one.Overall It's a pretty good show but it's hard to watch if it explains everything at Monogatari speed but without the visual information. better understand the show but that's a downside considering that I had to do that instead of rewatching the episode.Also, I don't think this show is meant to be watched week by week but don't quote me on that one.Overall It's a pretty good show but it's hard to watch if it explains everything at Monogatari speed but without the visual information."", 'So, this title has possibly the worst synopsis of any anime ever, and there have been a lot of contenders for thatThis is... the sort of thing that becomes a cult classic, though that really hasnt happened with Pet so far probably partially because it has some gay overtones that your standard anime watcher really cant handle.Just from the opener you can already tell that this is going to have fucked up visuals, but you cant really tell if its just going to be edgy, or camp, or truly disgusting, or what.Unlike most anime, you cant really tell what this one is going to be...like from the first episode or two, in fact this is barely an anime, as its hard to say it particularly conforms to any anime tropes.In fact, this anime doesnt really give anything away that it doesnt have to, every step seems to inevitably follow the last, without you ever really getting a clear picture of where you\'re going. I have rarely seen anything so suspenseful.Its hard to say you\'re worried about the characters, but its more that the audience is constantly invited to pose the question ""is this really happening? shit it is"" and watch as it all unfolds. like from the first episode or two, in fact this is barely an anime, as its hard to say it particularly conforms to any anime tropes.In fact, this anime doesnt really give anything away that it doesnt have to, every step seems to inevitably follow the last, without you ever really getting a clear picture of where you\'re going.

And while...the accompanying visuals aren’t great, those bits of the characters with pained expressions together with the music left quite an impression on me.Another thing that really struck me was at the very end, when the characters who made it through everything, suddenly reached SOMETHING and realized that surely there was a point to EVERYTHING. Because that something seems to say ‘Yes’, even if you don’t immediately know what it is saying that about or to whom.The audiovisual experience of this show gets a pass from me.

There is definitely a point to all of this and it is worth it.And now you too have found a ‘Yes’ in an unlikely place.', 'Well how to put this.I did drop PET before for few months because the first 5 eps were so hard to cling on for me, and I understand some who’ve dropped and the rating is also bad. Then, last week, I decided to finish it because I was bored, and boy, I regretted for not finishing it.This show is all about shitty people who runs a company on their demanding and basically interfered other people into their shitty acts aswell. As I take it as this anime is serious, it really does blow my mind for the last few eps. I can’t take my eyes...of the screen, because it’s so good.I recommend to watch this, a solid 8/10 if you are into new type of anime that is dark, cruel, twist and most characters were very unlikable at first. That’s basically it for me, gonna rewatch it again. of the screen, because it’s so good.I recommend to watch this, a solid 8/10 if you are into new type of anime that is dark, cruel, twist and most characters were very unlikable at first. That’s basically it for me, gonna rewatch it again.', ""On the surface level, everything about PET will drive most audiences off: the subpar character design, the mediocre animations and horrible mixings and sounds designs. As for voice acting, the Japanese side is decent, but considering large chunks of the dialogues are spoken in Mandarin by non-Chinese people... It's very bad for anyone who speaks the language like myself.With all that, I am confident to say that if you like good drama and usually look for good stories in anime. Then you own it to yourself to ignore the downsides and watch this anime. Because it has the best story of anything from 2020,...by far.The unique relationships between characters are defined by their special powers, creating conflicts impossible in any other stories. With the setting and supernatural abilities acting as a metaphor for the message the anime is trying to convey: what drives a person to continue living? That question being challenged time and time again throughout the story and ultimately elevated to another level by the end.Enough has been said about studio geno and their inadequacies. Yet I can't but feel respect towards them. They could be adapting shitty light novels like every other company in their calibre, yet they choose to not do that. If it wasn't for studios like this, most would have forgotten niche stories from 10, 20 years ago like PET. I think there is something quite commendable and even romantic about it, preserving stories that should not be forgotten with time. Sometimes, before we talk about how good something is, we should talk about how many of its kinds are left.Lastly, I would like to talk about my interpretations of what the writer is trying to tell us. Full spoilers ahead, only proceed when you have completed the series.In my opinion, peaks represent a person's drive and motivation. Since pets borrow theirs from someone else, you can say their will to live is based on someone else. Tsukasa did all the shitty things because of that dependency on Hayashi. When he lost that connection, he lost his drive to live and did everything he could to re-establish that bond. I think that's the reason for Satoru and Hiroki finding out where Hayashi's peaks came from. Even though their peaks will still look the same, they have a different meaning now. Theirs are no long borrowed from someone else's but are their own now. Unlike Tsukasa, they no longer live for someone else but are their own person now.Unlike characters in the anime, we don't have superpowers and our peaks are not as well visualized and defined. What we do have are motivations and reasons that drives us forward. Things that we live for. We can be like Tsukasa, borrowing others' peaks and dreams. In other words, living for someone else's sake. Eventually, when you have to be separated from that person, you will have nothing to protect you from all the valleys in your heart and the world.

Akin to Inception, this is a story that explores memories with certain abilities, here they\'re only acquired by neurodivergent people. The cast is full of people that understandably have sensitive outlooks and personalities, leaning into how unpredictable they can be with powers. The debates on how to deal with them, the leash cast on them since the beginning of their consciousness in life, it\'s really tragic.If...you work with people that can change memories, how can you even be sure yours are your own?

Plus, there\'s always something extra morbid and dehumanizing about manipulating a person\'s mind for evil purposes.

Even if you are baffled and a little confused by all the nitty-gritties and jargons of the hypnotizing/mind manipulation, just follow the characters who struggle for their humanity, dignity and freedom, and you won\'t be lost in this complex story.The show can be too dark and disturbing even for jaded audiences as we see the brutal consequences of hypnotizing (especially the technique called ""destroying"" which melts a person\'s mind into a pile of goo and turns that person into a vegetable). The mere suggestion that an elite group of hypnotizers might exist out there in the real world can make your hair stand. The brutality in Pet is very heavy-handed and can potentially be nightmare fuel. That is my main complaint with the show. Other than that, some obsolete depictions of overseas Chinese can also be problematic and even offensive (e.g. Chinese characters mostly having distinctive kinky eyes, ladies always wearing cheongsam, etc.).

Persona 5 the Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36023/Persona_5_the_Animation,"['Unfortunately for game anime adaptations, they have a steep hill to climb to recapture the magic you get from playing through them.Persona 5, another addition to the long time SMT/Persona series was a huge success in both the west and in Japan. It won 2017 Game Awards “RPG of the Year” And was ranked at was of the top games of the year by many gaming outlets. Even with that, the anime was considered a disappointment from the start. With its cheap animation, off-pacing at times, and generally its lack of what made the game special.However, my expectations played a part in the viewing experience....It was clear from the start that this wasn’t going to be like the game at all, as most game adaptations never are. Persona 5’s stand alone story is not what made the game special, rather just one factor. I wasn’t coming into this expecting what I got from the game, and neither should you. As I do see where most the criticism comes from, the root of it is from people who compare to the game, this probably isn’t a fair way to look at it. The game was made by thousands of more people, have had years to develop, and is generally taken more serious. This was a direct result of poor animation, bad pacing, and cutting out parts of the game. The anime should be given some slack in that regard.With all that being said, I am not trying to defend the bad parts of the P5 anime. They are noticeably apparent, and part of why it led to widespread hate of the P5 anime. The animation is sometimes shit. The CG usage was often bad, especially in the background characters walking around. The faraway faces are sometimes laughable. And although the pacing is considerably better in the second half of the show, the beginning is way too fast. Usually I wouldn’t give these issues a pass, but like I said since it was mainly being compared to the game I do. People who haven’t played the game probably won’t see that much of an issue in these.In many cases however, what likely appealed to you in the game should transition into the anime. If you like the characters, they will translate nicely. And of course, the music does as well. Chances are you didn’t complete everything in the game unless you played it through multiple times, so some of what you will be seeing from the characters could be a new experience. The character development was taken from the ‘confidant’ system so if you didn’t complete everyone’s confidant or maybe just were not paying attention you could be seeing new content. That along with the actual anime exclusive scenes, like seeing some of the characters in new situations, or seeing them given more backstory like showing them as children, gives the anime merit to watch even if you have played the game, a common criticism.There isn’t always something to say about P5TA. Largely because it is just doing what it was supposed to. There are both good and bad parts. If you want to experience the game but don’t want the time investment of playing through all of it, (and trust me, the game is huge) than this might be for you. If you are a fan of the game, than this might be for you. It doesn’t necessarily show everything the game has to offer, but doesn’t do anything too bad to diminish it either.You shouldn’t think too hard about this one.

I never expected it to surpass or even match the game’s quality, but with a director as talented as Masashi Ishihama (Shinsekai Yori) expectations were raised and this adaptation’s first six episodes have flown far below them.Story: 5/10A 100+ hour game stuffed into 24 episodes will inevitably have pacing issues, and this has its fair share. The...story is rushed as hell, but so far it has given us the most important information to give us a surface level understanding of the world and plot. Any depth the game's story offered is for the most part missing. The themes of adults in positions of power abusing their roles have been boiled down to “grown-ups bad, kids good”. Like most of this adaptation, any half-hearted attempts at storytelling feel like a low effort recap to advertise the much better video game.Character: 3/10We have only met Ryuji, Ann, Morgana, Yusuke, and the quiet main character called Ren in this adaptation. They all feel like cardboard cutouts with a fraction of the personalities of the game's counterparts. Trying to stay as faithful as possible to the game has hamstrung the character arcs, story beats are trimmed down or skipped entirely so we can't get a sense of who the main cast are from this show. The game itself was not perfect with characterization either, which is expectedly not fixed in this adaptation due to the insistence on staying as faithful as possible rather than letting the anime stand on its own merits.There’s plenty of inconsistencies in their arcs and annoying quirks that made some of them hard to like before they received development. These annoying quirks, like Ryuji’s obnoxious attitude and lack of self-awareness, become almost all there is to the characters. There just isn't enough time for each cast member to be developed beyond a surface level.Even those inconsistencies in development are already appearing. In episode 4 Ann announces she’s finally free of the twisted pervert Kamoshida who was sexually objectifying her, but because this is a lovely A-1 Pictures anime, the camera is constantly shoved uncomfortably close to her butt. You could argue plenty of fanservice is necessary for the studio to secure a budget, but it is so opposite to the message the game was trying to convey. Effectively undoing any development that came from what should have been the most monumental battle in the first quarter of the show.Art: 3/10Action scenes are where the series looks the worst. It constantly uses this laughable shortcut of zooming in and out on unanimated shots to reuse them at a different resolution in a later scene. There’s somehow less animation than the game, and what we see tends to be worse. Look no further than the ‘epic’ boss battle in episode 5, what should have been amazing was stilted by hideous CGI that looked even worse than what was used in the game. The action is so boring to watch too because there are next to no stakes, usually, the Phantom Thieves are fighting random mobs but even the boss goes down so quickly.The fight choreography is even worse, the whole battle scene where Ryuji awakens his persona is the worst case of it. There is next to no fight choreography at all, hits don't even feel like hits, it's more like colors flying around with sound effects added over it. And somehow the all all-out-attack is so much worse than the game’s even though it was practically ripped straight from it.Character designs are the best part of the visuals because they’re lifted straight from the game, but they only look good when they’re totally motionless or on an animation loop (very often). When there's not much movement and/or character close-ups look really good but by that logic, you should just play the game.There’s also plenty of ugly CGI random people walking in the background. In episode 2 Ren and his teacher are talking in a hallway, and there’s a giant CGI student trying desperately to walk without looking like a robot but its so obvious he was stuck on there last minute with zero quality control to fix him. He looks ridiculously unpolished and the perspective is all messed up, he goes past two girls standing near a door and he looks twice as large as them.Sound: 6/10Persona 5's OST is amazing, but here it's lifted straight out of the game and overused with not care for if it fits the scene or not (usually it doesn’t). You can easily tell when they use stock sound effects, deafening the punchy effects of the game’s combat for the sake of something easier on the ears but infinitely more forgettable. Yes, they fixed the OP and it is decent now, but the ED is still just a still image with limbs and hair being animated to look like the main cast is walking. It looks so uncanny, a completely still image would have at least not distracted from the pretty good song.Overall: 4/10I honestly can’t see this getting any better, but I love the game and respect the director enough to see if it can repair the story/character issues. I’m not expecting the art to get better because it seems as though they’re stretching the budget out to meet 24 episodes.If they try to simplify the character designs to be more fitting to a TV anime budget rather than solely faithful to the game, it may become more manageable for A-1 to animate. Also, I've referred to CloverWorks as A-1 a few times, there's no difference. It's a subsidiary of A-1 so they're the same. story is rushed as hell, but so far it has given us the most important information to give us a surface level understanding of the world and plot. Any depth the game's story offered is for the most part missing. The themes of adults in positions of power abusing their roles have been boiled down to “grown-ups bad, kids good”. Like most of this adaptation, any half-hearted attempts at storytelling feel like a low effort recap to advertise the much better video game.Character: 3/10We have only met Ryuji, Ann, Morgana, Yusuke, and the quiet main character called Ren in this adaptation. They all feel like cardboard cutouts with a fraction of the personalities of the game's counterparts. Trying to stay as faithful as possible to the game has hamstrung the character arcs, story beats are trimmed down or skipped entirely so we can't get a sense of who the main cast are from this show. The game itself was not perfect with characterization either, which is expectedly not fixed in this adaptation due to the insistence on staying as faithful as possible rather than letting the anime stand on its own merits.There’s plenty of inconsistencies in their arcs and annoying quirks that made some of them hard to like before they received development. These annoying quirks, like Ryuji’s obnoxious attitude and lack of self-awareness, become almost all there is to the characters. There just isn't enough time for each cast member to be developed beyond a surface level.Even those inconsistencies in development are already appearing. In episode 4 Ann announces she’s finally free of the twisted pervert Kamoshida who was sexually objectifying her, but because this is a lovely A-1 Pictures anime, the camera is constantly shoved uncomfortably close to her butt. You could argue plenty of fanservice is necessary for the studio to secure a budget, but it is so opposite to the message the game was trying to convey. Effectively undoing any development that came from what should have been the most monumental battle in the first quarter of the show.Art: 3/10Action scenes are where the series looks the worst. It constantly uses this laughable shortcut of zooming in and out on unanimated shots to reuse them at a different resolution in a later scene. There’s somehow less animation than the game, and what we see tends to be worse. Look no further than the ‘epic’ boss battle in episode 5, what should have been amazing was stilted by hideous CGI that looked even worse than what was used in the game. The action is so boring to watch too because there are next to no stakes, usually, the Phantom Thieves are fighting random mobs but even the boss goes down so quickly.The fight choreography is even worse, the whole battle scene where Ryuji awakens his persona is the worst case of it. There is next to no fight choreography at all, hits don't even feel like hits, it's more like colors flying around with sound effects added over it. And somehow the all all-out-attack is so much worse than the game’s even though it was practically ripped straight from it.Character designs are the best part of the visuals because they’re lifted straight from the game, but they only look good when they’re totally motionless or on an animation loop (very often). When there's not much movement and/or character close-ups look really good but by that logic, you should just play the game.There’s also plenty of ugly CGI random people walking in the background. In episode 2 Ren and his teacher are talking in a hallway, and there’s a giant CGI student trying desperately to walk without looking like a robot but its so obvious he was stuck on there last minute with zero quality control to fix him. He looks ridiculously unpolished and the perspective is all messed up, he goes past two girls standing near a door and he looks twice as large as them.Sound: 6/10Persona 5's OST is amazing, but here it's lifted straight out of the game and overused with not care for if it fits the scene or not (usually it doesn’t). You can easily tell when they use stock sound effects, deafening the punchy effects of the game’s combat for the sake of something easier on the ears but infinitely more forgettable. Yes, they fixed the OP and it is decent now, but the ED is still just a still image with limbs and hair being animated to look like the main cast is walking. It looks so uncanny, a completely still image would have at least not distracted from the pretty good song.Overall: 4/10I honestly can’t see this getting any better, but I love the game and respect the director enough to see if it can repair the story/character issues.

Its source material had around 5 hours worth of actual content like is implied in its name, yet playing the whole thing takes around 140 hours because it\'s a classic J-RPG game that relies on repeating the same thing 18500 times.Unfortunate for the fans of the game, the anime end up being 26 episodes long when it should have been 500, and unfortunate for anime fans, the anime end up being 26 episodes long when it should have been 13.As far as fillers go, filler is canon content I mean, Persona 5...is full of slice of life nonsense that has nothing to do with anything. People fighting over pieces of bread and talking about their dreams just to make sure the pacing will become harder to comprehend than the popularity of the franchise itself.What is directorship? is what I found myself often asking when seeing how Persona 5 is build to be nothing but a collection of random scenes that were edited together without any consistency or flow that makes the next scene related to the former one. Screen transitions seem to be some sort of ""worst animated cabbage"" meme when the focus goes from pan fights in the middle of the day to a scene where we drink coffee in the evening to a bully scene and finally returns to a scene where the actual pan is being eaten in a time that seems to be the very next day. The shots mainly remind me of Resident Evil The Final Chapter (movie) where the camera angle could change 45 times a minute over the same scene except here it changes from scene to another in ludicrous tempo. Visual storytelling at its finest. Bravo.Our main characters are incredibly random. They mainly remind me of Suicide Squad. By Suicide Squad, I mean every superhero movie ever because that thing was exactly as good as they all are. The real mc is some sort of mixture of Robin Hood and Jesus. The female lead appears very mysterious, but the real mystery is why would anyone care. She is pretty hot, tho. The blonde dude is like spiderman but sassy. All the other girls were just swag, but gladfully there was like 7 beach episodes so they really had time showing off their naked bodies as it\'s not like they had anything else to show. None of the side characters feel like genuine persons, they are more like NPC\'s who only exist for the main characters... oh wait.What is this series all about even, you ask. And that\'s what I am still wondering. Teenagers with stand powers are participating inside some sort of fighting tournament shonen storyline that mainly reminds me of Katekyou Hitman Reborn (we even have the same mascot here) except the comedy was replaced with some type of combination of angst and edgy, the villains are evil adults, the actual events are Robin Hood with superpowers and most of it is slice of life. As epic as it might sound, what it really sounded like was a wet fart.The only good thing about the game itself was the OST. Unfortunately, voice acting is always at louder volume than the OST, and SFX above all else. Boy don\'t we love it when explosions cover the music. It really fits the definition of a background music because instead of trying to make the series better by using the songs to their full potential, they are just there hanging in the background. It\'s pretty much a stupid decision.Our art is at least pretty fun if not otherwise impressive. Villains wearing strings and cloaks made of fur offer the most original content in the entire series. Some of the leather suits were also pretty sexy. Especially the art room looked cool as fudge. Too bad its overall screen time totaled 3 seconds. Like literally. Not that even these things would be worth of praising in a series that had some other merits. Pretty much all side characters follow the ""spot the main character"" tier filler/design. is full of slice of life nonsense that has nothing to do with anything.

Most of my opinions haven\'t really changed so bits and pieces will remain the same. No amount of additional content helped to save this anime and it only slightly picked itself up towards later episodes. Sega/Atlus should not be tolerating this kind of quality and I do sincerely hope they get out of whatever sort of contract they\'re in, if there is one, before they decide to...ruin another property in anime form.Let\'s begin, no spoilers unless I explicitly say they\'re about to come.P5 is a good game with a lot of good things to take away from it. Its overall story however, is a bit of a rollercoaster going from great to average. Lots of things they could work on, but nevertheless it\'s a solid entry with a solid cast, art, music, etc.. If you\'re wondering whether or not the *game* is worth your time, then sure. It probably is. Please don\'t go looking at this anime for your answers because chances are that you won\'t find them here.-- ANIMATION:Let\'s start with the big one. The animation is hilariously poor and is a stark contrast to the game\'s visual presentation. Persona 3, 4 (not Golden) and to an extent Devil Survivor 2 properties have been treated quite nicely with solid animation, and I certainly never cringed at any 1 frame. P5A however is so laughably bad to the point where it\'s sometimes even unbelievable.From the awkward running cycles shown in the first couple of minutes of the first episode to the new, overly lazy All-Out Attack meme scene of the second episode and out of place CGI characters that roam the corridors and street to episode 12\'s (~9:30) scene where they tried to zoom out on a character but the character layer and the background layer were done to two different levels of zoom so basically the kind of nonsense you might accidentally do in your 2011 YouTube videos. This is NOT stuff that you just accidentally miss. My favourite part was when they brought out a low quality P5 model of Makoto in episode 11.To say that this is an attempt to capitalise on P5\'s success would be an understatement. Ironic considering the story\'s themes.-- SOUND:Shoji Meguro is still amazing with music. Whatever he creates makes me the very happy. The first opening song is brilliant, the second opening song is brilliant, the ending song is brilliant; Lyn\'s voice is great and Shoji knows how to create music. Actually using his music at the right moments however is a different story. I\'m primarily thinking of the Ryuji awakening scene at the moment, the song choice and awkward sync was noticeable and took away from what should have been a very powerful moment for the character, like it was in game. This is frequent.Episode 12 (I believe it was) had begun using P5D music, in particular the Jazztronik remix of game\'s main theme and Konishi\'s Blooming Villain. Considering P5D was released like a week ago from this episode\'s release, their inclusions here all of a sudden made me think that this episode had only been completed fairly recently. Had they gotten the rights to such music beforehand, would they not have used more remixes in earlier episodes? And even if this idea of it being rushed was false, that sort of thought process shouldn\'t have existed in the first place.The sound design in terms of effects and ambiance is quite poor as well. I made a note of episode 16 having used stock sound effects, or what sounded as such, but either way it sounded very unprofessional and cheap.-- STORY:The pacing feels awfully fast and unnatural, with them cutting out a bunch of stuff that ultimately added to the game\'s story and development of its characters. They cut out the part where Kamoshida asks Ren if he wants a ride where he says ""Nah"" and that... man I was sitting there, anticipating the ""nah"" but they didn\'t do it and I was just blue balled. I may have cried a little even. With 24 episodes just like Persona 4 the Animation (which structurally was similar), you would assume they wouldn\'t need to rush but alas we got a 2 longer episode extension. Tips for next time: focus on filtering out the long and drawn out shots of the rain. I personally do not believe they added to the plot!Also as a quick note, watched the show on Crunchyroll where they awkwardly linked Kamoshida to being in a train accident in the first episode or something and then relate that accident indirectly to the phantom thieves... which never happened in the game nor really happens in the anime. It was just worded really poorly. Someone with more time can tell you if the show was poorly translated.A positive though, I do like how they ended the show with an ambiguous ending, did we get the ""good ending"" or the ""bad ending"" thing; obviously leading to their OVA but it was nifty none-the-less. However, always with the howevers, they did say they were going to sway away from the original ending with the OVA so when I they left on a note of ambiguity I got very excited...The ending was not different.-- CHARACTERS:In my personal opinion, Persona typically does its characters really well -- formulating them in such a way that makes them more human than just characters playing their part in a story. However in P5A, they\'re... well gee, they not done very well lads.The protagonist (Ren) comes off initially as this angsty, edgy and depressed teen, and with such dialogue options from the game as ""Please look after me"" and ""Hell yeah I\'m into older women"", I was expecting a lot more of that silly aspect of the character. Of course, Ren as a character is up to interpretation so I can\'t really say it\'s ""wrong"". The other characters though, well yes I can.Sojiro feels so monotone and boring. The first couple of moments in the actual game set him up as a character who doesn\'t want to bother with you, effectively helping to establish one of the best character development arcs in the story where he starts to take on a more open and fatherly personality. He just sort of feels \'there\' in the anime, to progress the story when we need him to. Ryuji was fine until his rushed awakening and overreaction to Ren\'s story. There\'s something about him but I cannot put my finger on it just yet. Morgana is there, Igor looks dumb, Mishima didn\'t get hit by a ball, and I can finally understand why Shiho wanted to jump.Ann is definitely the worst change though. Ann\'s whole arc was supposed to be about her feelings towards objectification and slowly acknowledging herself as an attractive individual, using that fact for good. But what happens the episode after she goes on her whole ""don\'t objectify me"" spiel? They simply objectify her. Constant fanservicey shots, close ups of the icky unmentionables, you name it, they did it.-- OVERALL:This show has been making me very sad and I\'m not entirely hopeful for Dark Sun. There\'s nothing much more to say except that I hope Sega/Atlus start giving their properties back to competent studios. Tune in next time for when I show you how to hack into the Pentagon using only Futaba\'s social link. ruin another property in anime form.Let\'s begin, no spoilers unless I explicitly say they\'re about to come.P5 is a good game with a lot of good things to take away from it.

Which is understandable due to it being difficult to cram so much storytelling into another form of media and condense it. There is also the fact that they bring the problems of the video game and try to adapt it into another form of media with those problems. Some examples include the adaptation of characters, their backstories, personalities and glossing over key plot points, believing that the viewer or reader already knows the details.Now I\'ve always admired the Persona games as an outsider since I have never played the games. So this was...a chance to inspect the story of a Persona game through the ease of use of watching it in anime form. But instead of judging and comparing it to the Persona game, I will judge it on its own merits and see how good it is as an anime and how it has been translated while still acknowledging it is an adaption. Spoiler alert, it didn\'t do well.Sit back, relax and google what the f**k a Persona is as I present to the anime review for Persona 5: The Animation. Lets begin.Story: 4/10The story begins with our main protagonist Ren Amamiya leaping around and trying to escape a casino until he is stopped and captured by the authorities. From there, someone comes into the interrogation room. An investigator by the name of Sae Niijuma tells Ren that she is willing to help Ren plead not guilty if he tells her everything about the Phantom thieves and their actions. The Phantom thieves are a vigilante group that steals peoples\' ""hearts"" to confess their sins to everyone that they have wronged. From there we see the events that have led to this moment and get acquainted to the Phantom thieves, their motivations and their desired goals to see justice against horrible people.The shows story structure is very formulaic. The phantom thieves encounter a very horrible person, get closer to them, change their heart, add a new recruit to the phantom thieves and move on to a bigger target. Every. Single. Time. There is some downtime between these in order to get attached to our characters more, which is good. Having downtime between these helps balance the pace out so we are not just going around in circles. But it doesn\'t change the fact that these castle raids to change peoples\' hearts are boring to watch over and over again with only slight deviation. Not only do you know what is going to happen, but there is little variation between them on how it is structured.And while I say the pace is balanced, it is also unbalanced as these castle raids have so many cutaways that it makes it all feel rushed and we don\'t get concrete buildup to it all when they encounter the final boss of the area. Context is key here as it helps flesh out the story and characters, but rushing to the important bits leaves the impression that nothing else is important other than this scene that we are trying to get to in order to show you this cool scene.Characters: 5/10Man, Ren is such a boring and bland character. I know portraying silent protagonists is hard but their personalities are driven by their actions and by you, the player. But translating that into an anime is very difficult. Instead, Ren resorts to being a near silent protagonist. The problem is that being a near silent protagonist, you are relying on your actions to speak for you, which is something the this show doesn\'t do. Ren does nothing interesting outside of the Phantom Thieves to expand and personalise his character. Too many times the anime cuts the meat off the side activities to help expand Ren\'s character. This leaves a main protagonist mind you, with no personality whatsoever as he merely just agrees and nods to other characters.Now does the rest of the cast share this same problem? Wellllll, not really. Individually, they do have their own personality traits to make them interesting but they are much better when they are together and these multiple personalities integrate with one another. They also get expanded upon in an episode dedicated to them to develop them more, which is something that Ren doesn\'t get unfortunately. The entire Phantom Thieves group hides Ren\'s lack of a personality by having multiple different personalities in the group work together to achieve the same goal. There individual personalities though. While they are better than Ren\'s personality (which isn\'t saying much), they do start to become a bit stale and boring. As well as some of the characters personality traits start to blend into one another as the show goes on.Animation: 5.5/10Well it certainly captures the Persona style but in execution, it does fall flat. It feels like there were many cutbacks and so the overall animation quality has dropped from what I was expecting. Too many cutaways affected the fight scenes to make them feel lackluster and not capture the overall feel of watching these awesome moves be portrayed effectively. Instead, they just feel like they don\'t have as much of an impact as they should. This is especially true in the finishing manoeuvre sequence as it really feels lackluster. On the bright side though, the art style is rock solid and really does capture the Persona series which thank god it does because Persona is styled like an anime after all. There is also a good amount of CGI used in this show as well and while I don\'t think it looks horrible, it isn\'t great looking either; it\'s just okay.Sound: 9/10Sound is the one area I have little to no complaints about. The OST has a very cool style to it and it really does stand out. From calm, collective soundtracks, to alert soundtracks to battle soundtracks. Each of them is distinct from one another and I can immediately recognise which one is playing at that moment. So at least this part of the anime is solid.Likewise the openings do help set a tone and are enjoyable to listen to. Both opening 1, ""BREAK IN TO BREAK OUT"" by Lyn and opening 2, ""Dark Sun..."" by Lyn as well are probably where the animation style actually shines and is well choreographed. While Dark sun took a little bit to get going for me, it is still enjoyable to watch and listen to. But Break in to Break out, for me, is the better of the two due to not having scenes ripped straight from the episodes before hand and the song being more fun to listen to due to its better build up towards the chorus.The endings, while also having good songs to listen to, is hampered down by simple animation as all it features is the cast just walking side by side, looking ahead of them, doing nothing else. I mean I know that it is meant to calm the viewer after watching the episode but it is boring to watch. But I still watched them because the songs were enjoyable to listen to.ConclusionFor me, Persona 5: the animation feels like a half assed attempt to adapt the game into an anime. Everything feels rushed as to say this is a summary of what the story is. For someone that has not played Persona 5 like myself, that\'s disappointing. I wanted an alternative to experience the Persona 5 story and characters, not a cheap way to make an anime while Persona 5 is still somewhat relevant before it gets swarmed by other big name games. It is a disappointment to me and I imagine many others and is a poor adaptation of an otherwise fantastic game. Unless you never played Persona 5 and you are really curious or a diehard Persona fan, you can skip this one.My Personal Enjoyment: 5/10Overall score: 5.7/10  Recommendation: Don\'t Bother a chance to inspect the story of a Persona game through the ease of use of watching it in anime form. But instead of judging and comparing it to the Persona game, I will judge it on its own merits and see how good it is as an anime and how it has been translated while still acknowledging it is an adaption. Spoiler alert, it didn\'t do well.Sit back, relax and google what the f**k a Persona is as I present to the anime review for Persona 5: The Animation. Lets begin.Story: 4/10The story begins with our main protagonist Ren Amamiya leaping around and trying to escape a casino until he is stopped and captured by the authorities. From there, someone comes into the interrogation room. An investigator by the name of Sae Niijuma tells Ren that she is willing to help Ren plead not guilty if he tells her everything about the Phantom thieves and their actions. The Phantom thieves are a vigilante group that steals peoples\' ""hearts"" to confess their sins to everyone that they have wronged. From there we see the events that have led to this moment and get acquainted to the Phantom thieves, their motivations and their desired goals to see justice against horrible people.The shows story structure is very formulaic. The phantom thieves encounter a very horrible person, get closer to them, change their heart, add a new recruit to the phantom thieves and move on to a bigger target. Every. Single. Time. There is some downtime between these in order to get attached to our characters more, which is good. Having downtime between these helps balance the pace out so we are not just going around in circles. But it doesn\'t change the fact that these castle raids to change peoples\' hearts are boring to watch over and over again with only slight deviation. Not only do you know what is going to happen, but there is little variation between them on how it is structured.And while I say the pace is balanced, it is also unbalanced as these castle raids have so many cutaways that it makes it all feel rushed and we don\'t get concrete buildup to it all when they encounter the final boss of the area. Context is key here as it helps flesh out the story and characters, but rushing to the important bits leaves the impression that nothing else is important other than this scene that we are trying to get to in order to show you this cool scene.Characters: 5/10Man, Ren is such a boring and bland character. I know portraying silent protagonists is hard but their personalities are driven by their actions and by you, the player. But translating that into an anime is very difficult. Instead, Ren resorts to being a near silent protagonist. The problem is that being a near silent protagonist, you are relying on your actions to speak for you, which is something the this show doesn\'t do. Ren does nothing interesting outside of the Phantom Thieves to expand and personalise his character. Too many times the anime cuts the meat off the side activities to help expand Ren\'s character. This leaves a main protagonist mind you, with no personality whatsoever as he merely just agrees and nods to other characters.Now does the rest of the cast share this same problem? Wellllll, not really. Individually, they do have their own personality traits to make them interesting but they are much better when they are together and these multiple personalities integrate with one another. They also get expanded upon in an episode dedicated to them to develop them more, which is something that Ren doesn\'t get unfortunately. The entire Phantom Thieves group hides Ren\'s lack of a personality by having multiple different personalities in the group work together to achieve the same goal. There individual personalities though. While they are better than Ren\'s personality (which isn\'t saying much), they do start to become a bit stale and boring. As well as some of the characters personality traits start to blend into one another as the show goes on.Animation: 5.5/10Well it certainly captures the Persona style but in execution, it does fall flat. It feels like there were many cutbacks and so the overall animation quality has dropped from what I was expecting. Too many cutaways affected the fight scenes to make them feel lackluster and not capture the overall feel of watching these awesome moves be portrayed effectively. Instead, they just feel like they don\'t have as much of an impact as they should. This is especially true in the finishing manoeuvre sequence as it really feels lackluster. On the bright side though, the art style is rock solid and really does capture the Persona series which thank god it does because Persona is styled like an anime after all. There is also a good amount of CGI used in this show as well and while I don\'t think it looks horrible, it isn\'t great looking either; it\'s just okay.Sound: 9/10Sound is the one area I have little to no complaints about. The OST has a very cool style to it and it really does stand out. From calm, collective soundtracks, to alert soundtracks to battle soundtracks. Each of them is distinct from one another and I can immediately recognise which one is playing at that moment. So at least this part of the anime is solid.Likewise the openings do help set a tone and are enjoyable to listen to. Both opening 1, ""BREAK IN TO BREAK OUT"" by Lyn and opening 2, ""Dark Sun..."" by Lyn as well are probably where the animation style actually shines and is well choreographed. While Dark sun took a little bit to get going for me, it is still enjoyable to watch and listen to. But Break in to Break out, for me, is the better of the two due to not having scenes ripped straight from the episodes before hand and the song being more fun to listen to due to its better build up towards the chorus.The endings, while also having good songs to listen to, is hampered down by simple animation as all it features is the cast just walking side by side, looking ahead of them, doing nothing else. I mean I know that it is meant to calm the viewer after watching the episode but it is boring to watch. But I still watched them because the songs were enjoyable to listen to.ConclusionFor me, Persona 5: the animation feels like a half assed attempt to adapt the game into an anime.

Unless you never played Persona 5 and you are really curious or a diehard Persona fan, you can skip this one.My Personal Enjoyment: 5/10Overall score: 5.7/10  Recommendation: Don\'t Bother', 'I\'m not going to waste my time with the introduction piece of the review so I\'m just going to start with the review.The story follows Ren Amamiya who\xa0is sent to Tokyo to stay with family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must ""rehabilitate"" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads the protagonist into the Metaverse and from there him along with his group of friends that he recruits must now\xa0steal corruption from the hearts of adults...in an attempt to reform the city under a group called the Phantom Thieves.Persona 5 the Animation is a 26 episode anime and yep alarm bells should be ringing. We haven\'t got a great record of Video Game Adaptations especially as of late with the lacklustre Danganronpa animes. However, I went into Persona 5 The \xa0Animation with an open mind because I thought that maybe this video game adaptation would work. It had director\xa0Masashi Ishihama who previously directed the critically acclaimed Shinsekai Yori. Plus the daybreak\'s OVA for Persona 5 was pretty good. I was actually excited.However, my excitement was immediately thrown out the window when I saw A1 Pictures. For those who haven\'t caught on, I hate A1 Pictures. I hate the studio with passion. I honestly believe that A1 Pictures is the most incompetent studio I have ever seen. Yes A1 did make some good shows that I really liked like The Idolm@sters, Magi, Shinekai Yori, Your Lie in April and Wotaku but the problem with A1 is that they made a truckload of mediocre, forgettable and terrible shows to a point where a lot of these bad shows seemed to represent A1 as a whole leaving a lot of good shows in the dust.I also don\'t want to speak about video games adaptations done by A1 Pictures because I heard nothing but awful things about them.I know that A1 Pictures did the Daybreak\'s ova back in 2016 and it was pretty solid but I never expected A1 Pictures to pass the TV series to Cloverworks aka A1\'s sub-studio until the studio split they own ways in October 2018.However, this show was released before A1 and Cloverworks went they own meaning this series despite being done by Cloverworks it still had that nasty A1 stench that I hated.Am not going to pull any punches with this one the story was awful and here\'s why.To start off with the elephant of the room is the pacing. Good god the pacing. Not going to lie this has got to be some of the worst pacings I have ever seen in anime because not only the show is ridiculously inconstant with it\'s pacing as it either way too slow or way too fast but it also screws up the overall narrative as well the emotional story elements.For example, in the game, Shino attempts suicide being raped by\xa0Kamoshida. It was an emotional moment in the early game of Persona 5 that was meant to showcase how screwed up the adults in the universe of Persona 5. It also gave Ann, Ryuji and Akira the motivation to act against Kamoshida.In the anime, it just happens in fin air. No tension, no proper build up whatsoever, nothing.This doesn\'t end where the show also outright skip various story elements that were meant to develop the characters. Even if you haven\'t played the games you can easily tell that the show is skipping and rushing many story aspects and as a result of that many of the story elements just feel awkward disjointed and forced.As a fan of the games, I felt insulted of how the show completely butchers and ruins everything that made the game so great in the first. Let\'s not talk about the social life aspects of the series because they do not exist. The biggest mistake of Persona 5 the Animation was how it adapted to a story that needed at least 51 episodes compared to 26 episodes that it actually gotThe final nail of the coffin was the ending. That ending alone was a big middle finger to the viewer as the show just ends in a very crappy way that feels unsatisfying as hell. I am aware that the series is getting an ova sometime soon but this is no excuse especially when we watched 26 of this rushed, awkward and poorly animated shit show that barely respects its source material.By the way, the Dark Sun OVA is not much better.The characters in Persona 5 are just lifeless husks of the game counterparts. Not only the character development is rushed beyond belief but they somehow made theses once interesting, well written and likeable characters and turned them into bland stereotypes. To save myself the misery and pain I will be ending the character selection of the review because if the show can even respect its characters than why should I.Now if thought the story and characters in Persona 5 The Animation were bad enough you ain\'t seen nothing yet because this is where the show officially hits rock bottom.Where the hell does I begin with this dumpster fire.First up the art style compared to the game looks like it was fished out of the toilet. Not only the show looks unappealing as well with its shitty background scenery, horrible lightning and uninspired character designs that look like the came out in early 2000 of anime but the art inconstantly is busted beyond belief where throughout the 26 episodes characters would constantly go off the model.The animation is even worse. I have never seen animation this lazy and lifeless since Black Clover and The Kings Game.Almost every single scene and fights in this show are all horrendously animated to the absolute core.Also, we don\'t speak about the shows horrendous attempt of using CGI. Good God was it awful to look at.The final nail of the coffin of this shit show was the all-out attacks which are frankly some of the worst pieces of animation I have ever seen in any anime. Every single all-out attack in this show feels like it was animated by college drop out who barely know anything about style when making this sequence in Adobe After Effects.Not even the beautiful fan-service scenes can save this shitty production.If there was anything good to come out of Persona 5 The Animation it would be the soundtrack. Despite the soundtrack being straight up taken from the game, it was still a great listen.The first opening theme BREAK IN TO BREAK OUT"" by Lyn is a fantastic opening theme for the show. While it was nowhere near as awesome as Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out its still a great song that perfectly captures the style of the series.The second opening theme Dark Sun by Lyn is a pretty solid opening theme in its own right however until the final episode I didn\'t like the fact that they reused footage from previous episodes into the opening visuals. However, the opening visuals for the last episode were awesome as it really showed off what the show could have been production values-wise.The ending themes were good but not that memorable.The voice acting was pretty okay as well however I feel like the Seiyuus didn\'t put much effort compared to the game counterpart. There is no English Dub for this show from the time of this review so if you\'re a fan of the Persona 5 dub well you\'re out of luck.Persona 5 The Animation is a total waste of time and effort. I honestly don\'t know what the hell was the director and Cloverworks were thinking during the production because they took everything that made Persona 5 so awesome and manages it screw it all up. The story is a rushed and poorly directed mess that is filled with horrific pacing that barely tells of what is going on. The characters are nothing but empty shells of the game counterparts and the visuals were horrendous beyond belief. The only good thing to come out from this scrapheap of a show was the music and the openings.If you haven\'t played Persona 5 and have a PS3/PS4 do your self a favour. Go buy it right now. If you don\'t have a PS4 or PS3 you can either save up for one or watch other anime with the same episode length like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Nichijou Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and the list goes on.Honestly out of all the game anime adaptations why is it Inazuma Eleven and Gungrave were the only one to get it right while others like Persona and Ace Attorney have to suffer. Such a shame.Cloverworks you may now be separated by the EA of anime studios A1 Pictures but you better redeem yourselves in future anime projects because you now have a lot of potential to be a competent studio. Don\'t let me down Cloverworks. in an attempt to reform the city under a group called the Phantom Thieves.Persona 5 the Animation is a 26 episode anime and yep alarm bells should be ringing.

Don\'t let me down Cloverworks.', 'For a game that\'s about ""stealing your heart"", Persona 5: The Animation on the other hand was nowhere close to capture LA\'s heart...LA only recently gotten into Persona 4: The Animation LA was hyped about Persona 5 as LA didn\'t play the game, so the anime was a good look into Persona 5, however...Persona 5: The Animation on the basis tries to relive the events of the game, truncating any of the minor events, and with that LA will at least say that trying to cram in a 90 to 120 hour game into a 26 episode anime IS gonna have these kind of limitations,...but for what it\'s worth, Persona 5 did ok if a bit rushed in some of it\'s arcs. Persona 5: The Animation is inflicted with the video game curse in some sense but not in the way you\'d think.Persona 5\'s plot revolves around the ""Phantom Thieves"" a group who is able to change the hearts of people and is led by Akira Kur- Ren Amamiya  voiced by Jun Fukuyama, the ""Joker"", but as they continue to gather more members, a bigger plot is brewing that leads Ren to being captured by the police and where the narrative structure of Ren retelling his adventures of changing people\'s hearts comes into play. Now the narrative structure is fine in some ways, a sorta in media res of Ren retelling his events to Sae Nijima, the detective questioning Ren all throughout the anime and the framing of how Ren got to where he is now is intriguing as well how he built up the Phantom Thieves and the members as well.Persona 5\'s characters are also immensely interesting to say the least, Ren has some personality to back him up though not the same as Yu from Persona 4 but nonetheless that and Persona 5 compared to Persona 4 have different levels of seriousness and playfulness in store. Due to Persona 5 going through many of the character arcs of the main cast (mainly the Phantom Thieves of course) we do get to see the Phantom Thieves develop through their issues or dilemma mostly through defeating the person or entity that troubles them in the ""villains palaces"" as a result. With that being said, LA was massively torn between two characters as LA\'s favorite character...either Makoto Nijima voiced by Rina Satou, the student council president and her views on ""justice"" tested during her arc (AND she\'s a badass) and Futaba Sakura voiced by Aoi Yuuki, a hikkimori who has a rather tragic backstory involving her mother and LA could relate to her in some sense due to this. LA\'s runner up was Ann Takamaki voiced by Nana Mizuki but nonetheless with the anime focusing alot on it\'s characters and their growth and arcs, made the main cast of the Phantom Thieves likable and memorable in a ways.Persona 5: The Animation\'s plot as LA aforementioned is was rushed and this was from a person who didn\'t play the games, each of the character arcs and ""palaces"" did have some decent screentime, but not alot of downtime much like Persona 4 and how they dealt with their dungeons, we at best get montages of the Phantom thieves traversing through the palaces, but in terms of battles, it\'s mostly one mob or monster then goes straight into the boss in question one or two episodes later. All LA means by ""no downtime"", is that the Phantom thieves doesn\'t have some breathing room in between palaces, though in some defence to this, Yuusuke Kitagawa voiced by Tomokazu Sugita and Makoto Nijima got ""some"" breathing room in between but still, it was rushed to say the least and this was even with a 26 episode timeframe!So if the characters were done well and the plot\'s structure had some rushed pacing, what really crippled it?, yeah...the animation is a bit subpar alot of the time. The animation studio CloverWorks round the halfway point, you could easily tell the derpy faces as well as cutting corners ALOT and it just gradually keeps showing up in the later episodes, sure the animation had some sense of detail in it\'s palaces and it\'s character designs being visually striking but for the animation to dip and not fully recover by the end of it was disappointing to say the least. The animation was subpar and was probably the biggest detriment to the anime overall.With that Persona 5: The Animation had a major problems but it\'s small little details that ruined Persona 5: The Animation from being in the same league as something like Persona 4 and LA loved that adaptation. Look, to most of the detractors of Persona 5: The Animation, you just can\'t cram a 120 hour game into a 26 episode runtime, there is BOUND to be some truncations, BUT for first timers who haven\'t played the game, it\'s actually a decent look into the game, with the story being structurally sound besides some pacing issues, characters who are memorable and develop them as the anime goes along BUT where Persona 5: The Animation falls flat is it\'s animation and that is just something LA can\'t ignore.Persona 5: The Animation you got some problems but your fine as an adaptation, being by the book in adapting the plot of the game well, but where the video game curse comes in is not having a convoluted stories and superfluous characters and the such but for what a simple thing as not having the drive in making the animation as great as could be as well as occasional rushed pacing, LA WANTED to love ya but by the end of watching it all, all LA felt was a dull thud in what could had been a great adaptation rivaling Persona 4: The Animation, yes LA was disappointed by this adaptation but not outright hate it as it had some strengths to it but nonetheless...Persona 5: The Animation your not misguided just mismanaged... but for what it\'s worth, Persona 5 did ok if a bit rushed in some of it\'s arcs. Persona 5: The Animation is inflicted with the video game curse in some sense but not in the way you\'d think.Persona 5\'s plot revolves around the ""Phantom Thieves"" a group who is able to change the hearts of people and is led by Akira Kur- Ren Amamiya  voiced by Jun Fukuyama, the ""Joker"", but as they continue to gather more members, a bigger plot is brewing that leads Ren to being captured by the police and where the narrative structure of Ren retelling his adventures of changing people\'s hearts comes into play.

Look, to most of the detractors of Persona 5: The Animation, you just can\'t cram a 120 hour game into a 26 episode runtime, there is BOUND to be some truncations, BUT for first timers who haven\'t played the game, it\'s actually a decent look into the game, with the story being structurally sound besides some pacing issues, characters who are memorable and develop them as the anime goes along BUT where Persona 5: The Animation falls flat is it\'s animation and that is just something LA can\'t ignore.Persona 5: The Animation you got some problems but your fine as an adaptation, being by the book in adapting the plot of the game well, but where the video game curse comes in is not having a convoluted stories and superfluous characters and the such but for what a simple thing as not having the drive in making the animation as great as could be as well as occasional rushed pacing, LA WANTED to love ya but by the end of watching it all, all LA felt was a dull thud in what could had been a great adaptation rivaling Persona 4: The Animation, yes LA was disappointed by this adaptation but not outright hate it as it had some strengths to it but nonetheless...Persona 5: The Animation your not misguided just mismanaged...', 'Persona 5 was one of the best RPGS I\'ve ever played in my life, sensational gameplay the story is very good, have very few holes and plot twists sensational.The characters are great super well developed, as long as the player has an interest in socializing with a certain character.Already in the adaptation made by CloverWorks was different, first of all in the adaptation they decided to adapt 26 episodes until near the end of the game, which would be about 80 hours of history inside the game, of course it was very rushado, the problem is that Person 5 is a slow game that has...the essence of making your own lifestyle within Tokyo with your own choices in the course of the game, taking that essence and accelerating the pace ends up leaving the feeling of everything being very superficial, whether in the relationship of the characters , at work, at school, in dungeons when he has fights, even in striking moments he can not deepen the scene in which the original had, was much worse.

This anime is what turns from a 100+ Hour long JRPG into a low-effort, low budget 7-8 hours of a cartoon.As someone who has personally spent 400+ hours on Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal combined and about 100 hours on Persona 5 Strikers, the anime leaves a lot to be desired if you have not played the game.Let\'s just call it as it is; There\'s no way you are compressing a 100+ hour journey...into the span of 7-8 hours without having to cut some major story elements out. The Social Links feel like NPC\'s rather than actual characters with relatable themes, Haru feels as bland as ever, and the downfall and mediocrity of this anime was pretty much inevitable.Story 5/10: The story is pretty much the same as Persona 5\'s. Not much to say.Art 1/10: I don\'t believe the art does this game justice. ESPECIALLY the boss battles and fight scenes. The fight scenes are absolutely abysmal.  Take a look at HeartSwitch! (the SFW fight scenes, not the other thing...) A SINGLE PERSON has made much more action-packed and well-drawn fight scenes than a FULL studio. I swear I could watch those 2-3 minutes of fighting as much as I wanted. There was SO much potential with the fight scenes, but the studio decided to take the easy way out and make the Persona 5 Animation battles nothing more than glorified pokemon battles, where a ball of magic essence is released when for example Carmen uses ""Agi"". The battle scenes are SUPER short, unengaging, and I\'d rather playthrough the entire game one more time than witness such horrible and lazy animation.Sound 7/10: Well, they use the OST from Persona 5, but at the same time add some fucking BANGERS. Infinity is a VERY good ED, but it\'s a shame it\'s not the only ED and isn\'t played for the entire series. Lyn Inaizumi is a great vocalist, not much else to say. The soundtrack definitely carries this anime and it has some very underrated tracks that are swept under the rug because they are only heard on this shitty anime.Character 3/10: In terms of character, Persona 5, the game itself, is probably the weakest here. The party members don\'t really develop over the course of the entire main story after the arc they are directly involved in (see Kamoshida vs. Ryuji/Ann) and as I said before the side Social Links feel like NPC\'s rather than actual characters that target themes and tropes that I can relate or see the perspective of.Haru didn\'t get screentime in P5, she doesn\'t get it here. Go look at the Valentine\'s OVA if you wanted some Haru Screentime. (or play P5 Strikers!)Enjoyment 5/10: It was pretty meh. I wasn\'t on my toes waiting for the next episode, but my love for Persona made me watch through the whole thing. Thankfully, not all in one sitting.Overall 4/10: Like every other anime adaptation of a video game out there, the main purpose of this anime was to promote the original game. Did it succeed in doing that? No clue. All I can say is that you would be better off playing the game itself or watching a playthrough on YouTube instead of watching whatever the fuck this is.(btw, steam/pc ports for P5R come out October 21, 2022!

Watch/play the game, don't watch the anime unless you want to make an AMV. :3"", ""This adaptation is riddled with issues, ranging from fairly minor to really irksome, but my biggest problem with it is the direction.Seiji Kishi did P4: The Animation a hell of a lot of justice. It may not have had the biggest budget or the highest-quality art, but the slice-of-life episodes were hilarious, and there were several really memorable (and emotional) action scenes. One need only recall the remarkably well-handled summer episodes, which retold several social link arcs in a really entertaining and satisfying manner, to realize the core strengths of the show. The anime ended up capturing the tone of the game perfectly and, for...what it's worth, the pacing was alright (the game itself is certainly not much better in that regard).I could go on - what about Yu Narukami, whose nonchalant and deadpan lines from the game carried over seamlessly into the show, and occasionally ended up being even funnier? He's a prime example of how to go about constructing the personality of an originally silent protagonist. Not to mention he even goes through a little arc of his own that wasn't present in the game.And here we have P5 the Animation, which starts out at a lightning-fast pace. Not too different from P4. I can certainly forgive that to an extent, as it's standard introductory episodes fare. But in this case the build-up to the Kamoshida conflict (and the aftermath) feels so rushed, that what is considered by many the most poignant act in the game turns out to be the first real low point of the show. The production values are at their worst around this point as well.Thankfully, the show begins to pick up with Yusuke's arc. The pacing slows down a bit. Goro gets some significant screen time to himself and his encounters with the Phantom Thieves, which makes sense considering the conflict of ideals which the story has to establish before it can move forward. Makoto is no less likable either and her design looks great. The main characters' confidant arcs which have been included thus far get resolved within an episode or two, whereas the other confidants have been shown in a few scenes, occasionally aiding the Phantom Thieves (as is the case with Ohya), and I can only assume they are going to have their stories fleshed out sooner or later. Kawakami's encounter as a maid with Ren was actually funnier than the game and she's somehow even more adorable.Our protagonist Ren doesn't quite match up to his game self. While he retains the semblances of a lovable dork, he's missing those snide dialogue choices from the game, and actually doesn't speak that much relative to the other characters at all. I can't fault his representation here too much, as keeping the protagonist's blank-slate character was a reasonable decision, if a bit on the safe side.Before I go any further, what do you think are the P3/4/5 games actually about? The typical response would be a cross between a dating sim and a dungeon crawler with demons. So why haven't the creators of this show sought to adapt both these aspects?See, the Persona v demon battles are embarrassingly short and poorly animated. This is assuming there is an animated battle taking place on-screen, as they haven't even bothered doing most of them. To the average fan of the games, this feels unfortunately alienating. P5 is even lengthier than P4, yet it's possible the former will end up having fewer episodes than the latter, for which I find there's absolutely no excuse. Of course they'd rather fill the episodes with more story, but this begs the question of why the series was planned like that in the first place. Knowing P5 replaced shadows with classic SMT demons, each with its own quirky personality, it wouldn't hurt to see them in action a little more.The game is also known and loved for how stylish it is. But the moment the anime tries to emulate some of that style, you know you're getting mixed results at best. There's no need to include the red-black transitions that tell us that a day has gone by or the characters are moving to a new place. And that all-out attack animation has yet to be neatly animated. The art in general is alright, although the show creates an atmosphere that's not nearly as evocative or moody like that of the game.I do hope the show ultimately gets the treatment it deserves. It's not a terribly boring watch by any means - just really disappointing to big-time fans. what it's worth, the pacing was alright (the game itself is certainly not much better in that regard).I could go on - what about Yu Narukami, whose nonchalant and deadpan lines from the game carried over seamlessly into the show, and occasionally ended up being even funnier?

Over 100 hours it tells a story about rebellion, corruption, suicide and a talking cat magically turning into a bus. It truly is a one of a kind experience. And that’s the entire problem with this anime. It truly has no purpose for existence. Besides people who are too lazy to spend 100 hours on a game.The story follows main character Ren Amamiya, a teenager forced to move to Tokyo after he was wrongfully convicted of assault. Who discovers the cognitive world, where distorted desires materialise. And must team up with fellow outcasts to...become the Phantom Thieves. A group dedicated to stealing those desires, causing a change of heart in even the most callous of criminals.The original managed to steal my heart within the first few hours, before we even started with the first palace. After the first three hours of this anime, we were already past the second palace. And that is the main problem here. The game took its time with the story. Taking the time to properly explore who these people are. The anime though has a lighting fast pace to it. Often skipping past entire palaces to get to the boss fight. Causing each palace to feel small compared to their in game counterpart.Characters pale compared to the game’s version. Great characters like Takemi, Kawakami and Chiya have their roles greatly reduced. All with the exception of Goro Akechi who is surprisingly, actually portrayed better here than in the game.The animation is terrible. When people prefer the cutscenes from a game that was released on the ps3. You know you have a problem.Overall Persona 5 The Animation is not only bad.

It is shows that even the best stories can be told poorly.', ""Persona 5 was one of the best games that I have ever played, and was a hit both in Japan and in the West upon its release, and continues to gather attention with spin offs and possible sequels based upon the loveable characters the game presents you with, along with the fantastic music crafted by Shoji Meguro (which luckily makes its way into this animated adaption).It was a hard job to handle, cramming a 90-100 hour game into only 26 episodes, but as we have seen with Persona 4 the Animation (also handled by A1 Pictures), it can be done well.But wherever the previous...animated series succeeded, this series failed. Miserably.The pacing of the entire anime is laughable, with exposition being either crammed into a few short sentences or not even brought up at all until it is only just relevant. The fight scenes are animated very poorly, with the pace of the fights all over the place and the art itself mediocre at best.Due to the poor pacing, many story moments are rushed over, and some of the truly important moments for character development and plot are give to few time for us to sink in the information or even care about the story it is presenting.This anime left a bad taste in my mouth, and when i reached the end of it's 26 episode run (along with two OVA episodes to complete the story in a rushed manner), i felt as though another trip through the PS4 title was needed to experience the story the way it was meant to be done. animated series succeeded, this series failed.

Art is mediocre overall but gets better too late. Enjoyable if a Persona fan, just don't expect P4A 2.0Persona 5 the Animation has been the subject of ridicule with the quality of the art and animation along with the rushing of a 100+ hour game into 26 episodes plus an unspecified amount of OVAs later on, and from this you would think that CloverWorks has somehow managed to make the worst anime...of the year. As someone who loved the game and somewhat enjoyed the anime, I disagree.Let me explain.StoryThe same as the game that's being adapted, a few changes to some major events that, in my mind, fix some areas of the game that I found a bit off (such as the existence of the betrayal being revealed in the first 15 minutes of the game and the Okumura arc). The rest of it is around or below average, especially near the beginning with the Kamoshida arc being horribly rushed, with a silver lining in that the writing seemed to improve as the series continued.ArtBelow average for the most part, with some standouts in the final few episodes. Poor animation (particularly All-Out Attacks and the use of CG outside of bosses) and art are everywhere in this adaptation, so the less said the better. The second set of visuals for both OPs and the final few episodes stand out as good art from this adaptation.SoundThe game's soundtrack with sometimes weird timings and mixing along with a few anime original tracks, both instrumentals and ones with Lyn again providing vocals.CharacterHere's where things get interesting. On one hand, Ren Amamiya is quite a boring character compared to the Joker of the game, particularly if you liked to pick the joke options, and is a huge let down to me after the P4 and P3 animes' portrayals of their protagonists (he has a few moments but despite them there's no redeeming his writing). The other characters, however, get expanded upon and have anime original moments that are actually good. Goro Akechi's friendship/rivalry with Ren sees heavy expansion to the point that they can be considered as having a connection instead of one line and a confidant rank up like in the game. The entire party seems to interact with each other more too, like the anime's addition of Ann and Makoto's friendship after the Kaneshiro arc.OverallIt's good I guess. I feel as if you'd have a much better time in watching this after completing the game as while the general quality of the series ranges from average to poor the new content, whether its original scenes or changes to the game's script, were generally the highlights of what could have been a massive dump on a great game of the year.

It constantly uses this laughable shortcut of zooming in and out on unanimated shots to reuse them at a different resolution in a later scene. There’s somehow less animation than the game, and what we see tends to be worse. Look no further than the ‘epic’ boss battle in episode 5, what should have been amazing was stilted by hideous CGI that looked even worse than what was used in the game.

When there's not much movement and/or character close-ups look really good but by that logic, you should just play the game.There’s also plenty of ugly CGI random people walking in the background. In episode 2 Ren and his teacher are talking in a hallway, and there’s a giant CGI student trying desperately to walk without looking like a robot but its so obvious he was stuck on there last minute with zero quality control to fix him.

It constantly uses this laughable shortcut of zooming in and out on unanimated shots to reuse them at a different resolution in a later scene. There’s somehow less animation than the game, and what we see tends to be worse. Look no further than the ‘epic’ boss battle in episode 5, what should have been amazing was stilted by hideous CGI that looked even worse than what was used in the game.

I knew it existed for a couple years, heck I even played Persona 2 (Innocent Sin) for the original Playstation. Back then I really had no idea wtf half the demons and spells were, how to pronounce character names, or why Hitler was in the fucking game,...but I remember it being one of my favorite games. However I wasn\'t able to play 3 due to stupid laws not letting me buy the game due to my age. Gee thanks a lot America. I got into the whole multiverse more recently with some YouTubers I watch streaming Persona 5. I loved watching them play, and recently I was able to convince my Mom to buy the game for me. But until then, I kinda had nothing to do. I wanted to play the game myself and it just so happened that an anime would be produced. My naïve mind was ecstatic. I thought it was good, until I got my own copy and relived watching videos, but in my own hands. Looking back now, this anime adaptation is a complete trainwreck.Story: The story here is a watered down version of the game. A lot of the nuance is taken out and some of the plotlines are straightout censored for TV. Apparently we can\'t say pedophile gym teacher is a pedophile, so we cut out half of his fucking character.  Well anyways here is the plot of the game. Your character is a student on probation due to an assault case from some asshole rapist, and he moves to coffe-dad\'s café , and he\'s a regular student by day, and a heart stealing phantom thief by night. No this is not a shitty porno despite how cheesy that last part sounds. Basically the protag makes accomplices and recruits other thieves, and a talking cat who screams at him to go to bed. The thieves steal the evil will from the hearts of the corrupt and reform society. That\'s what the anime basically portrays the plot as. A lot of the nuance from the game is gone. A lot of the dicking around that you and your friends go through in town during the day is gone. The school life is also gone. Its pretty much just an action story now.

However, Persona 5 is just so special to me that I have to share my thoughts.Persona 5 is a phenomenal game. It\'s probably one of the best I\'ve ever played. It had everything anyone could ever ask for; an intriguing story, fun characters, amazing gameplay, and one of the best soundtracks to date. The anime, on the other hand, is probably one of the worst things I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. I don\'t mean this as a joke....I actually was in pain as I watched one of my favorite franchises get the A1 treatment.Before I start this review, let me just say that I don\'t hate A1. They did a good enough job on the Persona 4 anime and an excellent job on the Persona 3 movies. I\'m also a casual fan of SAO and Darling in the Franxx. Just judging from the last two, you can tell I have a pretty high tolerance of what an anime can show me. I had really high hopes for Persona 5 after seeing The Daybreakers and the teaser, but I was let down really bad.Story - 3:Just. No. A1 had this problem with Persona 4, and it\'s even worse here. Pacing. For some reason, A1 just can\'t properly pace these stories. I think that\'s in part due to their attempts to try and cram almost everything Persona 5 had to offer into this anime, even though the game is 100+ hours in length. Their goals are contradictory. They want to tell this epic and include everything, while also keeping everything within a 26 episode season so it fits into fall anime. This alone shows that they really just didn\'t have enough appreciation for the source material. I think the best analogy I have for this would be to imagine trying to fit a steak onto a really small plate. You can go the route of trimming off all the fat and cutting the steak in a very slow and appetizing way as to not lose the flavors or randomly mincing the meat and throwing it on the plate like its dog food. Persona 5 is the steak, and A1 is the chef who went the route of the latter. Rather than choose plot points that make sense to be together in the story, or even cut parts that are time wasters, A1 made the decision to randomly grab select events from the various confidants of the game and randomly insert them into the story. The result is some horrible flow and pacing that had me confused at lots of points, and I even played the game to completion.What I wanted from this story was one similar to that of Persona 3\'s. It took the story we all know and love, added some extra events and fun character bonding moments, and overall just expanded on it. It offered something to people who have even played Persona 3, and each of these new things was totally worth watching hours of movies for. They did something like this with The Daybreakers. They offered a story no one had seen before. It was a new experience and it gave us some insight into the world of Persona 5 as well as give us character. The anime does none of this. It just tells the same story again, while cutting out some vital points. Even if you came to see the anime because you couldn\'t play Persona 5 and you wanted to know the story, you are better off just googling a let\'s play or even reading a plot synopsis of the actual game. It would save you time and sanity. Not to mention they don\'t even finish the story in the anime, so you don\'t even get the full experience if that\'s what you\'re looking for.Art - 4:Oh boy, this is the category that everyone likes to roast. In comparison to Persona 3, this is both a major downgrade and a major upgrade at certain points. I think the general rule with this anime is that if the camera is within a 2-meter radius of the characters, they turn out fine, otherwise they look like they just came out of MS Paint. Before you come out and say that it\'s hard to draw characters that are at a distance, consider two things; they have already done these kinds of long-distance shots for years and no one complained and there is no need to even put their characters in positions where the camera is far away. There isn\'t much to say on that point other what has already been shown by various people online.What else is worse is that there are just some points where the artists must have gone under some acid trip and forgotten just what the characters looked like. I explicitly remember an episode near the end where Ann has silver hair for most of the episode when she is in fact blonde. It could be attributed to lighting, but she was in both pure sunlight, half light, and pure darkness, so it\'s hard to name that as the cause.Sound - 7:This category is kind of short since most of the music and sounds come straight from the game. I only just wish it was more apparent since the game\'s soundtrack is absolutely amazing.Character - 1:In terms of character, they absolutely failed. I honestly can\'t find one thing I liked about how the characters were presented in this anime, and that\'s something that\'s difficult for me to say since these characters are some of my personal favorites. Look at the Persona 3 or 4 anime. Each character in both of those had something called personality. Even when they\'re not the ones in the spotlight, it\'s easy to tell who is talking just from the dialogue alone. If you gave me a script of either one, I wouldn\'t have much trouble naming the characters speaking because of how well they\'re presented. Persona 5 takes a complete 180 on this. I couldn\'t even find that much good character in the segments in which one character had the spotlight. They all speak about the same thing for the entirety of the anime; their justice. I think every single character in this anime has said ""my justice"" at least once. It gets really annoying when the characters all feel like carbon copies of each other, except for their origins. As someone who has seen the characters and their personalities exemplified in the game, I really don\'t know how A1 managed to screw up just letting each character have their own conscience and point of view.Don\'t even get me started on Ren. Ren is the worst mainly because he is nothing. I mean this literally. He has no character. I think even the silent protagonist of the actual Persona 5 game has more personality than the Ren we\'re shown here. The main reason I loved both Persona 3 and 4\'s anime is because they threw a name on our protagonist and gave them personality. Makoto is molded into the person he is because of a tragic incident he witnessed as a child, and Yu is given a deep fear of losing the friends he loves. Those character traits even extend from the anime into various other Persona properties. Ren, on the other hand, is just passive. He never has his own thoughts or actions. It kind of just feels that if someone says he should do something it\'s an automatic yes just because of derp. Even the Joker version of Ren, who is supposed to be a polar opposite to the silent Ren Amamiya, lacks anything. Joker is literally the definition of charm and snarkiness, but in this anime, I can\'t find a single good and original line from Joker. Ren starts to get some character at the last episode when he talks about ""his justice"" once more, but by that point, it\'s already too late.Enjoyment - 3:I think my enjoyment of this is already clear, but if it isn\'t I\'ll say it again. I really felt in pain while watching this anime. At the beginning of the first episode, I was excited to see these character\'s I\'ve admired come to the small screen. I felt if this was successful, Persona 5 would get more attention and become more popular than it already has and we\'d maybe have these characters expanded upon even more. By the end of the first episode, I just remember utter disappointment. Nothing, and I mean nothing, met up to my expectations. It was just a rehash of what we already had but presented in a way that just made me ache. I think after the second episode, the only reason I stuck with this anime was just to see how badly they\'d ruin Persona 5 and hope it would get better. Spoiler. It didn\'t get better.Overall - 3:This is the epitome of milking a franchise. Somehow, in their first attempt to make a spin-off of a fantastic franchise, they ruined it with terrible direction, art worse than that of MS painters, a story that could be made by a toddler holding a crayon, and character development that\'s just a horizontal line starting at 0. I personally don\'t know who at A1 greenlit this, but I feel they should have gone back to the drawing board after the first episode and rethought the entire strategy. 26 episodes, 13 hours of animation, and not one good half hour to be seen. If you want my thoughts on how to fix it, here\'s what I would do.Don\'t end on a cliffhanger. This is Persona 5. Not Avengers Infinity War. You don\'t get to do that.Fix the pacing. Don\'t tell me it\'s hard to cram all of this story into 13 hours. You did Persona 3 in 4 movies, AKA less screen time, and it was exactly what I was looking for with the story even though it was a similar length to Persona 5.Take your time with the art. Don\'t give me that All-Out Attack ever again. Make your own style and make us believe in it.Actually, give your characters some character. Every single phantom thief here had there own and complex reasons for becoming a Phantom Thief. Don\'t sum them up to ""I""m fighting for my own justice."" That\'s boring.For the love of god, make your Protagonist likable. He\'s the MAIN character, not the side character for everyone else to use as a stepping stool for the spotlight. You did it right 2 times, so why mess up now?Finally, actually have some respect for the source material. Persona 5 is a franchise loved by millions across the world. People took its themes about how to view the world, it\'s story, and its characters to heart. Give them something they can look at and feel happy to watch.P.S. Sorry if this sounds like a rant.

It\'s not my intention.', '(First of all, I\'m brazillian then sorry about any grammar mistakes)Persona 5 the animation is a anime series based on a game with the same name, first released in 2018 and finishing airing in 2019. I\'ve got to say with all my sincerity that Persona 5 is one of the worst and most disappointing anime shows that I ever witnessed with my bare eyes. I had some friends who enjoyed this... thing and I couldn\'t understand why. On this review I\'ll be mostly talking about why this series is so disappointing in my eyes.Story(7/10):The story is the major quality of the animation. Not gonna lie,...the whole concept of breaking into pallaces and steal souls is very unique and interesting, but this is not a compliment. Try to compact about 100+ hours of gameplay in 26 episodes is a very bad idea, because there was a lot of misused concepts(especially Personas) and lots of very rushed scenes. Now you may be thinking:""they needed to adapt a story in just 26 episodes, of course it would be dificult and have some mistakes"", well if that\'s the case SHOULDN\'T YOU JUST LIKE NOT MAKE AN ANIME ADAPTATION? Persona 5 story is interesting, but if you want to enjoy the best of it, please buy the game. it\'s more worth of your time.Art(2/10) and sound(7/10):Where should I start? If you just saw the art style or some promotional art, you probably thought:""wow the art is just like the game! This can\'t be bad right?"", and I\'m really sorry for you. The art style is very good actually and pretty faithful to the game, but on the other hand the animation... For starters, Persona 5 has the POOREST animation that I\'ve ever seen, the characters moved like some kind of cheap animatronics, and the animators didn\'t even care to at least make facial expressions that actually expressed something. Someone is angry? Is he sad? We can only know with the voice acting, otherwise they would be just a group of Bellas from ""Twilight"". One of the coolest things in the game were the fights, that are garbage in the anime. being basically pokemon fights, where they just keep shooting each other until someone dies.There was also the ""in-all attacks"", that looked like complete trash. I\'m also not in the mood to talk about their horrible CGI. Now about the sound, it would be total shame if it wasn\'t their voice actors. Besides the cast\'s robotic movements and blank faces, what gave them life was the voice, the dubbing was just too good and they matched perfectly with each character. The musics used on the anime were made by the game\'s lead composer:Shoji Meguro, and they were pretty damn good, but sometimes they didn\'t fit on the action scenes. On the other hand the sound effects were disgusting. They didn\'t match on what actions were happening, or they were just very poor. Some examples are the gunfire noises, they were ridiculous, mostly because they didn\'t resemble the sound of gunpowder exploding, somehow they resembled an airsoft gun shooting.Characters(1/10):The Persona characters were very cool, they were empathetic and interesting... sorry I\'m talking about the game. While our protagonist Amamiya Ren is stoic, he is not like Giorno from Jojo for example, he doesn\'t seem to have a deeper personality, he is just expressionless and nothing more. I dare to say that Ryuji is the only one that overall has a personality. The rest of the cast is just like Sword Art Online\'s cast, they are just there to keep the story going. I\'m giving a few positive points because they managed to make their designs faithful to the games(and overall because their designs are very good), but the main reason to my deception is how the anime cast are basically cardboard figures compared to their games counterpart. While Ryuji in the games is a stupid, but very kind,funny and sometimes a little perverted school delinquent, in the series he\'s just the dumb protagonist best friend. While Ann in the game showed how she felt guilt for not helping her best friend Shiho, eventually evolving and defeating her insecurity, in the anime she felt sad for her friend... yeah nothing more happens. While Yusuke in the game is a very passionate person for art,always wanting to illustrate what he sees, and a very dense person, being unable to read the mood, which creates very funny scenes, in the anime he simply doesn\'t have a personality.-PERSONAS-Now let\'s talk about the main mechanic in the games:Personas. Even if in the game the Personas were only used in attacking purposes, like in the anime, was it really clever to make things like this way? When someone summons their Persona, they just shoot a beam of light and disappear, eventually there were some different and more interesting powers, but they were always used in the same way (except in one scene where Yusuke\'s Persona uses a ice beam to freeze an enemy to the ground). What I wanted to see then? Let\'s use as an example another anime with a similar mechanic:Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure and their Stands. Each stand is used in a smart and surpring way, just like Giorno\'s Gold Experience and it\'s ability of life-giver. If Gold Experience was used in Persona, his user would probably just create some animals, like wolves, and send them to attack the enemy. In Jojo, Giorno uses his Stand to overload an enemy with life energy, making his senses go berserk, transform an object(like a shoe or a teeth) into a fly to track its owner,heal injuries, create trees to reach higher levels, etc. See the difference? Jojo\'s Stands are used in creative ways, they aren\'t just weapons, while the Personas are used in a plain way, wasting their potential. Also, one thing that the anime do not explain, is why Ren always show up with different Personas. And I don\'t know why. Now if you don\'t know, the reason why is a basic mechanic in the game:executing Personas to create a new one, and the capturing shadows to get a new Persona, but if someone don\'t know about that, it gets pretty confusing.Enjoyment(1/10) and overall(2/10):I needed to watch this anime after making a tract with a friend... I kind of regret that decision. The series have an interesting plot, but it is really wasted in the anime. The poor animation mixed with bad sound effects, a story that doesn\'t flow naturally and misused characters just make the experience of watching more and more painful. If you want a anime with a good plot, great characters, good looking visuals and animation,great sound in general and has ""Personas"" in it, just watch Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure:Diamond is Unbreakable, this is worth of your time. But if you do really want to know how Persona 5 is, play the game. Seriously, I\'ve started playing the game recently, but it is very obvious the difference beteween anime and game. Why would anyone watch 26 episodes of a poor version from a let\'s play, if playing the game itself you get to know the story better, the characters are really good, the gameplay is very fun and the animation is limited to cutscenes.Even without playing the game, i got really disappointed with the show, and after watching a few let\'s plays, I just couldn\'t believe that this game gave birth to the monstruocity that is this anime. I know that I said that a lot of times, but don\'t waste your time with this, it\'s not worth your time. People cried watching Anohana? Clannad after story? Your Lie In April?

While I know what will happen in the main story I don't remember a lot of the finer details of the source material.Story:The main story is kind of simple as of episode 12, 3 palaces in. World building is finally complete, and the real plot is set in motion in episode 15. If there's a thing the anime does much better than the game itself it would be the confidant stories. The team does go out of their way...to make them really funny.On its whole, it does what the anime is intended to do: to try to sell the game for newcomers and to add on to the game for those who already know the story. Though, even non-blind, the story up to the end makes me not entirely sure whether to laugh, cry or get mad. Thankfully there's an OVA later this year.Don't trust the ending lol, over here it already lists 26 episodes.Art: A few mistakes here and there. A few questionable decisions with regards to the battle sequences. Action starts looking much better on episode 4 and then into palace 2. Definitely picks up so don't drop it after episode 3.The art quality may not always be consistent but the artists definitely got better drawing Ren towards the end.Sound:uses the game soundtrack and the dancing spinoff soundtrack to great effect. I really enjoyed the use of Blooming Villain and the Life will Change remix. Whims of Fate got its time too.Character:I liked how Ren is portrayed. It felt very canon and logical. He definitely has sass and in general Ryuji and Mishima get the most of it. His progression is slow, but doesn't feel out of place.Ryuji is more likable in the anime than the source material.Morgana is cute.Futaba's plight is kind of sad; I would not recommend watching that particular episode (16) at 12am, they did a good job on Wakaba.Makoto and Sae's relationship has also been well highlighted.Akechi's definitely the best improvement of them all. He's not just the random encounter like the game anymore.Enjoyment:well, if I were to rewatch this I would definitely skip 3 All Out Attacks. I still like what they have. It has its cute, funny and cool moments. It definitely gets better and better. At first I thought episode 1 was the best, then that changed to episode 4, and then that changed again and again. They did so well on the last arc I almost wish they could go back and redo some of the beginning episodes.Overall, would recommend to friends. One, because I love the story, two, because I want to see those reactions on the finale. Generally if you are still interested after the 4th episode and make it past the 6th, you will probably continue watching it to the end.I must say though, by the end of the anime and if you're watching it blind, you'll definitely be wanting the conclusion to the story so bad you might decide to spoil yourself. Don't do that. Either wait for the Dark Sun OVA or get/watch the game.

The reason:1. Not using true ending (but the ending still different from game)I think they didn't choose true ending because of limitation of airing this anime. I mean, Persona 5 have a long story and a little bit complexity. It can't be made to anime with 26 episode? Still need more episode fore true ending.2. Animation is suck (compared to the game)If you like action, well I can say they try. But animation compared to the game, I prefer from the game, you can say it.3. You can get more feeling from game (trust me)But if you prefer watch the anime,...it's fine. Still can follow the story till the end. But don't be upset with ending. it's fine.

While Persona 5 is an amazing game, it’s also a very long game and the fact that this show is only 25 episodes long is the first thing that made me feel skeptical about this show before I watched it. After I watched it, it was a hell of a lot worse than I could’ve imagined. This anime is so damn ugly like Jesus Christ! Why do the characters look...so damn stupid?! Why is the all out attack screen so empty and hideous! Jesus Christ this is bad. The one positive of this show is the music because it uses music from persona 5 along with some decent songs made just for this show, the best of which is the first ending: to infinity.The only reason I have some of the stuff 10s and stuff is because it’s Persona 5, not because this show is actually good at it.But the main sin (pun not intended) is that WHY ISNT FUTABA CONSIDERED A MAIN CHARACTER WHY ARE THEY A SUPPORTING CHARACTER?! so damn stupid?!

The first Persona anime which was Persona 4 Golden and I love it so freaking much. I even played the game after I watched it. Same goes to Persona 3 and other ones. I know that it MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BIASED SINCE I...PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE BUUUUT I was a bit disappointed about the anime. Sure that I played it before and I loved it so fucking much. One of the best games ever!! Honestly, I just wished that they can do it a little bit better and have a bit of the same humour, just like on the game. The soundtrack and the art are awesome! But I still prefer the art style from the videogame.The characters from the anime makes them like they are bad and have no personality whatsoever. Like... there are no work on to it whatsoever. Like they just made an anime of it because it was getting popular. It feels rushed and there was no time or effort on to it.

Not so much... (Though it did get my to buy the game and I am grateful for that)I did enjoy this anime for what it was worth, but compacting 100+ hours of gameplay and story into a 26 episode block is far from easy. Personally I noticed a lot of the story was skimmed or summarized. For someone who has played the game several times, I didn't really struggle to keep up, but people who have only seen the anime must be completely baffled sometimes as...to what is happening on the screen.The art and animation were no doubt amazing. Several of the Castles were especially well done...but only visually. They cut out so much of what made the castles so interesting, but I suppose I can understand due to time constraints.The music was completely on point though, and I was very thankful for that. Persona 5's soundtrack is sheer brilliance at its finest, and I'm glad much of it was incorporated into the show as well. The intro/ending themes the anime introduced were also amazing, I loved watching them every week when a new episode dropped.I found a lot of the fight scenes in the anime rather boring compared to how I experienced them in-game. Once again, time restraints, I know. But fights ended in a matter of seconds and grazed over several of the in-game features that made Persona 5's fight system so incredibly fun.Persona (and the entire Shin Megami Tensai series) is known for having a huge variety of creatures, but I feel like I saw very few in the Anime adaptation. Plus, the anime barely touches on why the Protagonist's persona changes every so often. For anyone who has never played the game before, this had to be really confusing.Finally, character development suffered too due to time constraints. The game features very developed, multi-step interactions with many main and side characters that left you feeling like you were almost a part of the group. The anime touches on these, but has to summarize them far quicker. Seeing a character conflict/story introduced, discussed, and resolved within about 6 minutes doesn't do the character development justice. The patient and detailed stories featured in-game really tug more on the heartstrings, make you laugh, and allow you to invest into even the more minor characters. Anyone who has not played the full game is probably finding the anime's attempts to cover the side-stories as pointless filler, when it is completely the opposite.Overall, a red-hot masterpiece of a game turned into a lukewarm animated adaptation. However, I do still think it is worth a watch, especially for any fans of JRPG games or anyone interested in buying the Persona 5 game. For anyone who doesn't want to play the game and just wants to enjoy the anime, I'd recommend some supplemental wiki pages or youtube videos to fill in some of the gaps.

If i see this purely from an anime POV with no source material to fall back on, i would say its a fairly decent story with some average CG for action scenes The story is also well paced and it has some interesting premise. The ending was also unexpected.Story: If i compare P5A with P4A, the former has at least a semblance of a plot while...the latter was fragmented too much to the point that i lost coherence of the plot with each episode towards the later half of the season. On the bright side, it was fun watching this slice of life anime as it explored dark themes coupled with an interesting supernatural backstory.Art: The character art has some justice done on them. But i cannot say the same for the animation. The CG for battle scenes alone were so out of place that even an amateur like me could see how the 3D effect was ruining the animation itself. I am not a fan of this style of graphics.Character: I want to like Ren not only for his character design but also for his personality but he spoke so less and he just had not translated his inside-the-palace charisma onto his real life image. Like P4A before, the main players of the 'phantom thieves' are too docile to accept the persona and become a part of the team. I saw no resistance or betrayal of sorts that develop the characters. Ann who is vehement not be objectified invariably gets a persona which is the very definition of sexism.Akechi: Sometimes i felt like i was watching a conversation between kira and L. Only that akechi's suspicion on Ren did not amount to a 3 percent chance he could be a phantom thief. I loved the ending though. While i did expect something along those lines, honestly i could not predict how the animators executed it though. So its obvious i am looking forward to a season 2.Story: Similar to P4A the story style is same with the main chara entering a different dimension or metaverse. There is no point in trying to figure out anime logic. they can change the feelings without that person actually knowing that is heart has been invaded through some inexplicable means. The more confusing part is how they interact with desires itself which somehow is able to recognize ppl and situations. The explanations were of little to no help.In short this anime has created a series of NPCs of the characters as well. The story plays a lot by the ear. Everything is safe or if it was the animators' s idea to make it viewer friendly at the same time brushing against darker themes like abuse and such.Overall: Loved the building up of suspense. i understand why this gets all the hate but for all the animus that ever stuck to the source material, this is no so bad. Without perceiving at P5A as an adaptation of a popular game i was easily kept entertained for the two days i spent binging on this.

The only thing that holding this anime is the great soundtrack. That's it! That's the only thing that made me stay and giving this anime a chance.Maybe the worst...disgrace is how they giving us a very beautiful promotional art in the very beginning only to continue with horrible and downright bad animation. The animation feels empty and lazy with so many in between frames are missing from its place. In the very end of this anime, I feel betrayed by the promises they gave us before they released the anime. Well, I know A-1 Pictures have a history of bad action sequences and very minimal animation which usually they will fix them in their Blu-Ray or DVD releases but I think that is not an excuse to make a good potential wasted.About the story, I felt sad since the game of Persona 5 itself already has a very great story but at the end of the day they executed the story with an unsteady yet rushed pace. It really broke the story as whole because many key points and character relationship were threw away. And worse, they decided to cut-off the anime like it was nothing and just told us that there would be a continuation. WHAT? I know that the studio really wants to milk this franchise but I think it was not the wisest decision as it left the audience screaming that this anime is unfinished and downright bad.The only thing that makes this anime outstanding is of course, their soundtrack. Still retaining the beautifully composed music from the game, they kept the soundtrack and added with other equally beautiful soundtracks. I always love the work of Shoji Meguro and that endings are worth to note.Overall, I was almost this close to drop this anime but my generosity keeps me from dropping this one. Episode after episode, I was putting hope that they will fix this hell of a mess. But no. To the very end they did not fix it. So, I think it is better for you to watch the playthrough of the game instead of watching this anime if you are curious about Persona 5. disgrace is how they giving us a very beautiful promotional art in the very beginning only to continue with horrible and downright bad animation.

A 100+ hour video game. Persona 5 is actually my third favorite video game of all time and I have over 200+ hours in it. Anyway, a game like this CAN'T be condensed into anime that is a total of 8.6 hours. It's impossible to even try to do that. This will probably be one of the first and only reviews I ever do but I think it just needs to be said that this anime isn't good, but the game is amazing so definitely go play that. Ok...time to start the actual review now haha...STORY:Now Persona 5's story is pretty good on its own. I think you can see a bunch of things leading up to the big twists but that's beside the point. Now that was the game now let's talk about the anime. The anime misses a bunch of stuff, like almost everything except the main details and sometimes they even miss thoughts. A clear example is episode 3 where Suzui jumps off the school roof, this is lead up by nothing. They just threw it at us with no building up to it. Again the story can't be condensed into 8.6 hours.ART:The art is just comical at this point. A bunch of frames is just so bad and in general its just really bad. I think the biggest example is the all-out attack in episode 2. It's just abnormally bad and people say that it would have been better to just copy and paste the all-out attack from the game then use the anime style version. I will give it the benefit of the doubt that for 70% of the anime, it's drawn pretty ok, but for the rest of its garbage. Even the cutscenes in the game are drawn better than the anime.SOUND:I think this might actually be the best thing in this entire anime. Again it's still not good. The Persona 5 OST is a masterpiece, almost every single song from the game track is amazing and it's great to listen too. The anime again is very short, they don't even play every single song from the game. There's not much to say about it though.CHARACTERS:The cast for Persona 5 is great and I find it the worst thing in the anime. The entire point(or one of them at least) in the Persona series is to build up and grow your confidants, in other words, your friends, deepen the bond with them. Now when you take that aspect away from you only have the story and gameplay, AND take the gameplay away and you have a mediocre story. Anyway, Persona 5 takes away any type of character development any of the characters could have because it takes time for all of them to grow. My favorite character is Goro Akechi and even he is extremely lacking in this anime. Again they take all of the things away that make the characters likable, their development. All that time is taken away with you hanging out with them. I can't blame them because even though they did make the anime, they can't show everything in such little time. Definitely the worse thing about the anime though by far.ENJOYMENT:I can enjoy this very little from everything that I just stated. I cringed at some of the bad art. Again it's just a poor anime and it really shows how some games just can't be animes unless its extremely long.ok just go please play Persona 5 on ps4 thanks time to start the actual review now haha...STORY:Now Persona 5's story is pretty good on its own.

In order to properly adapt the massive game that is Persona 5, they would need a minimum of 50 episodes, as this series skipped over quite a bit of content. A longer run, along with taking an approach that mixed slice of life with the stylistic action of the main story of the game would probably have made this a more faithful experience, as my main issue is the fact that you dont really see the charm Persona 5 hold...outside of the main Palaces and the Metaverse.If you played the game, you may enjoy seeing the characters and specific scenes animated and elaborated on, though this Anime can't hold a candle to the masterpiece that is the game. outside of the main Palaces and the Metaverse.If you played the game, you may enjoy seeing the characters and specific scenes animated and elaborated on, though this Anime can't hold a candle to the masterpiece that is the game."", ""This anime is just disappointing, the only redeeming features are its dub and the score.

Now by fucking terrible, I mean it was a mediocre anime at best. If you're thinking of watching this because you know that Persona 5(and soon in the West Persona 5 Royal, as of writing this review) is a really really long game, around 90+ hours on a standard first playthrough and possibly another 45+ hours if you do New Game+, I'm telling you just play the god damn game. Persona 5, being the first Persona game I played, left a huge impact on me due to its phenomenal gameplay and...intense ass story. So much so that its become my favourite game(Though i will not lie didn't know who joker was until he was added to Smash Ultimate and i saw gameplay of him on Alpharads Youtube channel, But i did know the twin wardens for some reason. I know, im clearly the person to listen to). The anime did a horrible job with the pacing of the games story. Like the first boss was beaten in a matter of three episodes. This is approximately 10ish hours of the game. And this Boss, whose name is Kamoshida, left an impact in the game that only atlus was able to do. (ok there will be some spoilers from this point on so....... if you don't want any....... go play the fucking game) Like the scene where Ann's presumably best friend, Shiho, jumped off the rooftop of Shujin Academy. The game made it a presence that the abuse and sexual harassment(and technically pedophilia if you live in the west cuz shiho is only 17, same goes for basically all of shujin) done by Kamoshida to the sports team, which is glorified by the volleyball team, was fucking hard. This set the tone for the rest of the game that this game is going to deal with topics that most gamers will not deal with on a everyday basis. Examples of these cases could be of course Kamoshida's sexual harassment, Kaneshiro's pyramid scheme and the death of Futaba's Mom, Wakaba Isshiki, due to authorities(I'm gonna call them the Japanese FBI) exploiting the research teams for psience, who could assumably been hired by Masayoshi Shido. Nothing in the anime felt like it had a meaning. The characters were more flat than they usually are. Hell, some of the confidants weren't even there like Master of Gun About Shinya. Thus making my point that this anime to be honest, it was decent show but ,being a now huge Persona fan, was a huge disappointment. They honestly should have left this to AIC A.S.T.A cause they made P4A, which from the general view of Persona community was pretty solid. That is why my short ass review, cause i could have gone on for day but you weebs need more anime, of this anime gave it a good 5/10. intense ass story.

This is definitely true of P5tA. If you have played Persona 5 (or like me, played it twice within 2 months of its release), this show is a satisfactory reminder of the fantastic experience of playing the game. The music is all either true to the game or new but suitable. That in itself is a pleasant surprise - I found myself getting goosebumps when certain familiar songs started to play.Much of the story is also pretty surprisingly true to the source. However, as with all past and present Persona animations, the...art itself and the character development simply cannot live up to the source. As it stood, the art in the animated cutscenes in Persona 5 lacked soul - that is also true of this anime. It is also impossible to expect the anime to be able to relay the development of each character that you experience with each social link in the game in this type of medium.This show serves an adequate function as a post-gameplay portrayal of the story of Persona 5. If you have not played the game, don't do yourself the disservice of watching this show. As a stand-alone, it does not hold up as anything more than mediocre. Watching this anime, you won't feel compelled to play this absolutely amazing game. But you should. You should play it, and then come back and allow this show to just help you reminisce on the amazing sights, sounds, and characters produced by one of the (if not THE) best Persona games in the series. art itself and the character development simply cannot live up to the source.

The pacing is abysmal, spending way too much time on the early story and not leaving enough time for the conclusion. If you HAVE played the game, it's just fine. Akechi has more screen time in the anime than in the game, so if you're a fan of him then your enjoyment will definitely be higher. If you don't...like him, well, you'll probably hate the anime and feel like he took away from whoever your favorite is.The anime is good as supplementary material to the game, but doesn't hold up very well on its own. like him, well, you'll probably hate the anime and feel like he took away from whoever your favorite is.The anime is good as supplementary material to the game, but doesn't hold up very well on its own."", 'P5A has two versions. Since the dub has several improvements over the original, I\'m sticking with the higher score of the two. But, I\'ll be rating both sub and dub.Original/sub: 4/10 overallStory: 9/10 Condenses the game\'s 100+ hours very well for a 26 episode series.Art: 3/10 The art is pretty bad. But it\'s comically bad - which isn\'t necessarily a detriment to the anime. The problem, though, is that the animation doesn\'t carry the same feeling of maturity as the game does.Sound: 9/10 No complaints here. It\'s of high quality like the game.Character: 5/10 Ren does not get enough lines. Ryuji carries the series because...he\'s voiced by Mamoru Miyano, so any words or sounds he makes is pleasing to hear. Especially ""Renren"". And him calling out Akechi\'s name in a questionably sexual tone lmao.Enjoyment: 8/10 The sub almost completely fails to deliver the weight of the game, but it makes up for that with fanservice and moments of hilariously bad animation, firmly establishing itself as a fun, campy anime. It\'s like Ex-Arm in that it\'s popularity as a bad anime actually makes it good.Dub: 7/10 overallStory: 9/10Art: 5/10 A fair amount of scenes have been improved, and it feels more consistent and smooth. Some of the bad animation is still there.Sound: 9/10Character: 9/10 Ren has a lot more lines and expression.

I watched about 7 episodes straight and then started skimming through the rest of the way, I noticed issues that consistently plagued the show throughout its entire duration so I think my opinions are well-founded save for some bias against it for being a bad adaptation.The game is fantastic; it has a thought-provoking and exciting plot; the artstyle is full of personality; the sound design and ost are fantastic; characters feel fleshed out for the most part. Over the 100+ hours it takes to...beat it, the experience was consistently enjoyable with very few shortcomings, I felt genuinely sad and empty when the credits rolled because of how much I loved the whole experience.Now compare this to the anime.The amazing plot is condensed into 26 episodes and feels really rushed as a result, things that usually have a major impact in the game are swept to the side in the anime and as such some of the more significant events from the game lose their weight.The artstyle is poor and the expressive style of the game is lost, P5A has no personality and it looks rushed. This is even more dumbfounding considering that Persona 5 has animated cutscenes that look gorgeous. I understand that it would take more time and money to make a whole anime of that quality, but releasing a bad anime adaptation is a terrible alternative and discourages people who would enjoy the series from getting into it.Sound-wise, the anime reuses music from the game. Persona 5 has one of the best soundtracks out of any form of media so this is not an issue. P5A also has a fair selection of original tracks though, and they're great. SFX aren't bad either, they're just average and not worth commenting on.Characters suffer the same issues as the story for the most part, they get no time to develop and feel like cardboard cutouts of their game counterparts. One thing I do like is the emphasis on the relationship between the protagonist and another character that I won't spoil, this is actually an improvement on the game and the only reason someone who has played it should watch this.Here are some better ways to enjoy Persona 5 if you have yet to experience it in any form:Persona 5, the original game which is available on PS3 and PS4.Persona 5 Royal, a remake of the original game with a stellar bonus story arc and quality-of-life enhancements which is available on PS4 and PS5.If games aren't your thing, you can also read the 'Persona 5: Mementos Mission' manga which is great from what I hear.Honestly, watch a lets play of the game on Youtube if you really must, I don't reccommend it but if it stops you from wasting time on this dumpster fire then do what you must. beat it, the experience was consistently enjoyable with very few shortcomings, I felt genuinely sad and empty when the credits rolled because of how much I loved the whole experience.Now compare this to the anime.The amazing plot is condensed into 26 episodes and feels really rushed as a result, things that usually have a major impact in the game are swept to the side in the anime and as such some of the more significant events from the game lose their weight.The artstyle is poor and the expressive style of the game is lost, P5A has no personality and it looks rushed.

One thing I do like is the emphasis on the relationship between the protagonist and another character that I won't spoil, this is actually an improvement on the game and the only reason someone who has played it should watch this.Here are some better ways to enjoy Persona 5 if you have yet to experience it in any form:Persona 5, the original game which is available on PS3 and PS4.Persona 5 Royal, a remake of the original game with a stellar bonus story arc and quality-of-life enhancements which is available on PS4 and PS5.If games aren't your thing, you can also read the 'Persona 5: Mementos Mission' manga which is great from what I hear.Honestly, watch a lets play of the game on Youtube if you really must, I don't reccommend it but if it stops you from wasting time on this dumpster fire then do what you must."", ""tl;dr Play Persona 5 the Royal don't watch this.Short summation of my thoughts, Overall section has a longer tl;dr for Persona fans of various typesStory and Characters 4, 8 - vanilla Persona 5's story is a mixed bag and condensing 100 hours of game into 30ish episodes counting the specials causes it to suffer. The most common complaint with all Persona adaptations is that the pacing is bad, and the length of the game story does not adapt well. Persona 4 and the Persona 3 movies are like Steins;Gate compared to whatever this is supposed to be. (Steins;Gate is widely regarded as a great adaptation...of a visual novel) Events and main story beats that shouldn't be rushed are and slice of life and confidant events that should not have episodes dedicated to them have episodes dedicated to them for some reason. At this point I would suggest watching a lets paly without commentary over the show. There is one saving grace to this show, the mc speaks. You also get some extra voice lines for other characters. The fact this show got a dub is the only reason I watched it and hearing Xander Mobus speak like 40 lines wasn't really worth it in the end.Art 4 - there is cg and it looks terrible. Art is often shoddy, mis-proportioned, and choppy. Ironic considering Persona 5 is known for its style but the show is just watered down and sad.Sound 7 - At the very least Persona 5 still has its music to its name. Some great songs are in the track, not that the fit with the scenes well at all. If anything, the game tracks are jarring and don't flow well with the show, almost as if they were made in mind for a completely different medium. They are catchy though, so it balances out slightly.Enjoyment 5 - my enjoyment is tied to hearing the dub and seeing a few original scenes here and there. Score would be higher if the rest of the show didn't exist.Overall 4 - If you want to larp as a Persona 5 fan online then put a YouTube let's play on 2x speed. If you want to actually experience Persona 5 play the Royal. Royal fixes many gameplay annoyances with Persona 5 and adds the best story arc in the game and debatably the series (IS and EP are mid fight me). If you have beaten the Royal and want to watch the show for the sake of watching, go on YouTube and watch a highlight reel. There are probably many good ones, and it will save you several hours. If you're a loser and want to watch the first-person Valentine's episode, then play an eroge or get an actual girlfriend instead. of a visual novel) Events and main story beats that shouldn't be rushed are and slice of life and confidant events that should not have episodes dedicated to them have episodes dedicated to them for some reason.

One day, a strange app appears on his phone and he discovers he has the power to summon ""Personas"", spirits that dwell within people. He could enter the twisted hearts of others known as ""Palaces"" and steal the treasure from their Shadow that represent their inner dark desires that will give them a change of heart. As he does so, he soon meets...others that possess the same power and forms the ""Phantom Thieves"", convinced they can make the corrupt world of adults a better place by hitting out at criminals that are out-of-reach from the law.It\'s basically Atlus taking a stab at bringing about awareness of the problems in modern day society in Japan. The OVA ""The Day Breakers"" which acted as a prelude to the game didn\'t really impress me. Art was off compared to the game\'s cutscenes but fortunately the TV series gets off to a good start. Since the OVA, A-1 Pictures has branched out, rebranding one of their studios as CloverWorks in an effort to create a better brand and the art quality for this show is kind of better than the OVA efforts. Characters still look off sometimes like the quality suddenly drops and it\'s obvious the artists still aren\'t very good at using and blending 3D animation into their shows as you can see a lot of models walking around rigidly. As with the game Ann remains your main fan service character although they added some new scenes in while excluding some from the game so, you more or less have the same amount of fan service. Kawakami fans should be pleased. There\'s still your obligatory beach episode (or two) of course and the camera can be asset keen at times. Backgrounds on the other hand are a mixed bag because some such as Leblanc looks great but others such as the common shop you can see there was less effort.The show stays faithful to the game with a few changes (particularly Futaba\'s story) and extra scenes added which I\'m sure will make fans of the game grin - not just for Persona 5 fans but also for people who have played the other titles in the franchise. Some help clarify the story more too such as how the app records what they\'re saying before reaching the first Palace so it\'s good in this regard. There are brief side camera shots of the other characters so it feels less of the JRPG it was where you only focused on one character. That said, the show\'s not afraid to go back to its roots because there\'s so many scenes that will remind you of what made the game fun - negotiations with Shadows, transition scenes, mystery gear drops, confidants etc. They even put in the All Out Attack finishing screens but I don\'t quite get why they start out horrifically plain before they decided to use the game screens later on. Maybe Atlus stepped in. They also chose to skip most of the dungeon crawling but pick up the key parts that will probably make players who finished the game think, ""Oh! I remember that part!"" Boss battles are also play out the way they did in the game.There are two OP theme songs like most series that end in the mid-20s but the first OP for the show actually has two animations, one for first two episodes and then one for episodes 4+ before it changes again at episode 14. The first OP animation actually uses an animated version of the artbook\'s cover too just like when they first teased the Anime. Third OP animation looks better quality than the others and the fourth one during the last episode is probably visually the best in terms of design. There\'s also a slightly different ED animation in episode 17. Episode previews are also stylish, done in a similar style to the game.Most of the music is the same as the game too which is great because the game already had a really good OST. Hearing familiar tunes like ""Beneath The Mask"", ""Layered Cake"" or ""Tokyo Daylight"" playing is awesome. Voices are the same as the game. The show is so faithful to the game you have to wonder how many lines were from the game or if they actually re-recorded the show. As a bit of trivia, Ren\'s voice happens to be Jun Fukuyama who also plays Lelouch from Code Geass and Satsu-sensei from Assasination Classroom while Morgana is played by Ikue Ootani who also plays Chopper in One Piece. And of course, we have Mizuki Nana as Ann, best known as the first voice actress to top the weekly Japanese Oricon JPOP charts.On it\'s own, I don\'t think Anime fans will enjoy it that much because it does show its roots from a video game where you\'re just jumping from boss to boss or, you might just enjoy it for the character driven stories as they overcome their troubles. For fans who enjoyed the game and want to re-live the experience through a different format it\'s worth a watch. Unfortunately, it does go the same route as the Persona 4 Anime where they don\'t air the true ending... Other than that, as a show for Persona 5 fans it\'s really well done despite the inconsistent art quality. It\'s fun watching the gang get together again and there\'s plenty of material in it that\'ll remind you of the game.

It's one of the greatest games I have ever played and one of the best of the decade.The animation does some great parts in the slice of life segments of Ren Amamiya. Some of these scenes are well done and very funny. But the scenes on palaces and the fights...oh God...The fights are incredibly underwhelming and the animation in the palaces are terrible. It's such a shame that some of the best moments in the game (like the boss fights) were short or full of badly drawn characters. Even the All-Out Attacks...suffered with missing frames.It's such a shame that a great game had a cash-grab adaptation with no heart in it.

I have not played any of the Persona games, full disclaimer, so I can not compare whether this was a good adaptation of the game. Overall, this is a decent anime.The story and characters have to be summarized for a project of this nature, so there is a sense that a lot of the minor characters are sort of shoved into the narrative. This is a bit sad considering that the Persona4: the Animation and Persona5...(from what I've seen), plays heavily on the idea of forming relationships with characters.The animation seems to get a little spotty at points, but that is more the exception to rule. The music is catchy and I can see why the original game got a lot of praise for the soundtrack. Overall, this show has a decent story with decent pacing, though I am not a fan of cliffhangers that force me to watch the specials to get a satisfactory ending. I'm looking at you too, DVD release of Persona4: the Animation...I would recommend this series to either a fan or a novice who wants a summary of the game rather than playing. It also works as a very long advertisement for the game, and perhaps I will edit my review once I play the game.Until then, I hope you enjoy.P.S. I finished my first run through of the game and am half way through a second run through. Of course the source material is far more detailed and comprehensive than an anime forced to condense 140 hours of gameplay to a 12 hour show. I stand by my anime review, but the game I bump up +1 to everything (except Sound) for an overall of 8. If you can play the game.Hope you enjoy both.

You get a rushed and highly watered down disappointment.If you\'ve never played Persona 5 for the PS3/PS4, you might find yourself intrigued, and then totally lost in the first few minutes of the first episode. With only 20-something minutes in each episode to tell the same story that a 100+ hour game did, the plot-points and scene transitions are thrown at you so fast you\'ll probably get whiplash. The ever-lurking and ultimately important plot points that involve the Velvet Room (where the...protagonist learns more about the supernatural aspects of his predicaments) usually receive less than a minute total screen time, if it appears at all in any given episode. There\'s no time to grow attached to most of the characters, including the (now-""fully""-voiced) protagonist, because there\'s so many. Apparently the writers/director decided you have to touch on all of them in some way or another as a nod to fans, even though there\'d be more time to understand the main plot if the time related to side characters was spent on making sure the main story/characters are decently written. Sure, there are some moments where you get more info about the characters that weren\'t present in the game (hello, swimsuit Ka- erm, sorry), but again, that time would have been better spent extending the parts of the story that actually matter. The anime currently ends on a cliffhanger, of sorts. If this were the game, it\'d be considered either a bad ending (because you couldn\'t read between the lines and pick the right choices) or you know it\'s a cliffhanger (because surely, I didn\'t just go through this game to get this bull?!) One can only hope the upcoming OVA/second season (god-forbid) paces itself a bit better than what\'s been given so far.I couldn\'t name another A-1 Studios anime if I wanted to, but by god, if the quality of the art in Persona 5 the Animation is any indication of their usual standards, then I never want to see another A-1 anime in my life. The best animation/art in this show can be found in the opening and ending credits, which, while sometimes uninspired or even unrelated to the story, seems to have been where the majority of the art/animation budget has gone. The fight scenes are laughably, depressingly boring, almost as if each one (aside from the boss fights) was completely forgotten about until the studios were ready to greenlight that week\'s episode to air. The stylish All-Out attacks from the game are poorly replicated in terms of both animation and excitement, being used as a cheap cop-out for actually putting some action in the fights. As with many modern anime, there are plenty of stills/shots where characters barely resemble themselves, and you\'d be laughed at for watching this stuff if you pause at the wrong moment.Perhaps the only saving grace for P5A is the music. And only then is it because most of the music is straight up taken from the game soundtrack. Shoji Meguro and the rest of the ATLUS sound team did a fantastic job with it, and it\'s nice to hear it brought back in the anime. Lyn Inaizumi and Benjamin Franklin also return for each ending and opening song, and while they may not be as hype as their tracks from the game, they\'re definitely not hard on the ears.Overall, Persona 5 the Animation just kinda sucks. Though it\'s based upon an award winning video game, the similarities are only superficial. There\'s a lot missing, in terms of story, character development, pacing, art, and animation. As someone who\'s played the game and watched several others play it as well, I\'m not wholly ungrateful for it\'s existence, but I sincerely hope no one pays to own this anime. I would have preferred another side-story be expanded upon via OVA, like Persona 5 The Day Breakers did, instead of watching A-1 Studios cobble this mess together and call it a television show. I would have preferred to just play the game for a second time on the hardest difficulty. I would have preferred every episode show off a certain teacher in lingerie, or even just being a teacher.

There may be troubles with pacing but the story...telling explains out what you miss and and it is kind of a unique way of telling the story. There are so many questions in Persona 5 after getting the answer to one . You end up more curious about the anime. telling explains out what you miss and and it is kind of a unique way of telling the story. There are so many questions in Persona 5 after getting the answer to one . You end up more curious about the anime.', 'P5A, is it worth the watch? Short answer: definitely. I will explain why in more details and give a bit of background as well for better justification and reasoning.First of all, I will only write about the 26 episodes knowing there\'s a sequel. Also, I did not play the game, hence I\'m no fanboy nor hater. But I did my share of reading and played other Atlus related games. Game elements will be used for explanations, not for comparison. You\'re in for a long read so bear with me if you can.To begin with, I first had an interest in the Persona series from P3,...but I didn\'t play the game, only watched the 4 movies. Then came P4A, which I skipped. In 2018, I watched P5A out of curiosity but honestly, I couldn\'t make much sense of everything, especially with the abrupt ending and even after watching the 2 specials for the ending. Then in 2020, I played P4 Golden. In 2021, I finished P5 Strikers. After that, I binge watched P5A 26+2 episodes to write this review. Everything makes sense now and is still fresh in my memory.The story starts with a blast and a very stylish scene in a casino with a thief evading the police. Then he gets caught and there\'s a bad cop interrogation which will be the the main frame of the anime, where everything told by the arrested protagonist is actually the story. It\'s quite the neat setting but there\'s the issue of an ""unreliable narrator"" and it\'s difficult to judge from the start. Apart from that, the story is well played as you encounter more and more characters. This still requires some explanations even though the character Morgana explains everything well. In Persona 5, the heroes find the Palace of a Monarch by saying some keywords to a smartphone app at the correct location in the real world. The Monarch, is the ""shadow"" of an evildoer, usually a scumbag in society. In the Palace, you need to find the Treasure Room and then materialise the Treasure by sending a calling card to the scumbag in the real world. That person becomes particularly aware of their shadow with their wrongdoings listed on the calling card and the Treasure takes form. Then you go back into the Palace, find the Treasure Room with the Monarch defending his/her Treasure, battle, win and steal the Treasure. Rinse and repeat for all the scumbags encountered. This gives a whole meaning to ""Phantom Thieves of the Heart"", the group name for the heroes.Chara development was on point in my opinion, the anime didn\'t spend too much time on the myriads of characters that are more or less important and this is good in my book knowing the 26+2 episodes format. In Persona, Tarot plays a huge part but it\'s quite oblivious in this anime and that\'s a drawback for me. Amamiya Ren (sweet name BTW), is the Fool Arcana as the protagonists in Persona 3 & 4. This Arcana is class 0 in Tarot card, the wild card, then you have ""Chariot"", ""Lovers"", ""Emperor"", ""Magician""... If you watched Jojo Stardust Crusaders, you\'re familiar with them. In Persona, all the major Arcana are associated with a character which explains why you have so many minor characters like the classmate, the homeroom teacher, the fortune teller, the goth doctor and so on. Each time the protagonist interacts with them, he grows internally, which is part of his ""rehabilitation"" to live in society. Gotta say that I understood this only after playing the games though...Some game elements that I didn\'t know at first as well, basically attack elements: Fire (Ann), Ice (Yusuke), Electricity (Ryuji), Wind (Morgana), Nuke (Makoto), Psi (Haru), Bless (???) and Curse (Ren with his first Persona). All-out attacks: when they all gang up on the enemies while the screen turns red and finish with a swag pose. This happened many times in the anime and I couldn\'t understand why until I played P4 but it\'s thanks to P5 Strikers that I know where all the stylish posing and catchphrases come from. Also the different Persona that Ren acquires, you know them if you play the game. As the Fool Arcana, Ren has more than one Persona and can fuse them to get more powerful ones.Concerning the art, I am divided... On one hand the chara design is great, greater than the games. I find Haru more attractive in the anime than the game for example, and same goes for all characters. Stylish scenes and dialogue scenes are well drawn... But on the other hand, transition scenes, group scenes, battle scenes are not so great. It\'s either beautifully animated or sloppy, not much middle ground.Sound: absolutely outstanding for many reasons. The voice acting is just great, all star cast and same as in-game I suppose. Music: I guess it\'s mostly from the game which received critical acclaim for that and I can totally understand why. Then you have 6 more songs by Meguro Shoji & Lyn: ""Break in to break out"", ""Infinity"", ""Found a light"", ""Dark sun"", ""Autonomy"" and lastly ""It\'s too late"". Music and insert songs for the battle scenes are just so well fitted, you feel so energised and ready for a fight.So did I enjoy watching P5A? Not at first, truth be told. As someone who never played the game, many elements in the anime just slipped away from me. For example the many random characters interacting with Ren, I had no idea for what purpose and their respective Arcana was not even explicitly unveiled in the anime. I understood the battle mechanics but not the many gimmicks from the game like all-out attacks or even ""baton pass"". Attack elements were also absent which is not a problem but then you understand from the game why a fire Persona blasting a shadow is uneffective: because of element immunity... But there\'s no point to dwell on this and it wasn\'t that much of an obstacle for enjoyment. The ending was also abrupt and mindblowing for a first watch. The sequels did help though.After listing most of the negative aspects I could think of, I still think P5A does a great job as an anime. Forget the game. Yes it\'s an adaptation, yes the content is not up to par with the game but that\'s beside the point. Persona games are rich with so much content, you can\'t cram a hundred plus hours of playing in an anime. So judging this as a standalone anime, I think P5A was well crafted and pacing was correct for the format, which means it was a bit fast. And it does a wonderful job to promote P5 the game or the Persona series. It\'s stylish, characters are great even though Ren is a bit faded (but I read that this was intentional) and the music is just too addictive. So yes, P5A is worth the watch. It\'s a success as promotional material for Atlus.I hope this review helps you understand the anime or even get interested in the game. Personally I liked P5 Strikers and it made me want to rewatch this anime. And if it wasn\'t for P5A, I am not sure I would have played P4 Golden to get more involved in the Persona series to begin with. but I didn\'t play the game, only watched the 4 movies.

Very little has been cut, and very little has been added. I appreciate that approach when most video game adaptations are garbage with little relation to the source material, but going in this completely faithful direction has its own problems.Persona 5, if you're quick about it, is a 70 hour game. The anime is less than 10 hours long. Even cutting out the time you spend in the game doing straight up gameplay and systems management that an adaptation wouldn't show, you can't shove that amount of plot into a 20-something episode...anime season and expect it to be paced reasonably. You end up with a show that never seems to have enough time, where they rush through every plot point from the original slavishly. They even spend time covering specific gameplay mechanics like baton passing same as in the game, which is fun, but doesn't make a lot of sense in the context of the anime.Pace aside, the show isn't very pretty. There's the occasional cool-looking effect, or fight scene, largely it's unimpressive stuff. Because the anime sticks so closely to the game, it's in the rough position of having to be compared to a game that the devs spent years tarting up to the point where it's the most stylish JRPG ever, and the anime doesn't stand a chance in that fight. When it imitates aspects like the all-out attacks, it just looks pathetic, you can really tell you're getting the amateur version of the beautiful special moves the devs made.

It\'s really hard for me to breakdown the important details of this anime when its based on a video game, let alone based on a game with so much plot and character growth alongside with 100+ hours of gameplay.I love Persona 5. It\'s one of my all time favorites. And an anime adaptation was bound to be heading towards us as a substitute for people who couldn\'t play the game. However even judging it without playing the game and just viewing it as an anime, Persona 5 The Animation feels so rushed. Only...clocking in at around 26 episodes (28 if you want to count the 1 hour specials), it\'s a difficult task to accompany that length to a game that took me 100+ hours to finish. But I might as well. I didn\'t finish it the first time I watched it in 2018, but now I did and let\'s say I wish I hadn\'t.Story + Characters: 6/10 (Story) | 5/10 (Characters)Ren Amamiya is a transfer student who got arrested for defending the honor of a woman who was about to be sexually assaulted. He is then under probation and put under the hands of Sojiro Sakura and is sent over to Shujin Academy. He meets his newly found friends Ryuji, Ann, Makoto, Haru, and even others such as, Yusuke from Kosei High School, and Futaba Sakura, Sojiro\'s adopted daughter. He even meets friends with a talking cat named Morgana. All of them are part of a group called The Phantom Thieves and their main goal is to put an end to the corrupted people in Shibuya by stealing their distorted hearts and making them confess their sins.I\'m lumping both the story and characters together this time because they both easily share the same flaw this anime has. There\'s no room for development at all for both of them due to how rushed the anime is. Characters don\'t get their time to shine all that much with Ren and when they do it\'s pretty brief. What usually takes growing connections and relatable and heartwarming moments, alongside with unlocking new abilities through skill links, ends up being nothing more than a bunch of filler. I understand cutting down in order to make the anime flow better, but it doesn\'t even do that right. Some scenes just show up and end out of nowhere for a brief second not adding amount to anything. It feels so awkward and ruins the moments. With that said, the story remains the same as it was before. It\'s still entertaining but not by much with the problems addressed before. And the character which ended up being some of the most relatable characters, ended up just being one noted and with no special bonds with the characters during Ren\'s off time, they really don\'t play an important factor all that much. They still stay true to themselves so I guess that\'s a redeeming quality I guess.I think Ren got the worst of it. During his time in the anime he\'s mostly silent, only spewing out generic lines such as ""We\'re the Phantom Thieves"" and ""We\'ll stop you!"" It almost feels like the writers just saw the dialogue options in the game, found the best one, and just put them in the script.Art: 5/10And while we\'re on the topic of rushed. Jeez this animation. The game\'s anime cutscenes were by Production I.G. and Domerica. This time, however, the animation was done by CloverWorks. And it was here I questioned why exactly they couldn\'t get Production I.G. to do the anime. Even if the cutscenes weren\'t great, they were miles better than how CloverWorks ended up doing it. While it stays true to the style of the games, the actions scenes are so painful to watch due to how lifeless it is. Even the all out attacks look uninspiring. I assume CloverWorks and Atlus have a strong relationship since they\'ve done the Persona 4 anime plus the Persona 3 movies as well. But if this anime\'s animation didn\'t convince me, I\'m not looking forward to those either in terms of art style.Sound: 7/10I think the sound design might be the best thing about this anime. Though that\'s because all of the music is from the games themselves. Don\'t get me wrong, the soundtrack is excellent in game and the dubbing is too. I personally find the english cast to do a great job as their respective characters. With that said, I feel sad for Xander Mobus who plays as Joker and only has to read 2 or 3 lines every 3 minutes. He deserves much better.Enjoyment and Verdict:Coming from someone who loved the game, this isn\'t a good adaptation. I can only recommend this anime to anyone who doesn\'t feel like playing the game for so long. But even then it has a lasting appeal. Up until the end, the anime just ends up being nothing more than a shadow of the game it was adapted from. And it\'s better off just playing the game instead. Heck, watching a let\'s play of the game is a better option to be honest.5/10 clocking in at around 26 episodes (28 if you want to count the 1 hour specials), it\'s a difficult task to accompany that length to a game that took me 100+ hours to finish.

I assume CloverWorks and Atlus have a strong relationship since they\'ve done the Persona 4 anime plus the Persona 3 movies as well. But if this anime\'s animation didn\'t convince me, I\'m not looking forward to those either in terms of art style.Sound: 7/10I think the sound design might be the best thing about this anime. Though that\'s because all of the music is from the games themselves. Don\'t get me wrong, the soundtrack is excellent in game and the dubbing is too. I personally find the english cast to do a great job as their respective characters. With that said, I feel sad for Xander Mobus who plays as Joker and only has to read 2 or 3 lines every 3 minutes. He deserves much better.Enjoyment and Verdict:Coming from someone who loved the game, this isn\'t a good adaptation. I can only recommend this anime to anyone who doesn\'t feel like playing the game for so long. But even then it has a lasting appeal. Up until the end, the anime just ends up being nothing more than a shadow of the game it was adapted from. And it\'s better off just playing the game instead. Heck, watching a let\'s play of the game is a better option to be honest.5/10', ""I gave this a 10, but only because I played the game before watching this. My bf and I watched this together and then came here to give it a score. That is when we noticed the low scoring but we also understood why. It took us 157 hours to finish Persona 5 Royal, of course it could be less if it wasn't Royal. Therefore, cramming all of that content in anime would be impossible unless it becomes one of the long anime.  This anime kept us watching and we were not bored. It gave us a further look about some events in it...and it was a pleasant thing to see the characters move around and are not just voices and writing. Truly watch it after playing the game, so you understand it better. and it was a pleasant thing to see the characters move around and are not just voices and writing.

I binged this anime in 3 days and it was incredibly enjoyable. What you're getting from most of these ratings are a bunch of stuck up gamers who expect perfection for an anime spinoff.I truly enjoyed how each character was displayed and filled their own respective role in the group, each with their quirks but all required to get the job done.

Therefore, this is not a full blown analysis more than it is a impression that may help you decide to watch it or not (no spoilers)I never played the Persona 5 game, and it\'s obvious that the history, world, combat and characters are better suited for a videogame rather than an anime, but the story holds up pretty well still and it\'s a fun watch.

Something lavish. A sense of scale, setting, space, and tangibility. A tapestry woven together from the scraps of many different influences. Some recognizable, others just on the tip of the tongue. A made-up culture that\'s deep-rooted in particulars of a far-off period. Fauna that adds domestic quality. All these attributes joggled simultaneously, the likes of which can be drastically altered in the absence of finesse. There\'s a culminated purposefulness to Panzer World Galient. A chemistry of fine-tuned planning stripped away of any additives that might dilute...the formula. A formula that was unfortunately rushed, the unforeseen tampering of corporate mandate. The kind of external meddling to a precise algorithm that causes genuine harm to the work in question yet still plays a vital role in its inherent ability to fascinate the unexpected viewer.For behind this tarnished work, the gem of what could have been still managed to shine through—a textbook diamond in the rough. Unpolished and forgotten by many. Buried. Just another date on a calendar. Another entry of yesteryear. But thankfully, one still worth unearthing, for Panzer World Galient has an advantage not allotted to other works. It isn\'t just the brainchild of a nobody. Galient was the work of an industry veteran, guaranteeing that one day, no matter if that day was undetermined, It would be rediscovered by devotees. Steadfast followers, driven by an unspoken understanding that anything orchestrated by this man would yield an interesting artifact. Even if the title in question has suffered from deep-rooted issues—this one certainly has its fair share—the end result would still spark one\'s imagination.That man in question is Ryosuke Takahashi, an auteur within the industry who\'s held a steadfast existence within the realm of name relevancy and the thin membrane that makes up the cult fanbase that religiously consumes his works.For those familiar with his trademark style, a penchant for mechanical detail and world functionality is a must. A kind of hyper-obsession that leads to fantastical constructs. Environments and characters that are highly rendered—tactile. This is a constant for Takahashi, almost done on impulse; OCD-like even. The kind of obsession he\'s demonstrated with the lesser appraised ""big 3"" of the mecha genre, Armored Trooper Votoms, and even more so with his smaller passion projects. From hard sci-fi like Flag to the mystical political drama of Gasaraki, when it comes to methodical plotting, in-story elements that maintain constant plausibility, and malleable characters that retain believable attributes, there\'s not that many that could rival him. He\'s a mad scientist toiling away in his lab. And this time around, the result of his tinkering bears something that\'s unlike his usual outing.Panzer World Galient is an anomaly in Takahashi\'s canon.Transient glimpses of Tolkien rendered topography flickering through in the way it builds upon itself. A world seemingly grafted by stepping forward in any direction. The kind of storytelling where landmarks and casual name drops sweeps over every corner of the foreseeable map, each feeling every bit as significant, whether it has immediate ties to the plot or not.Takahashi\'s work is usually composed of stark realism and hyper-world functionality; a well-oiled machine with characters equally adjusted to operate within it. Seeing his type of penmanship homogenized into a genre that requires flexible renditions of escapist elements makes for an interesting watch. A painterly looseness, the boundless freedom of coloring outside the lines. Magic, fatalism, pure imagination; core aspects that grant high fantasy its freedom to operate like a lucid dream.It\'s a kind of lackadaisical sensibility that goes against the grain of everything Takahashi stands for. And yet, here it is, the tangible form of what is in all likelihood the mixture of oil and water. Only bested by Mamoru Oshii\'s ability to pendulum swing from the casual lightheartedness of the Patlabor TV series, to the muted cynicism of the film installments that proceeded it.

A true patriarch. Panzer World Galient, or Galient, as I\'ll refer to it going forward, was one of anime\'s first successful mixtures of high fantasy, mecha, and sci-fi.Planet Arst, home to a civilization stuck in the Middle Ages, comes face-to-face with a foreign enemy; their technology otherworldly, their invasion methods ruthless. A destructive force governed by a tyrannical ruler named Marder. A man every bit as mysterious as the weapons he deploys. It\'s the natives vs. the colonists. Historically, the colonists are usually victorious, for the people of Volder\'s kingdom, their first encounter against Marder and his empire was no different. They stood there, transfixed in the face of utter defeat. Twelve years later, Marder still sits on the iron throne; his reign met with contempt. Jordy Volder, the forgotten prince of the fallen kingdom of house Volder, fights back. The fate of Arst held in the balance, while a bigger truth looms over it all.Kunio Okawara and Yutaka Izubuchi are mecha experts. They give life to Takahashi\'s vision. Frankenstein mixtures of inhuman steel giants and fable-inspired entities. They don\'t take long to make their debut. In only a few minutes we\'re greeted by Marder\'s steampunk jousting centaurs; bodies coated in titanium, lances in hand, they gallop through the night like apparitions of an oncoming apocalypse. Swarming behind these imposing mechanical beasts are Marder\'s army; hooded figures donning executioner masks, mounted on the backs of armless velociraptors, electric battle axes in hand—a mixture of primitive and futuristic. The robust tank-like motion of a pitch-black battle armada leading the charge, standing several stories high, a monolith that shakes the earth around it—this is only the teaser for things to come.A storm of metal, exhaust smoke, and bloodlust—their target, the common folk. Poorly armed farmers. Men with secondhand weaponry. Wooden bows and arrows, medieval swords, shields made of flimsy iron—child\'s play. A one-sided battle. Their determination to win being their only true asset, as steel meets with even harder steel. Fighting fire with fire proven futile when it\'s a flamethrower pitted against a candle flame. But victory isn\'t Marder\'s, not as long as Joldy is around to deny him the satisfaction.For Joldy stands as the child of myth. A descendant of Homer\'s Greek epics, birthed from the sands of Arst and ancient literature. His name and presence itself is a story simply waiting to be told. The honorary prince, protector of the weak, strength of his people. A pupil of sword-and-sandal adventures. Piloting a mech perhaps more distinguished than himself. A holdover from a forgotten time, hidden underground, only awakening from its slumber for a moment like this.This is what Takahashi brings to the table: discipline, foresight, systematic control. A sense of causality for the usual carefree nature of high fantasy sagas. A fixation for detail demonstrated in the battle tactics adopted by the people of Galient. An unnecessary amount of planning to the way widgets function. The anatomy of machines. The habits of creatures that call this world home. The backstory to things not needed to be seen. Lively personalities, warriors and citizens, friends, and enemies alike, adapted to the machinations of their surroundings, each serving their purpose. Each comfortably fitting within their world—details matter. Context matters. Subtext matters. Motivations matters. Worldbuilding matters. Setting matters. Characterization matters. Nothing is shortchanged. Excuses are not acceptable when you enter this man\'s lab. This is the discipline of a creator that understands that art without purpose is no better than highly-rendered vandalism.

King of Prism: Shiny Seven Stars,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39699/King_of_Prism__Shiny_Seven_Stars,"['Oh lord, I\'m only writing this review because I think it deserves an analysis from someone who has actually SEEN the Pretty Rhythm series from start to finish. If you\'re going to start this anime on its own, just know it means you\'re practically watching the 2nd half of a finale and have no business doing a review based on that alone.So where do you start? Tl;dr 1) watch two movies: \'King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm\' and \'King of Prism: Pride the Hero\' first THEN this one.2) For best experience, watch Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live first, it has a female cast but...serves as the prequel to King of Prism3) Technically the King of Prism series are solely for Pretty Rhythm fans so you should in fact just start all the way back from Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream (not that there\'s any important plot points but there are maaaany jokes/references that you will only get by watching that), though its optional esp if you\'ve outgrown children\'s animeHere\'s the long explanation:One of the great things about Pretty Rhythm stories (Aurora Dream, Dear My Future, Rainbow Live, King of Prism) is that unlike other shoujo/magical girl franchises it NEVER repeats itself, instead it grows up with you. While I was watching it throughout my teenage years I\'m always surprised with a ""there\'s no way that they did that""; anyway I\'m going to explain this in a way that people that have never seen Pretty Rhythm can understand where I am coming from.Imagine starting off with a completely innocent coming-of-age idol anime touching some heavy topics such as friendship/loneliness, sabotage, child abandonment -> that is Aurora Dream. Next we are presented with a more worldly, competitive, shounen-like story, with a new cast of characters including Korean idols. A world where ""winning isn\'t important as long as your audience is happy"" cliche DOESN\'T EXIST anymore \\o/ and being no. 1 is everything -> that is Dear My Future, the sequel to Aurora Dream which cleverly completes the story of the first season and its literal hype.Now if it wasn\'t amazing enough that we\'ve got an idol anime with an actual villain (well... I mean one that is actually a threat), how about we diversify the music, improve the CG art by leaps and bounds, have no filler episodes and add instruments to the performances? Okay now we\'ve got Rainbow Live. While set in a completely different world, it\'s still the same universe with a new cast of characters. The story goes more in depth about the idol system that was in the first two seasons. What\'s great about Rainbow Live is that plot armor doesn\'t exist - there are 7 ""heroes"" so it\'s not always the main protagonist that shines. Now this season is from 6 years ago (as of writing) so it might not be a surprise now but watching this anime was like the start of a revolution. Never have I seen an idol anime where the songs aren\'t always the happy generic pop type but now we\'ve gotten straight up rock, jazz and some classical elements in these girl\'s performances to showcase their individual characteristics. The story is full of mystery, the romance is unpredictable, there are some happy moments but its ~80% complications and angst. Some characters have happy families, others have issues of their own resulting in a lot more conflict initially. We\'ve still got a villain in the show and long and behold, they\'ve finally introduced male idols!And that\'s when we get to King of Prism. Granted you need to watch the first two movies: King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm and King of Prism: Pride the Hero. They focus on the main male love interests of Rainbow Live: Kouji, Hiro and Kazuki who are the main heroes but also act as mentors to the new cast of 7 male characters in the final installment of the Pretty Rhythm series - Shiny Seven Stars. It essentially brings light to the dark/corrupt side of the idol system that they are using and concludes the end of the main villain. Funny enough, if you told middle school aged me about King of Prism I would\'ve gone ""ew nah, male idols? not interested"". Unfortunately, I\'ve grown an interest in BL along my anime journey, then King of Prism came out; so with each season being targeted by a higher-aged audience it certainly feels like I\'ve grown with the series.Now here are some FAQs (haha I wish as if anyone\'s ever asked me questions about Pretty Rhythm TT^TT)Do I need to watch Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live/King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm/Pride the Hero?You do not need to watch Rainbow Live esp if you\'re not interested in female idols, but I highly recommend you do since some characters in King of Prism had their journey start from Rainbow Live, notably the main love interests and Yu Suzuno who is the younger brother of one of the main characters. Also starting with King of Prism may be overwhelming since all the characters are technically ""good"" already. Some of the stuff they do (like four-chained jumps) may seem normal but were originally impossible feats in Rainbow Live. Though, if you do not want to watch it, scroll down to Rainbow Live spoilers to see what you need to know anyway.The first two movies is a must though. While the seven main characters play a minor role in them as it is Kouji/Hiro/Kazuki focused, it sets up the conflict leading up to the main seven competing against the main villain. How it goes is that all 12 episodes takes place in a single tournament day, focusing on one character each episode and their background story leading up to their final performance. Why would you start a story at its conclusion? Start with the movies.In fact, you should just start from Aurora Dream if you can since that story itself far surpasses other popular idol anime I\'ve seen such as Aikatsu, Love Live, PriPara... I won\'t say AKB0048 since that was just as emotional. (sorry no hate, don\'t get me wrong some of those anime do things much better than Aurora Dream but in terms of story they always had the most impact for me) Not to mention that there are a sht ton of easter eggs that reference all the way back to the first seasons of Pretty Rhythm ever.Is it gay?Yes. But don\'t come here if you\'re looking for a proper BL story because the representation is kind of bad. While Kouji, Hiro and Kazuki have gay elements in their performances (for fan-service\'s sake) it is already established in Rainbow Live that they are straight. Nevertheless, it\'s presented as a running gag that some male characters, with absolutely no shame, act ""flirty"" while others refuse to do so. The ""friendships"" between the male characters are abused so bad it\'s so good, but thankfully only where appropriate. As an example, Leo Saionji (a girly-guy) acts like a possessive girlfriend to the MC but oh thank god they never fetishise Yu Suzuno, the younger brother, as that would\'ve been concerning. Because Shin x Louis exists, there is actual canonical romance but you shouldn\'t count on them since it\'s sorta... ya know... toxic... unless you enjoy tragic love I guess. (should also note that Rainbow Live itself had subtle lesbian bait so LGBT elements isn\'t exactly a new thing in Pretty Rhythm)Can I ignore the gay?No. This anime is packed with wayyyy more fanservice than Yuri on Ice. Some of the idols are extremely flirty inside (and outside) of their performance - sometimes intentional, sometimes as a joke, sometimes due to influence/peer pressure AND sometimes they don\'t. As I mentioned, it\'s only there when appropriate so for some characters whose identity isn\'t romantic/flirty they won\'t incorporate that into their performance. For the most part, it is very gay. Most (not all) characters are gay in their own unique way. The main character is gay, the villains are very gay I have no other word to describe it and you will understand if you watch it.Is King of Prism solely for fanservice?Considering that this is a sequel to Rainbow Live they both made this anime fujoshi-bait while managing to complete the story as a whole so as a Rainbow Live fan, watching this is a must. In fact, they pretty much completed the mysteries of Pretty Rhythm\'s world-building since it started back from Aurora Dream episode 1. Shiny Seven Stars is an episodic anime and the contents of the story highly depend on the focus characters in that episode. We\'ve got the MC involved in a romantic relationship, we\'ve got some characters looking up to their mentors like they\'re in love, we\'ve got characters who enjoy dressing flamboyant and some of them are totally normal. Regarding the themes of the show, I\'d say it\'s prominently about self-identity. What is their purpose? What are their motives/resolves? What can they offer to the team? Surprisingly all these characters have depth for an episode worth of screentime. You learn about their backgrounds, experiences, and when you see these characters learn something about themselves, you might learn something about yourself. If you dislike shallow characters, honestly you don\'t have to worry with this anime because character development is one of the best. Even the villains aren\'t just ""bad guys"" but they\'re treated as humans too.[RAINBOW LIVE SPOILERS]What do I need to know if I don\'t want to watch Rainbow Live?Basic terminology relating to the idol system of their world explained in Rainbow Live -> Prism Shows are the main entertainment system which combines ice-skating, singing, dancing and appeals (which come off kinda as super powers). Should note that this anime is based on a children\'s arcade game. The main appeal is called a Prism Jump - basically the performer does a figure skating jump, they can create illusions and points are earned based on the quality of the jump. The main way (initially) to gather points in tournaments was doing multiple jumps in a row. The struggle in Rainbow Live was being able to do four consecutive jumps which only non-humans were able to achieve at first.Another appeal is called Prism Live which was introduced in Rainbow Live and allows the performer to play with instruments, which only the 7 MCs could do but now just about anyone can do them. At the end of Rainbow Live, a bunch of appeals that weren\'t jumps/lives were introduced which is why the King of Prism series is much crazier than Rainbow Live with everyone doing all sorts of unique tricks of their own.The most top-tier tournament is the Prism Queen/King Cup separated by gender. Edel Rose which is the Prism Show specialty school the MC enrolls in were originally the antagonists in Rainbow Live, until the principal (main villain) was kicked out.Also Kouji has a girlfriend, Hiro was originally the bad guy, Jin is Hijiri\'s half-brother and has an inferiority complex which is why he\'s evil. The different worlds in Pretty Rhythm is connected by a magical realm called Prism World which is the power source for Prism Shows (its how people can dance on ice and create illusions like its normal) and they are delivered by messengers called Rinne who are all identical but can take a different appearance to pose as human beings. At any point, the staff in Prism World can essentially cut off the power source and end Prism Show entertainment in any human world. June (the nun; supporting character) was one of the villains in Rainbow Live and a Rinne, but became human and lost her memories.How is King of Prism different to Rainbow Live? Is it better?Songs are more individualistic (we\'ve got straight up a street dancer wearing a fundoshi, Kabuki dancer, and cross-dressing) so yeah it is very, very wild. You know how at the end of Pretty Rhythm superpowers other than Prism Lives are introduced? Yeah that happens and the diversification is crazy. Sadly there is less focus on chained jumps though. Personally, I liked Rainbow Live more but I think the performances in Shiny Seven Stars are better in terms of uniqueness, originality, and overall aesthetic.Do Naru and the others come back?They come back as cameos, some of them have speaking lines but they don\'t play a role in King of Prism sadly.[RAINBOW LIVE SPOILERS END]Finally, will I enjoy King of Prism if I don\'t watch Rainbow Live?Honestly I don\'t think you\'ll receive the same enjoyment as someone who has seen Rainbow Live; in fact, some people say you do need to watch Rainbow Live. It depends though. Do you like idol anime? Do you appreciate CG? (I once showed the CG to a friend saying how good it is and they complained it looks ""too obvious"", so if you\'re that person then you probably don\'t like CG). Are you a mature audience? Do you not mind gay tropes/mild nudity? If yes to both then there is a high chance you\'ll like this anime.On the other hand, if you\'re a Pretty Rhythm fan, this would probably be the best thing you\'ve ever seen just for the sake of seeing a children\'s anime targeted for adults combined with satisfying top-tier performance - the creators literally decided to do whatever the hell they wanted with it without caring about public opinion, only for it to actually be well received. It\'s definitely not childish but it doesn\'t try to be emo/edgy either. You can complain about the yaoi-bait but Pretty Rhythm IS a female-targeted anime and holy it\'s actually fluffin nostalgic with all the references they put that you can only understand by watching the very start AND Pretty Rhythm\'s successor PriPara. Funny enough the quality of Pretty Rhythm peaks in this season; in fact, it\'s because the creators put so much effort into making King of Prism so over the top that it\'s one hell of a masterpiece. serves as the prequel to King of Prism3) Technically the King of Prism series are solely for Pretty Rhythm fans so you should in fact just start all the way back from Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream (not that there\'s any important plot points but there are maaaany jokes/references that you will only get by watching that), though its optional esp if you\'ve outgrown children\'s animeHere\'s the long explanation:One of the great things about Pretty Rhythm stories (Aurora Dream, Dear My Future, Rainbow Live, King of Prism) is that unlike other shoujo/magical girl franchises it NEVER repeats itself, instead it grows up with you. While I was watching it throughout my teenage years I\'m always surprised with a ""there\'s no way that they did that""; anyway I\'m going to explain this in a way that people that have never seen Pretty Rhythm can understand where I am coming from.Imagine starting off with a completely innocent coming-of-age idol anime touching some heavy topics such as friendship/loneliness, sabotage, child abandonment -> that is Aurora Dream. Next we are presented with a more worldly, competitive, shounen-like story, with a new cast of characters including Korean idols. A world where ""winning isn\'t important as long as your audience is happy"" cliche DOESN\'T EXIST anymore \\o/ and being no. 1 is everything -> that is Dear My Future, the sequel to Aurora Dream which cleverly completes the story of the first season and its literal hype.Now if it wasn\'t amazing enough that we\'ve got an idol anime with an actual villain (well... I mean one that is actually a threat), how about we diversify the music, improve the CG art by leaps and bounds, have no filler episodes and add instruments to the performances? Okay now we\'ve got Rainbow Live. While set in a completely different world, it\'s still the same universe with a new cast of characters. The story goes more in depth about the idol system that was in the first two seasons. What\'s great about Rainbow Live is that plot armor doesn\'t exist - there are 7 ""heroes"" so it\'s not always the main protagonist that shines. Now this season is from 6 years ago (as of writing) so it might not be a surprise now but watching this anime was like the start of a revolution. Never have I seen an idol anime where the songs aren\'t always the happy generic pop type but now we\'ve gotten straight up rock, jazz and some classical elements in these girl\'s performances to showcase their individual characteristics. The story is full of mystery, the romance is unpredictable, there are some happy moments but its ~80% complications and angst. Some characters have happy families, others have issues of their own resulting in a lot more conflict initially. We\'ve still got a villain in the show and long and behold, they\'ve finally introduced male idols!And that\'s when we get to King of Prism. Granted you need to watch the first two movies: King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm and King of Prism: Pride the Hero. They focus on the main male love interests of Rainbow Live: Kouji, Hiro and Kazuki who are the main heroes but also act as mentors to the new cast of 7 male characters in the final installment of the Pretty Rhythm series - Shiny Seven Stars. It essentially brings light to the dark/corrupt side of the idol system that they are using and concludes the end of the main villain. Funny enough, if you told middle school aged me about King of Prism I would\'ve gone ""ew nah, male idols? not interested"". Unfortunately, I\'ve grown an interest in BL along my anime journey, then King of Prism came out; so with each season being targeted by a higher-aged audience it certainly feels like I\'ve grown with the series.Now here are some FAQs (haha I wish as if anyone\'s ever asked me questions about Pretty Rhythm TT^TT)Do I need to watch Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live/King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm/Pride the Hero?You do not need to watch Rainbow Live esp if you\'re not interested in female idols, but I highly recommend you do since some characters in King of Prism had their journey start from Rainbow Live, notably the main love interests and Yu Suzuno who is the younger brother of one of the main characters.

Only read if you have finished the series. --I'm gonna get straight to the point, because quite frankly there's not much going for this show. This one of the worst things I have ever seen.Basically, two people who happen to look alike decide to switch roles and do the other person's job. In a really dumb way, it somehow manages to work. The female lead goes to an all-boy school that is made for fighting - I guess - because they're never in class to begin with. Anyway, through sheer stupidity of the side characters, they support her and...believe her, along with two other characters that know her identity. In the end, when it's made apparent that her secret is known, she decides to not reveal anything whatsoever, and it somehow manages to work out, again.Not only was the story terrible, but the action scenes were incredibly dull as well. The viewers are also expected to believe that she successfully beat everyone with no real explanation to it. Not only that, but she has a past history with one character in particular, but nothing ever really happens with them.Long story short: I understand you're the main character, but there's no way things just magically work out like that. Besides the obvious things, one may struggle to realize what the point in all of this was. believe her, along with two other characters that know her identity.

Main female character has a lovable personality and not annoyingly immature or stupid2. Amazing voice acting by star-studded seiyuus3. Doki doki (heart pounding) moments e.g. Kabe-don4. Beautiful art style of all main characters e.g. Ikemen types for Otome fans to swoon over5. Humour = hilarious at some partsMy only disappointment is that each episode is only 8 mins, but it's common for Developers to introduce Otome game with a short anime. I...can only hope the psvita game ever gets translated into English so that I can buy it.

A story about friendship and lots of funny scenes involved as well. Every episode is just to show character development for the main characters. Fighting scenes are short but pretty good!Even though it is kind of a harem anime, there is no romance involved at all which is what I\'m looking for. Kenka Banchou Otome can be quite predictable and Hinako will talk to the viewers a lot through this thing called the ""4th wall"".Character: 8Each characters are different and have unique personalities.

This isn\'t a very cerebral show. It\'s simple, but it\'s simple done well all because its main focus is on the fight scenes between the protagonist and the other characters.Each episode is terribly short and all the characters are one-dimensional, but boy, if you\'re a fan of good fight sequences, this otome-based shoujo is the anime for you.I\'m quite happy with the creative decisions the studios behind this series took with...this show. I haven\'t played the original otome game, but I read the manga adaptation when I found out about the plot of the then ""to-be-released"" anime.

It’s lighthearted, it’s fun and if you don’t think too much about it, it’s really a must-watch for reverse harems/otome fans. I don’t think it’d be a waste of your time anyway, since it’s so short. What are you waiting for?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But since this aspect is what counts the least for me, let me get to the juice.From an overall perspective, I seriously...don’t know if I am just starting to grow out of these reverse harem animes, but from when UtaPri proved to be so marketable, I have the impression it just triggered the path towards “standard-ness” and just generally fear of risk. I used to be a big defender of fanservice animes directed to a straight girls audience in the past because of how little there even were: I liked Hanasakeru Seishonen, I liked Amnesia (despite the general complaints), I liked Arcana Famiglia and I even liked UtaPri for being so cutely cringy and aware of itself. But do you know what these reverse harems had in common? Potential and a great deal of passion. That’s something that I feel less and less the more the genre is starting to become more mainstream in recent days and Girl beats Boys is a very good example.StoryWell, one thing is certain; this anime is a great advertisement for its otome game counterpart. I love otome games so there’s that, but on the other hand, saying it’s like an “advertisement” is not exactly a compliment when it comes to a show.The main issue with it is that it’s unsure of what its point is. Is it commenting on gender stereotypes? Is it enforcing gender stereotypes? The dialogues were ambiguous enough to manage to lean towards both and none.  Then, is it about the heroine discovering love by beating guys up in an all-male school to get to be the boss of the entire said-school for her twin brother? Eeeehhh….Yes, but not as much as it is about her discovering the power of bromance and yet still managing to treat it superficially when she just went through all these poster-perfect guys, defeated them and collected them to her bro-team because that’s totally what guys do after being defeated in battle, am I right? 8D.... Am I to understand the male gender is like pokemons then? O-o Let me try that the next time I find myself in an all-male school and try, for reasons, to just defeat all dungeon bosses and get to the top of the castle to save the prince only to discover he is in a different castle---wait what? Wrong story? My bad, it gets tough to figure out at one point.Ehm, Mirakochu, I CHOOSE YOU!If you somehow get around the “point”, the next issue is about the short-lived conflicts.  It’s really hard to care when everything just gets settled in what is like 5 seconds and I wouldn’t blame that on the lack of screening time seeing how there are shows that manage to convey more and better in less time (unless the otome game is just that bad...).For example, what I’d take out are those instances when the characters seem to be narrating to somebody at times, but it’s never revealed who they’re actually talking to. Are they talking to me? Because if so there’s a very weird unnecessary disconnect there; the narrating could have perfectly been integrated in the show or just have more of that small, little, “show don’t tell” technique. It appears to me that the reverse harem industry thinks we’re stupid or something if they don’t just tell us everything, but I guess that’s an issue of nowadays media as a whole.Lastly, they aren’t even consistent with the little plot there is. It’s just offending to have one scene be recognized as acknowledgement and a hinted silent nod from one of the guys, only for the next episode to deny it by dumbing up said-involved-character. How are people possibly that stupid, I ask? (I'd have given it a 5 for managing to be so fun, if it weren't for this )And by the way of Characters…I probably wouldn’t have been so salty at this anime if the characters at least showed some potential, but unfortunately they’re the standard-est of stereotypes. They are supposed to have some sort of character arc in each episode, but besides Mirako, shortened as “idol guy”, where they tried to do something with his cynical attitude (but ultimately failing because “by the power of bromance” ), the others don’t really go beyond “that cool guy who was an orphan” or “that short guy with a big family”.  It’s particularly worrying when nobody really sticks up in your mind, if not for superficial biased reasons. I’m really questioning if they can be called “characters” at this point.And now let’s finally talk about the heroine. Fortunately, I think we are starting to get over the bland self-insert heroine who’s main traits are being clumsy and furiously blushing everytime a person of the opposite gender pokes her. And thanks God for that, but at the same time, she doesn’t have enough character to do main heroines justice either.  She knows martial arts, she’s nice and she always felt lonely, but that’s basically how you can resume her entire character. Unfortunately, with the add of the “badass” trait, you don’t automatically make a “strong female protagonist”. I’ll stop being a b*tch and at least give it props for trying though.AnimationWell, that is also quite standard switching to hilariously bad looking during the fighting scenes, but hey. Standard is not bad, I’m sure they did what they could with that. The color palette is quite bright and colorful with a switch of darker tones during the school scenes, probably to emphasize the overall competitive aura of it.SoundI honestly really liked the opening song, also the fact that they didn’t lose time with it and decided to throw in some scenes of what was currently going on in the episode which worked great with the song.  They did a good job there.In conclusion, only check it out if you want to see something bright and fun. Really. don’t know if I am just starting to grow out of these reverse harem animes, but from when UtaPri proved to be so marketable, I have the impression it just triggered the path towards “standard-ness” and just generally fear of risk. I used to be a big defender of fanservice animes directed to a straight girls audience in the past because of how little there even were: I liked Hanasakeru Seishonen, I liked Amnesia (despite the general complaints), I liked Arcana Famiglia and I even liked UtaPri for being so cutely cringy and aware of itself. But do you know what these reverse harems had in common? Potential and a great deal of passion. That’s something that I feel less and less the more the genre is starting to become more mainstream in recent days and Girl beats Boys is a very good example.StoryWell, one thing is certain; this anime is a great advertisement for its otome game counterpart. I love otome games so there’s that, but on the other hand, saying it’s like an “advertisement” is not exactly a compliment when it comes to a show.The main issue with it is that it’s unsure of what its point is. Is it commenting on gender stereotypes? Is it enforcing gender stereotypes? The dialogues were ambiguous enough to manage to lean towards both and none.  Then, is it about the heroine discovering love by beating guys up in an all-male school to get to be the boss of the entire said-school for her twin brother? Eeeehhh….Yes, but not as much as it is about her discovering the power of bromance and yet still managing to treat it superficially when she just went through all these poster-perfect guys, defeated them and collected them to her bro-team because that’s totally what guys do after being defeated in battle, am I right? 8D.... Am I to understand the male gender is like pokemons then? O-o Let me try that the next time I find myself in an all-male school and try, for reasons, to just defeat all dungeon bosses and get to the top of the castle to save the prince only to discover he is in a different castle---wait what? Wrong story? My bad, it gets tough to figure out at one point.Ehm, Mirakochu, I CHOOSE YOU!If you somehow get around the “point”, the next issue is about the short-lived conflicts.  It’s really hard to care when everything just gets settled in what is like 5 seconds and I wouldn’t blame that on the lack of screening time seeing how there are shows that manage to convey more and better in less time (unless the otome game is just that bad...).For example, what I’d take out are those instances when the characters seem to be narrating to somebody at times, but it’s never revealed who they’re actually talking to. Are they talking to me? Because if so there’s a very weird unnecessary disconnect there; the narrating could have perfectly been integrated in the show or just have more of that small, little, “show don’t tell” technique. It appears to me that the reverse harem industry thinks we’re stupid or something if they don’t just tell us everything, but I guess that’s an issue of nowadays media as a whole.Lastly, they aren’t even consistent with the little plot there is. It’s just offending to have one scene be recognized as acknowledgement and a hinted silent nod from one of the guys, only for the next episode to deny it by dumbing up said-involved-character. How are people possibly that stupid, I ask? (I'd have given it a 5 for managing to be so fun, if it weren't for this )And by the way of Characters…I probably wouldn’t have been so salty at this anime if the characters at least showed some potential, but unfortunately they’re the standard-est of stereotypes.

The anime was pretty good, considering it didn’t have a big budget OR that many hours dedicated to it. Lemme break it down for those of you still reading my review:Story: 8/10Why...an 8? Because despite what everybody here is saying about the story being boring and predictable, I did not find it so. There were little twists and turns that constantly managed to surprise me, especially seeing how this anime was adapted from an otome gameSound: 9/10The OP took me completely by surprise, because it was way too heavy for a traditionally female fanbase, and I suppose that made me like it even more! It’s the same for the ED!Animation: 8/10Again, considering the budget restraints this anime had, I was very happy with the quality of animation they presented, especially when the fight scenes came over. I expected them to be choppy and clunky, but nope! They were pretty seamless.Characters: 7/10Ah, when an anime is 6 minutes long (excluding the OP and ED), you really can’t expect much character development, can you? With the introduction of every new character, their personality was made crystal clear, and if you ask me, that’s a hella difficult job. Sure, they do fit in your typical anime stereotypes (the pretty idol, the tsundere, the protective one and the loner), but then again – this anime doesn’t have the luxury of delving into deep character developments because of its severe time constraints. So, no complaints from me!This was a reverse harem, so my hopes weren’t very high. Because we all know how the female leads are – stupid and completely clueless of people’s feelings for her. But not here. Because for starters, nobody liked her (except the idol star) – they all treated her as a friend, and she had more than one occasion to showcase how strong she was – both emotionally and physically. She did not need any boy to save her. If at all, she was the one saving people’s asses and I simply LOVED that in this anime. If this is how modern reverse harems are gonna be, bring ‘em on! an 8?

There\'s nothing worth your time here, and unless you don\'t care about the quality of an anime, I can\'t see who this anime could be for. My best advice is to stay away unless you have some sort of compulsion to watch every single otome show out there or are really desperate for a halfway to mediocre time waster.Now don\'t get me wrong, this anime is not hateable or anything like that in my opinion. Actually, I think the idea behind it could have been kind of fun and entertaining. The show however,...executes it really poorly. Prepare for a long explanation why.Plot:So the show is about a reverse-trap in an all-male school where she has to beat up everyone in order to be like, the boss of the student body or something. Of course, the backstory of her twin brother and a school that has an all-out brawl for an entrance ceremony isn\'t steeped in realism, but it doesn\'t have to be. We\'re here for the fights and the guys am I right? So who cares, the story serves its purpose. What we need are some cool characters to carry it.Characters & Pacing:These guys are in short, exceedingly generic. Their personalities are unfortunately flat and at first, you might be tempted to blame it on the length of the episodes since the show likes to hint that there\'s more to these guys than the story is really telling you. I disagree. The show makes many errors in their pacing, and there are many short shows that do an extremely better job at fleshing out their characters. The 8-min length of the episodes is not a good enough excuse to cop out on giving us interesting and/or engaging characters. The narrating that the characters do at the beginning of episodes is unneeded in my opinion, and having them do this takes time away from showing instead of telling what could have been the show\'s strengths; setting details, more and better fights, fleshed-out personalities. I really think the staff made a mistake in choosing to instead spend some of their precious episode time on unnecessary narration of all things.In addition, the show seems to drag its feet in places, like in one episode where the characters take like two minutes to stare at books, do narration, and talk about homework. That could be easily compressed into like 10-15 seconds of speaking lines about homework and leave the rest of the time for other things.This leaves some of the male characters with far shorter character arcs than others. While some guys get 1-2 episodes of their arcs, some get like 3-4. They really don\'t need that much. In summary, many things could have been cut or compressed to give more time to the characters. It\'s disappointing that the staff didn\'t do that and I don\'t think it\'s fair to blame it on the show\'s length.The Protagonist and The Fights:But who really cares right? In the end, fairly good-looking guys are good enough for you and you just wanna see some girl kick their butts. Forget romance and 3-dimensional guys, we want some action! Well you and me both. I came to this show thinking that maybe I might find something that might look like an interesting, strong, maybe gender-challenging, female lead. And well, the show seems to have a surface level idea of what that means but a lack of understanding of how to show it.Hikaru(Hinako in reality) is the strongest in the school in terms of fighting skill so I would have given the show a higher rating if the fight scenes were cool. On one hand, they weren\'t boring, and it was nice to see a girl get punched in a serious street fight with a guy and hold her own for a change. That being said, they aren\'t anything special in terms of animation or exciting moves or anything like that. The only thing going for it is the novelty that it\'s guys fighting a girl, thinking she\'s a guy.Hikaru(Hinako)\'s motivations and personality are also a mystery but a generic female lead isn\'t exactly news in otome anime and games. This show tries to remedy that by making her personality seem more like a male character\'s instead. I can only assume that this is to make her seem like a more proactive character rather than a passive one (passive like Ema from BroCon). This backfires though, as the staff just give her run-of-the-mill male-like traits like determination, friendliness, and an unwillingness to give up. Hinako now becomes indistinguishable from a generic male lead.Hikaru(Hinako) is also puzzlingly intent on saying and proving that she\'s a guy the whole show period, which is weird because there seems to be no reason for it. Why should she want to be seen as a guy? Does she not care? Then why is she so vehement about it? Does she identify as a guy? Then why does the show treat her as a possible girly love interest from time to time? The show wants it to look as if she likes being treated as an equal and as a friend amongst men, yet keeps putting her in somewhat fanservicy positions with them. If the show was trying to present an otome character that the guys saw as both an equal and a romantic interest, than why didn\'t it have any romantic development in the slightest?The Romance:Some of you might be in the other camp; people who want to see a trashy romance-teasing shipfest of an otome anime and that\'s fine. You won\'t find it here. Frustratingly, the show can\'t seem to make up its mind on whether it wants the main lead to be a romantic interest (UtaPri, Kamigami, BroCon) or a commentary on gender roles (Kashima from Gekkan Shoujo). It also does not seem to be a smart enough show to make Hinako both (Ouran High) either.For some reason, the show teases that some characters have figured out that Hinako is a girl. This is obviously so that they can see her as a potential love interest, yet they never fall through. Hinako always denies it for no clear discernible reason, there\'s a fight, and then the guy says that of course she\'s a guy, a girl wouldn\'t punch like that. This is a problematic attitude and in the hands of a better show, Hinako would challenge this idea to make the themes a whole lot more interesting. However it never gets bellow surface level and in consequence, the show\'s themes come across as sexist rather than gender challenging. Nothing really happens romance-wise.In Summary:This show\'s themes are all over the place and it can\'t seem to decide what it wants to do. The male leads are only memorable by their candy-colored hair and lack of depth. The protagonist tries to avoid being a generic female lead by becoming a generic male lead. The fights are probably the best part of the show, which isn\'t a complement since they aren\'t ""wow""-inspiring, and anything the show could have done to add some more ""character"" to their characters was derailed by its bad pacing and choice to fill up time with narration.In conclusion, unless you need to watch every single otome anime out there or like me, are heedless of the quality and have a craving to see a romance-free anime about a girl being treated like a guy, this show is not for you. executes it really poorly. Prepare for a long explanation why.Plot:So the show is about a reverse-trap in an all-male school where she has to beat up everyone in order to be like, the boss of the student body or something. Of course, the backstory of her twin brother and a school that has an all-out brawl for an entrance ceremony isn\'t steeped in realism, but it doesn\'t have to be. We\'re here for the fights and the guys am I right? So who cares, the story serves its purpose. What we need are some cool characters to carry it.Characters & Pacing:These guys are in short, exceedingly generic. Their personalities are unfortunately flat and at first, you might be tempted to blame it on the length of the episodes since the show likes to hint that there\'s more to these guys than the story is really telling you. I disagree. The show makes many errors in their pacing, and there are many short shows that do an extremely better job at fleshing out their characters. The 8-min length of the episodes is not a good enough excuse to cop out on giving us interesting and/or engaging characters. The narrating that the characters do at the beginning of episodes is unneeded in my opinion, and having them do this takes time away from showing instead of telling what could have been the show\'s strengths; setting details, more and better fights, fleshed-out personalities. I really think the staff made a mistake in choosing to instead spend some of their precious episode time on unnecessary narration of all things.In addition, the show seems to drag its feet in places, like in one episode where the characters take like two minutes to stare at books, do narration, and talk about homework. That could be easily compressed into like 10-15 seconds of speaking lines about homework and leave the rest of the time for other things.This leaves some of the male characters with far shorter character arcs than others. While some guys get 1-2 episodes of their arcs, some get like 3-4. They really don\'t need that much. In summary, many things could have been cut or compressed to give more time to the characters. It\'s disappointing that the staff didn\'t do that and I don\'t think it\'s fair to blame it on the show\'s length.The Protagonist and The Fights:But who really cares right? In the end, fairly good-looking guys are good enough for you and you just wanna see some girl kick their butts. Forget romance and 3-dimensional guys, we want some action! Well you and me both. I came to this show thinking that maybe I might find something that might look like an interesting, strong, maybe gender-challenging, female lead. And well, the show seems to have a surface level idea of what that means but a lack of understanding of how to show it.Hikaru(Hinako in reality) is the strongest in the school in terms of fighting skill so I would have given the show a higher rating if the fight scenes were cool. On one hand, they weren\'t boring, and it was nice to see a girl get punched in a serious street fight with a guy and hold her own for a change. That being said, they aren\'t anything special in terms of animation or exciting moves or anything like that. The only thing going for it is the novelty that it\'s guys fighting a girl, thinking she\'s a guy.Hikaru(Hinako)\'s motivations and personality are also a mystery but a generic female lead isn\'t exactly news in otome anime and games. This show tries to remedy that by making her personality seem more like a male character\'s instead. I can only assume that this is to make her seem like a more proactive character rather than a passive one (passive like Ema from BroCon). This backfires though, as the staff just give her run-of-the-mill male-like traits like determination, friendliness, and an unwillingness to give up. Hinako now becomes indistinguishable from a generic male lead.Hikaru(Hinako) is also puzzlingly intent on saying and proving that she\'s a guy the whole show period, which is weird because there seems to be no reason for it. Why should she want to be seen as a guy? Does she not care? Then why is she so vehement about it? Does she identify as a guy? Then why does the show treat her as a possible girly love interest from time to time? The show wants it to look as if she likes being treated as an equal and as a friend amongst men, yet keeps putting her in somewhat fanservicy positions with them. If the show was trying to present an otome character that the guys saw as both an equal and a romantic interest, than why didn\'t it have any romantic development in the slightest?The Romance:Some of you might be in the other camp; people who want to see a trashy romance-teasing shipfest of an otome anime and that\'s fine.

It just isn\'t as flashy as other shounen anime fights since the camera movement isn\'t as hardcore, but if you focus on each gesture, you\'ll have a newfound appreciation for this approach.#2 the Resourcefulness despite low-budget animation claims- People were quick to point out the silhouettes for background characters being a poor approach, but if budget constraints really did influence this decision, I actually think this was a smart move.When it comes to background characters, a lot of newer animes do draw the ensemble individually, however, since they\'re not the main focus, it\'s often done poorly or so simple to the point that it looks like a draft.It\'s become a joke amongst the anime community wherein background characters often get dull designs in order to fully contrast the lead protagonists who either have wild hairstyles or outfits. While this does the job of making the main characters stand out, it just feels so lazy (not hating on this approach, though. It works for some)While silhouettes for background characters initially seem like the lazy approach since some anime fans compare it to examples I\'ve listed above, it\'s actually very fitting with the overall aesthetic this show has to offer - it makes the lead characters stand out in a clean way as compared to multiple plain characters drawn in the background. Why? Because it\'s like an ode to visual novel stills (the origin of this anime). The background characters resemble sprites that don\'t have much movement during the scenes they\'re featured in, and the chosen colors blend well with the surroundings + the characters that are our main concern for that moment. In photography terms, it also doubles as a leading line for our eyes to naturally gravitate towards the protagonists.#3 The timing is well-placed- Again, if you jump into this anime expecting a complete story, you\'ll only be setting yourself up for disappointment. But if you start it with just the intention of being taken on a journey with it, you\'ll see its strong points.What supposedly looks rushed and ill-timed, is actually very fitting considering the anime\'s origins.Having begun as a game, the cuts for each scene and the timing for the music is reminiscent of cutscenes in video games. From when the opening song starts playing alongside the actual storyline, to the short interview-like portions from the cast - it gives us, the audience, a POV of being reminded about where the story had last ended.In conclusion, this felt like a great way to introduce people to the game and manga. It could serve as a teaser for those installments, so don\'t get turned off by the negative comments it\'s garnered.If you enjoy the following:- Subtle reverse harems (nothing too in your face with romance/love interests excessively fighting for the lead)- A main heroine who isn\'t ""perfect"" (not introduced to the audience as someone super pretty, isn\'t a damsel in distress, isn\'t always saved, doesn\'t have huge tits)- Hot guys, each a different trope- Gender bendersThen by all means, please give this a shot.

However, I can hardly say that there is anything else that is good about this series.The episodes are really short (8 minutes) and there are only 12 episodes. So, there is hardly time to do any sort of character development. Also, the entire thing is just unrealistic. The main character is kind of annoying and borders on being a Mary Sue. I do not want to spoil anything... but the series leads nowhere and there is no real plot twist.This series is fine if you just leave it in the background while you are doing something else.

I didn't really expect to much, since the episodes are very short, and we all know how that usually plays out. I still won't say it's an outstanding show, or even great. But it has it's fine points and is enjoyable.What I have to say though is that it's a shame how the episodes are so short. There would be so much more potential in the show.The art style is very nice, although proportions are sometimes off and I can't halp but feel that the producers got tired with the fighting scenes, with all those shadow-like people.The overall story is...okay, I guess, albeit very cliché - but to a certain degree, that's what you expect from a harem anime.The character development certainly lacks, but again, not surprising. They are very flat, but there are still instances where you get glimpses of what they might be like, if their characters were longer and more carefully developed.Good for a short run-through, and certainly better than other 5 minute animes (I'm thinking makura no danshi and the likes) - but more a guilty pleasure anime than any actual potential. okay, I guess, albeit very cliché - but to a certain degree, that's what you expect from a harem anime.The character development certainly lacks, but again, not surprising.

I kept forgetting the names of the characters.I, myself, is a big otome fan, but being a big VN/Otome fan gave me high expectations and it just ruined my thoughts of the show.

Heck, you got a reverse harem situation, nice to see once in a while.  Heck you have a somewhat compelling premise...BUTTHAT’S THE PROBLEM! THE SERIES LACKS DEPTH. Don’t get me wrong the series was fine, but that’s all it’ll ever be unless there’s a manga that goes further in depth.I have questions about the main characters and the supporting characters. We only know very little. Or was it intentional to not to make this rememberable? It really felt like once...of those easily forgettable slice of life series ( NOT ALL SLICE OF LIFE IS FORGETTABLE SO DO NOT GET MAD)  The only redeeming quality was the presence and the premise. I was compelled to watch it and kept watching but it feels lack luster because the series wasn’t expanded upon. I do wish it dipped more into the shounen formula and was more extensive, it probably could have been more impressionable if it were properly fleshed out. Though I definitely see myself unfortunately forgetting this series in a few years.I don’t hate the series, but I hate what it couldn’t become.However, if you’re into reverse harems and the school scene this might be for you.

The art was average, the characters will be hugging one frame and standing 5 feet apart in the next frame, the jokes were overdone and so was every other line. Guys, I LIKE the power of friendship, but you do not have to pull it out every other second. ever heard anyone say ""dont wear out my name""? .....clearly not. The concept is the sameit took me 3 episodes to realize that each...one is less than 8 minutes long (and thank the stars, I would not have lasted any longer,) and I cannot tell if the animators were desperate to reach the 7 minute mark through exposition, or desperate to cut DOWN to 7 minutes by not giving this anime an opening. In fact, most of the fights happen during the opening. And it gives me a migraine. The music is unjustifiably intense, not to mention painfully loud. And repetitive. All intense scenes have the same drum in the back, I need to punch someone. With idols singing in the back, because thats how its done yonder these parts.the worst thing is that this anime cannot decide what it wants to be. Reading the synopsis, I was expecting a badass girl in crossdress that punches the living daylight out of hot guys. She can punch allright, but there is no bite other than that. I have seen WEEDS more aggressive than her, WEEDS!!!!!!!!And the romantic scenes are so? These guys are bisexual as fuck, and that is the only mildly entertaining thing about them. They cannot decide if they want a bro or a boyfriend, and Hikaru is just as clueless as them. I dont even know if I should waste energy being upset that no one finds out the truth, I DONT KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS. I am gonna assume Hikaru is trans. or something.Houou was the best character, and he only appeared for 10 minutes, AND we got basically no family content. Why could you not tell it wasnt your brother. Why dont you go visit him at home. DO YOU NOT KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WAS JUST ADDED TO YOUR FAMILY REGISTRY. And for everyone else, half an episode of family time riddled with only the most boring stereotypes, and that was IT!! Someone tell me the game is less painful.I am not going to think about the fact she can most definitely date the man who has been her brother for both of their childhoods, I have exhausted all of my neurons. Or of what insufferable sheep were the supporting cast of no faces. And the characters dont ever get any developement. Oh, you want to know about blondie s past? Too bad, hes your bro and that is all. You want Hikaru (and I guess blondie) to help babysit emos 15 siblings? Too bad, they exist for exposition, and though he is shown to care for them he spends all time training in later episodes and never goes home. I am sorry, did your house burn down with them inside???? Why are they not even mentioned? I despise this lack of understanding of what makes otome actually compelling. It feels like the 4 bachelors have more chemistry with each other than they ever will Hikaru and maybe this should have been marketed as ""crossdressing girl with homosexual supporting cast"". Oh wait, Thats just OHSC but worse.This anime could have been enjoyable if it didnt take itself so seriously. I need it to be far MORE demential and stupid to get any joy out. It got a good laught out of me in episode... what, 4? And that was it. A swing and a miss for everything elseAnd today too, a confident female character is out of my grasp one is less than 8 minutes long (and thank the stars, I would not have lasted any longer,) and I cannot tell if the animators were desperate to reach the 7 minute mark through exposition, or desperate to cut DOWN to 7 minutes by not giving this anime an opening. In fact, most of the fights happen during the opening. And it gives me a migraine. The music is unjustifiably intense, not to mention painfully loud. And repetitive. All intense scenes have the same drum in the back, I need to punch someone. With idols singing in the back, because thats how its done yonder these parts.the worst thing is that this anime cannot decide what it wants to be. Reading the synopsis, I was expecting a badass girl in crossdress that punches the living daylight out of hot guys. She can punch allright, but there is no bite other than that. I have seen WEEDS more aggressive than her, WEEDS!!!!!!!!And the romantic scenes are so? These guys are bisexual as fuck, and that is the only mildly entertaining thing about them. They cannot decide if they want a bro or a boyfriend, and Hikaru is just as clueless as them. I dont even know if I should waste energy being upset that no one finds out the truth, I DONT KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS. I am gonna assume Hikaru is trans. or something.Houou was the best character, and he only appeared for 10 minutes, AND we got basically no family content. Why could you not tell it wasnt your brother. Why dont you go visit him at home. DO YOU NOT KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WAS JUST ADDED TO YOUR FAMILY REGISTRY. And for everyone else, half an episode of family time riddled with only the most boring stereotypes, and that was IT!!

Not good enough to hit over average but also not totally terrible to fall below it.Personally, I enjoyed it. It didn't have much to it, if anything, the plot and the characters weren't fleshed out or developed whatsoever and the episodes are only 8 minutes long but, I still enjoyed it. It served as a nice break from all the plot and character driven animes I've been watching, and I know that's what makes anime so good, but I need my occasional chill, funny/calm anime that can be watched casually.What kept Kenka Banchou...Otome from going below 5 is that the anime is clearly NOT meant to be taken seriously. Don't expect any character development or even the story to make that much sense. Also, it's literally only 8 minutes long, it's hardly a waste of my time and I really did enjoy it for what it was.There's nothing special about the characters, they're what you would expect of a 96 minute anime. Even movies have better characters than this anime. The animation is nice though, no complaints on that.Now, IF Kenka Banchou Otome was longer, they'd have to actually develop the story and characters. I think the premise and idea was interesting and could've been really good. I try not not to base my rating on how good the story is capable of being, because then it's inaccurate, but a properly developed anime with this storyline would've caught my interest so quickly.Overall, you're not missing out on anything if you decide to skip on this anime. I don't regret watching it cause I like watching as many things as possible from different genres and of different ratings, helps me get a clearer picture of great from good and bad. This anime falls slap back in the middle and is mediocre at best. Still enjoyed it though ngl Otome from going below 5 is that the anime is clearly NOT meant to be taken seriously.

I am totally ENRAGED!I should have read the reviews on this anime before watching... needless to say, my irritation grew as I held out hope that the show would get better... Now I\'m so pissed off I had to write a review to express my anger!!!First of all, it appears that the creators sloppily put this anime together to make more money instead of trying to recreate the wonderful manga it was supposed to be based off of. The art is also incredibly poor and lazily done. ""Unimportant"" characters are...drawn as shadows. The plot line is carried on by random monologues from the characters rather than allowing the viewers to learn these things from the characters interactions.They barely followed the plot line, changing events and interactions between the characters. The characters themselves also seem different personality wise. Worst of all, Hinako\'s personality is completely different than the manga!!! How dare they turn her into another typical weak schoolgirl!!! X_X -_- I could go on but instead, I\'ll let you read the other reviews to get a better understanding. drawn as shadows.

Lupin III (2015): Italian Game,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32321/Lupin_III_2015__Italian_Game,"['We can say that ""Italian Game"" is probably one of the most disappointing Lupin TV Special ever made.It was a nice choice setting the story in continuity with the last serie (the blue jacket one) with the same animation style and re-proposing the new characters we met, a countinuity that sounded like a warm ""don\'t worry, there\'s still some of it"".So, what went wrong?The challenge to find the heritage of the Count of Cagliostro (open reference to Miyazaki\'s film) is covered only by the last 20 minutes of the special, before that we have to see again a lot of material from the serie.Yes, they...took three entire episodes and they sewed them together to make a huge introduction that takes three quarters of the time.The problem is that many of the scenes make sense only in the context of a standalone episode and they\'re completely useless for the development of the plot. They could have just condensed the major events in 5 minutes while keeping a good connection to the serie.The original part suffers for the lack of time, even looking at it simply as an extra episode, we get undeveloped new characters (the Masked Count was ok, but it needed more space) and a rushed resolution, if not forced.I can save only the majestic opening made by Koji Morimoto, maybe the only part which was worth watching.In the end, if you really enjoyed the blue jacket serie and you desperately need to see more of it, maybe you can appreciate it.But if you\'re looking for a fresh tv special I don\'t recommand it. took three entire episodes and they sewed them together to make a huge introduction that takes three quarters of the time.The problem is that many of the scenes make sense only in the context of a standalone episode and they\'re completely useless for the development of the plot.

Despite giving it a 5 this film is more like a 7 or 8 however it is completely dragged down by one crucial thing. 70mins of the film\'s 90 minute runtime is comprised of 3 ""Lupin III (2015)"" episodes played entirely in their full. This means that only 20 minutes are actually comprised of new story and animation. And of what is new, most of it is not particularly good and mostly functions to loosely tie the plot of the three episodes together. So the only purpose this film serves is if you haven\'t already seen the 2015...series and can\'t be bothered to watch it, which is an incredibly small number of people. If you have already seen the 2015 series, don\'t bother with this special. And if you haven\'t, just watch the 2015 series. series and can\'t be bothered to watch it, which is an incredibly small number of people.

One thing I can take away from this is after seeing the character development go so wrong I have a better understanding of what right looks like.The opening is way to long with clips that happen in the movie, with no context. It even some shows very dramatic scenes, but I have that ""why should I care"" when they scenes are around the girl I don\'t know yet. And, the opening is too long.Speaking of the character development girl, I don\'t feel like she actually learned anything...because her development was rushed and it felt empty.The plot and storytelling are rushed and feels empty. This is also one of the ones where Fujiko is useless.I don\'t suggest this to fans or new comers to Lupin or anime, in general. because her development was rushed and it felt empty.The plot and storytelling are rushed and feels empty.

Over 70% of the run time is abridged version of the first half of Part 4 aka ""Lupin III (2015)"" Thus the actual original content lack any time to develop and is rushed near the end.And I have to say, by this point when you say ""Count Cagliostro"" in a Lupin III story, nobody is gonna realize you are referencing the original Arsene Lupin story, everyone\'s gonna assume you are talking about the one from ""Castle of Cagliostro"", it\'s already a bad choice and the special also didn\'t do a job stating that case.With so little actual run time, how...are there even any mystery to the supposed mysterious villain,  since this Special is supposed to happen in between Part 4?There\'s really not much watching value to this, even though there are some good parts, for one, the train chase scene is pretty good, so much so I\'d rather it\'s its own 20 min or so episode.Also the Opening is really awesome though, sadly it\'s attached to this excuse of a clip show. are there even any mystery to the supposed mysterious villain,  since this Special is supposed to happen in between Part 4?There\'s really not much watching value to this, even though there are some good parts, for one, the train chase scene is pretty good, so much so I\'d rather it\'s its own 20 min or so episode.Also the Opening is really awesome though, sadly it\'s attached to this excuse of a clip show.']"
