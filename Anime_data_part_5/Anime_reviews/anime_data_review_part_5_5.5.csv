Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2615/Otome_wa_Boku_ni_Koishiteru_Special,"['This is my FIRST review, so please don\'t hate me or anything >_>;I LOVED this.  This was the most best thing I\'ve ever seen yet, even though it was short, I wanted more. D:Alright well enough loving.The Story here in the special is just like your old, average Cinderella Story.Cinderella works for her 2  ugly step-sisters and her step-mom,Then one day they received a letter to go to the ball and blah..Then the 2 step-sisters goes and buys a dress or whatever,Then.. blah blah blah,  Cinderella wants to go to the ball so her friends, the mices or mouses made a dress...for her but then later her step sisters ripped itThen they left her then Cinderella cries, but then Fairy God Mother shows up,and Cinderella has her new dress on, then she turned some of her friends to Horses, and so, they got everything prepared and they went to the BALL!The Prince was sitting in his chair and there wasn\'t any girls that interested him, but then later... DUN DUN DUN DUNNN. CINDERELLA COMES!And so, The Prince and Cinderella dances together~ but then later it was late, and it was the time that Cinderella\'s Fairy Godmother told her about. And so, Cinderella had to run before the prince will see her in her old, raggy dress and she ran down stairs! And so, her glass slipper is left on one of the steps, and then Cinderella runned for her life!  Then later there was news thats related to the glass slipper. And so, the Prince went to EVERY girls houses, and then last, it was Cinderella\'s house. And so they came in, and they tried the 2 Step-Sisters but they didn\'t fit. but then, when Cinderella came, She went to try it on and well, YES. It fitted. and so they got married and blah blah blah and yeah, you know.But my friend, this special does have that story that I just said up there, but theres three  twists in this special, As you can see the main character in the special, our Student Council President, Takako is Cinderella, but they changed the name though. They changed it to Cinderella to Tsunderella. Add Tsundere plus ella and you get Tsunderella! Also, our lovely, sweet and kind Shion plays the fairy god mother, and as you can see, when Shion explained about the time thing to Takako, there is also something about ""tentacles"" and trust me, it didn\'t look so pretty... and last, instead of using a Pumpkin carriage with Horses and a man up there to tell the Horses to go, They used Kana for the carriage, and so in the specials, Kana was saying ""~nanodesuyo"" while she was flying/taking Takako to the ball or something. for her but then later her step sisters ripped itThen they left her then Cinderella cries, but then Fairy God Mother shows up,and Cinderella has her new dress on, then she turned some of her friends to Horses, and so, they got everything prepared and they went to the BALL!The Prince was sitting in his chair and there wasn\'t any girls that interested him, but then later...

With a fairy tale setting and guest appearances by Snow White, Red Riding Hood, Mirror Mirror on the Wall, and the evil Queen (at a gingerbread house) this is a nice little encore to the &quot;Otoboku&quot; series. Better to see the series first, to become familiar with the characters, otherwise the whole gag will be lost on you.

Oscar's Oasis,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33430/Oscars_Oasis,"['What a good show, simple, effective, funny and gorgeous, thsi show literrally is a good way to waste wour time, so go ahead and check this, cuz is amazing, really luv this, doesnt need a complicated trama, characters or some elititst things like that, no just funny beetwen animals and a lot of thing, and works perfect, for me, this show is a must watch, the carachters are so compatible, even the extras are good like a sit com form 90s, if u like the comedy, with no sense you need to watch this show, promise you than is good, for me, is a masterpiece ', ""What.The.Hell.When I found out Oscar's Oasis was indeed an anime on myanimelist.net, I HAD to make a review for this childhood kino. It genuinely is quite surprising to hear that this is part Korean. I thought it was fully French, what a diverse world we live in.So I watched most of the series back in the day, but I have vivid memories of some events that took place, with it usually being the same thing over and over, I don't think I am missing out on a lot of stuff to talk about because ultimately, Oscar's Oasis is really just fun and games.It's an episodic...series, filled with funny characters, funny moments, funny situations, and generally everything needed to make for a good kids anime. 3D animation is the entire thing, but it has a good nostalgia call to it, even without, it's fine regardless, fits the theme well and there is seriously nothing jarring about it. The same goes for the sound here, pretty memorable soundtracks, some OST stick to me even today. Lack of actual dialogue but that just means this can be universally enjoyed.I remember talking rubbish about some of the logic here back when I was like 9 or 10 or something like that. Despite its lack of consistency (Oscar's tongue CAN go 50 meters and sprint 70 mph if he wanted to smh), I thought it was fun on the whole, even if sometimes very dumb. I'd watch this with the mindset as a child would, look for the dumb funny nonsense, and don't be a pseudointellectual like I was looking for the chef-d'œuvre in the form of artistic representation of Newton's Gravitation Law of Motion.10/10 for being a great kids anime. It's no Oggy and the Cockroaches tho 🤷🤷. series, filled with funny characters, funny moments, funny situations, and generally everything needed to make for a good kids anime. 3D animation is the entire thing, but it has a good nostalgia call to it, even without, it's fine regardless, fits the theme well and there is seriously nothing jarring about it.

Mazinger Z tai Ankoku Daishougun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4406/Mazinger_Z_tai_Ankoku_Daishougun,"[""Mazinger-Z vs General of Darkness is a pretty good passing of the torch.Mazinger Z is an undeniably iconic figure when it comes to the history of anime, one of the first pilotable mecha, cementing and popularizing many of the tropes that are still used 40 years after its inception, the way it was introduced in-series goes to show just how powerful the unit was by it being this unstoppable demon. Now imagine if this titan of power and fame gets absolutely demolished.The forces of the General of Darkness destroying the cities that Kouji worked so hard to protect sets up well just how helpless the...Mazinger will be in this fight. It's honestly disheartening seeing its wide arsenal be useless against the villains: his rocket punches being deflected, his breast beam barely scratching, his missiles almost ineffective, his breath rendered null. seeing the damaged robot head into battle only to have his wings melted and limbs torn during the fight feels like watching a legacy come to an end. In this moment of total despair comes in the one who will take over the title of the demon that fights to protect the world: Tsurugi and the Great Mazinger.Demonstrating how the new unit is an objectively better version of the old one in all regards is a great way to convince the viewer that the Great Mazinger is fit to replace the current protector of the world, and having him work alongside the beat-up Z is a touching method of show that it has good intentions. Great's upgraded weaponry decimating the foes is an incredibly reassuring scene, considering just how hopeless most of the movie was, not only did it convey how Kouji would be ok leaving Tsurugi with his role, but it works well convincing the viewer that the new protagonist is someone they want to watch.If anything, this movie's a fun watch to see something that anime doesn't do as much anymore: an anime icon passing the baton to a new generation.

Nyanko Days,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34148/Nyanko_Days,"['Don\'t overthink it. Succumb to the nyanko.After years and years of painstaking research, Japan\'s finest at studio EMT² emerge with the perfect girl-to-kitten hybrids. In fact, these ""nyankos"" are so cute that we are not worthy to witness them for longer than two minutes at a time!I don\'t know what exactly it is, but the fact this series even exists just makes me happy. Nyanko Days is nothing but a quick rush of serotonin in cute chibi nekogirl form. Main character Yuuko is a sweetheart, quite relatable to many in her wallflower personality, and her friend Azumi helps supplement the series with a nice, blossoming...friendship (complete with her own nekogirl!) As no series is complete without a rival, Ran introduces herself as such, though of course she has a softer side to her otherwise competitive spirit! Mostly importantly, each of the kittens in Ma, Ro, Shi, and Elsa each express their own individual personalities and quirks, leading for a diverse cast of kittens to cuddle!No, it\'s not a literary masterpiece, not even close, but that\'s not the purpose. Nobody buys a cat and expects it to recite Shakespeare or Descartes. You watch Nyanko Days to feel good. You watch it to forget your troubles. You watch it to see cute cats doing cute things.Stress from work? School? Break-up? Just angry at the world? Nyanko Days, my friend. Your pain and discomfort will melt away as you\'re comforted by four of the cutest beings ever drawn. There\'s something genuine in each and every expression that lets you know everything will be okay.It\'s just hard to explain. If you like this kind of über-kawaii content, you\'re going to like Nyanko Days. Two minutes of your time for a rush of happiness? Count me in.The only outstanding flaw of the series is how short each episode runs, being only a minute and a half when you exclude the outro. The mini-episodic format the creators elected towards greatly affects the flow of the series, with some episodes forbidding us from even seeing our cute companions in favor of the girls. It will prove one of Japanese animation\'s greatest tragedies that Nyanko Days didn\'t get the proper run-time it deserved.With all of that in mind, there is only one thing to take from this completely serious review: Nyanko is love, Nyanko is life. friendship (complete with her own nekogirl!)

This anime is for you then. Watch Nyanko days, as it enfolds the story(if you count 2 minutes each episode as a story) of three extremely kawaii kittens and their master Tomoko.The animation is superb and so is enjoyment(I'll rank it 100/10 if I can). The characters could have had a better backstory, but oh well, cute cats don't need much explanation, right?There is not much to think or reflect to, just sit, watch and enjoy the cute kitties playing around and wonder why you couldn't get cats as cute as those. "", ""Imagine if all cats look like dwarf-sized loli nekos and can speak human language. If there was such a thing in reality then I'd probably freak out. But in the world of anime, anything can become possible. The world of anime can make you question your true gender, turn the things you hate into things that you will love, and do other weird shits and get away with it.Anime is truly weird. But that's why I love watching anime. Nyanko Days is a short anime about girls vibing with undersized loli cats.honestly I don't know why but I feel stoned after watching this...anime. I don't even know what to write on this review anymore. I just want to know when Elon Musk would finally develop the genetically engineered cat girls so i could finally get one- wait i think i just contradicted a point i made on my first paragraphuh anyways.

That said it was the disappointment of the season as soon as it came out that the episodes were 2 minutes long rather than something longer. And as it turns out it happened to be massively detrimental to the quality of the show.Usually the shows best suited toward being shorts are those that are comedic gag series; there are other shows that work but for the most part, it doesn't suit most shows. While Nyanko is listed as a comedy I didn't find it particularly funny. I don't even think it is much of a...comedy, sure it has it's moments of comedy but that's not it's focus. Rather, Nyanko is a show that lives off of its cuteness. And while that can be digested in 2 quick minutes the show failed to make me attached to the characters which, in my opinion, is necessary to get the full cuteness in. Otherwise what makes these cat girls special? Why not look at other animations or other pictures that can be found scattered around the Internet? As much as I love cuteness, for it to be a worthwhile show I need to have some basis for that cuteness, something I can attach to that enhances that cuteness. Nyanko does not have that.It's not just that the characters don't get developed, it's that the characters feel dull and cliche. The black cat is studious and reserved, the orange cat is a playful tomboy, the white cat is the sweet one, the rich girl's cat is a tsundere. They're nothing more than these traits nor do they ever break out of them. They feel so obvious and manufactured that I have a hard time actually liking them. The only way they are set apart from their archetypes is that at least they do act like cats. So, If you really like cats you'll probably enjoy them. But if you're looking for more than that, this show does not provide.There isn't really a plot but really that doesn't matter. If you're here expecting a plot you're in the wrong place, and that's not Nyanko's fault. It's not very notable in anything else besides the OP, which is quite CUTE. You know what? Go watch the OP. You get 30 seconds of pure cuteness and a catchy song. It's well worth a watch or 12. But as for the show unless you're as much of a cat lover as the MC I'd suggest you skip it. comedy, sure it has it's moments of comedy but that's not it's focus.

I dare say it's one of the best, where you always watch every happy and many (VERY MUCH) fluffy moments (100% of the time is cute).At first the protagonist is a shy girl who, instead of relating to other people, prefers to keep her cute kittens, which are really cute (have I already said they are cute?). It has 3 kittens and they are easily memorable, so in the first speech of each one you already know exactly...the personality of each one, which makes them from the beginning striking and lovely characters. What really marked me in this anime is that exactly ALL the conversations and situations of all the episodes (released so far) are extremely funny and fluffy it seems until I'll melt away from such cute.The best point about this anime is that with only 2 minutes in length they do a awesome job to makes you cling so much to the charactersJust a personal opinion: this is one of the types of anime that I really wish it had more than 700 eps with 20 minutes minutes long. the personality of each one, which makes them from the beginning striking and lovely characters.

She had a cat there, a type of domesticated animal that I hadn\'t seen before. As I went up to greet it, the feline lifted it\'s tail in my direction. You see, when cats\'s are scared, they perform an action called ""spraying"" where they expel urine in a certain direction. The direction, in this case, was toward my soft young face. Now, remember that cat urine contains 0.05% ammonia (about 1% of the concentration that might be found in household cleaners), among other caustic substances. This resulted in a horrible burning sensation on...my paper-thin facial flesh. I tilted my head backwards and unleashed a pained, terrified scream.Ever since then I\'ve hated cats; even despised them.  However, the cats in Nyanko Days are quite different. They lack all of the unappealing aspects of the domesticated feline, while retaining their cute and playful nature. The severely limited intellect of the cat is replaced with that of a precocious child, and their sharp claws and disease-ridden fangs are nowhere to be seen (Note: cats harbor a large amount of bacteria in their mouths, and bites from them can lead to severe conditions like sepsis or worse).Their dander-riddled fur is also completely absent, with the Nyanko Days cats bearing soft, warm human flesh. I remember staying the night at my aunts house when she had her cat there. In the middle of the night my throat swelled up, restricting the intake of air to my lungs. Had my reaction been a bit worse, I could have died. It was all due to that cat. That evil, evil cat.Thankfully, the cats in Nyanko Days wouldn\'t do that to me. They\'re sweet little girls that just want to love you and have fun. This show transports me to a world where cats aren\'t malicious creatures of chaos, but adorable soft little bundles of joy.I\'m rating the ""sound"" score very high mainly because of the opening song, which is very cute and catchy, despite it\'s short run-time of 30 seconds. Cat\'s in real life don\'t make pleasant sounds like this. I remember when my roommate got a cat a year ago. At night it would sit outside my bedroom door for hours on end, screaming like it was in the throes of death. It was absolutely horrid. One day after work, I returned to my bedroom to find my figure of my dear waifu Hestia on the floor broken, with a dreadful pile of cat feces on it. Outside, in the hallway, I spotted a pair of feline eyes glaring at me, glowing a sinister gold and full of primal malice. I cried myself to sleep that night...Anyway, back to my discussion of Nyanko Days. It\'s a fun, saccharine 1-minute long dose of cutesy moe that\'s worth a watch whenever you\'re feeling blue. When I see those cute little moe-blobs, I can\'t help but smile and feel calm, even with memories of my feline-related trauma wriggling through my subconscious, threatening to break through to the surface at any given moment.I have to admit, sometimes I lay in bed and weep from the fact that I\'m trapped in this corporeal 3D body, unable to ascend to the eternal paradise known as the 2D world. What did we all do to deserve this foul, dreadful curse?But I digress. Nyanko Days is a great show and you should give it a watch.Final verdict: 8/10. my paper-thin facial flesh.

I can sympathize with you that the anime is way too fucking short, and even if you planned to skip watching the anime until the full release of it comes out, you're going to have to deal with the op and ed, in which you have to skip it arduously.

Although, from what im seeing, it's not much of a different show than how most moe show are, and that's to prioritize cuteness, childishness, and very slice of life with not much interesting or great theme in there, but only very simple or general theme for these kind of anime to have. However, I still enjoy this shit.It's, overall, not a bad anime. I actually enjoy every bit of this anime, since the characters (well fuck the owners), is SO FUCKING CUTE!!!!!!!!!

However, I still enjoy this shit.It's, overall, not a bad anime. I actually enjoy every bit of this anime, since the characters (well fuck the owners), is SO FUCKING CUTE!!!!!!!!! I just can't help it. That doesn't make me a pedo right? Well who cares anyway, cuteness is laifu."", 'This is just the cutest anime I’ve ever seen! Short, simple, and sweet for a perfect cozy anime watching day. :) Nothing serious, just a girl with her kitties that make her happy as well as everyone watching. I love the art style as well which makes the characters even cuter.I wish the episodes were longer though and I hope they make either another season, film, or anything else with these cute little kitties. I definitely recommend this for anyone who just wants to watch a Kawaii anime short when they’re feeling down, need a pick-me-up, or just bored and want something new! If you...enjoy cute, slice of life anime, this is for you! enjoy cute, slice of life anime, this is for you!', 'Nyanko Days successfully gives a show full of kawaii-ness especially for neko and nekomimi lovers.

There\'s nothing superb with the visualization, but it is plenty enough for bringing us the feel of kawaii all over the place.Adapted from 4-koma manga, the anime adaptation is last for approximately 2 minutes per episode. Therefore, observing from the length of the series, there isn\'t much thing to explain for the story and characters traits. In a few episodes, Konagai Yuuko and her school life dominates...the scenes while in the other hand and other occasions, her three adorable cats take control. All of the characters are characterized as cute, humble, real teenagers in their puberty (who concerns of little things), has a weakness but still ""cute"". We can find inbetween-girls problem too, like rivalry. The cats, I believe are presented well the real cats traits of the species even though I never met those cats in real life. Sometimes the story is more into the pets rather than its owner (and that\'s how I like it more lol), but don\'t worry there are also the human characters too take place. There is no complicated matter in this short series except the Yuuko\'s school life at first as the introduction only.There is only one soundtrack for Nyanko Days, Nyanko is L♥VE! by every❤ing!. It\'s catchy and buck me up. The seiyuu(s) singing in nasal voices and fun rhythm. It\'s getting more fun while watching the background scenes as the song is playing.Nyanko Days, that worth 8, saves me for a few hours after watching other series or doing my assignment.

A cute fluffy anime about anthropomorphic chibi cats and their owners. Its just that and nothing else for two minutes each episode. The animation is fine for showing simple colors and cute character designs, as do the voice actors as do a decent job. I'm not a fan of either the opening and ending songs as I found them both annoying to listen too by the third episode.There really isn't much story as its mostly about the characters...and they barely have any development and are just cliches of character traits.

This is probably the lowest score I've given because considering the length, it is the laziest writing that you could do. We'll come back to that later though...Art was decently good. The cat girl...chibi thinga-ma-doo's are cute and everything, but most of the art is nothing great or groundbreaking in any way.

You don\'t need an incredible plot when you can just have velipaka and... velipaka.

To focus this as just...an exhilarating story would be like trying to suggest that a show about kittens should be “Stranger Levels” type-storytelling.

In fact, there\'s so little substance that it\'s a struggle to even talk about the show beyond its substance.It\'s not really that it\'s bad per se. It\'s mindless and cute stuff to turn your brain off to for about a half-hour, so it\'s perfectly serviceable in that regards and serves its function in that way. It\'s also incredibly cute which no one can deny. It\'s hard to criticize because it effectively serves its function and arguing against that function just feels like...it comes off as weird and nitpicky. But one can afford to be nitpicky over a series that is, effectively, nothing.When you really get down to it, Nyanko Days is the most anime thing an anime is. Anthropomorphized cats, big eyes and cute faces with characters fitting nicely into archetypes, constant sugary cuteness, loner girl starts to hang out with non-loner girl... it manages to be incredibly exhausting in the very short time it runs, because it feels so much like other similar anime. I don\'t need originality, but I need something that\'s derivative with something to offer, and there\'s nothing here. Not even the cats are cats I can care about. Basically the visual equivalent of ""in one ear and out the other"".Part of this is definitely due to the fact that every episode is two minutes long, with only about 70% of it being actual content due to a five-second long opening slate and a 30-second long ED (approximately). There\'s almost literally no time to even absorb anything is happening, because everything is so rapid-fire that it washes over incredibly easy. Even multi-part episodes suffer from this. It would have honestly been better to split it up into four-minute episodes, or even eight-minute episodes, because at least then you can realize an episode is happening. Even poor slife-of-life anime get by with so-so paced 24-minute episodes; two-minute episodes where a thing happens is beyond the pale.It does some things serviceable at least, in a way that doesn\'t make this anime feel like an actual waste of time. Yuuko Konagai and Azumi Shiratori may not be great characters, but they\'re done fine enough with at least a bit of interest that it\'s fine (and also have cute interactions together, more cute than anything else in the show). The, uh, arc with Ran Iketani, the girl who\'s scared of cats, is amusing while it lasts. The ED should be annoying but it ends up being catchy (I still have it stuck in my head even now) and at least has serviceable visuals for it. Aurally, it has a bouncy and bubbly sound design (but especially when the cats are the focus) that it makes up for the lackluster art. Two of the four cats are distinctive. The anime is so short that even if you find it dreadful, you won\'t have even spent half-an-hour on it. The voice acting was okay.Really it\'s hard to name what I like about it when there\'s so little to care about that I have to stretch myself to name positive aspects. But it\'s enough to not make it a bad anime, just really mediocre. A lot of it comes down to its awful pacing of two-minute episodes, but even if that were fixed, it\'d still be really unmemorable and nothing more than a blip in my memory to remember to possibly check out the manga, if I could ever find the time to do so. So it has some benefits, just not many. If you\'re that into slice-of-life that you need to watch as much as you can from the genre, or have a spare half-hour you can\'t spend starting/continuing another anime, then you at least have this. Otherwise, there\'s too little of value to even passingly recommend. But hey, cats. it comes off as weird and nitpicky.

Basically the visual equivalent of ""in one ear and out the other"".Part of this is definitely due to the fact that every episode is two minutes long, with only about 70% of it being actual content due to a five-second long opening slate and a 30-second long ED (approximately). There\'s almost literally no time to even absorb anything is happening, because everything is so rapid-fire that it washes over incredibly easy. Even multi-part episodes suffer from this. It would have honestly been better to split it up into four-minute episodes, or even eight-minute episodes, because at least then you can realize an episode is happening. Even poor slife-of-life anime get by with so-so paced 24-minute episodes; two-minute episodes where a thing happens is beyond the pale.It does some things serviceable at least, in a way that doesn\'t make this anime feel like an actual waste of time. Yuuko Konagai and Azumi Shiratori may not be great characters, but they\'re done fine enough with at least a bit of interest that it\'s fine (and also have cute interactions together, more cute than anything else in the show). The, uh, arc with Ran Iketani, the girl who\'s scared of cats, is amusing while it lasts. The ED should be annoying but it ends up being catchy (I still have it stuck in my head even now) and at least has serviceable visuals for it. Aurally, it has a bouncy and bubbly sound design (but especially when the cats are the focus) that it makes up for the lackluster art. Two of the four cats are distinctive. The anime is so short that even if you find it dreadful, you won\'t have even spent half-an-hour on it. The voice acting was okay.Really it\'s hard to name what I like about it when there\'s so little to care about that I have to stretch myself to name positive aspects. But it\'s enough to not make it a bad anime, just really mediocre. A lot of it comes down to its awful pacing of two-minute episodes, but even if that were fixed, it\'d still be really unmemorable and nothing more than a blip in my memory to remember to possibly check out the manga, if I could ever find the time to do so. So it has some benefits, just not many. If you\'re that into slice-of-life that you need to watch as much as you can from the genre, or have a spare half-hour you can\'t spend starting/continuing another anime, then you at least have this. Otherwise, there\'s too little of value to even passingly recommend. But hey, cats.', ""There isn't really much of a story to Nyanko Days, but it centers around this one girl that has these three different cat/human cats, unless of course she's just imagining them to be able to talk & all of that. Each episode pretty much just has the main character hanging out with her three cat/human cats & then again there's a few episodes where all three of the main characters cats are just making a mess of things in the main character's bedroom, like trying to draw on a piece of paper with a pen, but forgetting to click the pen so they'd be able...to use the ink in it. Nyanko Days is of course one of those cutiesy animes that was enjoyable to watch. to use the ink in it. Nyanko Days is of course one of those cutiesy animes that was enjoyable to watch."", ""Do you like cats? Would you like to see kittens anthromorphized into cute anime girls? Then Nyanko Days is the short anime for you! And by short, I don't mean it's just twelve episodes long, but that every episode runs for two minutes. That's it. Moe anime tend to get a bad reputation, mostly for putting too much emphasis on cuteness over substance, and that's understandable. Especially if they drag on for much longer than they need to. But twelve episodes of cute kittens having fun, with every episode only being two minutes long is the perfect length to digest something of this caliber. The...story centers on a girl, Yuuko Konagai, who is shy and doesn't have friends at school. But she has three kittens at home, named Maa, Shii, and Rou, and they're all the friends she needs. She loves cats, and later, she befriends another girl, Azumi, because of their shared love of cats. Sometimes the anime focuses on the girls, and sometimes it dedicates time to the cats and their shenanigans.With this show being as short as it is, both in its episode count and how long the episodes run (Only two minutes, including the ending song), there really isn't much to talk about. The animation is bright and colorful, and the cats are all adorable little toddler girls. The soundtrack isn't really memorable in any way, and the ending song is so moe, squeaky, and saccharine that I think any diabetic who listens to it will die from a sugar overload. Actually, the whole show is super sugary sweet, but its episodes running for under two minutes actually manages to be its saving grace. If Nyanko Days had its episodes go on for half an hour, or even ten minutes, it would just seem dragged out, making it dull and boring.That said, its short length gives it other issues as well. All of the characters are little more than moe blobs with very little personality other than one basic character trait. Yuuko is the shy girl, Azumi is the popular rich girl, Ran is the hot-blooded rival who wants to one-up Azumi for no reason (We never learn why), and so on. Ran in particular doesn't really have a reason to be in this show, as she only appears in two episodes and that's it, and all she wants to do is one-up Azumi. She's literally a complete waste of space and animation, and she's not even given any sort of character arc at all, so there's no reason for the audience to care about her at all. Also, Yuuko's naming choices for her cats are uncreative as hell. They're literally the first syllables in their breed names! Were you really too lazy to give them more distinct names? Furthermore, the author seems to think having the cats do things like know how to read, watch TV, draw, and use a remote control will make them cuter, but this just goes against the fact that they're...y'know, cats! Giving cats human traits doesn't make them cute, it's just lazy writing.Eh, even with those flaws, Nyanko Days is a cute little time killer for if you want to waste half an hour. But it doesn't have much to offer other than cuteness and moe cat girls, and I can recommend several anime about cats that are much more substantial, such as Chi's Sweet Home, She And Her Cat: Everything Flows, and My Roommate Is a Cat.

It just didn\'t have the ""this is a very crucial event"" factor to it. In other pokemon movies all the events  had weight in it. In this one its just very light stuff. The action sequences are always the highlight of Pokemon movies.And in this one it had decent to bad action scenes. The supporting cast is very useless as well. They had no use in the whole thing unlike the previous movies. The only thing this had going are the Legendary Pokemon. Rashiram, Zekrom and Victini are cool Pokemon. Though I had...a problem with the some of the animations and colors they used on them. The dub is pretty much just good as its always been. My biggest complaint is the plot. It is just stupid and useless for me. It seemed like they didnt plan the plot to well. Filled with loose ends and a subpar conclusion.By far this is the worst movie in the franchise and I hope they do a better job next time. The Pokemon Universe is filled with pokemon and I just can\'t see how writers cant think of better ways to use this vast universe.Pros-Pokemon are present. Most are cute and some are cool looks-Relationship between Ash and the Pokemon are fun to look atCons-Decent action sequences-Stupid plot-Useless supporting cast-Animation choices arent very goodRecommendationI recommend this to any die hard pokemon fan. Its pretty much still a pokemon movie and we all know we need to watch it. But to light fans just see the other movies instead.

You've got a neat concept, great legendaries, character moments, breathtaking scenery and superb animation. What a shame that two crucial ingredients are missing - originality and good dialogue.Annunal Pokemon sequels bumped up animation slightly with almost every release. What caught me off guard, however, was a massive improvement with these two films. One thing that can't be understated is how nice Reshiram & Zerkrom look. For this reason alone, it's a joy to watch the films. But these two aren't aiming to be an artsy audio-visual extravaganza. While the best thing I can say about audio production...is that it did its job, I can't be as forgiving to other elements.These films can be split into two parts. The character driven first and plot dirven second half. Both focus on different elements and both come up short in their own departments.Throughout the first half, we're treated to quite a few neat situations. While watching, as I try to enjoy them, something rushes through my mind - images from previous films. Therein lies the problem. There's very little originality here. A garden with tastly berries? Already done in The Rise of Darkrai, better too. Running through the packed streets of an old town? Fifth film. Pokemon waking up Ash to enjoy the local sunrise? Almost every series did it at least three times. I could go on, but I think the point has been made. Black & White are plagued by moments already done better before. The battles at display here aren't very memorable, either.Where the films really starts to fall, even for someone not familiar with the better works in the franchise, is the second half. The dialogue turns into a complete disaster. Characters won't talk to each other. They'll arbitrary decide to withold key information, just so the plot can go the way director envisioned.For films centered around Reshiram & Zerkrom, there's very little build up of them as legendaries. After all is said and done they feel more like rare local pokemon, rather than legendaries. Their themes of Ideals & Truth, Yin & Yang, are barely touched by the films. Twice blurted out in expositional fashion, these lines feel like trailer material. Making the two virtually identical and replacing one with the other in each film is troubling. Equaling truth to idealism and implying they act the same is just not deep. Then again, these two films don't even touch the subject.As the mysterious dragon force raises the sword castle into space (yes, this actually happens), we're left with questions. How does it work? Where does it come from? This isn't explained. We are told the force will destroy the world, but nothing shown seems really threatening. The fact that the force acts as if powered by Yveltal and Xerneas is a mere curiosity for Pokemon fans. The truth is, this force is not thought out and won't be mentioned ever again.Lastly, there's Victini. This little doll is pretty damn cute. Throughout the films he's been handled well. Until the end, that is. Near the end he's given a fake death scene. I'm sick of these. Ash in the first film, Celebi in third, Darkrai in tenth, Giratina in eleventh and Zoroark in thirteenth. The faux death has been overused and the manipulative nature of Victini's death is pathetic. We're treated to a scene of characters standing, spewing exposition, while sad music plays in the background for a minute - then revealing the little bugger alive. Even if they had to do this, is this the way it should have been done? No. It just doesn't work.Ultimately, I would recommend these films to people craving some more Pokemon. It doesn't bode well under any close up scrutiny, but looks pretty good.

Persona 4 the Golden Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24075/Persona_4_the_Golden_Animation,"['What began as a triumphant success, both critically and commercially, in the gaming culture, even outside the JRPG community, has now devolved into whoring itself out. That is not a negative connotation, as the spin-off games and the Vita port are excellent in their own right. However, the event that started the whole milking process began with announcing an entire adaptation of Persona 4 in anime form back in 2011. It would be of no surprise to anyone that it was a thing that, in the end, would be looked at as a project that could not be called anything but unnecessary.Speaking as someone whose...favorite game is Persona 4 and will cherish it till the day I die, I’ve also adored its Vita port, Persona 4 Golden. Its different mechanics and new fantastic scenes also brought a new character, which breathed all new life into it. After much popular demand by absolutely no one, Aniplex thought to themselves, “Remember that Persona 4 anime we made a couple of years ago? Why don’t we make another one for the port to cash in on the hype for Persona?” Atlus probably had a hand in the decision too. Still, Persona 4 the Golden Animation is nothing more than just decent fan service for fans to see, even with the inevitable cringe-worthy attempts to adapt it fully.For those who aren’t aware of the concept of Persona 4 Golden, it is another version of the original game with a different side character that we get to know throughout her own story. The anime wants to solely focus on the new one, named Marie, and find out the mystery of who she is and why she is there. These do not bode well in how they handle the pacing and development. At one point, there are several parts where they skip over significant growth to fit 13 episodes in with Marie’s and animate the extra scenes; this includes the beach fanservice, the band practice, motorcycle licenses, etc.Ironically, this problem of fitting too much content into one season was the same problem with the 1st season. The creators wanted to include as much content as possible to make it feel like an authentic Persona game in full anime spectacle. While it is admirable of them to at least try to accomplish this, it fails considerably. There are many instances where the pacing felt too quick for us to understand and feel for our characters. If they were to make this into a bonafide hit, a more prolonged episode count would’ve sufficed a bit more for one. But in this day and age where shows more extended than 24 episodes all come and go, I don’t think Aniplex has that kind of budget to have had that accomplished.Art and animation have their moments of eerie distinctiveness, where the characters are drawn quite an on point to how Atlus usually draws their Shin Megami Tensei characters. However, there are moments where the art quickly goes down south at a draw distance where the characters look very deformed. The animation can be guilty of this, too, with rigid motions at specific frames and cutting corners here and there. When the battle scenes occur, the art and animation are pretty stellar to see, so you can tell where Aniplex put most of their budget towards.Despite this not being an excellent adaptation, should this be outright slandered by Persona fans? Not entirely. What is still intact from the source is the humor, which can still serve to be a delight on multiple occasions. Seeing them in the animated form helps make it more memorable in this light. Not only that, but there are a few exciting bonuses they added to the story, despite its flawed presentation. Adachi’s past is given a lot of in-depth analysis, which has him seen in a more sympathetic light in how he became a police officer.Many will ask the obvious question: Should I play the games or watch the anime? Or should I watch/play Persona 3 first before 4? Depending on your preference, they will prove to be more fruitful in experiencing a truly brilliant story. Golden only proves to have more of the same systematic problems from the previous iteration. Even without mentioning it in regards to how it compares to the game, it isn’t anything that noticeably special. Fanservice shows are of no small quantity these days, so your best bet is to leave the fanservice for the fanatics to dive into.Grade: C- favorite game is Persona 4 and will cherish it till the day I die, I’ve also adored its Vita port, Persona 4 Golden.

As for the rest, well, my (first) review.The Golden Animation, simply put, is all the scenes from the updated rerelease from the game, animated and stretched out a bit.As opposed to the strange combination of social life, school days, and vigilante-Shadow-fighting-crime-solving that was Persona 4, Golden, when taken at face value, comes off as a typical Slice-of-Life with a mystery sub-plot that isn't even explained well. Which is admittedly understandable, though it doesn't improve the series.Our returning characters have their previously established relationships hinted at, as with their slightly more complex personalities, but they're mostly shoved to the...side to make room for the amateur poet amnesiac with enough tsundere to give Ms Rin Tohsaka a run for money, Marie(a.k.a. canon love-interest). The series has no direct focus, but Marie's story in context of this expansion, translating to giving the girl some memories that might jog her old ones.Cue the beach.As a fan of Persona 4, I can admit that I found it enjoyable to watch, though that might have been somewhat mitigated by the conscious knowledge that I was supporting the ludicrous overmilking of Persona 4 that still continues with its yet to be released PS3 port and Rhythm Game spinoff. Even if the new artstyle took a moment to get used to, they were the guys who did the cutscenes for the game and they weren't too shabby here, either. Props, Madhouse.I say watch the aforementioned episodes because they have direct relevance to the original Mystery/Reach Out For The Truth story by offering a look from the killer's eyes through the whole story; from before the murders to his inevitable defeat by the heroes.Aside from that, though, I can only recommend this to someone who has already seen or played the original story and wants the canon equivalent of a fanfiction added on. I have no malice for this series, no anger with it that motivates me to give it a low score. But it just doesn't do anything noteworthy aside from the moment in its midpoint where it briefly returns to its source material to do what one might have wished at least half of the episodes had done. Perhaps it's for the best, though. Golden did have a happy & satisfying alternate ending, though.Live long and prosper! :) side to make room for the amateur poet amnesiac with enough tsundere to give Ms Rin Tohsaka a run for money, Marie(a.k.a. canon love-interest).

Even if you have played it, don't expect a full adaptation like the Persona 4 Animation. Think of it more as a  compilation of the cutscenes and events from the game.Overall I give this a 10/10. This isn't because of its merit as a  stand-alone series. In that regard it's actually terrible and you would have no idea what's going on if you watched it in a vacuum. I give it a 10/10 because of how well it adapts key scenes from the game- which is probably the goal rather...than making an adaptation of the entire narrative.Not only do you get memorable events in full animation, but they retroactively add in Marie for events she wasn't actually present in. Normally, this alone with a few minor plot changes would put me off, but they did a really good job of fitting the narrative together in a way that wasn't at all confusing...if you already played the game. It's almost like an alternative universe in which Marie had an even larger role.

Normally, this alone with a few minor plot changes would put me off, but they did a really good job of fitting the narrative together in a way that wasn't at all confusing...if you already played the game.

Based off of a highly popular game for Playstation Vita, there may be high expectations when it comes to adaptation. And why shouldn’t there be? The franchise is already popular and the concept of Persona itself should be enough to hit a few chords. The only catch is that Persona 4 Golden isn’t necessarily a sequel or spinoff. Instead, it’s a remake of the original series with the addition of a new character. Rebounding back with the story of the original series, Persona 4 Golden is far from a golden egg.Even when coming into...the show as an anime only viewer, it’s easy to say that the foundation of the show is built on knowledge of the Persona world. In other words, the producers assumes you’ve at least know some aspects of the show. If you’re coming into the series completely point blank fresh, then confusion might be a factor to endure. The first episode begins with doses of mysterious concepts as we meet protagonist Yu. He comes into contact with a strange avatar dubbed as the Persona and fights even more mysterious monsters. However, what’s really strange to me is the way the first half of the adaptation that came following the pilot episode. There’s little to no explanation regarding the events of what has happened. Instead, the show transits into slice-of-life formulation with the introduction of a variety of characters. The most prominent of them is Marie, the new girl in town that we meet in this remake. And to be honest, I’m not that impressed.For a show that has both a smart and intriguing premise, the first half of the series leaves me with a bit of disappointment. It feels bleak and the slice of life aspect builds on repetitive teenage-esque drama rather than supernatural phenomena. When you hear of the word “persona”, what you may think would be something along the line of “just what is that”? Sadly, patience would have to play a key role if you want to find out. The questionable decision to adapt the show this way leaves me wondering what the slice of life purpose really is. Furthermore, some of these questionable episodes feels rushed and leaves moments that are easily forgettable. These may include beach episodes, shopping sessions, and even forming a band. It takes roughly half the series to once again focus on the concept of Persona again. That’s just a whimsy shift and inadequate decision.As being foretold as an alternate continuation, the series still takes place in the town of Inaba. A major difference is the introduction of Marie, whom Yu befriends early on in the show. The two aren’t very compatible when it comes to their personalities. Their strange relationship can’t be depicted as romantic either since Yu doesn’t seem to show feelings for her or vice versa. To say the least, I could describe them as more of acquaintances. Portions of the story focus that is expanded in this adaptation seems to be focused Marie. As we find out, she has a case of amnesia so this show begins to unravel more secrets about her character. In essence, it creates a modern-life journey for her to recover those memories. Her relationship with other characters is mostly minor except for Yu whom she interacts with the most. As such, we only see most of her true colors during their times together. But for such a key character in this series, there’s not much appeals with Marie. She is reserved but not always shy to speak out her thoughts. Her lack of common sense on occasions is played out as a joke along with her tsundere-like tendencies. The plus side is that she isn’t a girl that causes trouble but just doesn’t seem to be able to catch a viewer’s interest despite the focus on her character.Speaking of characters, most of the original cast returns in this show ranging from cheerful Rise, the elegant Yukiko Amagi, tomboy Chie Satonaka, or clumsy Yosuke. Even Kuma makes his return that reminds us the show still appeals to peculiarity. Despite their lack of characterization, all of them get some moments to shine and a chance to interact with Yuu and Marie. The drawback is that there’s less prestige focused on their roles in the story. The plus side is their diverse personalities that leads to certain events that can be entertaining. But even taking this for granted, their performance is underwhelming filled with lackluster and stereotypical clichés that makes it all look bad on paper.If you lasted over half the show, then the patience might pay you off. Despite the overwhelmingly saturated amounts of clichés in the first half, the latter part of the show becomes more plot oriented. Characters such as Adachi and Teddie get more highlight with their roles. The former stands out as a testament of suspicious deeds after it’s clear that Adachi is more than who he claims to be. The climax of his battle against Yu serves as a solid example of Persona should be. The endgame is that the show had weak buildup leading to such a powerful climax. Thus it created less anticipation but more so on resolution. On the other hand, Marie’s side of the story also becomes centralized regarding her amnesia. Although relatively short, it’s clear that there is a bonding relationship between Marie and Yu that is emphasized in the final few episodes. Challenging himself to his limits, Yu struggles to bring back memories of Marie and the girl he once knew. It also creates moments of revelations as we find out more about Marie’s identity, her role, and ultimately what she wants to do. Perhaps the two most noteworthy moments of this subplot are Yu’s search for Marie (especially in a snowstorm) and their reunion. Although relatively short, it captured a profound image of their relationship. On the other hand, other characters are seemingly left out in the dark with minimal roles while I have to wonder why they get involved in the first place. Ultimately, it creates the result of a rushed adaptation.Creativity deserves some attention for Persona Golden namely with the action. Although CGI can be a bit distracting, it does pay off with the way it’s utilized. I give some credit for the way Personas are designed and the fluid action they are involved in particular with episode 11. Then, there’s the humor that is a mixed bag. While most of it feels forced or cheesy, there are some charming moments when the show delivers what it’s trying to do. And while the jokes are stale, the character interactions are genuine that defines what friendship is all about. However, the mechanics of the game remains stale. You’d expect some exposition but in the end, you’ll be left out stranded if you have no knowledge of the Persona world if you don’t pay attention.A-1 Pictures pulls their strings and as the company involved with the anime production, I could only say that the visuals are moderately adapted. Taking a good look at the characters, their models look weird and unrealistic. The only decent character design I can take my hat off to would be Marie for her unorthodox way of dressing up. Backgrounds are also fairly blend except for the battlefields in the otherworldly arenas. It’s there that creativity deserves some props. But if you want to talk about praise, then most of it should be focused on the Personas. Indeed, they are designed with great peculiarity but also distinctive marks of intelligence. It’s hard to recall exactly a word to describe them but the Personas stole the show when it comes to visual dynamics. When combined with effective camera angles, Persona 4 Golden actually shines more than meets the eye only for that element.Soundtrack has some influence but isn’t exactly a powerhouse. The OP song may be different (except for one episode that used the second opening song from the original season) but it still maintains the same tone. Its repetitiveness has no bounds either when it comes to its quirky OST. On the plus side, action scenes again takes control with its choreography; a sharp contrast to its easily forgettable SOL background music. For the character casting, most of them retains the same way of their mannerisms. I think I already mentioned Marie before but her tsundere-like voice can be borderline annoying and childish. However, Yu seems to have matured a bit with his much more confident voice as result of his max stats retained from the original show.So, what’s the best way to enjoy Persona 4 Golden? I’d probably say patience. If you’re bored by the end of the first episode, then take heed and drop this show. The first half has that slice of life feeling where each episode almost seems like a different show. But once you get through that, it might pay off with the focus on Marie and the main story. Rewards worth reaping would be the action oriented scenes with solid coordination and tolerable soundtrack. And while the comedy in most aspects is dull, there are occasional moments where you’ll find yourself burst out laughing. Ultimately, Persona 4 Golden is short of achieving stardom when it comes to its end product. Rather, it’s more like one of those shows that tries to work on its own terms but didn’t achieve its end game. the show as an anime only viewer, it’s easy to say that the foundation of the show is built on knowledge of the Persona world.

For you guys out there who haven't watch or play the game (at least Persona 4), don't watch this series yet. This series only emphasize on Marie, the new character from the golden version.Story 3/10The series is a bit messed up with characters after characters appear out of nowhere at the beginning of the episode without explaining how they got to meet the protagonist in the first place. The original story is pretty much non-existent here. I do understand they want to emphasize on Marie but at...least they need to explain how the other characters get to know each other since this series is more of a remake / alternative version. Each episode from the first half of the series feels like a brand new story rather than a continuation from the previous episode especially with a new character coming out from nowhere.Art/Sound: 6/10The art doesn't change much honestly. But hey, the original ones is acceptable so I still give it a 6 (Yos****sune still looks badass) and for the sound, I still enjoy the battle theme from the game so I give it a 7 (Meh, quite biased right?)Alright Character, 5/10Well, honestly, I haven't played the golden version so I find the new character to be quite interesting and probably the only reason I watched this series to the end. It brings a new spark to the old gang which is quite enjoyable. The problem lies with the rest of the gang. The main character is quite similar with the one from the original series (and the game, but this one talks!) but a bit livelier than before. The problem lies with the secondary characters (the rest of the gang), it feels like they are just... bland. Since they didn't explain how they got there in the first place, there's no progression or whatsoever from them.Enjoyment and Overall 5/10Overall, this series is quite a disappointment. I got a mixed feelings about this but I do like the new character and the comedy bits in this series is quite entertaining. It's really a shame that this is only a 12 episodes and the rest of the crews did not get properly introduced. For Persona fans out there who haven't watched this series, this series might be quite a disappointment to you Especially if you are looking forward to the actions and battle (which is pretty much non-existent). However, if you don't have time to play the game and want to know what happens in the Golden version, you might want to check this series out (even though I'm not sure how close this series to the game version). And again, Do Not watch this one before finishing either the original series or the game first!!This is my first review so please be nice to me guys :) least they need to explain how the other characters get to know each other since this series is more of a remake / alternative version.

Not an all-rounder but it'll make you feel good inside especially the last episode.I wouldn't say you should avoid watching this if you have not played the game or watched Persona 4: The Animation, It's a different story on its own but it does have some spoilers but its not blatantly obvious.What really got me was that the animation is top-notch; it was like it was from those cut scenes from the game itself. The...story does get stale after so many iterations coupled with such rushed pacing but somehow it always compels me to watch it again and again. Recommended if you want something beautiful to admire or just to have something new to watch. story does get stale after so many iterations coupled with such rushed pacing but somehow it always compels me to watch it again and again.

From the intro you can tell this is meant to emulate a new game+ for the main character, with his stats maxed out, lending to the main character's more lively personality. If you actually played a new game+ run of P4G, this is how your save would look, easily skipping over character introductions and dungeons, while absorbing all the new content of the game. The important part of this version is the GOLDEN, but negative reviewers mostly lament the fact they didn't re-animate the events of the original Persona 4 animation. What did...Atlus add to the Golden version of the game? Marie and Adachi s. link, Winter trip, and a new boss, and therefore new ending. What P4GA didn't cover was what the base game already had and what was already animated, but what it did animate was everything NEW to the series. This is a supplement to the main story and not a retelling, please watch it with that in mind. Atlus add to the Golden version of the game?

Unlike a majority of the P4 fans, I feel like this anime did honor to the game\'s story.  So I\'ll try and keep this...as simple as I can.  Why did I like this anime and the original that its based off of?1. I feel in love with the characters and world of P4 and the shows did justice in bringing so much of what I liked about the characters back from the game and even stepping it up a notch.  If you are new to P4, then welcome to a well rounded crew of characters that mixes anime mystery and slice of life with Scobby Doo adventure and antics, no I\'m not kidding.2.  Since the games main character Yu is a Silent Protagonist, its great to see his character be given so much life in the animes.  Everything that made him badass based off the players choices, are personified (hehe) in the show.  Scenes like the P3 nightclub are made that much greater or in the case of this anime, the Christmas and beach events.3.  This is where most people will disagree with me and why I encourage you to watch the original anime first.  Yes the main story is almost completely lacking in this anime, and I\'m Glad it is!  Why?  Well while I understand not everyone fits in this group, its overkill for me.  I played the original game to completion, I also 100% the golden version.  I also watched the original anime before this one.  While I love the story, I also am tired of it as well.  I played through the game again and that was fine, but the last thing I want to do is rewatch all of it AGAIN just to see some of the ""extra new stuff"".  This anime gives you Marie\'s story and all of the awesome extras that the golden game added without you having to rewatch the same stuff again.The creators made this anime catering to the fans who watched the original already.  A similar thing is done in Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.  They rush through the things that sync up with the original anime and when it branches away, they start to give the anime a slower, more depth paced feel, (even  if it was a roller coaster ride).  The anime producers do this to prevent the original work they did from becoming obsolete while still appealing to the fans of that original work.So all of that being said, watch this either after or alongside the original anime and you will find yourself in for an enjoyable time. as simple as I can.

I will discuss my viewpoint in the series.Story 5/10The story is the weakest part of the Persona Golden  unlike the first Persona 4 which the story is top notch for it told the event in the night more and some day events. The story in the golden is majorly in the day and will focus more the slice of life and normal friendship bonding and less action.

And maybe for some casual fans as well as the fans in-between. However, none of these enjoyable moments involved Marie and moments that did not involve Marie were very rare when watching. I expected Marie to be a heavy focal point walking into this as she was one of the more significant additions to the Golden game but I did not expect to walk away from it with a new hatred for the character.Golden is also littered with moments of shoddy animation throughout. It was kind of like the double Chie...situation from the original animation. In addition to these instances of questionable quality featuring twice the Chie, there are a thousand Maries this time around.The first animation was by no means the pinnacle of video game adaptations but I remember it for being a fun, fanservice-y run through that endeared me even more to the characters I spent those hours of game time with as well as giving a likable personality to the hero. The overall experience is what made me look over some of the technical/quality issues it had. Most importantly, it was enjoyable to me as a Persona fan.

Villians can be saved or just defeated, it\'s up to the protagonist or someone else to choose. Remember, villians aren\'t unsympathetic nor are they unempathetic, because they are as much of characters as the main cast, if not even more. Villians represent what we may become, one of the possibilities, that\'s why you can\'t just take out everything with a big fat laser. You have to understand the villian, and understand him/her/it well. How did the villian become a villian? Did someone do this? Was it society as we know it? A...cultural flaw? Imo, Adachi was one of those unlucky unfortunates that got the short straw in life. Yes, he did kill, but that doesn\'t cover up his own suffering. Understand the villian, know the villian, take out the villian if you want but don\'t treat the villian character one-dimensionally, even if he/her/it hates you for trying to understand the situation. Pity the villian? That sometimes may be fine. But the best solution as shown in Persona 4 The Golden Animation, is to SAVE THE VILLIAN.(like many people who end up not talking to their ""friends"" past graduation because they were never that close).I loved The Golden Animation even more than the first anime. Why? It went into greater depth for character development for one of the most pivotal characters, Adachi. The original series depicted little of Adachi, and left little to pity about him, as he was depicted mainly from the Investigation team\'s view, and felt one sided as a villian, not explaining much about himself and forcing the audience to analyze deeper into him without many clues.The Golden Animation elaborates on Adachi\'s self more, how he became like that etc. Adachi was originally a bit of a ""good student"" kind of person, as seen  in ep7, this doesn\'t mean that every good student who studies hard and as a result doesnt further his/her social relationships like Adachi will become a killer or anything like that.It\'s just a possibility that may happen, if let be by either the subject and/or others.EPISODE 6 AND 7! These are the high rewatch value episodes for 10/10 character development! I can relate, empathize with Adachi about the shittyness of the world, cuz I\'m a anti-social existential crisis myself. Adachi\'s life before discovering the Midnight Television as depicted in episode 6 and further elaborated in ep7 resembles the sort of cruelly realistic life that many people lead, one that is boring and uneventful, a situation that ends up making one view the bad sides of the world. Adachi was nearly improving tho, when he met the Dojimas. He hated the life in the country, and life and people in general.Of course, as shown in Golden\'s Adachi arc, when someone else came in (Yu), he started to spiral downward again, so it seemed like Yu\'s fault here (watch the episodes for more info).I actually cried, no I actually cry everytime I rewatch episode 7. And when I rewatch episode 6 my heart cringes and I feel myself in Adachi\'s shoes, because I\'ve had similar experiences and feelings. Some folks might go all insensitive and ""JUSTICE"" and say one-dimensional things like ""Adachi is such an ass"" or ""so annoying Adachi, go to jail already"". Those sort of insensitive things you see on the internet often. But that\'s called being stuck in the one dimension. Villians are not one-dimensional, not in real life and not in Persona.The KEY to solving Adachi\'s suffering was bonds, as Yu reveals Adachi had with Dojima all along, and that Adachi wasn\'t replaced. Or perhaps that was just an illusion cup? No, play Arena Ultimate and know that this is not true, Adachi DOES have a bond, and he is saved by it by YU who saves Adachi by showing him the bond and understanding Adachi\'s woes recognizing his own existence as one that may make Adachi\'s suffering.That\'s something you don\'t get in many anime. The Golden is a masterpiece, tho short. Prepare to cry when you finally do feel Adachi\'s woes and anger. And when you see him saved, you\'ll find yourself likely thinking that he\'s the  best villain in Persona 4 you ever faced. cultural flaw?

The slice of life events mostly compromises of beach to hot springs to the more zany ""Yu\'s cramped schedule day with EVERYONE"" event, it for all accounts counterbalances the more serious events the original had with it\'s serial murders and Persona\'s business.Now Marie as a character for LA was a bit hard for LA to like with her tsundere personality and LA LOVES tsundere\'s but she kinda was borderline unlikable at times. LA knows her entire deal is of a person who has no idea who she is and also when she finds out who she is she doesn\'t want to know, Kana Hanazawa helps...a bit but when it starts focusing on her ""arc"" her motivation for what she did was for the Investigation Team but LA was still torn by those revelations and what she did to make it rather tedious to ""get her back"".On speaking of ""get her back"", because Persona 4 Golden essentially being a retelling of the original game that means the ""original series villain"" of the series who LA won\'t name even in this review is back and mood-whiplashes you from the slice of life moments to the outrageously serious in taking down the villain in question and guess what Marie is nowhere to be seen (LA knows her disappearance has relevance but still coupled with the moodwhiplash doesn\'t help it as the major villain hijacks the plot for his development before jankily turning back to Marie).The animation done this time by A1-Pictures, keeps the favour and art style of AIC A.S.T.A\'s animation pretty well form character designs the original had, LA really don\'t have that much to say about A1-Pictures animation besides that it has a few derpy facial animation at times but other than that, A1-Pictures\' animation is decent enough.The voice cast is back just adding the aforementioned Kana Hanazawa and a portion of the anime is dedicated to Marie so Kana Hanazawa has ALOT of screentime compared to the rest of the cast, LA will give Kana Hanazawa MVP by default but LA will put Yui Horie who voiced Chie as second merely because Chie gets screentime in the slice of life events and was LA\'s favourite character.Persona 4 Golden: The Animation though does have elements of the anime missing from the original to pretty much abridging the original series to fit it\'s narrative but Golden still has it\'s upsides to all this, from new and old storylines from both Golden and the original series being finished along with trying to give character development to the newest character is a difficult feat Golden had done...just with some loose execution in it\'s part.Some of the new and old storylines Golden did answer at the very least is who Marie really is in detail, how Yu got his Persona powers in the first place (and these two plot points are linked) as well as giving a proper epilogue of all the characters so that Persona 4 finishes completely with no loose ends.If anything, Golden is an companion piece to the original anime series and sure LA will say both animes can compress a 200 hour or so game into 36 episodes and expect it to fill in ALL the details like what anime to game adaptation CAN do something like that?, but for what Golden did in 12 episodes from introducing, developing Marie and her presences in the plot, explaining everything it could AND bringing in Persona 4\'s more mundane slice of life events into focus all into one, LA will commend Persona 4 Golden: The Animation for that.Persona 4 Golden: The Animation should at least be watched for diehard Persona fans or people who watched the original series and just want more of Persona 4, be it serious or not this time with all the loose ends tied.

For the first three episodes, I actually kind of liked her. This did not continue.For reasons that I can understand, P4GA only adds the added stuff from the updated rerelease. As such, it is best watched after playing both P4/G and watching the original anime series.One of the things that the original Persona 4 Animation failed to deliver on was animation and action scenes. The writing was fine, but the series still suffered greatly. One thing that I thought that the Golden...Animation would at least impimprove upon was the art, but there is even more QUALITY than there was in the original.The Adachi fanservice was fun, but it was interrupted with copious amounts of Marie. By the way, Marie has more spoken lines in P4GA than any of the other characters (besides maybe Yu) do in both Persona 4: The Animation and Persona 4: The Golden Animation combined.So, to summarize:Bad artBad animationBad writingBad everything.Music was right out of the original soundtrack so that doesn't really count, does it?

Since, I have played and enjoyed the game extensively, expect my opinion to be biased and in order for one to enjoy this show, I would say it is almost a complete necessity that you play that game and begin with the same bias as myself. Understandably, that’s a high barrier of entry as very few people have PSVitas, all I can say is that I have no regrets owning one.Why is this preface important? Well that’s because I have no...idea what it would be like to watch this show without prior knowledge of the new plot elements introduced in Persona 4 Golden - primarily the new character Marie that is, as she is the entire focus of this series.Persona 4 Golden the animation makes no effort to introduce (or in some cases re-introduce) it’s world and completely skips entire segments of the story that are not related to either of the new character sub-plots. Personally, I was able to follow the story as I’d both seen the original anime and played through the game multiple games for the platinum trophy, however, if you’re here for the plot and you don’t have prior knowledge, prepare to be confused.Story: 3Think of persona 4 Golden the Animation as the fillers of an anime, extracted from the main series and stuck together. I happen to like fillers, the beach events, the school festival events, the summer holiday events, ski trip events, swimming pool trips, hot spring events, etc, these things breathe life and relaxation into characters and are anime tropes for a reason. That being said, occasionally and eventually, sh*t does go down and when it does *spoiler alert* friend power saves the day. I can’t even get angry about this anymore.Characters: 6Listening to Hanazawa Kana voice the adorably tsundere new character Marie was probably my entire reason for watching this show, especially with Kugumiya Rie also present in the cast. During the intro sequence, you get a quick shot of the Main character with maxed out personal stats and throughout the show he seems to be trying his hardest to try to be cool and badass, it comes off a little forced but fortunately he doesn’t say much and is an otherwise decent blank canvas type character for viewers to project themselves through. The rest of the cast is all present, but receive neither decent introductions nor any meaningful character development.Adachi does act as a reasonably interesting villain, presenting unique views on talent, success and social expectations… too bad he only gets to be in two episodes before being beaten by friend power.Art & sound: 7All very modern and clean. Some small amounts of fanservice that are present but not obnoxious. VAs do a great job and background tracks and music from the game are brought back, fitting in appropriately.Enjoyment: 8This is where I admit that I am biased, because I came into the series already in love with the world and it’s characters.Overall: 7If you’re already a fan of the series and you’re a fan of Hanazawa Kana, then let yourself relax and enjoy the show. idea what it would be like to watch this show without prior knowledge of the new plot elements introduced in Persona 4 Golden - primarily the new character Marie that is, as she is the entire focus of this series.Persona 4 Golden the animation makes no effort to introduce (or in some cases re-introduce) it’s world and completely skips entire segments of the story that are not related to either of the new character sub-plots.

I can see why someone who\'s never played the game that jumped onto The Golden Animation as their first exposure to the franchise would be thoroughly confused (and indeed turned off).Let me try to explain this in a way that people who have never played Persona 4 might understand.Persona 4 is a unique game in that it has elements of your classic RPG, a slice of life anime, and a dating sim, all neatly packaged into one. The game\'s main motif is ""Power of Bonds"", that is to say,...your connections are your source of power. So in-between saving the world and killing monsters, you still have to attend school every day and have a social life. That said, the RPG-element is still the primary plot of the game, everything else is only secondary.What The Golden Animation does is essentially ignore the RPG-element of the game and focuses entirely on the secondary aspect, specifically the social link (what bonds are called) of Marie.Now this is bad. The series is already assuming you have some knowledge of the overarching plot and therefore doesn\'t go into detail about events that are directly tied to the RPG-element, which is why the series makes no coherent sense. New characters are introduced every episode with no development, the calendar transitions jump back and forth between months with no explanation, and the first episode gives false impressions that it\'s an action genre when in reality it\'s a slice of life.It was understandably done this way because the studio\'s goal wasn\'t to retell the original plot or rehash the original anime. Its goal was to fill in the gaps the game left with the introduction of Marie and flesh out her character. See, Marie wasn\'t in the original game, she\'s actually a new Golden-exclusive character, and the problem is that in terms of plot significance she\'s actually quite an important character, and that\'s what this series tries to highlight.In that regards, this anime did an excellent job. To be honest (and I speak as a Persona 4 fan), Marie felt shoehorned into the game. Because the original plot (without Marie) was so nicely wrapped up, fitting Marie into it ended up feeling jarring at times because her social link makes it seem like she\'s super tight with the main group, but then she\'s not mentioned anywhere else.This series suffers from the unfortunate drawback of only appealing to a very select audience. It\'s not enough to have played the original Persona 4 or have watched the original anime, you NEED to have played Golden. As a whole, and rated objectively, I have to give it a low score. If this was part of an OVA package, it\'d be another story, but this is marketed as its own independent series which just doesn\'t work due to how much they cut out.That said, I love that it brought some of the most memorable scenes from the game to life. Kanji\'s beach scene was fucking hilarious and makes me love the characters and the series even more. I thought it was hilariously well done in-game, to see it animated made it that much better! Chie fan-service? Who needs that junk when you got Kanji the man in all his glory? I also thought Adachi was very well written in The Golden Animation. The game does scratch the surface of what they were trying to make Adachi to be, but this series really highlights how Adachi is Yu\'s foil. your connections are your source of power.

Well, in a few words, Persona 4 the Golden Animation belongs in that movement. You could literally rename it to Persona 4 the Cashgrab Animation or Baysona 4 the Michael Bay Animation. In short, it is not good and a disgrace.When I saw how Golden in comparison to the Original, its score was almost 1 mark lower than the former. I did not think it will be bad until I watched it and...yeah it was poorly done. Despite that fact, there were very few moments when I had fun one being the...final episode, the second half. The rest is cliched disjointed and a clusterfuck of nonsense.There was close to zero saving graces for this masterpiece of a series, and the only thing I found good was actually the sound. But that was also poorly used during the series. The op is ok but it grew on me. The ed is the only track I actually liked and the animation in the ending was good. Shoji Meguro is one of my favorite music composers and his passion is shown in the song. It just feels wasted on this Michaelbayan ingenuity of an adaptation.Who knew that when you see the label A-1 Pictures in a show you should already know what to expect most oftenly: animation and art becomes gradually worse later on, the soundtrack is standard to good and story and characters are not given a shit.My biggest complaint with this adaptation is that instead of making it a complete series, they just took the opening episode of the original and after that they just put the scenes from P4G. The end result is a mess of a story that has little to no continuity and A-1 shines again with its notorious use of timeskips *cough* SAO S1 *cough*. Characters are bland and a paper-thin imitation of the original. Marie who is the only new character is annoying and typical as hell and the fact that half the series is about her made me rage. She is your typical, annoying, tsundere, amnesiac girl who has a secret that will cause a plot-twist to occur. She is even more annoying than Teddie in this anime who is innately annoying.This is exactly how not to do a game adaptation and how to do a Michaelbayan chef-d'oeuvre (more like poop-d'oeuvre). A-1 Pictures can do so much better if they handle the story and characters better like in Shinsekai Yori.

But clearly, most of the time, their shows end up following the Cashgrab formula."", 'The review will be split into 3 categories so pick which ones correspond to you.For those that have never seen Persona 4 The Animation or played either Persona 4 or Persona 4 Golden:Don\'t bother with this anime cause it requires knowledge from the previous season or the games.For those that have seen the Persona 4 anime or played the 1st Persona 4 game:This adaptation will give you all you need to know about what happens in Persona 4 Golden. With the addition of Marie and the backstory of the main antagonist. And it won\'t bother with showing you stuff you have already seen...or played before with the exception of the 1st episode but with awesome action since the animators treated it like you imported your old save to start new game+, so you already have max stats and an Izanagi with Maziodyne. However it\'s focus is mainly on the characters and slice of life mode except until the later parts where the action picks up again.For those that have played Persona 4 Golden:This adaptation will show you all the added content in the game and more. It will show scenes that were never in the game especially with Marie and later for a couple of episodes with Adachi. The focus is on Marie\'s development as a character and on the slice of life comedic antics of the group with some really hilarious twist that I wish was also in the game, especially the Christmas Eve episode which was Golden!It\'s a great adaptation assuming you already know Persona 4 beforehand.

It does Marie so much justice that she doesn\'t get in the game, even in her social link. Before watching the anime, my thoughts on Marie were ""Eh, she\'s alright. At least she has a cool design."" After the anime, she is probably my favorite female character from Persona 4. Even her tsundere-ness is more charming in the anime, while in the game it\'s the main thing I disliked about her. In addition to all that it does for Marie, the visuals are also gorgeous. Probably...my favorite visuals in any anime. It\'s so colorful, bright, and shiny, and it just brings so much life to the characters.The story is presented very oddly, skimming over the main plot points of Persona 4 to focus on the new Marie segments present only in the Golden version of the game, but I got used to it after a few episodes and I find it a unique and oddly charming way of telling the story. Because of this, it\'s not a good anime to watch on its own: you should have at the VERY least watched the original P4 anime first if not played the game, otherwise you\'ll likely be confused by new characters suddenly popping up out of nowhere. my favorite visuals in any anime.

Because it is.But let\'s start with something more simple. This anime is the adaptation of the remasted version of Persona 4, Persona 4 Golden, so I was expecting the plot of Persona 4 (maybe without many details, since it\'s a lot to put in 12 episodes) plus the story added in the Golden. I was really wrong.This anime is completely a filler season. It\'s literally the Social link story of Marie, the character added in Golden that is really important for the story. For those...who don\'t know what a Social Link is, it\'s the Friendships with the other characters in the game, that you have to level up meeting and chatting with them while you play to know them better. And it\'s okay when you have the entire game, but when you have ONLY the Social Link of a character, it feels pretty useless to make an entire anime about it. Also this isn\'t exactly stated in the plot, so at first I wanted to watch only this series without the vanilla one (and I didn\'t play the game). Luckily I changed idea, though I still wanted to watch them together, so I was alternating episodes and I got really big spoilers from the second episode already even if I was already past half the vanilla season. Yes because this series doesn\'t even care in giving you prompt of the story, already in the second episode you have the full cast together, without any explanation, when you should actually know them one by one. It was pretty rushed too, since the episodes are mostly one shot, and aren\'t pretty much plot-related if not for few chatting about the major plot point of the story.At the end of the story, how could I enjoyan anime that was almost like watching a series only of ""beach episode""? Only the last episodes are really plot-related, but this doesn\'t justify or help that much since I was really bored when I got there.Also, I have the opinion that every media should be watched by itself, but in this case you should play the game of watch the vanilla season (and this is not a sequel, let\'s be careful with that) or else you wouldn\'t understand anything about it. who don\'t know what a Social Link is, it\'s the Friendships with the other characters in the game, that you have to level up meeting and chatting with them while you play to know them better.

Perhaps it will help you appreciate this work more.---o---The reason this anime has such a low score is because a lot of people misunderstood what this anime is. In the videogame franchise, Persona 4 Golden makes Persona 4 vanilla (the first version for PS2) not worth playing, since P4G is an enhanced version, with much more content (characters, story, levels, etc). Same happens with Persona 3 FES and Persona 5 Royal. I\'m pretty sure a lot of people tought that, since the P4G makes the...original P4 obsolete, the anime could be the same thing. I mean, the idea that ""Persona 4 The Golden Animation"" would have much more content and would make obsolete ""Persona 4 The Animation"". And they couldn\'t be more wrong.If you want to enjoy the principal story of Persona 4, you should watch ""Persona 4 The Animation"". There you will see how Yu gets to know every character, and how with his squad they go forward toward discovering the truth. That\'s why that anime has more than 12 episodes. If you try to watch this anime first, without knowing the principal story, you would get more lost than a compass in a washing machine . So yeah, I would say that\'s the reason it has such low score. People see this anime has a standalone anime, when actually they should be seeing it has an OVA, or has a complement to see after watching the first anime.Now that I have made that clarification, let\'s see; what does Persona 4 The Golden Animation has to offer?Story: 8Instead of re-telling the entire story of Persona 4, which could have been tiresome to someone that has already played the game, and/or just watched the first anime, this anime tells us the story of a character unique to the P4G videogame, Marie. Also, it lets us know more about the villain past, wich was my favorite add to the series. You\'ll know who Marie is if you haven\'t played the P4G game, or if that isn\'t the case, you could enjoy the new scenes of this character in the story. Personally, I\'m not a fan of this character, but I truly enjoyed seeing how her relationship with the group develops. And well, Iguess she has some fans that would surely love this.It also adds a bad ending, listed in this page, and the true ending for P4G.Art: 8It has great animation, and some good drawings, but sometimes the characters have badly drawn faces. Normally when they are afar from the viewer\'s sight. But I guess this is kinda normal in anime.Sound: 10Not much to say, the voice acting is great, and the music is top-notch.Character: 9In this version, we could say Yu has every social stat to the max. The real Yu NaruCHADmi. Every other character is just like what we\'ve seen in the previous anime. I would take 2 points of it because I don\'t like the new character (sorry tsundere fans, just not my cup of tea), but I added one because I love how they animated more of the antagonist past.Enjoyment: 7I mean, the story goes around a character I don\'t really like, but I could still enjoy how this relationship develops, and revisit a lot of funny moments from the P4 story, like the beach scene. If you have played the Persona 4 Golden videogame, then I would say this will fill a hole that you probably felt after completing the first anime (which is an obligatory watch btw).Overall: 8This anime isn\'t as enjoyable as the first anime, but that\'s okay since that wasn\'t its objective. The objective of this anime isn\'t replacing the first anime making it obsolete. The objective of this anime is letting you know about all the content added in Persona 4 Golden that you could have missed, if you didn\'t play the game and/or only watched the first animation. I would recommend it to a friend that can\'t play the game, but only after watching ""Person 4 The Animation"" first.I hope this review makes people understand what this anime is, and how they should watch it. I\'m beary sad because a lot of people failed to understand this, and really expected a re-telling of the complete story (for that they have the first anime), whic would have made this boring to watch to someone that already watched the first animation. Anyways, I don\'t have anything else to add. If you already enjoyed the first animation, watch this. If you haven\'t seen the first anime, GO WATCH IT, and then watch this one. Have an enjoyable time doing so, buh-bye original P4 obsolete, the anime could be the same thing.

Probably people came into it expecting to enjoy it standalone... but then again, objectively, it works just fine as a standalone, OR as a continuation of the first Persona 4 anime. My only real issue with it is the animation could be very nice in spots, and very lackluster in others. Everything else was fine; not the greatest anime I've ever seen but it had a sweet story, focused on Marie (mostly because she was absent from the original P4a so it makes sense she would be the focus of this one). Perhaps...more viewers were expecting a total revamp of P4a? Who knows? Either way, I enjoyed it equally, viewing it as a piece of the whole. more viewers were expecting a total revamp of P4a? Who knows? Either way, I enjoyed it equally, viewing it as a piece of the whole."", ""tldr - watch the original adaptation or play the game first before watching this series, since it only covers what is new in the Golden game.I first watched the first Persona 4 anime when it was released in 2011, watched one episode of P4GA when it was first released in 2014, and never touched it again until after playing the steam port of the game. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy the first epsiode of P4GA. it was that the original adaptation had aired relatively recently, and I did not feel like rewatching through the entire storyline again.Now that I have finished the series proper,...my initial impression that this series was simply a retelling was right and wrong at the same time. And that sums up the issue with P4GA. It does not really know what it wants to be. Part of it wants to have the same continuity as the original (heck, Episode 6 in P4GA reused scenes from P4A), while others is a complete retelling.In essence, P4GA is mostly a supplement to the original series. It focuses mostly on events and characters which were new to the Golden version of the game; which is basically Marie's social link, her backstory, and a few new bonding events of the investigation team. Therefore, new viewers would have zero idea as to what is happening, particularly the first half of the season since about 90% of the events from the original series is happening during the same timeframe.This does not necessarily mean that the adaptation was bad (at least for someone who understood the story of the original and was not confused by the choices made in this adaptation).  Story-wise the animation team took some liberties from the game material and did flesh out Marie's character a bit more. Art-wise I felt it was more appealing than the original adaptation. Colors are brighter, the color palette of the characters match more closely with the game. It was still very flawed in parts, but I felt for the most part it was pretty decent. Sound is great, as is most Persona-related things. Characters are still loveable as they were in the original adaptation. Overall, I felt this series as a whole was pretty good.I think the choice that the animators took to only animate the new aspects of P4G made sense considering that the original aired just 3 years prior. The only anime in memory that did a completely new adaptation in such a short time-span was probably Kanon. However, I just wished they fully committed to it, and left events which were already covered in the original alone and focused only on the new content, and made it very clear that this is purely meant to supplement the original series rather than replace it. Heck, even shortening it into an OVA series would probably work well. Instead, we end up with a confused mess that will satisfy fans of the material but confuse the heck out of new comers. my initial impression that this series was simply a retelling was right and wrong at the same time.

In a way it is but Marie's story was very enjoyable. Its better to watch the original animation first then this as extra content. Though I found the ending of this version much better than the original one.I was watching the show along with my progress in the game and I had a really great time. It's sad to see this being not appreciated as much as the original animation since not many played golden and barely cared abiut the extra character or alternative ending.

If you haven't played the games or at least watched the previous anime you most probably won't enjoy this anime and I'll explain why.Story 8/10It's all about Marie. Marie's story is a subplot in the Golden version of the game. However, as the original game was already animated in Persona 4 The Animation, this one is almost completely focused on Marie, and the main plot of the game becomes the subplot. If you don't like Marie or don't know her and have no interest in her character, this anime isn't for you....If you haven't played the game nor watched the 2011 anime you will be very confused with P4GA, since characters seem to pop up out of nowhere, without any explanation about them, and their backstory is never discussed. This anime also animates events that weren't animated in the previous series, and if you're a fan of the series and its characters you'll certainly have fun watching their shenanigans.Characters 8/10Marie, together with Yu, is the star of the show. You get a lot of her, since the whole point of this series is learning about her past. Some say Yu is too different from the games, but I definitely love his personality in the anime adaptations. After seeing Makoto in the Persona 3 movies being a walking corpse devoid of personality, Yu is certainly a breath of fresh air. The other characters are there too, the whole bunch, Yosuke, Kanji, Naoto, Yukiko and Chie, being themselves, it's fun to see them. And we also get to see and learn much more about Adachi, which is one of the highest points of this series imo.Sound 6/10Typical Persona 4 OST. It definitely fits the atmosphere and I don't really have any complaints, it's just not one of my favorite OSTs, but that's just personal preference. The OST isn't bad.Art and Animation 9/10The animation is definitely much better than it was in the previous anime. The colors are brighter and feel closer to the original game. The art is the same, which means it's great.Enjoyment 8/10It's fun. Seeing characters we already know and love in different situations can be very entertaining, and getting to know one more interesting character adds up to fun.

Sakigake!! Otokojuku Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4031/Sakigake_Otokojuku_Movie,"['A short film on a underrated manly battle shonen, Sakigake Otokojuku The Movie serves as an introduction to the series.The film\'s plot is straight to the point as we have our leading characters embark on a journey to America to participate in the tournament known as Great Battle August. Half the film is an outrageous road trip while the 2nd half are 4 rounds of 1 on 1 fighting.Not much can be learned from the characters by the movie alone aside from expressing manliness & the friendship they all shared on this short adventure. The only flaws to this film are the anti-climatic final...fight & the lack of other main characters such as Date Omito & The Three Fists. (Same goes for Akashi Gouji who only gets a brief scene in the movie).But like the Otokojuku series, expect some last second rescues as characters miraculously survived their deadly encounters. Overall the film is great especially with its soundtrack that yells ""awesome 80\'s!!""

(Same goes for Akashi Gouji who only gets a brief scene in the movie).But like the Otokojuku series, expect some last second rescues as characters miraculously survived their deadly encounters.

Let's start that review, this movie is a sequel to the Sakigake anime, so it would be nice if you did watch the anime first, or at least know a little about the series, even without that you are probably going to have fun too, cause the movie is quite simples. The plot consists in a deadly competition between the toughest students in USA vs the toughest students in JAPAN, just like it also happens in the anime, but with new characters and a new motivation for the US men, and of course, the first years of otokokuju have to prove themselves...once more. The artstyle if craziely good, manly as fuck(I love that kind of draw style), but the animation lacks a little, just like in the regular anime the fight choreography looks very off, and not cause of its time, but due to bad animation. The movie is really fun and will entertain any Sakigake fan and also any battle shounen fan, and  probably even get the  rest of the audience due to its over the top humour. Check ouy THEAnimeHERO review in his channel, dude is the best, you are gonna get even more interest in the story if you do. I really want a new adaptation of this. once more.

Kabuki-bu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33840/Kabuki-bu,"[""At first it looks fine and slightly interesting,  but after episode 1 it starts to get boring. Since the series revolves around Kabuki, we all or at least some of us know it's a classic style of Japanese dance-drama crap that is shi... can be boring. The mc tries to make a Kabuki Club at school but this character is annoying AF sometimes. He basically shouts out these Kabuki lines in public... the anime is based on this weird shouts with make-up... sorry this is just my emotions. Anyway it's not the studio fault, it's just the plot. There might be people out there...who love it but for most of us it's just another anime about weird club activities, it's probably predictable too.I give the green light to watch but don't go in this expecting a calm kabuki club in a school, shit will happen and Cringe will happen too. I'm personally not gonna enjoy watching the rest.After I make preogress I will update. who love it but for most of us it's just another anime about weird club activities, it's probably predictable too.I give the green light to watch but don't go in this expecting a calm kabuki club in a school, shit will happen and Cringe will happen too.

I enjoyed this anime a lot more than i thought i would.This is my first review on MAL btw... i thought i had to write something given how badly this show has been perceived by some viewers (maybe because kabuki is not this generation\'s thing?)Aaaanyway! When i first started this show, i thought the story was gonna go the cheer danshi route where we hardly got any content on the actual club activity. But to my surprise, this show brought the Kabuki and it brought it really hard! i.e. absolutely well executed, enjoyable and still realistic enough. My love for the art called...""Kabuki"" literally cannot be measured now thanks to Kabuki-bu!. One more reason to love Japan!Okay lets lazily follow the usual rating system..Story: 10. Beautiful well written story. I\'ve seen countless of anime and this has to be one of the most well paced story I\'ve seen. The author knows what he wants to achieve with this story and no episode is wasted in pointing that out.Art & Sound: 10. This part really shines whenever the kids do the kabuki play. You could feel the passion they have for the art from their body movement, facial expressions, plus the costumes are hot! (Genroku era type of hot). Sounds also on point, really sets the atmosphereCharacter: 10. What is more important here than character development? well you got tons of it. But what i liked the most was how dynamic the characters are, you can never get bored with them. Totally squad goals.Enjoyment: 10. I look forward to Fridays not cos of tgif, but cos of Kabuki-bu! The show just has a way of relaxing you. What better way to unwind after a stress-filled week?Overall: 10. I would like to use this moment to say a big thank you to the author for this beautiful story and to the production team for a well executed job. Thank you for introducing us to the world of kabuki, and for breaking it down so well so we can understand and relate.

And come back to thank me XD', 'This was one of those series which caught my eye when I was checking out the PVs for Spring a couple of months back. Right now, I can safely say that it has hardly disappointed me and even exceeded my expectations.Kabukibu is a story focusing on a youngster, Kurogo, who is incredibly passionate about kabuki (classical Japanese dance-drama), as he aims to gather people to form a kabuki club, hence the title of the show. The plot is not in any way unique; it\'s probably not the first time you will have heard of an anime where some guy decides to form a club...and tries to persuade everyone around him to join. However, in place of the plot\'s simplicity, there were other areas which made the show appealing. First of those which comes to mind would be the comedy. While humor can be pretty subjective from person to person, I found myself really enjoying the comical aspect of the show. The jokes they made didn\'t really feel forced, most of them felt casual and really things which everyday high school students would do and say. Apart from that, it was also really interesting seeing how Kurogo goes about trying to persuade the others to join him in doing kabuki. Imagine if you were asked to participate in a club which focuses on performing a 400-year-old traditional art form which supposedly has no part to play in modern society. You\'ll probably decline the offer, wouldn\'t you? That\'s exactly how everyone reacted to his proposal at first. And that was just the first of his troubles. Honestly, the ending is predictable and there\'s nothing to hide, Kurogo was always going to be successful, but this story is about HOW he will accomplish it. That is precisely what\'s intriguing about the show and makes you want to watch on every week.Another element of the show I would like to touch on is the characters. What I really love and what I feel really makes the show is the interactions between the characters. It wasn\'t a one-man show where one know-it-all character goes ""Leave this to me, I\'ll carry everyone"". Stuff happened. There were conflicts, some of them even somewhat unexpected, and the characters had to talk to one another in order to solve them. The characters themselves were not unique individuals per se, but together they formed one unique group of people striving towards a common goal. Although the show did not address every single character, I felt they generally did a good job for those they focused more on. The backstories were not too complex to understand, and simple enough for viewers to sympathize with the character involved. Overall, I liked the characters a lot and couldn\'t really bring myself to dislike any one. With regards to the seiyuus, at one glance you can see that while the cast isn\'t exactly star-studded, they are all adequately experienced. While it was certainly a challenge for them to try and voice lines in the kabuki style, I feel they did a great job. It actually helps that they aren\'t adept at kabuki lines, because after all, the characters themselves are mere amateurs, just like the cast.Checking the synopsis of this anime out, I\'m sure you\'ll start to wonder things like ""But I\'m not interested in kabuki, will I be able to get into this show?"" I can safely assure you that you do not need to have any background knowledge of kabuki in order to watch this. In fact, it\'s quite the opposite; watching this show could be what gives you the background knowledge of kabuki instead. Of course, if you\'re already interested in kabuki, you\'re definitely going to enjoy this anime. Nevertheless, that is not a necessity. I went into this show not knowing much about kabuki (heck, I don\'t even know much about Japanese traditional arts), but still wound up enjoying myself watching it. Dare I say, it has even got me interested in kabuki to the extent that I would give it a try if I had the chance to.I\'d personally give this anime a 7, or at most 8... but that\'s just me. I hope reading this can help convince you to ignore the bad ratings and give this anime a chance, because I feel that it truly deserves more attention and love! and tries to persuade everyone around him to join.

They learn about kabuki, practice plays, and perform. There’s nothing particularly driving about the plot. It’s just… there....Like some ordinary cliche school club anime from 10+ years ago.One thing I will admit that I’m rather grateful for is that it doesn’t litter unnecessary technical jargon in every line of dialogue. Considering how complex the world of theater is, I was expecting to be slapped in the face with all sorts of terms and definitions, and was pleasantly surprised to see that that wasn’t the case.While there are a few small moments and flashbacks that set the characters a bit apart from their generic roles, there isn't a lot that make them particularly memorable in any way. For example, the main character directs and writes the scripts for plays rather than acting as one would expect a protagonist to do. But what else? There's not a lot of depth to him or the other characters.**Edit: as of today (June 23), the anime has ended, and some development/backstory for characters-- namely Ebihara-- is only around half done.

So yes, 6-point-something MAL score is definitely less than what this show deserves.So, the premise of the story is an optimistic boy loving something and want to spread that love by gathering member to make a team, or a school club in this case. Sounds cliche, right? Yes, even the most of the characters are the usual mix-ups: The Optimistic Guy, The Super Smart Guy, and even The 'Refuse Doing Something Because of Some Dark Issues But Ended Up Doing It' Guy.Some people might think this is just another boring,...cliche slice-of-life. I also thought that at first. I even almost dropped it. But after watching about third of the show, after about 3-4 episodes, I started to like the characters more, started to appreciate this thing called kabuki that they're trying to explore more, started getting curious about what they'll do next. The plot doesn't really develop much more even until the very end. But I think, the interesting point of this show lies in its characters.For the MC, we have the ever optimistic little guy, Kuro. Barely has any personality in the early episodes, I found out that he is much more a realist than I thought he was. He's so stubborn, but he knows when he needs to give up and is quick to make decisions if something doesn't go according to the plan. He also has his moments where his confidence deflates, and I realized much later that many of the characters has something 'hidden' beneath their first impression personalities.Another thing that I like about this show is that it touched some topics that many people actually struggle in real life (such as confidence issues, femininity/masculinity issues, body image issues, abandonment from parents, people's expectations) without making it overly dramatic, and even showed that the characters themselves can overcome the problems.All in all, yes, it's not a master piece or something.

But definitely a worth watching in my opinion."", ""I decided to watch this after rewatching Chihayafuru (both seasons). So, unfortunately, I can't help but compare the two? Why?Both MCs are obsessed with a Japanese art form that is difficult for most to understand and dedicate themselves to. It is about them trying to start a club and recruit members for people to partake in the art form. Kind of. Competitive karuta, which is what Chihayafuru is about, isn't an art per se, but it's based on Japanese poetry.I preferred Chihayafuru much more. Here are the reasons:STORY (7/10): Well, the synopsis and my comparison covered that.ART (7/10): Clamp isn't known for pretty....Which is fine because xxxHolic is one of my favorite anime. Chihayafuru is josei so...SOUND (7/10): There's only three tracks in Kabukibu: the opening, the ending, and this one instrumental piece. All of them are great, but only three?! Okay, there was this one scene where a different piano piece was playing, but it wasn't outstanding. It's only getting a seven because and op and ed were so catchy and the one instrumental piece that was being repeated was quite moving.CHARACTER (5/10): To continue with anime comparisons, the MC's best friend is like a mix between Kyouya and Mori-senpai from Ouran HSHC. He's taciturn, intelligent, diplomatic, and tech-savvy. I think my word count is higher than his in the anime. Two members are basically Mikorin and Kashima from Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. The one like Mikorin is a feminine male. The one like Kashima is also a female mistaken for a beautiful male and is also in Drama Club, has a fan club, and is the lead for most of the Drama Club's productions. The reluctant and arrogant character kind of reminds me of the Queen in Chihayafuru, like how she sticks her nose up at team tournaments, he believes that a kabuki club run by amateurs is insulting since he comes from a kabuki family. Overall, the supporting characters weren't too memorable. Also, it lacked a balanced focus on the characters.THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE MC. He's so dull! Yes, Chihaya was obsessed with karuta, and Daddy Bear, but she had character. She was an airhead in addition to being a karuta nut. Throughout the seasons, she encounters opponents who are basically her teachers. They help her grow. This MC though, I don't remember his name tbh, just cares about kabuki. He's not even good at kabuki. What the hell?ENJOYMENT (6/10): Despite my biggest complaint, it was still interesting to learn about kabuki. The music was decent. The anime wasn't comedic so that was a let down because my favorite genre is comedy and this could have easily weaved it in.OVERALL (6/10): To be fair, Chihayafuru had 25 eps per season so it had the chance to be fleshed out. This only had 12 episodes. Give this one a try if you're interested in kabuki. But afterward, totally watch Chihayafuru for some actual conflict and character development and a variety of good music.

I think the anime has no idea whether or not it wants to be treated seriously or not. They make some ""tragic"" backstories for every character in the show. But then, it takes like around 3 minutes of interaction for the character to tell the main character about his tragic backstory, and another three to get chummy with the rest of cast. One character in particular completely opens up to the main character within a few seconds. I really don\'t get it....Then, you\'d think the story is serious, but it apparently tries too hard to incorporate comedy / slice of life stuff, which are also really mediocre.Honestly, the story arcs by themselves are considered average, but when considering the whole story, it\'s a joke.

Granted, as a non-Japanese person, I have  surface knowledge of kabuki. So I picked this show up for 9 episodes. I did learn a bit about it, not going to lie, but there\'s nothing original about this show other than the kabuki premise. It\'s a dead show that doesn\'t try to do anything interesting.

They are not simple or plain either not sophisticated or pretentious , their true nature is revealed on stage during...the Kabukibu play. Don’t be fooled by the new concept this anime delivers for its viewers  ,everything about  the art of kabukibu is explained during those 12 episodes.

There’s nothing really new here and nothing really terrible either.I liked the idea of it. A boy named Kurogu really wants to start kabuki club as he sees it as dying art and wants to bring it to a younger audience. The thought of learning about a new bit of culture and seeing all the cool costumes for used for Kabuki was a nice thought. And the kabuki is interesting. From what I’ve gleamed it uses pretty simple stories like a band of thieves or too people in love and uses fantastic costumes,...specific, almost dance like movements and sound effects to bring it to life. And all that was fun. It’s just the rest of it that fell flat.None of the characters are that interesting. I can’t even really remember their names. Kurogu is the basic overeager boy who is always happy and lives with his mother whom he for some reason calls by her first name which is kind of confusing; I did like that he never let anything stop him from achieving his dream and he apparently sucks at the thing he loves so much and Tonbo is the quiet, nerdy, tech guy who just does whatever Kurogu asks of him. For the rest of the characters after the initial conflict of getting them to be in the club are just kind of there afterwords. Kaoru for example, is a great actor but she’s in the drama club and also a girl so they have to find a way to borrow her from the drama club and have a girl in kabuki which doesn’t really happen apparently unless they’re a love interest. And she’s shown to be an amicable girl who just wants everyone to get along. And you’d think after finally wrestling her away from the stubborn manager of the drama club and even going through a competition to get her in the kabuki club she’d be a bit more of a focus. But she almost never talks after that and other than one episode there's no more conflict between the two clubs. The same for Hanamichi. They work really hard to get him into the club even though at first he scares them and it goes through this whole thing of him being a tough guy who’s secretly a softy, but then he’s just a side character after that and they do nothing with him afterwords. He also changes from tough guy to gay stereotype so quickly, there was no really point to it in the first place. Maruko is my favorite character be far. She makes the costumes as well as cosplay outfits. She’s so sarcastic and just basically hates being there it’s really funny. But once again she stuck in side character land. It could have done so much more with them instead of just more focusing on trying to get the one guy to join the damn club he doesn’t want to join.Jin and Shin were the most interesting; Jin mostly because the show seems to be focused on his joining the kabuki club and he gets the most development due to it. Jin is really amazing at kabuki but thinks people in the club are just doing it for fun and looks down on them for not taking it seriously. He’s overly polite and a perfectionist which sometimes gets him in trouble such as when Kurogu and Tonbo show up at his house he can;t just kick them out and instead offers them tea which is kind of funny. He’s trying to work hard to be as good as his famous kabuki actor grandpa and gets into conflict with his father for the former not being around a lot and Jin’s not being a regular boy. As for Shin, he’s a good kabuki actor with a apparently famous kabuki actor as his dad who tragically died. But instead of wanting to be like his father, he wants to be a rock star. Shin is loud and obnoxious, basically you're typical anime rocker dude. Something that's stands out a bit is that he has to live with grandma because his mom married a man that lives in the U.S. and moved there.That brings me to the second problem with this anime besides underdeveloped characters. Seriously issues are never taken seriously. Jin doesn’t get along with his dad and constantly fights with him? Never bring it up again. Kurogu’s mom is never home? Oh he’s fine! He has Tonbo! Shin’s mom abandoned for a man and moved to America which upset him so much that when she does come back to see him perform he wants nothing to do with her and gets depressed enough to not want to leave his bed? Get over! We have a show to do! And it works! These issues are brought up and then brushed aside almost immediately like they don’t’ matter but they do! It’s like the story writers wanted character development but didn’t understand how to deal with the fall out and it’s infuriating to see characters who are suppose to be friends say that the other characters problems are basically stupid and don’t matter.My last point is about the voice acting. It’s atrocious. Well two parts are really and that's enough to make me hate it.. Hanamichi’s voice starts out fine. It fits the design they gave his character. But then once he joins the club, he’s given this high-pitched girly voice that doesn’t match at all and starts acting like the gayest stereotype imaginable and it’s grating. I don’t know why he couldn’t keep his old voice. The second part is when they actually do kabuki. Every time the club started putting on a performance I dreaded it. Not because it wasn’t well done. The costumes were great, the sets were cool, the interactions backstage were fun to watch, but the voice they use for it made me want to jab a screwdriver into my ear drums. It made me miss the moments of them just talking about the plays or just hanging out eating lunch. Which those parts were fun, don’t get me wrong. I liked all of the characters practicing and figuring out what plays to do and who does which part, or having them just hanging out and being friends. Hell, the most interesting episode was watching them update a play so that younger audiences would get it. But kabuki is the main focus so it was just constantly me pulling my headphones halfway off so I would have to listening to it that much. And I get that it’s apparently the actual voice used for actual kabuki performances but my God, it felt like someone was yelling directly into my ear and doing it in such a slow, agonizing manner like people who think that the deaf will hear them if the talk slower and more exaggerated. It drove me insane.Overall I’d give Kabukibu a D. The setting is whatever, it’s just Japan, the animation is smooth, the characters are underdeveloped, I don’t really remember much about the music, the only conflict is getting Jin to join the club and every other one is brushed under the rug, the art-style isn’t anything new and the voice acting is annoying as all hell. I wouldn’t re watch it, or hope for a season two and kind of wish I hadn’t watched it in the first place; even if I did learn a bit about kabuki.

Now, as a high school student, he desires to create his own kabuki club in order to bring an appreciation of kabuki to a wider audience. He'll find, though, that with the weight of hundreds of years of strict tradition, it's not so easy to get high schoolers interested. A rough start is not enough to deter Kurogu, and he’ll work hard to inspire in others the same burning passion he feels, until the day he can put on his own performance!The character development isn't nice,...it's not entertaining. However its attempt to portray a unique japanese culture is definitely interesting.With Clamp designing the characters, the artwork is incredible.There is not much story behind it and character sidestories have been rushed.

One of my favorite anime stories of all time is Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, and while I didn't expect this to rival that work, the concept of another anime whose main focus is an archaic form of Japanese theatrical storytelling was something that greatly interested me. This may have been a bit of a mistake, because at the beginning of this story I felt that my expectations were far too high. However, as the story progresses, we do manage to get some things that I find very interesting that gives the work its own reason...to exist. Let me explain.STORY -------------- 7/10The story itself is rather generic. It is about a group of classmates interested in an activity, and their struggles and attempts to do said activity. This can be easily compared to other works of this genre, or even idol shows, or as I tended to think of it, a sports series. Sports stories have lots of training before bigger events, giving the characters a chance to grow and evolve as they attempt to improve. Kabukibu does something similar in that characters have their progression and conflicts in between these moments of Kabuki, but herein lies one of the problems with the story.The Kabuki sections themselves are rather short when they appear. The longest performance happens near the end of the series itself, and this may cause a problem when it comes to getting viewers interested in the art of kabuki. We have a performance that may get people interested about halfway through the show, but that is also rather short for the buildup the show gives it. Personally, I think the show could have used more long-form kabuki performances, like the one that happens in the last episode.Outside of the Kabuki performances, later on in the series the story brings up some interesting questions about the act of kabuki theater itself, and this was honestly one of the most interesting parts of the series. I don't really want to bring up spoilers, but there are some interesting questions that are brought up by the kinds of people who are interested in a 400-year old art form.ART ------------- 5/10Kabukibu is pretty generic in its art style, and there's not a huge amount of good animation moments. In fact, I can more frequently remember moments of poor or reused animation than good moments of animation. I would forgive this if we had more kabuki moments, but sadly the fact that there aren't a great amount of kabuki performances means that it feels like a show on a budget. I will say the final episode has to have some of the best animation in the show with its final kabuki performance, but I wish that this happened more in the series itself rather than only giving us this good animation in the end.SOUND ------ 6/10I don't have much to say in this department. Voices were decent, and the OST frequently used a leitmotif that gave the story a nice sort of theme to it. The sounds of the tsuke and the shamisen during the kabuki sections were great, and it also has a good opening, but nothing related to the sound in this series will really stick with me.CHARACTER --------- 7/10Characters start out pretty boring and generic, but later on they are given interesting and enjoyable interactions. Tonbo in particular is a character I really enjoy. The characters really follow the main sorts of archetypes you would expect from a show about a club, but again their interactions and development are given unique and fun touches.ENJOYMENT ------------- 7/10While I didn't really like it coming into the series and it felt boring to sit through, once I hit around Episode 5 I was finally more interested, and the last episode was exactly what I wanted from this show. It asked questions I didn't really expect it to and gave realistic answers that also continue to raise questions about the art form itself. It's pretty interesting by the end. I was hoping it would be better animated, especially during the kabuki sections, but I did like one or two of the cast by the end.OVERALL ---------- 6/10There were some problems, especially going into it. I don't think this series is going to convince people that aren't already at least mildly interested in Kabuki to look into Kabuki. I don't think I will be doing so, and I wouldn't blame others for feeling the same. It's slow-paced and feels oddly focused at times, but by the end manages to deliver something I was really looking forward to, and on the way brought up some concepts and ideas that were really fun. to exist.

It definitely shows a bit of what Kabuki is about and you will be able to learn some of it. However, it started off with an overused plot of some typical school animes that shows the main character wanting to start a club being all positive about it and starts to recruit more people to join in. Also, I actually find myself not really focusing or remembering some of the lines in the script for some of the Kabuki plays, be it big or small...as I got a bit confused with what it was talking about and don't find myself remembering it.Characters: 9The characters are really interesting with different personalities. The anime progresses and slowly leaks some family background in each episode about some of the characters which are not too difficult to understand and sometimes can be quite shocking.Art: 7Not the greatest but still pretty good enough for me, knowing CLAMP's art style. The way they animate Kabuki is beautiful and makes you appreciate this sort of culture that Japan has.Enjoyment: 8This kind of anime is for people who want to enjoy something laid-back and not about serious Kabuki. The first two episodes were kind of boring for me to watch but, I still continued to watch hoping it will get better which it did, thankfully. As I reach the last episode, it feels a bit incomplete for me as I feel there are some things which can be explained further.

Kabukibu! was rather an unexpected find and quite the unexpected gem! As a non-Japanese person who enjoys anime as well as the art and culture that Japan has to offer, Kabukibu! was indeed an eye-opener as I had been of the thought that Kabuki was primarily a dance form but apparently it is a type of dance-drama performance and I wouldn't have known that had it not been for this anime!Kabukibu! gives a thoroughly slice-of-life-esque look into...the art form set within the context of a high school and its various clubs; to summarize: it shows the extreme perseverance of a single student and his attempts to have his high school provide a platform wherein people can casually learn and practice Kabuki, which in this universe, is an unusual feat (Aspects of this can appear somewhat corny, to be blunt). It allows the viewer to know the basic nuances of what goes into Kabuki within the span of 12 episodes through the perspective of characters that either love or at the very least understand Kabuki, characters who indulge in the performance of the same, and audiences of various age groups who either know or do not know about the art form. It enables the viewer to see the value of such an art form from a cultural point in addition to depicting ways in which the art form could be distant from the modern viewer and even makes attempts at bridging that gap...By no means, is this anime some masterpiece but it sure does offer a good time, a thorough ground for base-level knowledge about Kabuki as far as an anime in a high school setting can go with predominantly high school characters; it's soft, simple, cheesy, wholesome to some extent but absolutely enjoyable if one was to give it a chance...It's a fairly lesser-known anime and I for one, believe that it deserves more than the 6-point-something rating that it currently has on MAL! Again, it's no solid banger but it is fairly decent for a single-season anime! :) (And it had me looking up actual Kabuki videos on YouTube, so I suppose that's a plus as well!) the art form set within the context of a high school and its various clubs; to summarize: it shows the extreme perseverance of a single student and his attempts to have his high school provide a platform wherein people can casually learn and practice Kabuki, which in this universe, is an unusual feat (Aspects of this can appear somewhat corny, to be blunt).

For those that don\'t know Kabuki is a dramatic Japanese theater play meant to be outlandish and downright erratic. It\'s one of Japan\'s most popular forms of playwright and has been around for hundreds of years.If you want to learn a bit about kabuki, then this anime would give you some pointers about it. But if you\'re looking for a decent story involving it, you may have to wait longer on that. The story is cliche, following a generic looking boy who loves kabuki maybe...a little too much, and he ends up making a club for it. Here\'s come the part where it starts to become cringy. When it comes to kabuki, you\'re supposed to be doing exaggerated acting and display it loudly for your audience.The guy does this...out in public, with no context or warning. Maybe its due to my Western culture, but anyone doing stuff like that in public gives me second-hand embarassment. I\'m not sure how the Japanese handles things like this, but I wouldn\'t think clapping and cheering would be one of them.As for the characters, well, there\'s nothing to say. They\'re just typical tropes that aren\'t really explored or expanded on. There\'s your ""I\'m a professional kabuki, why should I join an amateur club?"" character, there\'s your ""i\'m a girl, but I wanna play kabuki even though its male only"" character, the ""i\'m a popular lover boy"" character, etc. There\'s nothing really interesting about them.I dropped this show five episodes in after seeing the main character (boring, brown hair guy whose only personality is liking kabuki) faint and then everyone has to pitch in to save the play because that is just what he wanted.If you like kabuki a lot like that guy, then be my guest. Otherwise, maybe check around for other things.

This anime deserves more credit than people give it.Story:The story is basic. It's a typical high school anime with a club involved. But it's about kabuki. There aren't a lot of kabuki animes in general.Because of that, it might be difficult for people to get into.Art:It's alright. I like the design of the characters.Sound:Not anything to scream about but it's not bad....Character:In my opinion one of the most redeeming factors of this anime. Everyone has a motivations that makes them go a little bit beyond their trope. They are all likable and no one makes me want to rip my scalp.

The conflict is solved by alternate means instead of yelling at each other for several episodes and the conflict doesn't revolve around stupid misunderstands and the lack of communication. There's a lot of communication.Compared to other highschool animes, this one lacks the same intensity and 'over the top'-ness that modern animes tend to have. However that doesn't make it bad. It makes it feel like a very natural anime.Overall:There are some animes that don't deserve the high ratings that they get. Then there are the hidden gem animes that don't deserve the low ratings that they get. Kabukibu is one of the animes that doesn't deserve such low ratings.This is a relaxing anime and people should give it a shot :) Character:In my opinion one of the most redeeming factors of this anime. Everyone has a motivations that makes them go a little bit beyond their trope. They are all likable and no one makes me want to rip my scalp.

I died of cuteness in the episode as he tries to guess which of the three balls is the seal. Am I weird to be shipping prey with your predator? Maybe, but no one cares. It's really a pity, it's so short and has so few episodes! It may take at least 6 minutes. Anyway, the episodes were a lot of fun. It's super fast to watch, so I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have much time. "", ""A very cute and adorable short anime series - if you can even call it that. Is only about 6 or 7 minutes for the whole anime but is definitely worth a watch if you have a few minutes to spare. If you're an animal lover, like me, you'll defo like this!Story - 7Very cute, It is nice to watch the seal's & polar bear's relationship grow, although the concept is weird, (prey and predator) this would never happen in the while but who cares? It's anime so its supposed to be fun and out there =^--^=.Art - 6The art style is fair enough...for a short anime, very cute.Sound - 7The voice actors did a good job with voicing the lines for the characters, I think they do a good job especially for the seal.Characters - 7The two characters a very likely tbh, the seal pup is so cute and the polar bear seems so blissfully unaware that the seal is supposed to be it's prey that they make a good pair. I feel like they could defo turn this short into a full anime series if they develop the story more and add more characters just because I think the polar bear and seal's  little love dynamic is fun and original.Enjoyment - 7Is a VERY enjoyable anime. Made me have a few little laughs and I really love the polar bear's and seal's relationship.Overall - 6Although I enjoyed it I'm only rating it a 6 as it is only a 6 - 7 long anime, but as previously stated I think the writers can make this into a full series of like 10 - 11 episodes for like 20mins per ep. They have a good concept here & if they developed the story and also added some side characters, it will make it better. If they made this into a full series and it was good then It'll probs get a higher score from me as it will have more depth.But anyways this is defo worth the time to watch and is good for how short it is. for a short anime, very cute.Sound - 7The voice actors did a good job with voicing the lines for the characters, I think they do a good job especially for the seal.Characters - 7The two characters a very likely tbh, the seal pup is so cute and the polar bear seems so blissfully unaware that the seal is supposed to be it's prey that they make a good pair.

Mamotte! Lollipop,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1509/Mamotte_Lollipop,"[""Mamotte! Lollipop is a fairly short 13 episode show. The main character is Nina, a 12 year old who, while eating a cake, mistakes the crystal pearl that lands on her bowl as candy and eats it, right before all the magical examinees come falling from the sky.The first two examinees she meets are Zero and Ichi, who, upon discovering that she accidentally swallowed the pearl, drag her off to find a way to get the pearl back. Unfortunately, there is no way for them to get the pearl out at the moment, so they have to wait until Christmas, the last day of the...exam. Zero and Ichi then decide that they will protect Nina from the other examinees until they find a way to get the pearl out of her.Story: 6The plot is not completely awful, but it's not amazing either. Since the anime cut out parts from the manga, there was not a lot of character development, especially with relationships. The Nina and Zero pairing felt forced and cheesy at best, and Ichi was just left at the side. The ending was rushed and messy, which did not help.Art: 5the color choice is good, but the animation tends to be lacking. There are many occasions where the faces are proportioned poorly, and it's easy to tell that the show suffered from lazy animation techniques.Sound: 5the music is very typical for a shoujo, especially the opening and the ending themes. Voice actors are okay, but I did not enjoy listening to Nina whining and complaining.Character: 6The cast is thankfully varied, with each character having different reasons for why they decided to take the magical exam. However, some of them are quite annoying, and the characterization is limited, at best.Enjoyment: 5As someone who has read the manga, I expected a little more out of this show. It was a show whose entertainment tended to vary from episode to episode, with some being especially painful to watch and others not as much.Overall: 6If you are a diehard fan of shoujo, then this is probably a series you would try. Fortunately, this series is short, which means that if you don't like it but are watching it anyways, it won't take up too much of your time. exam.

Wow. I was wrong. VERY wrong. The best thing about this anime is the opening song. Seriously. Although its only 13 episodes, it's so boring and uninteresting it seems to drag on and on and on. I had to force myself pretty hard to finish watching it - just so the money I spent wouldent go to waste.Story: 5. It's very ordinary. Nothing I havent seen before.Art: 3. Below-average.Sound: 7.

It is so lazy. ZERO effort was put into this. I\'ll elaborate:Story: The story is rather stupid. You already read the summary, yeah? It seems like one that can be so easily solved like ""why not just do this"" but it\'s like the characters are too dumb to suggest that. Don\'t get me started on the script and...dialogue. I swear to God, a TEN-YEAR-OLD could do a better job. The two boys repeat the same lines over and over. That\'s fine for spells and speeches and things of that sort but no, the repetitive dialogue is more like something they keep saying because the writers don\'t care enough to think of what else they might say. It is PAINFUL.Art: It\'s based on a manga that I\'ve read which is...well, it\'s just okay. Mediocre, I guess. The MANGA art is not very good. The faces look so squashy and in the side profiles, the noses and eyes are hideously positioned. So....the show didn\'t have much to work with....but somehow it made the characters look even worse. Nina herself looks like....an alien. I don\'t know. The eyes are totally messed up and I LOVE big eyes! :(That\'s not the most offensive thing about the art though.IT\'S CHEAP. So cheap. They reuse animation over again-DON\'T even bother editing it if the characters are wearing DIFFERENT CLOTHES. That\'s right. That hits an all time low for me. I lost any lingering respect at that moment.Sound: Haha.....you might hate me for this but as a lover of delightfully obnoxious high-pitched J-POP, I LIKE the opening song. Again, the lyrics are childish and dumb like ""it\'s okay to be indecisive in love"" oh really? ANIME FANS HATE THAT. But it\'s catchy enough. The ending theme is meh. I can\'t even remember how it goes.Character: Good god....Ichi is the only likable character. Nina the heroine is a f*cking idiot who takes ""idiot"" to a whole new level. ""All these bad people are after me so I will fight with my protectors and then RUN AWAY"". Like that\'s all she does. And she doesn\'t learn. She does it over and over and over. Zero is an idiot too. The other characters....yeah, I don\'t even really care. The backstory of the little cousins is kinda cute...but it\'s not worth sitting through this crappy show just for them.Overall, I do not enjoy this anime. Five-year-old girls might....but just because something is aimed at children doesn\'t excuse it to be crappy. Five-year-old girls also enjoy Sailormoon and Disney Princess movies and those are classic and loved by all because the creators RESPECT their audience.Mamotte Lollipop does not respect you. In the slightest. I was actually offended by how bad it was. If I was Michiyo, (the manga-ka) I\'d be crying to see my work turned into......whatever this is.Now Michiyo has a few other manga that are WAY better than this; if you like shoujo, do check them out and hope to high heaven that if any more get adapted it will be done by a studio that gives a crap. dialogue.

Lollipop.I thought it was very good most of the time. But you couldn't see anything but mistakes. The characters were a little rough and I would of liked to see a little more action.I liked it because of the romance between the three characters and the ways of the story.I didn't like how the story was the same every episode.As someone already said its plain boring but it entertains you for awhile until you get bored of it. As said before its VERY short. 13 episodes or 26? I would choose 26. I mean come on. Seriously! You need more episodes...to complete the series.

Regardless, I'm breaking out the decent grammar for this one because usually I type like a third grader.I read this manga a few years ago and have several fond memories of it. I liked it a lot and found the story to be, while childish, pretty decent. However, this anime adaptation was atrocious. The art is really awful, (at some points the characters look like their shorts...are pulled up to their arm pits, the characters are seen wearing the same clothes every day, attack sequences are recycled) the story is quite different from the manga, and several important characters are missing. Not to mention the fact that they completely missed the point of the manga and didn't even include the real ending, regardless of the fact that the manga was already completed at the time the anime was airing. I think the only thing I really liked about the adaptation was the dubbed version because of the choices for the voice actors. Nina was cast pretty well, even though she's seriously annoying. I think Brittany Karbowski does a great job of capturing her whiny nature. Eric Vale as Zero was a fairly good choice as well(considering that he's one of my favorites) but I thought he sounded a bit too old for the character (which is what tends to happen in English dubs). Michael Tatum as Ichi was probably my favorite, just because of how well he suited the character.I really wish they would've included more ACTUAL romance in the anime like they did in the manga, such as kissing scenes. I'm assuming they didn't have a great budget with this anime, considering that it's definitely far from being popular(especially like 4 years ago) however even as a standalone, it isnt very good.I got a bit of enjoyment out of the DVD when I purchased it, however now that I'm older, I find it embarrassing to watch and my enjoyment of it has lowered. I could definitely still read the manga, though. The series itself isnt terrible, its only the anime, in my opinion. I would get rid of the DVD however there isn't anyone who would buy it, and I also have it signed by the entire cast and the director, so...Story: 4 - this is for the anime, not the manga. they excluded several important parts from the manga.Art: 3 - the animation was really awful. characters use recycled attacks and battle sequences, wear the same clothes every episode, pants pulled up to armpits, ninas hair makes me cringe when it moves, etc.Sound: 6 - the english voices were pretty decent (i never saw the japanese version so i cant say for that) and the opening and ending credits are very cutesy and they fit the theme of the series.characters: 6 - this also goes for the manga. they're super cliched and lack originality. that being said, i did REALLY enjoy ichi's character for some reason. i suppose the big brother thing is endearing to me.enjoyment: 3 - like i said, i got enjoyment out of this series when i was younger, but now that i'm 18, i find it embarrassing to watch again.overall: 4 - not very good, in my opinion. is worth a read if you're willing to, however the anime is awful and the only reason you should watch it is if you're in the mood for a laugh. are pulled up to their arm pits, the characters are seen wearing the same clothes every day, attack sequences are recycled) the story is quite different from the manga, and several important characters are missing.

I came across this series when I was at a local book store one day looking for a new Manga to read.  I did some Research after I bought the Manga to see if there is also an Anime.  I always look for something that looks like a very cute series.  And sure enough this is what I was looking for.  I definitely recommend this if you like a Shoujo Anime about a main female character who...is surrounded by cute boys.StoryThe story is something I would be interested in but because this is a very common thing in anime for the main female character to be surrounded by boys and have them protect her, I highly doubt this would be the anime for you if you get bored of the same theme over and over again.ArtI personally love the art style both in the anime and the Manga.  Why?  You ask?  Well in my opinion, the art style to me looks very similar to the art styles in series like Full Moon O Sagashite, and Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne.

"", 'Save Me! Lollipop... I was watching the previews on my Ouran High School Host Club DVD Box Set one day, and the preview for this came on. I recognized Brittney Karbowski\'s voice, and since I am a huge fan of her, I had to watch it. That night I started it, finished it 6 hours later, and honestly I don\'t know what to think about it. It was probably one of the most interesting thing\'s I\'ve watched over the summer, and by interesting, I mean strangest.The story is fairly simple. 2 magicians, Zero and Ichii, are from the magic world and they\'ve entered a competition...to become full-fledged wizards, only the item they have to obtain is eaten by a girl named Nina, who wishes that the person she\'d fall in love with would fight for her and defend her. The fighting and defending part actually came in right away because everyone else in the competition is after her now, so there\'s barely a moment of peace for her. Ending was a little strange, could remain open for a season 2, but I highly doubt it.Artwork, everyone in the show looked like little kids, what can I say. I\'m fairly certain all of them are at least like 13 or 14, but they look like 11 and 12 year olds, so it was kind of hard to remember, ""Oh yeah, they\'re teenagers"". That and the bright colors everywhere made it seem like something found on Cartoon Network. Just think Bakugan and Pokemon, you\'ll remember some of the colors from that show and know what I\'m talking about.Sound, ehh... the only actress that made it worth watching was Brittney Karbowski\'s voice. Not her BEST work, but still good. All the rest of the characters had awesome voice actors and actresses, but they didn\'t suit the character\'s personalities.Characters... not much to say about them. They were fairly unoriginal. Their looks, hair styles, clothing, all of them I\'ve seen before, but Nina\'s hair and Forte\'s outfit were the only thing\'s I\'ve never seen anywhere else. Characters were lovable in some way, like San and Forte, they\'re a good team, and Nina and Zero make a good couple, I mean it\'s obvious they\'re both into eachother, so why not.I enjoyed the show overall, got some good laughs, especially the spa episode, I was laughing so hard, and I felt bad for Zero like the entire episode. It could have been better if they changed a few things, but it was good.

I've seen it a few times since the initial viewing, and I swear it just gets worse and worse everytime you watch it.First of all, the sound is meh, the animation is pretty bad, and the story is mediocre at best and has been done much better in better shows.Honestly there isn't much to talk about other than characters.For one, I hate Nina. I don't care that she's 12, she's whiney, annoying, stupid, and never shuts up. She also gets herself into so much trouble constantly. She's also selfish and a bad role model. All...of this is a shame, because I actually think she has a cute design...Zero is okay.

Her parents asked her to go down to Earth and stay there. She now lives with a human girl who runs an antique shop. The anime is mostly about the cat god and her fellow gods spending time together and getting into some trouble along the way.People would’ve probably just passed through this anime and didn’t give it a second look. I kind of understand because this anime is a bit dull and plain. An anime released in 2011...shouldn’t be dull and plain yet this anime remarkably is. There is nothing in this anime that you haven’t seen before and almost all of its elements worked against it.The one big problem about this anime is that the first episode introduced all the characters and it already had an already established status quo. The cat god, Mayu, was kicked out of her house in heaven but the next scene we see is her in a house with a girl. So there was a time leap and the anime kind of just told us that the events in between wasn’t important but it actually is. Out come a bunch of characters who casually speaks to one another as if they’ve been introduced already but they weren’t. The anime immediately told viewers that this is what we have: a bunch of characters talking to one another. It’s now the viewer’s job to catch up with the anime. Most first episodes start out strong with an exciting premise but this anime opened with a yawner that will hardly interest you. The one thing that made me want to watch about this anime though is the way the characters interact with each other.  I’m not saying it’s great but there is some pretty impressive blending here. Also, I don’t judge on first impressions. “This anime will get better” is what I said to myself.This anime will only start to get good though after the third episode. Like I said, the character interaction is it’s only saving grace. The story is non-episodic and they come off as a bit predictable. Why watch an anime if you already know how it will end? This anime is of the Comedy genre and it’s flat. It most certainly won’t make you laugh. Believe me, I tried and forced to laugh but it won’t. It’s just too simple to even try and make you laugh. Even the characters are a bit flat because they didn’t have a proper introduction. There are a lot of negative aspects in this anime that it overwhelms its good parts. This anime is just meant to be watched for simple fun and nothing else. Oh, don’t marathon it as well. It won’t do you any good and you’re just punishing yourself.The episodes have some basic set up to them and they are mostly divided into three types. The first type is episodes about a random god and some trouble it causes on the characters. Just like the first episode, the characters are scrambling to chase off the god of poverty that wandered into their town. The second type is the simple kind of episodes where the characters just hang out and do random things together. There are episodes like telling ghost stories or helping a mangaka with her work. I like these episodes because the characters play off each other and their individual charm gets to shine for a while. The third type of episode is about Mayu and her relationship with Yuzu, the human girl who owns the house she lives in. These episodes are particularly deep because they explore some dramatic moments of their relationship like the incidents after Yuzu’s parents die and the events on how they first met. This is the special part of the anime but you first must not over think the anime and just have fun while watching.The character design is simple. I actually like this kind of design because the simplicity makes the characters more pleasing to look at. If you look closely too, some of the characters have some big boobs on them. I love how some fan service is able to make its way on the character design. It has some “moe” on some of the characters as well. They were cute and they were paired with some cute voices. The outfits are pretty nice as well. There is a large range of outfits in the anime from simple shrine maiden clothes to some frilly dresses.Overall Score6/10 “It’s a pretty nice anime if you want to just sit back and relax and just enjoy some silly random fun.”The anime is OK.

Papuwa,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2501/Papuwa,"[""When I was 12 years old I went to fye and looked at anime and found a lot of really underrated anime which also came from exploring animes to watch next. One day at fye I found papuwa. I only found the first three volumes watched those and I thought it was the whole thing until I saw a preview for the next episode. After years of finding it I finally went online and got them when I was 14. Ever sense then I've been thinking what made this anime entertaining and why it stuck out to me and why is it so underrated?I haven't...seen the original papuwa kun anime but this one basically told you what happened before.So today I will be reviewing papuwa.Story 7/10The story was unique in a lot of ways. Basically before this one kotaro explodes the papuwa island and comes back later and older with amnesia. So liquid changed his name on his underwear to rotaro which in simpler ways of explaining コko to ロro. So kotaro or the newly named rotaro can't argue with his underwear so that's his name and what happens is other people go to the island to find him and get him back but instead live their.Art 8/10The art style and character design were very good because its colorful and fun to look at. But the animation was OK it wasn't horrible it was just normal looking.Sound 8/10Originally I gave the sound a 6/10 but I forgot about the english dub. The english dub was AMAZING, the voices were fitting for each character the acting and emotion in the voices were solid and it was amazing in its quality. The good dub aside, I thought the opening and ending songs were good but not great. The the soundtrack was a little forgettable.Character 8/10This is one of the parts that makes me surprised the anime is so unknown because the character cast was one of the most entertaining to watch. I feel like the interactions with each character was great. I liked almost every character. Plus a lot of the characters were really memorable too. But one thing that bothers me is the anime totally ignored introducing the names of the characters sometimes .Enjoyment 7/10Despite all the good things I said i think i enjoyed this less than i thought i would I laughed a lot it was good too. But sometimes I felt like i want enjoying to the most of it because i feel like I grew out of being a big fan of comedy. But something took away my enjoyment that I just don't know. Sorry i can't because I just don't know I could think of a few theories but I cant always be sure.Overall 7/10I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good crazy comedy with a story. I would also say that you should watch it to know you've watched something really underrated but I think overall it was a good series that shouldn't be taken to seriously seen the original papuwa kun anime but this one basically told you what happened before.So today I will be reviewing papuwa.Story 7/10The story was unique in a lot of ways. Basically before this one kotaro explodes the papuwa island and comes back later and older with amnesia. So liquid changed his name on his underwear to rotaro which in simpler ways of explaining コko to ロro. So kotaro or the newly named rotaro can't argue with his underwear so that's his name and what happens is other people go to the island to find him and get him back but instead live their.Art 8/10The art style and character design were very good because its colorful and fun to look at. But the animation was OK it wasn't horrible it was just normal looking.Sound 8/10Originally I gave the sound a 6/10 but I forgot about the english dub. The english dub was AMAZING, the voices were fitting for each character the acting and emotion in the voices were solid and it was amazing in its quality. The good dub aside, I thought the opening and ending songs were good but not great. The the soundtrack was a little forgettable.Character 8/10This is one of the parts that makes me surprised the anime is so unknown because the character cast was one of the most entertaining to watch. I feel like the interactions with each character was great. I liked almost every character. Plus a lot of the characters were really memorable too. But one thing that bothers me is the anime totally ignored introducing the names of the characters sometimes .Enjoyment 7/10Despite all the good things I said i think i enjoyed this less than i thought i would I laughed a lot it was good too. But sometimes I felt like i want enjoying to the most of it because i feel like I grew out of being a big fan of comedy. But something took away my enjoyment that I just don't know. Sorry i can't because I just don't know I could think of a few theories but I cant always be sure.Overall 7/10I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good crazy comedy with a story. I would also say that you should watch it to know you've watched something really underrated but I think overall it was a good series that shouldn't be taken to seriously"", ""Before I start I will say that you should watch this Dubbed. The Japanese voice actors are good enough, but I feel that you only get the energy that the comedy requires from the American ones. It might also seem silly that I would rate this show a 10 out of 10 too and you would probably be right, because this show doesn't look good, it doesn't have a deep and interesting story, and to be honest the jokes probably wouldn't even be funny half the time if it weren't for the dub. Yet I not only enjoy Papuwa, but I adore it, I adore...it enough to put this on my favorites list, and not because the show is as flashy and stylish as something like Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei or Bakemonogatari, not because its as deep as Cowboy Bebop or Serial Experiments Lane, but because it makes me feel good.This anime is fun to watch, and that is what makes this a 10. For starters the characters are all very strange. Not only is the main villain (or what could pass as the main villain as they're isn't really a central villain) a man who's anxiety is so extreme that he practices his lines to a wooden posing doll, but one of the goals of the main character is to become the most beautiful boy in the world.  Then there is the variety and admittedly large cast of side characters that each get an ample amount of screen time to give you an idea of what they are like, or at the very least what their gimmick is but that in itself gives them some personality where other anime have characters that have no personality despite their gimmick. Then the large cast of sort-of villains have their own unique quirks that get built upon and give them personality as well.Now before I  get too carried away, I will briefly explain the plot: The main character Kotaro suddenly awakens from a deep slumber some time after the events of the first series, and yes it is a sequel series but you don't need to read the first manga series (there is a show but as far as I know it hasn't been subbed at all) to know what has gone on as the show explains at the beginning that Kotaro destroyed the first Papuwa island (where the events of the first series took place) and now through the magic of a blue and red orb a new island was born where the second series takes place. Kotaro then escapes the place where he was being kept and through a series of events lands on the second Papuwa island where he meets Papuwa, a boy who become his best friend and Liquid the man maid, who looks after him. After that the series is fairly episodic and needs to be seen to be believed.Sure, maybe this isn't going to be someone's 10/10, maybe you'll even hate it, but I've watched this series several times over, and I still feel the same about it as when I first saw it. It's a comedy at heart, so the show is only as good as you believe the comedy is, and no amount of explaining is going to help you laugh at them. I've probably talked too much too, and the only reason I unloaded everything like this was because no one saw this, no one, and that's a shame.For those who just skim towards the bottom: It's not deep, it's not beautiful, it may not even be funny to some people, but it has heart, and so does the manga its based on, so watch it please, and read the manga obviously. it enough to put this on my favorites list, and not because the show is as flashy and stylish as something like Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei or Bakemonogatari, not because its as deep as Cowboy Bebop or Serial Experiments Lane, but because it makes me feel good.This anime is fun to watch, and that is what makes this a 10.

I gotta tell you dudes, this anime was pure stupid.I mean good stupid in which some of it nearly made me break my jaw and nearly peed my pants from laughing at the jokes on the anime....Seriously the English Dub cast were top notch in this anime like seriously, things they came out with was just so clever! I think Paul Sidello and Eric Opella who played the fish with the hairy fish net human legs and the snail were one of...the best characters. Their Cross-gender acting skills (thanks wiki) just impressed me!Even tho I'm not a fan of this anime in its art but it is entertaining and fun to watch. In fact, I didn't realise it was a sequel but I'm not gonna be arsed checking the first one out tbh lol..Anyways folks, watch this anime if you wanna waste time and in desperate need for a laugh at total nonsense! the best characters.

I stumbled across a lot of anime back then, but THIS is the one that stuck with me the most. I consider it a critical part of who I am, not only as a person, but also as a writer.It's your traditional Gag Manga, with an underlying plot. The plot isn't especially well-done or written, but it's fun and...it helps amplify the amazingly fun cast of characters. The plot also isn't especially clear in this sequel, and I'd highly suggest to read Nangoku Shounen Papuwa-kun first before watching this. It helps clear up the plot better than the brief synopsis in this anime, especially concerning Kotaro, Shintaro, Kintaro, Jan, (Gion Kamen) Arashiyama, and Liquid.Also, due to the fact the manga for this sequel is untranslated, the full story isn't readily available to english speakers, and you're left with the rushed ending from the anime. And trust me, there's a LOT more to the story that the anime doesn't get the chance to touch upon. Maybe one day.... One day. ( I've been saying 'one day' for over 10 years now )This is a series very near and dear to my heart, and if I could, I'd make a full-blown essay on how great Shibata Ami and her works are. But I'll spare everyone that, and just say, hey! If you like stupid gag anime and manga, then give this a shot!

Orient,https://myanimelist.net/anime/45560/Orient,"['If I have to sum Orient in one sentence, it would be this: A prolific mangaka\'s fall from grace, and what worse than karma to make a horrible adaptation out of it.If you have absolutely no idea who mangaka Shinobu Ohtaka is, go do yourself a service to read and watch Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic series. For anyone whom has even heard and/or seen Magi (yours truly included), most of them would consider the series to be the her crème de la crème, pièce de résistance of a work, and to think that it has been almost 10 years (as of this review) with...Magi\'s anime adaptation starting in 2012, wow, life must feel so long. And let\'s not forget her first series of Sumomomo, Momomo in the mid-2000s, that only now exists as a footnote in her biography work that\'s completely overshadowed by Magi.Come this year, and we have her newest series: Orient, which started in 2018, and features the same Shonen tropes as per similar counterparts like Hiroyuki Takei\'s Shaman King (which the recent complete adaptation of a reboot is more rushed and boring than the unfaithful-but-better 2001 adaptation) and Yuki Tabata\'s Black Clover (which I admit that it has the same problems as Orient at the very beginning), all with the same unchanging beautiful art style. Except...let\'s repeat Black Clover\'s problems with Pierrot and make it ""double the trouble"" with outdated studio A.C.G.T which produced the horrible, lambasting and lamentable Dies Irae done from 2017-2018! For such a dated studio whose work on the Freezing! series during the early 2010s is the best that it could muster, that says quite a lot.But let\'s not speedrun our way through Orient. There\'s gotta be a place to start, and that\'s with the ludicrous story that is just a copy-paste from Black Clover, change some things here and there to make it look more Magi-like, and why not incorporating stuff like a motorcycle to make it feel modern at least!  Honestly, reading this in manga form just felt so awkward, and finally watching it in anime form only solidified the fact that for such a series to have a bad start, this to me, just feels like Black Clover all over again. I mean, for a story set in the Sengoku period with demons/Oni called ""Kishin"" and samurai called Bushi that travel in groups called Bushi bands lead by leaders with their family names on display, it\'s pure expected typical Shonen that rests on its execution to deliver, and oh boy, the execution...let\'s just say that it doesn\'t exist at all. Even when the anime is following the manga\'s first few volumes to adapt, which is really a rough start for investment values because of time constraints, I\'d say that Black Clover has the edge overall from broadcasting in the same TV station (TV Tokyo) but on the more suitable Shonen dinner timeslot that everyone can watch (6~7 p.m.) as opposed to airing this at midnight in Japan, much less working with only 12 episodes to boot.The characters feel so dated, and that\'s not for the lack of trying. The worst offender of MC protag-kun Musashi feels like Asta but doesn\'t have the likability of Aladdin, Kojiro Kanemaki is a more depressed and downcast version of Alibaba, and Tsugumi Hattori like Morigana, is cheerful and forgiving, but has severe personality issues when faced with adversity. Couldn\'t even bother to name the other characters because they are so one-note-ish, and taking Tsugumi\'s oppressor Hideo Kosameda for example, he\'s leading his Kosameda Band of what looks like a population of retirees with children, only to be a manipuative asshole to the people serving under him, including Tsugumi to instill fear within the people that both Musashi and Kojiro would ultimately save them from his fear of oppression. Sorry for the spoilers there, but I could not for the life of me, fathom how shallow the character writing has gotten to this stage, and to experience it TWICE from reading the manga and now watching the inferior anime adaptation, that\'s kinda of a low-blow.I\'ve already gushed how absymal the animation is, heck, I\'d rather read the crappy story and experience it with Shinobu Ohtaka\'s amazing art style, which is something that she is very consistent in the manga. But to think that High School DxD and Seireitsukai no Blade Dance a.k.a Blade Dance of the Elementalers director Tetsuya Yanagisawa is directing this adaptation, that honestly cuts the knife deeper for me to see that how did such an esteemed director like him could go off the rails THIS BAD. Honest to god, I\'d expect at least he would do some changes being in a directorial position, but he didn\'t do much to save this god-awful adaptation. Even with series composer Mariko Kunisawa whom did a fantastic job with Honzuki no Gekokujou a.k.a Ascendance of a Bookworm, she did some things that made the watching experience better, even if by a tad bit. What in the world...The music fares no better either. J-Pop boy band Da-iCE isn\'t a remarkable group to say the least, and their Oricon singles charts since their debut in 2014 only peaked best at No. 2 since then. Even so, their OP here is just typical Shonen one pony hat-trick fanfare, it gets old really fast, and I REALLY mean it. Also, it\'s weird how Wataru Hatano\'s ED song just doesn\'t fit at all, being yet again like a song meant for disposition use when nothing works. Don\'t get me wrong, I love it as a standalone song, but incorporating together with the anime just...felt so strange and off-putting, not to mention the RGB influence on a PowerPoint slide show of a lazily-put ED.Not every Shonen anime these days needs to come close to Demon Slayer or even Jujutsu Kaisen levels of treatment for enjoyment, just a better execution and a better staff team (not to mention a better animation studio) could\'ve just worked things right. And sadly for Orient, as much as I would want to say that Shinobu Ohtaka kinda shot herself on the foot for the basis of her new manga, it just feels so out of touch with the modern Shonen juggernauts these days, and I would like to have you believe that her best days are certainly behind her. Even as a work just to earn enough for a rice bowl, it\'ll only take another season for Orient to really show off what it\'s capable of, and this prologue just didn\'t cut it at all.Magi, until the absurd final moments, at least it was a good ride. But for Orient, you could have been a good post-Magi effort...but this is what we got. Just an immeasurable disappointment that could\'ve been much better being in the hands of capable people. See you again in Summer with the The Battle of Awaji Island arc. Magi\'s anime adaptation starting in 2012, wow, life must feel so long.

But in my opinion, the execution of the last few episodes managed to change things, from Plot Hole to Cliffhanger which will keep you glued to see what happens next, and I think this is a good thing.Characterization; 8,97The MC attitude that not everyone thinks about, but worth it and manages to make a good first impression. Finally came the MC whose problem was not whether...he was naive or not, this anime MC was presented with his intelligent and sensitive nature to the situation which I appreciated.Character Design; 8,86The modern concept of samurai edo, a unique and difficult concept to digest. Good looking and waifuable characters make me feeling enjoyed watching this anime.Visual; 9,20A clear visual presentation that not many people talk about. Where are the visual team people?? sure you missed watching this anime? geek hypocrite. Let's watch this anime, guaranteed not to regret.Also blehh for people who forget about visuals when trying to rate this anime. PUCEK MENNAudio; 8,76Good sound quality above average adds to the enjoyment aspect of watching this anime. Nice songs to listen to, appropriate voice actors for each character, etc.I respect people's opinions and I hope you guys also respect my opinion of defending this anime as a good anime.

CHEERS MATE,RESPECT!"", ""Orient is a show where the source material is just extremely awful crap but then we get the anime. It's even worse. Why you ask? The anime is worse because, it has awful animation. And the only reason why I got some enjoyment out of the Orient manga was because of its art which was fucking brilliant and carried the entire manga at the beginning.Though for those liking Orient or finding it even decent, I have some good and bad news for you. The good being, the manga gets drastically better and more original and the bad well is that one of the upcoming...arc has literally almost no focus on the main character. Though the arc just ended and we are past that point so yeah. I don't think this manga is completely hopeless right now, it might become decent or at least be much better.Let's get to this.Story basically. Every fricking thing here is either been used in an old shonen or is a completely copy pasted and over used idea. Nothing original and I am NOT stretching this. Absolutely not. It is full of boring and predictable clichés. It adds nothing new to anything. The entire concept is super stupid. How do humans end up being stupid enough to worship the monsters that once they hated. And why did the whole bushi are the bad guys thing came in. Random and extremely bad story. Its super garbage even from shonen standards. Trust me, this type of plot and story does nothin but make me laugh my ass off even in th serious moments. What a joke. WHAT A JOKE.Oh boy, this is where it gets worse. Let me tell you something, I enjoy the Orient manga more than the KnY manga. And I would have loved the Orient anime more than KnY if it had gotten the same ufotable treatment. No, it's not necessary to have that kind of anime but if it were even decent, I wouldn't have had much of a problem. But the problem is that it is an extremely cheap project with garbage animation and no passion put into it. The bigger problem is that the manga has some extremely hard to animate scenes but seeing how they are handling scenes as simple as walking just makes me do nothing but loose every expectation of them pulling that right. You have a scene where the main character is killing a oni and his weapon goes through the oni and oh boy, that scene has blurry art and animation, the blood is not shown properly, the action is super weak.The opening theme is fun, it gives you the fun old shonen feel, didn't hate it. The ending too, was nice. Nothing special in the music or visuals but it wasn't bad, at least the music. Nothing outstanding too, keep in mind. But listening to it constantly just doesn't have the same effect as the first few times, you don't feel the energy, this is something the opening should DO because two reasons:1. Orient is a fun and energetic shonen manga.2. Most shonen nail the music and be fun to listen to even on constant watches, so orient not being able to do it is very weird.Characters...oof. Nothing original or unique. Every characters personality is soo overused and Orient is not only using many concepts again, but it adds nothing new to it. You have your usual sad back story guy, the cheerful and always happy MC and the your usual girl. Just super bland and uninteresting.Enjoyment, in this anime is NOTHING. You (at least me) can't enjoy it in any goddamn way. Super boring and frustrating to watch. If you are new to anime and don't tend to think critically about an anime, then maybe this is worth it. I am not trying to hate on it for being a cliché shonen but this does everything unoriginal up until now in the anime plus the art and animation suck. My disappointment is immeasurable.Overall, just skip it. Magi was such a good manga until final arc but this... arc has literally almost no focus on the main character. Though the arc just ended and we are past that point so yeah. I don't think this manga is completely hopeless right now, it might become decent or at least be much better.Let's get to this.Story basically.

You have your usual sad back story guy, the cheerful and always happy MC and the your usual girl. Just super bland and uninteresting.Enjoyment, in this anime is NOTHING. You (at least me) can't enjoy it in any goddamn way. Super boring and frustrating to watch. If you are new to anime and don't tend to think critically about an anime, then maybe this is worth it. I am not trying to hate on it for being a cliché shonen but this does everything unoriginal up until now in the anime plus the art and animation suck. My disappointment is immeasurable.Overall, just skip it. Magi was such a good manga until final arc but this..."", ""I know this was going to be a bad one when I heard it was going to get an adaptation, albeit half of my resolve came from curiosity, it is such a shame to say that even when the source disappoints, the staff had the brilliant idea to make it worse.Story: 2/10Messy and convoluted, is what best describes Orient at the moment. The lore of Orient manages to be confusing and contradicting with bizarre powers that don't explain what it does, strange plot conveniences come out of nowhere, and disruptive pacing. At times, it gets super boring and dreadful to handle, but once something starts...to become intriguing, it abruptly stops with characters doing immediate one-shot moves and unclear motivations even after 3 episodes. We get it, you want to become the badass samurai who swore to destroy all demons who reside in your world. This brings us to my next point.Characters: 3/10The main characters are a pain in the ass, I was rolling my eyes when they felt the urge to shout out the childish motivations that strangely stuck with them without going through any development along the way. Whenever things started to get easy for them, they start throwing tantrums and go out there without a care in the world. Keep in mind, I am fine with characters going guns-blazing on the enemy without thinking of consequences IF the characters are appealing and likeable. Well, at least they aren't there for the sake of being nice, work a bit hard, get a bunch of loli harem, and think being nice and OP is a personality.In other words, if you think hard enough, this show is more of watching voice actors showing their amazing talent, rather than a truly immersive story with memorable characters.Art: 4/10The character designs look fine, it made me happy to see the return of Magi's art style once again. At its best, you get a generic shonen that does well enough to entertain you with somewhat delicious designs. However, the animation just wasn't cutting it once episode 2 came out.They made this for the sake of grossing money rather than producing a passionate and heartful creation. I struggled to accept the stiff movements, repetitive actions done numerous times, and doing more poses rather than going for tasty, nut-cracking action. An action anime with this kind of animation infuriates me to the brink of exploding.Enjoyment: 6/10It's pretty bad but there is still some sort of enjoyment you can find in this money-grubbing production. I find it best if you turned off your brain, let the story speak for itself, try your best to not laugh at how much of a terrible joke it is while listening to the voice actors/actresses for 24 minutes. If you like listening to your favourite voice actors, good because this is what it provides you for a good amount of time, don't expect anything amazing or creative. to become intriguing, it abruptly stops with characters doing immediate one-shot moves and unclear motivations even after 3 episodes.

Despite lingering doubts, these two weren’t afraid to rise to the occasion to fight for their people’s liberation.So what’s the verdict for Orient? A strong OK.  It ticks off the general checklist of what you might expect of a shounen series.  It has two childhood friends promising to take on the world together, they drift apart when they get older because...of conflicting differences, etc, etc.  Even though it hits those typical story beats both Musashi and Kojiro are fine protagonists and are acutely aware of the societal limitations placed on them.I do appreciate the show’s acknowledgment that Musashi and Kojiro have different life experiences, which makes it easy to understand why Kojiro feels resigned to his fate while Musashi is ready to fight for their future.  Musashi didn’t have to deal with his hometown’s discriminatory attitudes towards him, while Kojiro did since he comes from a long line of rebel warriors.  Kojiro knows what’s at stake and has every right to be cautious since they both could end up killed.  Seriously, they are just a couple of good boys trying to look out for each other in an unfair world.It’s almost eerie seeing how quickly humanity was indoctrinated to be servile to their demon overlords while the bushi (human warriors) are seen as the “villains.”  I’m sure there is a competent demon hierarchy that we just haven’t seen yet, but until then look at the funny cat demons below:It’s also worth noting that the series composer is Kunisawa Mariko, who’s also known for writing a number of episodes for Ascendance of a Bookworm so that probably explains why the systematic oppression themes are handled adequately.  Aside from that, the power of friendship won the day and our protagonists rode off together into the sunset with their motorcycle crystal hybrid.Based on the opening and ending theme, it seems the duo will become a trio in the future and I’m honestly hoping she’s going to have character depth instead of being a damsel in distress.  If Jujutsu Kaisen has taught me anything, it’s that we can have well-written women characters that can absolutely kick-ass too.  At this point in the game, there isn’t any excuse for other shounen titles to not follow suit.if folks are looking for a standard shounen show to watch then check it out and see if you like it. of conflicting differences, etc, etc.  Even though it hits those typical story beats both Musashi and Kojiro are fine protagonists and are acutely aware of the societal limitations placed on them.I do appreciate the show’s acknowledgment that Musashi and Kojiro have different life experiences, which makes it easy to understand why Kojiro feels resigned to his fate while Musashi is ready to fight for their future.

Unlike Magi with their 72 djinns and their city-destroying power, you can count such characters in Orient with your own hands, which means very small in number. Orient strongly emphasizes in power chain/constellation as shown in eps 3 to beat the greater enemies, because individually most bushis aren't that strong.You all should also notice the different colours in the opening, ending, or poster. It's not just colour, it's part of the power system and how they would be placed effectively within...a constellation, which makes Orient more interesting.This idea support what bushi are in real life, a samurai group who works together as one. a constellation, which makes Orient more interesting.This idea support what bushi are in real life, a samurai group who works together as one."", ""Once upon a time, we were graced by the mind of Shinobu Ohtaka. She introduced us to the world of Magi, a fantasy adventure filled with mystery, personality, and of course magic. Flashforward several years later and here we are with her new work, Orient. It's another fantasy adventure taking place in a historical period.Even if you're not familiar with the author's works, Orient should hit no different for its elements of fantasy and adventure. We are dropped into a world where the lands is ruled by supernatural demons, known more commonly as Oni. Soon, we meet Musashi, a young boy who vows to...change the world by defeating the demons and becoming a Bushi, warriors who fights against the supernatural demons and perhaps humanity's last hope for survival. From the very start, it's clear that Orient decorated itself to be what it intended. From our main protagonists to its world setting, there's never been a time where viewers should feel caught off guard.Shinobu's ideas and personality are also infused with the two main protagonists. Similar to Alibaba from Magi, Musashi demonstrates a determined personality but also full of cheerfulness. It is because of his easygoing nature that allows him to make friends, such as with Kojiro and Tsugumi. As one of his closest friends, Kojiro's competitive nature brings out the best of both characters. Similar to Musashi, his kind nature also allows himself to earn friends. On the contrary, Tsugumi enters the show with a mischievous nature and in essence, one of the lesser trustworthy characters. Over time, she overcomes her inner demons thanks to Musashi and Kojiro's influence.At some point early on in the show, you're going to ask yourself if it's worth watching beyond the first three episodes. Ah yes, the universial 3-episode rule falls into this category because Orient itself can also be somewhat of an a niche anime. Watching Orient tells a fantasy adventure but some off its themes and characteristics can rub viewers in the wrong way. For instance, not everyone will appreciate Shinobu's style of cheeky humor. The way this show depicts its comedy often comes off as cartoony and almost childish at times. Then, we can't forget our main protagonists, who despite having some deep background stories receives minimal character developmet this season. With just 12 episodes, the anime only scratches the surface at characterizing our cast. Musashi and Kojiro are characters that really doesn't invent much to their basic personalities. It appears that Shinobu didn' take much risk at creating the two main leads. On the other hand, I do enjoy Tsugumi's presence in the anime, as she is much more unpredictable. She adds the context of being a vulnerable girl in a dangerous world but uses her own advantages to survive. And to add more flavor to the show, she has her own background story although the anime verson so far only scratches the surface. What it does show the audience is her important relationship with her sister.With this season, I would like to say that Orient is an example of being a show with a colorful potential. What holds the anime back is sadly, the length. Let's face it, 12 episode is far from enough to cover an ongoing manga that has been running over 100 chapters. The directors obviously wanted us to get hooked into the franchise with its cast, story, and mysteries. Speaking of which, we do meet perhaps one of the most mysterious character this season by the name of Shirou Inukai. What he seeks is a mystery and it makes us scratch our heads about his purpose. This season doesn't fully explore his character or story but he does make a prominent presence. As with the case of Orient, we want to learn how the pieces of this show fits together, like a puzzle. At the heart of this anime, the author wants us to embrace its story, set in such a mysterious world.I won't be the last to say it but A.C.G.T had a handful of mediocre projects in recent years. It seems the studio adapts various media but never lands into mainstream popularity. Orient is another example. If we judge by its art style, the show pretty much designates itself as an average production. Character designs does reflect well with its manga counterparts but there's nothing particularly flashy about them. Similarly, the supernatural demons in this show seems to be loosely based on Japanese folklore, but most of them fits into the realm of mediocrity. It's as if you've seen it once, you've seen them all. The action scenes are perhaps the best part of the show with its colorful chereography. However, Orient's animation style isn't exactly star caliber by today's anime industry standards.It has been a rather short journey for this season and 12 episodes won't cut it. Orient practically yells for the audience to check out the manga if you're hungry for more.

It has those things you may want from your shounen: bit of tragedy, some back stories and flashbacks, a couple fights and situations that make characters come out stronger. But in the end, you know damn well it isn't really that good. Can it potentially hit a spot if you’re desperate? sure. But um. Anime isn't fast food. You have options here, so there isn't much of a point to watch this.But to actually explain what this even is, we have a world where demons exist and are thought of as gods, and the...Samurai that fight to protect people from them are shunned. The MC is a miner who's friends with the son of a samurai, the only one in town, and he has a dream of being a samurai himself. There's nothing too special about the premise or it's execution. Sure, I won't pretend everything that happened was obvious, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was good. The world is not particularly interesting either. Everything looks the same, and it's all desert-like and boring which doesn't help. But all that being said, that doesn't mean this is bad. As I said, it does have the basics that you would more or less expect. The issue is that that is all this has. It feels more like the show is trying to hit a checklist of what this should be, rather than actually provide an interesting story. Samurai that fight to protect people from them are shunned.

The pacing however is probably the worst part. its like it is trying to copy the older anime's pacing which is not what most new new anime's do. Another Bad Thing is the animation. The art and drawings are beautiful yet for some reason the animation is chopped up instead...of flowing it draws me away from fights which is bad for a shounen. however the story is still good enough to keep me entertained; in the manga especially.

Is that Orient is a show that takes some getting used to. But once you're used to it, you're hooked, and you are ready for more and more. That is what happened to me when it comes to this show. There is a lot to appreciate from this show, from how the characters seemingly are, to how the action develops, to more world exploring stuff that is just a sight to see. Though that might just be me, looking for my fix after finishing Gintama. This show isn't that, but it certainly packs a punch.Imagine.Two friends. Two childhood...friends in, Musashi and Kojirou Kanemaki, make a promise that once they grew up, they would become samurai, form a league, and go on demon-slaying quests. But since then, things have changed. With demons now being praised and worshipped by society, the samurai are shunned and disgraced. Which is what really gave off the Gintama vibes for me. But what got to me, is the characters themselves that progress through the story.Musashi can seem like a real hero at times, but also can seem like too much a dare devil for his own good. While Kojirou can seem more cautious, and both in their own right can have their own realistic approach to these larger than live beings in demons that seem to be unbeatable by their standards. Which does promote a bit more good in terms of it's writing. They're not suddenly able to destroy them so easliy, like a power fantasy. The growth feels way more natural here. It really does. We've still got a more vide cast to cover too. There are so many interesting characters that make their presence, which is only a good thing in the long run. Along with how their dynamics really all mesh well together, to make for a good watch.The art as I said looks real nice. The battles don't seem cluncky or weird. They look great. Along with the overall theme during these battles. Top notch stuff all round. You can tell that they tried real hard when it comes to making it look really good like this.

Like there are some very nice touches when it comes to it's style and how it all looks. Very great stuff. From the clothing, the animation and movement of things. To how the lighting of everything starts looking.Orient again is a show that takes getting used to. But it's certainly one to watch for sure."", ""This is your typical shonen with all the tropes you'd expect from it. Not that bad just to kill the time (and certainly better than the manga counterpart), but don't expect much more from it.It's from the same author as Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic and suffers the same problems, but overall I prefer Magi.This keeps telling me to write a longer review but honestly I don't know what else to say. I'll try anyway.Yeah the story is nonsensical. Yeah the characters are your standard shonen kit. Yeah some story arcs are super long, the latest covering like 7 volumes of manga.

Now the concepts itself are pretty good but yes, they still need to give it some effort.The sound is pretty good cus I believe they choose good sound effects, good actors, and good songs. It matches the characters and story pretty well.The characters...are pretty well done. The red hair in Musashi for example. Red can symbolize passion, love, anger, and heat. Which also is the color of his soul. Then we have his friend Kojiro. Blonde hair but a blue and white attire. His soul is blue and that is considered average and the support. He also happens to support both Tsugumi and Masashi. Then we Tsugumi who has green hair and a green soul. She holds the enemy and she is very good at that in her character too.The reason I enjoyed this series is because the story is promising.

There is very little to say about these 12 episodes, even much less that can be positive. At the end it teases the viewers by revealing that it just the beginning of a large story. And yet, I feel very little reason to keep going despite the announcement that this series will continue this coming Summer season. The first 3 episodes are easily the worst.

Tragically, she has slowly become more and more irrelevant, and stops having any real use to the series besides just the occasional fan service that gets shoved in the viewers faces. She has now been reduced to a background character that constantly gets scared, boringly explains what is happening, and embarrassingly breaks the 4th wall. She is strangely confused with how to make use of her sex appeal and tries her best to make her constant single frame presented sister proud.Afterwards, the series begins to focus on the development of Musashi.

The story starts really getting good at episode 5 so if anyone says the story is dry or that you shouldn\'t watch it check how many episodes they have watched.Personally I\'m a sucker for shounen and these characters fit shounen so well. But its not the current shounen personality its the more nostalgic ones. Every time i see a character like Shiro or Nanao on screen i get so excited because of Shirou\'s childishness and Nanaos ""big sis"" like nature even though we...see little of them its still fun to watch. I also like how all 3 of the MC\'s are socially awkward just like me XD.The animation is lacking a lot but that\'s what\'s expected when a not well known studio adapts a manga. I do love the art style thoughI LOVE THE OP AND THE MUSIC THAT PLAYS IN FIGHTS ITS AMAZING. i study music and the op of orient is so good. When learning about Musashi and his past the music (like most) reflects the mood he is feeling as he is tormented by what he did.I enjoyed it so much that id rate the enjoyment a ten IF the first episodes weren\'t so boring so nine it is.Anyways overall Id say an 8. see little of them its still fun to watch.

I'll mainly focus on the story and characters as the other categories aren't really worth talking about as they are just kinda there.Story: The story is your typical shounen story with typical story beats. MC has a dream to be the best at something, faces ridicule for having such a dream, proves on a small level that...the dream is obtainable, and goes on a journey with friends pursuing that dream. The actual setting for the story is what piqued my interest when looking at previews. The magic/combat system seems interesting at the surface and could potentially be unique, however, the pacing feels really off. I have not read the source material, but it feels like the anime has cut out a lot of details that would compliment the slow pace. There are attempts at world-building but it feels repetitive since either the same information is conveyed again or the amount of time spent on a subject is way longer than what we learn. The actual story progression also feels extremely slow. While watching, I could guess what general events would occur given what typically happens in shounen, but it would take an unnecessarily long time to get there. This has become very evident with the latest arc progressing at a snail's pace. To be fair, the source material could have the same pacing issues and the anime may not have cut much out, but I can't be sure.Characters: The characters in the story also fall into the typical shounen molds one would expect, but they are still enjoyable to watch. Similar to the issues with the story, the characters are not given very much to do other than delivering exposition. Of course, the characters have their moments and there are signs of development, but the pacing of the story really holds the characters back and can make them slightly stale at times. The characters are at their best when interacting together and not conversing to just progress the story forward.TLDR: Orient is an anime that is certainly watchable if you are a fan of shounen anime and are just looking for something to watch. If you can tolerate bad pacing, extremely slow story progression, and cliche characters and story beats, then Orient is worth a watch. If you are looking for a great story or something unique in the genre, I would recommend passing on it. the dream is obtainable, and goes on a journey with friends pursuing that dream.

Reeks of bad writers.Ninja but on motorcycle.. okBut what annoyed me the most is the constant flashbacks to justify a storyline. Episode two, 2 minutes in and a long flashback.. followed by another and another.It was annoying. The story seems rushed and things are simply accepted as they are, would be fine it if was comedy but they are serious.Freaking first demon enemy they fight, strong enough to smash them. Choses to gently drag the guy by its sword, then instead of killing him.. slaps him away. Why? No reason, just so main characters are not dying and we get...that stupid flashback sword story. Fights dont make no sense,  the characters actions dont make sense and its not even trying to be funny in that sense. Its just bad writting that stupid flashback sword story.

It’s animation is sloppy and the story plus world building fall apart if you think about it too much. However, if you’re looking for a show that reminds you of early episodes of Naruto then you may have a good time with this one.The story follows Musashi and Kojirou who want to become magic samurai warriors known as “Bushi” so they can form their own clan and go and kill weird, alien demons so they can escape mining slavery. Later they meet Tsugumi who joins them after Musashi and Kojirou learn that...not all Bushi clans are necessary good and that Tsugumi has big boobies so they can go to hunt more demons. Okay, I admit that I may have watered down the plot a bit, but if you’re looking for an interesting, philosophical, coming of age story about demon slayers then you’re better of watching the hundreds of better written shows out there on the topic, one of them is literally called Demon Slayer.However, even though it’s story and animation are lacking I will admit that I did enjoy my time with Orient. There’s a certain charm that shines through all the bullshit and very bad discrimination metaphors and I think it comes down to the three leads. I really like Musashi, Kojirou and Tsugumi. They all have really good character chemistry with each other and although some of the writing is a bit naff, some of their joking around and banter got legit laughs out of me. I especially really like the episode when they all set out together, but have no idea how to handle the new dynamic which leads to some very funny misunderstandings. I like the arcs they go through too. Even though Musashi’s character arc is a bit more ridiculous then the other two, it is very satisfying to watch them overcome their individual trials so that they may form a better team.I also really like some of the designs of things in the world like the weird crystal motorbikes that they refer to as horses and the floating crystal Bushi fortresses. Even some of the Demons look pretty cool.Orient will not be everyones thing in fact it has a lot going against it. Considering the behemoths the show was up against this winter season the second part slated for summer has a tough road ahead if it wants to keep interest.

An Anime about Onis, which are monsters that took over the world, and Bushis, the people that fight them. The main goal is to defeat the Onis and get back the freedom they once had.Freeing the World from anything evil is a common storyline of an anime. Its nothing special. So was this anime.Starting off with the quality. The Overall Quality is pretty good. The Animation quality was quite good and it was fun watching the fights, and I liked the character design very much, but as usual the main character sticks out very much. The music is not special in any way,...average I would say. But overall there is nothing to complain about the Quality.Now continueing with the Story. The Story starts pretty slow, what got me bored quickly. So the main character has a goal and that is to defeat the onis. This motivation comes from his ""Stepdad"". At the beginning of the show there is not much explained, you just get to know how the oni and Bushi Bregardes work and that with not many details, which confuses a little but it gets better over time. As I reached the middle of the show I thought of dropping the show because it bored me so much, because the world and setting this anime is in, is boring and not very beautiful. And you didnt know anything about the villains and about the system of the Bushis. But I have to say after you reach Episode 7 it gets better very quick. New interesting Characters get introduced, and you get more information about the villains in this anime, more fights and action. It turns out that the protagonist is pretty strong, which didn\'t look like it at first. That saved me from dropping this show and got me to finish these first 12 episodes. So the second season or part 2 is currently airing but i didnt watch it until now. I hope the action is kept up and they continue to progress with the storyline and especially the villains because the villains are nice in my opinion and I would like to see more of them.I know this isnt a very objective review, but i wanted to describe the watching process in my point of view, maybe it helps someone to decide if it is worth starting this anime or not.So overall I have to give this anime a 6, because the first half ruined the score for me, but with the second half and the quality it comes to a solid 6 out of 10. average I would say.

New interesting Characters get introduced, and you get more information about the villains in this anime, more fights and action. It turns out that the protagonist is pretty strong, which didn\'t look like it at first. That saved me from dropping this show and got me to finish these first 12 episodes. So the second season or part 2 is currently airing but i didnt watch it until now. I hope the action is kept up and they continue to progress with the storyline and especially the villains because the villains are nice in my opinion and I would like to see more of them.I know this isnt a very objective review, but i wanted to describe the watching process in my point of view, maybe it helps someone to decide if it is worth starting this anime or not.So overall I have to give this anime a 6, because the first half ruined the score for me, but with the second half and the quality it comes to a solid 6 out of 10.', ""My complete rating - 8.4Story: This anime started out seeming pretty generic with an upbeat 'quirky' protagonist vowing to be strong and triumph over all his enemies, u know, the shonen/ iseaki standard. However, as you make your way through the story you get a compelling backstory for each of the main cast which delicately illustrates why each character has the motivation and personality traits they portray. This coupled with a cool climax whereabouts certain unanswered questions are given relatively satisfying answers, makes the show very watchable. It then sets up nicely for a season 2.Character design and visuals: Very pretty, the animators did a...good job.Audio: Love the voice actors chosen for this. None of them are annoying, and do a good job of portraying the characters they are given. good job.Audio: Love the voice actors chosen for this.

So, even though I wasn’t seeing a lot of hype being built up around it, I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, this anime fell flat, and other reviews of it seem to agree. The first several episodes of the series feel like they are following a formulaic approach to shounen anime. Boy + Sword + Demon = Good Anime. And while there are several amazing anime featuring a boy with a sword going toe to toe with demons, this...anime seems to have missed the point about what exactly made those anime so entertaining to watch.Maybe the story moved a little too fast for my liking, but Musashi’s journey to become a bushi warrior felt too easy. His friend, Kojirou, forgives Musashi too easily for joining in on his family’s torment. Musashi is able to acquire an oni-slaying blade very easily despite many factors working against him, and he even manages to find a love interest who is genuinely interested in him in record time.If you want to watch a shounen anime where the protagonist faces minimal struggle and an easy ride to victory, I suppose this show is for you. But if you’re really wanting to see a boy do some cool sword moves and take down some demons, you’re better off watching Demon Slayer.4/10. anime seems to have missed the point about what exactly made those anime so entertaining to watch.Maybe the story moved a little too fast for my liking, but Musashi’s journey to become a bushi warrior felt too easy.

Renai Boukun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32262/Renai_Boukun,"[""Death Note is easily one of the most popular and instantly recognisable anime out there, currently sitting at the number one spot here on MAL for the number of members it has. It's a show that has been referenced and parodied time and time again by fans of the show, as well as in other anime. However, Renai Boukun, otherwise known as Love Tyrant, takes it a step further by making an entire show a parody of Death Note itself! And it's completely mediocre, with forced and bland comedy that becomes stale incredibly quickly, a lacklustre cast of characters while, at the same time, hardly...doing anything with its set-up or parody elements. I honestly really wanted to like this, I really did, but each passing episode became even more incredibly bland and dull than the last resulting in an end product that most people will forget in only a couple of months and leaving me with a feeling of genuine disappointment.As I just mentioned, the show is essentially a parody of the series Death Note, but in this instance, the Death Note is now replaced with a new book called the Kiss Note; an extremely powerful tool that, when two names are written inside it next to each other, they will both fall madly in love with each other regardless of the gender, providing that they kiss one another that is. This feature, in particular, comes greatly in use for the yaoi enthusiast,  Guri, a hyperactive idiot cupid whose task is to match up potential couples with each other. However, she accidentally writes the main protagonist's name in the book, by the name of Seiji Anno, and he has to kiss someone otherwise Guri will die (which we later learn is an outright lie). He decides to kiss his crush, who turns out to have a mad obsession with our bland as hell main character here, bordering on Yandere tendencies, pulling out random knives and swords from her tits in the same way a girl may keep her phone down there or something? They eventually do kiss, but Guri makes herself, and Yandere-chan, known as Akane, into a three-way relationship, eventually adding Akane's sister,  Yuzu (who actually loves Akane) into the mix. And that's pretty much it for an overall narrative, which, I believe is fine for a comedy anime as long as the characters are fun and the comedy is funny and varied, which, unfortunately, is something I believe the anime lacks.For starters, let's discuss the wasted potential in the Death Note parody gimmick and set-up of the narrative. Despite being a parody of said series, Love Tyrant hardly utilises the Kiss Note to any substantial merit and the show pretty much forgets about this item throughout much of the duration, which, in my eyes, is wasted potential for some comedic moments. It feels like the Kiss Note was added as a way to make the show more marketable by riding on the popularity of Death Note, rather than being used as satire. There is no clever meta-commentary or callbacks to the actual series either, so the Kiss Note, aside from being used to start the story, feels inconsequential and rather pointless to boot. Not only that, but the comedy, for the most part, feels incredibly weak and trite despite the potential in the first two episode. I'll honestly admit, that the first two episodes of Love Tyrant are actually pretty funny and engaging to boot; I was having a great time with the show. The jokes, at the beginning anyway, felt fresh and they often were more hit than miss, but, as the show progresses, it feels more tiring to watch since they never switch up the dynamics and repeat the same jokes throughout. This makes the show feel so damn repetitive to watch, and repeating the same jokes is essentially a cardinal sin in comedy; it becomes stale by episode five! In addition, the jokes and comedy itself feels extremely forced and most jokes can be seen a mile away before they're even delivered! It doesn't help all too much either that the characters have hardly any chemistry with one another nor do their personalities bounce off each other well either.For the sake of argument, let's compare it to another comedy this year, from the previous season, called Gabriel Dropout. While that show is not a comedic masterpiece or anything, it was able to remain a fun ride throughout since its characters had defined personalities which had chemistry with one another, while, at the same time, spicing things up just enough with its joke variations to keep things from becoming too stale. This doesn't happen in this show and each joke feels as bland as the last. There is no snowball effect taking place, nor are the character's personalities strong enough to carry the weight of the show. The comedic timing could also feel pretty off, and often at times jarring! The problem with the show is that it doesn't quite know if it wants to be a comedy, a drama or an edge-fest and combines them all together, with an end result that feels clunky to watch. It's not necessarily uncommon for anime to combine multiple genres together, but here there is hardly any downtime between any of the events, so in one moment they are laughing and joking, and in the immediate next, the main character is being tortured. There is no downtime between any of these events and thus it can feel really awkward and jarring while watching the show since the pacing for this show is strangely inconsistent, but is normally pumped up to eleven at all times. Again, for the sake of argument, Gintama is also an anime that features a lot of comedy intermixed with more serious and emotional moments, but, in that show, these two never feel all too intrusive on each other since there is a good amount of downtime between each one. Perhaps this is an unfair comparison considering the sheer difference in the lengths of both shows, but there are plenty of other shows that can achieve this, so why not this one?This doesn't help when the music for the show is so badly implemented and placed at the worst of times. One of the worst examples comes from episode eight in which the main character is being continuously stabbed with a sharp object, while light and carefree music is being played over it, music that would fit right at home in children's shows. It just feels, yet again, jarring, and that's the best word I can use to describe this show: jarring.When it comes to the characters, they don't fare much better. The main character is as boring in personality as he is in visual design. He plays the typical main character lead; spiky hair, getting embarrassed when a girl gets close to him, and so on and so forth. He is a rather boring character, who is pushed into playing the straight man role for the group and nothing else beyond that. He responds with the typical reactions you'd expect from a character in his position and jumps in to save the day whenever he is needed to do so. He is not a bad character necessarily, just an extremely dull one. Akane has a little bit more going for her, in that we do actually learn her back-story, which does explain the reason behind her action and general personality, details I can appreciate, it's just that each scenario and joke she is in, always is about how she is a yandere, while, at the same time, pulling out weapons from her tits. While beautiful in her visual appearance, her character doesn't really have all too much in likeability nor does she receive all too much development as a person either, aside from her rebellion against her mother in the eighth episode of the show. Yuzu receives a little bit of exploration into her character and reasoning behind her love for Akane, while, at the same time having superpowers (which the show never actually explains why she has those now that I am thinking about it) but, again, it feels like I'm repeating myself here, needed more in the way of development in order for her character to be good. The only character I liked was Guri, mainly because I have a soft spot for his aloof idiot types of characters, but I generally found her to be kind of charming in her own little way. I liked her character design perhaps the most, and the various facial expressions she did were kind of funny in their own little way, although nothing remarkable as a whole.If there is one thing I can praise, it is the artwork and general look of the show. It is very colourful and pops pretty well, and, as I said, I liked the various faces and chibi-ness of some of the facial expressions too. I also liked the opening and ending tracks, especially the opening which is incredibly catchy. It's upbeat, lively and full of energy, which, the rest of the show should have been as well, which is a shame since it did have a few things going for it. Some of the comedic moments were alright and the initial set up was good, but unfortunately, the show was not funny in my eyes.But this is where it becomes difficult, however. Comedy is something that is extremely subjective, and thus, I can imagine many people finding this show very funny to watch, which is completely fine. After all, many people consider the second season of Konosuba to be weaker than its prequel, yet I found it funny still, which is something I have to consider when talking about comedy. My sense of humour is pretty damn strange, and I find pleasure in absurd humour. On that end, I would like to recommend this show, on account that you personally may find it funny to watch, but, on the flip side, there are so many other comedy anime out there that take the time to write much more varied jokes that don't come across as forced or jarring when they switch to a more serious tone. It's unfortunate that I didn't enjoy this show, since, as I said in the opening paragraph, I really did want to like this show, but I just couldn't... doing anything with its set-up or parody elements.

The humour never dies, the seriousness never shines. The love comes and goes & the parody just flows.[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 7/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 7/10]What do you get if you give the power of something serious as ""Kiss Note"" (similar to Death Note but kissing) to a clueless cupid who just wants to use it to make her wildest fantasies come true? You get a deconstructed rom-com parody that somehow keeps you watching for...more. This show never takes itself seriously and frankly it\'s because of this that this show shines as a whole. In Renai Boukun aka Love Tyrant, a Kiss Note (parody of Death Note) is a powerful notebook that makes people who have their names written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other, regardless of any circumstances. If they don\'t… they will remain a virgin forever and c\'mon which person would want that? Enter Guri, a cupid clueless about Love, accidentally writes Seiji\'s (MC) name mistaking him for someone else. She shows up to his door, explains the concept to him, they kiss, and the problem begins from there. This whole show starts off from this tiny snowball of a problem that just keeps rolling down the hill and it gets just bigger and bigger. Quite a rollercoaster ride if you ask me.Before I get into the plot, it\'s the characters that makes this show so enjoyable. You have Guri, a BL obsessed undere cupid who is clueless about love. Then, Akane, a psychotic beautiful yandere, that will kill anyone that touches her love. Cue in Yuzu, a tsundere wincestual stalker, in love with her step-sister. Next the cousin of Akane & Yuzu, Shikami, a sado-maso mayadere who gets off on pain, obsessed with stealing other\'s love. On the side, you have the MC\'s younger sister Akua, a kuudere with severe brother/sister complex hoping for her brother\'s love. Finally, you have the weak & pathetic yet kind MC, Seiji, who is ""not handsome, quick to anger, stubborn, insensitive and just a really boring guy"" wanting to find true love. Throw them all in one pot, thanks to the supernatural power of ""Kiss Note"", you have a chaotic mess that will deliver enough comedy to keep you watching for more. Seriously, the characters all feel unique and though the point isn\'t for viewers to identify themselves as one of the character in the show, you just can\'t help laughing at each of their hilarity. Even the Kami, aka God, and Maoh, aka Devil, are presented in such comedic manner that the only less outrageous character in this show is the MC himself. You really do start to pity him seeing the stuff he gets himself into. Despite all the chaos, each of the characters actually undergoes some form of character development to better their personality. Now that you have a better grasp of the characters and their ""goals"", let\'s dive into the plot.Plot wise, the story sort of follows a linear pattern as the show is supposed to showcase Guri\'s coming of age story as she becomes a better Cupid who will succeed Kami in the future by truly understanding the concept of love. However, this show isn\'t about reaching that destination, it\'s about enjoying the messed up journey these characters gets themselves into. At its essence, this is a parody that deconstructs the rom-com genre by showing how obscure the concept of school love is by portraying it through a comedic lense. Each episode is a two part episode where the characters find themselves in stereotypical harem/rom-com messy situations that gets resolved by the end after poking much needed fun at its obscurities. The constant juxtaposition of presenting different deretype characters really adds to its comedic value, plus the dialogues go from corny to cheesy to somewhat deep at times. It\'s almost as if the director snaps their fingers at the viewers to tell them, ""sssh, serious matters are being shown here… or so we think."" Seriously, the best part about this show is that neither the plot nor the director takes the show seriously which allows for the ""quit pro quo"" comedic style to flourish so well.Nevertheless, the animation team behind Renai Boukun did a great job. Each of the major characters stand out from one another and they made the MC a very relatable looking character that is both bland yet unique looking. The use of bold vibrant primary colours really shines throughout the anime. It is able to contrast the deep satirical emotions of love with the outrageous comedic elements of chaos. Though scattered if observed individually but seems cohesive when seen together. The OP song is quirky & catchy and the ED song is nice but its the OST that really shines as it helps the anime flow well with the story by constantly aiding in the creation and diffusion of tension. Definitely worth a listen as a standalone.Overall, Renai Boukun is a fun show to watch, not just on a whim. It\'s a good parody and it never takes itself seriously so the comedy never dies. I enjoyed watching it despite not being a fan of rom-com because it is a deconstructed parody of this genre. If you are debating whether or not you want to watch the show, just ask yourself this. Do you want to watch a show that is utter madness due to hilarious characters? Do you enjoy good comedy? Do you like a bit of fan service? Regardless of yes or no, you should watch this show. Simple as that... joking. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it.P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!P.P.S. ""What is love?

Now that you have a better grasp of the characters and their ""goals"", let\'s dive into the plot.Plot wise, the story sort of follows a linear pattern as the show is supposed to showcase Guri\'s coming of age story as she becomes a better Cupid who will succeed Kami in the future by truly understanding the concept of love. However, this show isn\'t about reaching that destination, it\'s about enjoying the messed up journey these characters gets themselves into. At its essence, this is a parody that deconstructs the rom-com genre by showing how obscure the concept of school love is by portraying it through a comedic lense. Each episode is a two part episode where the characters find themselves in stereotypical harem/rom-com messy situations that gets resolved by the end after poking much needed fun at its obscurities. The constant juxtaposition of presenting different deretype characters really adds to its comedic value, plus the dialogues go from corny to cheesy to somewhat deep at times. It\'s almost as if the director snaps their fingers at the viewers to tell them, ""sssh, serious matters are being shown here… or so we think."" Seriously, the best part about this show is that neither the plot nor the director takes the show seriously which allows for the ""quit pro quo"" comedic style to flourish so well.Nevertheless, the animation team behind Renai Boukun did a great job. Each of the major characters stand out from one another and they made the MC a very relatable looking character that is both bland yet unique looking. The use of bold vibrant primary colours really shines throughout the anime. It is able to contrast the deep satirical emotions of love with the outrageous comedic elements of chaos. Though scattered if observed individually but seems cohesive when seen together. The OP song is quirky & catchy and the ED song is nice but its the OST that really shines as it helps the anime flow well with the story by constantly aiding in the creation and diffusion of tension. Definitely worth a listen as a standalone.Overall, Renai Boukun is a fun show to watch, not just on a whim. It\'s a good parody and it never takes itself seriously so the comedy never dies. I enjoyed watching it despite not being a fan of rom-com because it is a deconstructed parody of this genre. If you are debating whether or not you want to watch the show, just ask yourself this. Do you want to watch a show that is utter madness due to hilarious characters? Do you enjoy good comedy? Do you like a bit of fan service? Regardless of yes or no, you should watch this show. Simple as that... joking. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it.P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!P.P.S. ""What is love? It\'s not about knowing what love is… being in love means whether you are happy or sad the heart always aches for that one special person""', ""**You will not find any spoilers in my review**I felt the need to express my initial feelings toward the series:Renai Boukun parodies of Death Note. Given that it's a parody, expect some over-the-top humor displayed through unrealistic situations. It doesn't, by any means, take itself serious: This casual anime is simply one that contains some light-hearted humor. In addition, it contains yuri, yaoi fandom, and the yandere archetype, in case you're a fan of one of those three. (It has more yandere--and a super obvious form of it--than the other two.)I would have to say the production (story, art, sound, etc.) is pretty standard for...being 2017. It's neither a piece of art nor is it sub-par in quality. We'll see if it continues to deliver as its story develops. If nothing else, Renai Boukun has the rare yandere archetype and is a parody of the most popular anime on MyAnimeList. (I mean, it really boggles my mind how no one has yet parodied Death Note since it's been out for over 10 years.) Renai Boukun got my interest. being 2017.

Only read if you have finished the series. --Story:When thinking of this show, the word wacky comes to mind. We\'re introduced to characters that fit their ""niche,"" if you will, but with a slight spin on it. They are basically forced together with the end result of their shenanigans being rather bizarre at times. This comedy follows the job of a cupid and the troubles that go along with it. With that said, it may be repetitive here and there which brings the show down overall. However, one of my biggest problems with the show is that the story itself...quickly goes downhill somewhere midway when Guri is basically forced to find love for the sake of ""developing"" her character; the way it was brought about was rather sudden and obvious in intention. As if the romance wasn\'t stiff enough as it is.On the other hand, I do enjoy the ever-present theme of ""good vs. bad"" within the show; to be more precise, angels vs. demons. It really plays off the characters really well, and I think it was a great setup. For instance, our ""antiheroine"" Akane comes from an assassin family skilled with swords while her half-sister\'s family offers protection in the form of a shield, or rather, a barrier. Likewise, we can say the same thing towards Seiji\'s sister - being on the good side - and Shikimi - being on the bad side. Interestingly enough, Guri is a living and breathing oxymoron herself. She\'s an angel, yet she loves to stir up trouble every so often.Art:The exaggeration of the characters\' actions brings home the idea that this anime should not be taken too seriously. It\'s really more for entertainment value, rather than being realistic. From the faces they make to the times they should have ""died,"" the art makes sure to convey a comedic tone to it. Much to my surprise, it does a decent job of balancing out the tone in critical points.Sound:This department was pretty lackluster, admittedly. While it fits the general atmosphere, it\'s not exactly something you would want to listen to by itself. It has a somewhat quirky feel and generally compliments the show. Overall, it definitely gets the job done when it needs to, even if it\'s half-heartedly.Characters:Probably the most disappointing aspect of the show. It\'s a comedy, and I get that; they are funny in their own way. Although, that\'s not necessarily a good reason to cling to when they get so predictable early on. After a first impression or two, it\'s pretty obvious to see that Akane is a yandere, Guri is a carefree spirit, Seiji is clueless, Yuzu is obsessive, Shikimi is sadistic, and Akua is a tsundere. It\'s not exactly original. There may be some character development here and there - which is great - but then why does it go back to being redundant almost immediately afterwards? The change is definitely there, but it\'s just extremely hard to tell sometimes. More often than not, it\'s stagnant. While the characters did bring a smile to my face once in a while, I would not go so far to say that they have depth.To summarize, it\'s an entertaining show. I would recommend it to anime fans that are looking for something... ""peculiar."" Despite the things it does right, it\'s just not my cup of tea. From my perspective, there were more negatives that outweighed the positives. As a whole, I would say it\'s pretty unoriginal yet amusing at best. You can interpret that however you wish.Final score: 3/10. quickly goes downhill somewhere midway when Guri is basically forced to find love for the sake of ""developing"" her character; the way it was brought about was rather sudden and obvious in intention.

You can interpret that however you wish.Final score: 3/10.', 'Love is weird.  On one hand, you can fall head over heels for your partner, but you could also want to dig your fingers into their throat because of how annoying they can be.  I hope not every relationship is like that, but it can and has happened.  Through it all, love can be hilarious due to how nonsensical the concept it can be when you put it in perspective.  So why does it matter anyway?  Well to Renai Boukun (aptly titled ‘Love Tyrant’), it means a lot.Story: Aino Seiji is just your typical harem protagonist.  Nice...to everyone, easygoing, and comes into contact with a plethora of very troublesome women through very unfortunate circumstances.  After coming into contact with a girl who presents him with a “Kiss Note” (Yes, it’s a death note reference.  Don’t think too hard about it), he is brought into the realm of couple-making where he must help couples get together, all the while dealing with a small trail of women himself.This show is in a word, rushed.  Smashing together about forty or so chapters of the original manga into a twelve-episode anime, the story for Renai Boukun follows the story of a hyperactive fujoshi, a shrill, incestuous stalker, a kukuri wielding yandere, and the main protagonist, as they come across various, loosely love-based scenarios that culminate into…something.  When looking at it from face value, it’s quite unclear to understand what it is the show wants to be.Aside from the overall theme of love and how love exists in various kinds of romantic relationships, the show zip zaps around from being one-off episode comedy plots, to one-two episode long drama plots involving one of the main characters.  Due to the rushed nature of trying to get to the end, the show suffers from poor comedic timing, as the necessary time to let the audience breathe from in-between jokes is absent and thus makes it very difficult for the audience to really get a full kick out of what we’re supposed to laugh at.  Not only that, it doesn’t help that the show relies mostly on repeated gags in order to try and be funny either.Another problem is character development.  Due to the fact that the show attempts to squeeze so much in so little, any and all character development that the show tries to accomplish feels contrived and stiff.  Two of the main girls in particular get arcs dedicated to them, and it doesn’t really feel like they accomplish much of anything in the end because we’re given less than hour each of total focus to even give a crap.  The ending doesn’t really help either cause things are more or less thrown back into the status quo of things, so I guess like some aspects of life, some things never change.Overall, the story of Renai Boukun is a mess of fragments broken off from an existing manga shoddily put back together to try to create some semblance of an anime.  A lot of the in-between details are missing and while the show does tell a story in the end, it doesn’t really feel genuine or rewarding because the journey watching these characters feels so half-hearted.Overview:-  TERRIBLE pacing (Some episodes are one chapter.  Others are three-four.)-  Poor comedic timing-  Contrived character developmentCharacters:  If I’ll give the show anything, it’s that its main cast is…something.  It’s something all right.First off, we have Aino Seiji.  Now I don’t know why this guy is our protagonist of all characters, but I safely say that he is as bland as they come.  Seiji is your typical ‘nice’ protagonist: respects women, nice to all, easygoing, and most of all, dense.  Maybe he’s not that last one so much, but the rest for sure.  The most interesting part about his character I’d say is how he at least acknowledges the affection he gets from the girls (At least one of them) and has the willingness to be a kind soul regardless of the situation.  Which honestly is something you have to give to the guy considering his harem is filled with absolutely terrible people, deals with haphazardly stupid situations daily, and he gets blamed for stupid shit when his involvement in things aren’t always his fault anyway.  Beyond that, he’s about as interesting as a saltine cracker.Then there’s Guri.  I want to separate this one from the rest of the harem specifically because she is the cause of everyone’s problems.  Noted previously as the ‘hyperactive fujoshi’ who likes to cosplay, Guri doesn’t understand love, yet does whatever she wants because she’s a free spirit and can’t be held down by any form of convention so long as it’s fun and whatnot.  This can be a good archetype, except the show makes her really, really annoying.  For the most part, she causes a lot of the series’ conflicts (she’s the one that jumpstarted the plot anyway), leaving Seiji in particular to try and fix some things.  She’s just…not a very good character, especially since the ending tries its best to get the audience to care about her when the show up until that point gives us very little reason to give a damn in the first place.Then there’re the two half-sisters, Yuzu and Akane.  Yuzu shares similar problems with Guri, with most of her gags and annoyances coming off as creepy yuri as she jealously tries to garner the attention of her ‘onee-sama’ when in reality Akane gives little shits about her half-sister’s attention.  Yuzu’s whole saga throughout the series is all over the place and lacks enough cohesion to warrant any form of sympathy or care from the audience.  As for Akane, she acts as the series’ mediator while also being batshit crazy herself.  Carrying kukuri knives and comically threatening anyone who gets in the way of her and Seiji, Akane is surprisingly the most level-headed member of the entire female cast as she carries a lot of reasoning and understanding that most of the girls in this series lack.  Of course she does share her own fair share of problems (like having her arc be completely rushed to the point it didn’t even really matter), but in comparison, she fares so much better than the other girls in the series.Beyond them, the sidecast involves various family members of the characters’ families (who are also all crazy might I add) that add to some of the arcs in various ways with similarly varying degrees of success, a bunch of cast members who provide their own one-off love stories to help fill up the runtime and provide a different kind of romantic relationship, and the rapey penguin.  Yes, you read that right.  Why he’s there, I don’t know, but he has a surprisingly large part (by supporting cast standards) in this series so…that’s there, I guess.  (There’s also the character ‘Shikimi’, but we don’t talk about her and how much of a bitch she is.)Overview:+ Some level-headed characters-  Most of the cast is crazy (and not the good kind)-  Rapey penguin?  (Don’t know if this is necessarily a bad thing, but I’m adding it.)Art: Produced by EMT^2, Renai Boukun’s art is what I would describe as lazy.  The colors are blindingly bright to the point that it looks uncomfortable to watch; background characters are usually just gray silhouettes, and the characters just look gaudy with how the colors used on them are.It’s not even just the art.  The animation for some scenes clearly show little effort is put into them, thus giving off this really cheap, cost-efficient look to the whole thing that looks very uninteresting to look at.  Not only that, but character designs have their own sets of problems.  Personally I find Yuzu’s hair very irritating to look at.  The huge pigtails on her sides combined with the cheap looking animation make her look like an eyesore every time she came on-screen.Overview:-  Lazy, cheap looking artSound:  The OP known as…""Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!” (Lord that’s a mouthful) is a poppy, upbeat song that actually fits well with the show’s wacky and comedic story.  Sure it’s just a pop idol girl song, but it has merit to it for having a unique beat to it so that it’s not just some generic anime opening that sounds similar to heaps of other openings from other shows.Its ED, \'Suki\' wo Oshiete’ on the other hand isn’t so fortunate.  Comparatively, it’s not really all that unique and falls into a generic sounding song that while sounds good, doesn’t really have much in the way of memorabilia so that you would want to listen to it again, and not so you have to loop it in the background so you can accurately come up with the words to describe it.Overview:+ Decent tracks-  Ed isn’t really all that memorablePersonal Enjoyment:  Having read the Renai Boukun manga, the adaptation disappointed me for not only not being on the same level as the original, but for rushing so much to get to a certain point in the story that it had to sacrifice so much just to get there.  As such, I had a really hard time finding many positives to say since not only was the plot not that stellar to begin with, it actually got worse because it was adapted into something with a limited time frame.  As such, my enjoyment with this series dipped down a bit, and I really wish it didn’t.  Because I did kind of enjoy just being forced to go along with the flow of things sometimes cause like the MC, there’s really no other way out of it.Did I like this series?There were a few choice moments I’m glad they animated.  Not only that, but I’m glad Akane mostly stayed intact.  Despite her obsessive nature, she’s the series’ main voice of reason and maintains her sensibility (mostly) throughout the show despite the random shit going on around her.What didn’t I like about this series?Aside from the obvious plot problems, the rest of the girls in the main group: Guri, Yuzu, (and Shikimi, technically) really irk me.  Their archetypes to me are actually really unlikeable because not only do they center around one thing, which is being annoying, they do it so persistently throughout the series that it never feels like they have any kind of growth to them that would warrant me to like them.  There’s almost no change with their characters and it upsets me that in a harem series of all things, there are very few candidates for ‘best girl’.  (Not like any of them really are stellar choices.)Would I recommend this series?If you are going to watch this, turn your brain off.  Your enjoyment will skyrocket if you do.  Beyond that, this really isn’t something worth recommending.  Its plethora of problems with its pacing and characters combined with a really cheap looking animation style make Renai Boukun a really difficult watch.  Coupled with poor comedic timing and a newbie seiyuu for Yuzu whose voice grates the ears, I honestly have a hard time finding many redeeming merits for this show to watch.  I’d say read the manga if anything, but even then it’s best to turn the good ol’ noggin off. to everyone, easygoing, and comes into contact with a plethora of very troublesome women through very unfortunate circumstances.

While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!---------Positives---------- Ridiculous FunRenai Boukun is the classic example of a show that doesn\'t try and take itself too seriously. Its parodic intro to the show (with the ""Love Note"" parody) is a fittingly silly,...tongue-in-cheek, and completely not subtle icon that symbolizes the whole show. The concept is crazy, the characters are ridiculous, and the hijinks they get up to are top notch. Additionally, there are many references and parodic elements that keep the energy going in the right direction.- Support Structure StoryDirect romances and the underlying romantic story as a whole are not spectacular, but they also do not take away from the show in the slightest. They act as a nice underlying current that runs confidently beneath the shenanigans pushed to the forefront. There\'s no needlessly contrived plot points or backstory, just ones that are handled quickly. As if to say: ""Look, this isn\'t the focus of the show, but that doesn\'t mean we were going to slack off on it"".- Charming CharactersRenai Boukun\'s core production strength is its ability to recognize exactly what to emphasize. While I\'ve already mentioned its ridiculous comedy, the conduit to this comedy (the characters and their interactions) is arguably even more important. The characters were varied, yet equally ridiculous and the MC, Seiji-kun, was a good straight man to the rest of the show\'s goofy ways. Each of the main/major side characters felt sufficiently fleshed out for a 12 episode season, without feeling burdened with unnecessary fluff that could take away from the show\'s core feeling.- Matching Art StyleThe artistic style of the show does a fantastic job of not only contributing to the over-the-top moments of the show, but also serves as a very nice visual in between those times. There is a clear emphasis on popping colours and shining characters, which is exactly what a show like this should be pushing to the front.- Excellent OPThis OP hits all the right points for me. Catchy music, character introductions, and a perfect set-up for the show you\'re about to watch. Never skipped it once, and it always got me in a ""Renai Boukun"" sort of mood.---------Negatives---------- Good, Not GreatOne of the disadvantages of pushing a few themes to the very forefront is that you leave some other elements behind. Let me be clear: Renai Boukun\'s overall story, character backgrounds, and world building are far from bad. They are adequate. As I mentioned above, this is to keep the comedy and madness at a high for as long as possible, but if you\'re looking for deep lore, complex characters, or an uber compelling romance plot, you won\'t find it here.- Kissed PotentialThe show\'s introductory episode was brilliant, and its roots in parody-ing ""Death Note"" with its counterpart, the ""Kiss Note"", was incredibly compelling and a great tool to get the characters in a wealth of kooky conundrums. Where the show goes wrong is where it throws that concept aside about halfway through the season. It leads to a generally disjointed feeling to the arc, as it takes back seat to slightly more serious arcs for each of the main girls. I wish they could have incorporated more of this fun concept into the story.----------Conclusion----------Some anime is meant to tug at your heartstrings. Some anime is meant to fill you with a ""Go Get \'Em!"" spirit. Some anime captivates its audience with deep, twisting plots that have you drooling for more. Renai Boukun is not any of those shows. It doesn\'t break new ground with confidence or ease. But what it does do is allow you to turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy pure, unadulterated ridiculousness. It doesn\'t take itself to serious (even in its more serious moments), and neither should you.There is no more perfect analogy for Renai Boukun than to describe it as ""junk food"" anime. It\'s not particularly good for you, and it won\'t quell a deep hunger in dire anime situations. However, it will provide a light, focused entertainment series. It knows its strong points, and focuses on them, providing you with a silly, romcom to keep you smiling in between heartier meals.------------Final Rating------------While it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: ""Would you recommend I watch this show?"". So,If you are a fan of romcoms and/or harems, Renai Boukun is a perfect(ly silly) addition to your collection.If you enjoy shutting your brain off and wondering just what crazy situation a set of characters will get themselves into this time, you\'ll be right at home.Finally, if you\'re hoping for a heartier look into the genre(s), I\'d recommend choosing a more refined, deeper anime. tongue-in-cheek, and completely not subtle icon that symbolizes the whole show. The concept is crazy, the characters are ridiculous, and the hijinks they get up to are top notch. Additionally, there are many references and parodic elements that keep the energy going in the right direction.- Support Structure StoryDirect romances and the underlying romantic story as a whole are not spectacular, but they also do not take away from the show in the slightest. They act as a nice underlying current that runs confidently beneath the shenanigans pushed to the forefront. There\'s no needlessly contrived plot points or backstory, just ones that are handled quickly. As if to say: ""Look, this isn\'t the focus of the show, but that doesn\'t mean we were going to slack off on it"".- Charming CharactersRenai Boukun\'s core production strength is its ability to recognize exactly what to emphasize. While I\'ve already mentioned its ridiculous comedy, the conduit to this comedy (the characters and their interactions) is arguably even more important. The characters were varied, yet equally ridiculous and the MC, Seiji-kun, was a good straight man to the rest of the show\'s goofy ways. Each of the main/major side characters felt sufficiently fleshed out for a 12 episode season, without feeling burdened with unnecessary fluff that could take away from the show\'s core feeling.- Matching Art StyleThe artistic style of the show does a fantastic job of not only contributing to the over-the-top moments of the show, but also serves as a very nice visual in between those times. There is a clear emphasis on popping colours and shining characters, which is exactly what a show like this should be pushing to the front.- Excellent OPThis OP hits all the right points for me. Catchy music, character introductions, and a perfect set-up for the show you\'re about to watch.

Can't talk to your school crush? Always wanted to build your dream harem? Well, look no further, cause we have a product made just for you. Introducing the Kiss Note! No Kira calm down stop laughing like a maniac we said Kiss Note not Death Note. Ugh anyway... With this handy little book, you can write down your name along with the name of your preferred crush and viola. One kiss and you'll become an official couple. You can even put down several names at once! Why have only one girlfriend when...you can date your entire school? (even that weird girl that sits in the back drawing summoning circles) So don't wait, don't delay! Buy your very own Kiss Note today for the low low low low low price of 1 million dollars.Disclaimer: Only a cupid can activate the powers of the Kiss Note, it's basically useless in the hands of a human. But buy it anyway I need to buy an Akane body pillow help a guy in needLove Tyrant is a parody harem. We got our own male MC Seiji Aino who meets Guri, a cupid that accidentally wrote Seiji's name into her Kiss Note and now has to get him to kiss someone or she will die cause gotta keep that Death Note reference alive. We progress from there with Seiji hooking up with his crush Akane Hiyama, triggering a series of events that turn Seiji's life upside down. It gets pretty insane as Seiji tries to get used to all the shenanigans that has now arrived due to Guri's interference. There's not much story besides the few arcs that throw in some drama to spice things up, but these can either take away the silly charm of the show with some temporary seriousness (give us back our craziness drama!) or be quite heartwarming as we all declare our love for each other.The comedy here is the main and best aspect of Love Tyrant. The interactions that the characters have with each other and the crazy situations (that range from running away from a horny demonic demon penguins to dying and meeting your omnipotent father in law) are all incredibly funny, throwing joke after joke to keep you laughing without end. It pokes fun at harems and deres, subtly pointing out the ridiculousness of these tropes that we have become so used to The pacing does start off a little rushed, but it just adds onto the comedy as it gives us more and more hilarious scenes.The characters are pretty great as well. Akane is the school idol that turns out to be a kukri-wielding yandere, Yuzu Kichougasaki is a barrier creating tsundere lesbian who's in love with her sister, and you can't forget Guri, our lovable otaku cupid that loves creating yaoi ships and causing trouble. Even Seiji, who acts as our slightly dumb Harem MC, has a certain charm to him with his attempts to keep his girlfriends under control so they don't end up causing too much damage. The rest of the characters (which consists of cupids, sadists, gods, angels, demons, super-powered assassins and bodyguards, the list goes on and on just like this sentence I should really stop) are just introduced to create more comedy or drama, but they get enough screen time across the show to let you see their own unique personalities and quirksRomance is handled quite nicely with the whole harem skit. There aren't any pussy men that can't handle being 10 metres around women. In fact, there are several dates and kisses shared across the harem as the anime progresses. Sure the show isn't really that romance heavy as we have Seiji trying to figure things out due to him keeping some generic harem mc traits, but the rest of the show is able to make up for it with its comedy and the occasional sweet moments that just makes your heart skip a little.Love Tyrant is definitely not for everyone. Due to it being a harem and comedy anime, there are many people will get turned off due to that fact that they either dislike the overused idea of several girls dating one guy or just don't enjoy the comedy the show has to offer. However, I highly recommend this show to everyone to at least try out for a few eps. If you dislike it, drop it. If you enjoy it, welcome to the club.

Sounds ridiculous? Well, that's Renai Boukun in a nutshell for you.This is a hilarious parody of your stereotypical romcom, Death Note and more. Renai Boukun does not take itself seriously whatsoever and is packed to the brim with light-hearted gags and references. It is utterly silly...in every sense of the word but doesn't pretend to be anything else, resulting in a plethora of shameless, unapologetic comedy. And oh boy is it fun to watch. When the mischievous angel Guri arrives in the average joe Seiji's life, she helps him finally being able to get together with the girl of his dreams—Akane—only for him to find out that she was actually a psychopathic yandere all along with madly possessive feelings of love for him. And when Akane's little sister Yuzu confesses that she in turn had always been in love with her own sister, things quickly become about as chaotic as it gets after all four of them are roped together into a twisted relationship thanks to the power of Guri's Kiss Note, which also gives them all immortality. Add to that a creepy dog-angel, a giant black rapist penguin of doom and you've got yourself one hell of a strange anime. The whole thing is all over the place, but it results in a ton of absurd slapstick comedy which is very well-executed in general.The problem with Renai Boukun however is that it doesn't maintain the same quality for very long. The first four episodes are hilarious, but starting with episode five, Renai Boukun starts to drop off pretty fast. And it starts with the introduction of a new girl called Shikimi, who just so happens to be *another* psychopath, but unlike Akane, this girl is one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen. She is the epitome of being crazy for the sake of being crazy with little rhyme or reason attached to it. But her being annoying in person is not the main problem, but rather that she takes the role of the villain in the story and starts interfering with the main characters consistently for her own strange reasons, which results in the anime as a whole becoming significantly more serious as there's now an enemy they have to fight. Thus, the hilarious comedy/parody content almost disappears entirely to make room for it, which is an awful trade-off. It just leaves you wishing that the story would've kept doing what it was doing originally instead.Compared to the manga, Renai Boukun is technically a pretty rushed adaptation in terms of how much content is covered in every episode, but given the hysterical and hyperactive nature of the show, the faster pacing ends up working out alright anyway I think (kind of like with the Prison School adaptation). However, the genre-switch unsurprisingly bothered me just as much in the anime as it did in the manga, and that is the main downfall of Renai Boukun.Now that doesn't mean that the show isn't worth watching all of a sudden. The first few episodes are quite good and even later on it's still bearable, albeit not great. It's just one of those series which leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth solely because you know it could have been so much better still. in every sense of the word but doesn't pretend to be anything else, resulting in a plethora of shameless, unapologetic comedy.

It has a promising start, setting up an interesting concept that’s slightly different yet feels familiar at the same time! This is achieved in the following way, familiar cause it falls for the same corny ironies such as an MC who’s both dense and uncertain about what he wants while at the same time the anime differs itself with its near perfect timing of comedy which is really the best type! Even though it starts off with an amazing pace, it...ends on an annoying and boring term because it can’t help shake off all its clichéd tropes. The beginning part worked because the anime understood itself and accepted it without any regrets! What I mean is that the writers knew this show isn’t for everybody so they didn’t waste any time in pleasing everyone, instead they just throw you into this messy story and let you decide whether you want to stick with it or not! It made a point of mocking the Harem genre which worked for a while but later the joke turns on them itself! Comedy is the best thing here, hitting you with unexpected type of jokes which is always fun. But they pretty much bash your head with the same type of gags again and again until it becomes irritating. Towards the end, they jolted to focus more on their preposterous concept by reducing their Comedy which sucked out all the fun from the anime, making everything dull and the climax was pointlessly hastened.A cupid cosplaying as a demon named Guri is not very good with her job since she doesn’t understand the concept of Love. Ironic, right? On top of that, she gets bored all the time cause she’s freaking dense so she easily gets distracted from her task whenever something ‘Fun’ comes around! She crosses paths with the MC, Seiji who’s your clichéd nice guy surrounded by pretty girls, and writes his name in the ‘Kiss Note’ which is a diary that makes people fall in love once their names are written in it. But in typical ‘Death Note’ fashion, if only 1 name is written then that person must find a partner quickly or remain a virgin for life! Seiji resolves to put Akane’s name next to his cause he has a secret crush on her which’s suitable because Akane’s crazy about Seiji as well which is very fortunate for him. When I say crazy, I mean literally cause unfortunately she also happens to be a psychological Yandere character who gets effortlessly envious and resorts to extreme violence at once! Sadly, that’s all she does, for the anime opts to replay that same joke over and over again where Akane gets mad and starts stabbing someone! Then Guri, in her nonsensical habit, adds her name into this relationship just cause she thinks it will be fun! Soon the follow up is Akane’s half-sister, Yuzu, who also adds her name cause she’s in love with Akane and this is where the plot starts to make no sense so you should just go along with it. Oh yeah, Yuzu is a clumsy girl who has this morbid fixation for Akane which was creepy to watch but since this is a Harem she also starts eliciting feelings for Seiji as well. Anyway, at one point all must help this lazy plus hyper cupid to do her job cause otherwise they all will end up in hell for some lame reason and that’s how the show starts. Boy that was hard to explain! And what’s worst is this plot rarely ever surfaces again! The story is weak throughout the series, the only difference is that it’s commencement was buoyed with a riveting idea which is why it’s tolerable at first. But due to the half ass effort, the anime later fails to hit the right points with its storytelling which is why it gives off a bitter and boring vibe when the show shifts its focus to more serious exposition! This is the reason why sub plots like the whole family drama between Akane and Yuzu or the backstory with Guri didn’t land with the audience since it lacked any real depth to it. An attempt was made to flesh out their female characters but they were so rushed and poorly done, I couldn’t help ask why even bother? Proper development is achieved by giving details and time to tell a well-fashioned tale which is never applied here, instead characters are one note with distinctive epitomes of other anime’s.The artwork falls in with every other Harem anime with its bright colours and fan service but there was something with the character designs that caught my eyes for I could tell something was off but I can’t seem to place it! It was slightly distracting! The animation met the standard outlooks despite some untraditional attempts with the camera angles. Even the sound effects used to play up the humour wasn’t very notable but the Dubs here was great, nicely capturing the vibe for these whacky characters which the Subs failed to carry. Both OP/ED botched to leave any impression and shall be forgotten quickly though the video for OP was kinda nice.I really enjoyed the first few episodes, thinking this might turn into a great Comedy anime for I didn’t mind its chaotic setup or straightforward characters. And I did laugh at some jokes though this show needed more since it lacked fresh and self-aware humour, rather much of its Comedy comes from overused gags which becomes dull after a while. With nothing else going on except for clichéd characters and story that relies heavily on repeatable puns, it turned this ‘could have fun show’ to a predictable one that just can’t be recommended to others!

Instead I offer you to check out ‘Kono Subarashi’ that really nails the head with its Comedy, Story and Characters!', 'Plenty of rom-com series focuses on school life relationships these days between young teens. I can’t say this enough but every season seems to have them in some way or form. Then, there’s Renai Boukun which seems normal at first. But then, you add a thing called the “Kiss Note”, a red headed yandere, a Shinigami, angels, and you get a show of bizarre shenanigans.Adapted by the manga of the same name, Renai Boukun is what I envision as a parody or perhaps deconstruction of the rom-com genre. The series starts off with Aino Seiji, a normal high student living his daily life as...usual. That is, until one day…he encounters Guri, a female Shinigami who shows him a Kiss Note. It’s a supernatural notebook that makes anyone who has their name written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other. Things take a weird twist when Seiji’s name gets written into the book and he kisses his long time crush, Akane. See where this is going? A bizarre rom-com that adds in supernatural context to entertain the viewers. For me, I think it’s some popcorn comedy that will easily draw some laughs.If there’s one thing to mention, Renai Boukun excels at selling its humor. The show has romance but delivers it in such a way that you can’t help but laugh at it. The comedy is played out that can feel ridiculous with characters such as Akane, the beautiful and popular yandere. In almost every scene they are together, she obsessively attaches herself to Seiji. Whenever she senses that Seiji may be “cheating” on her, she goes into full yandere mode in comedic fashion. On the other hand, there’s Guri who seems rather oblivious to the concept of love. The first few episodes shows that she is a very playful girl with a childish personality. Akane doesn’t get along with her as she sees Guri as a “love rival”. In essence, the show portrays their rivalry as a humorous gag rather than a serious drama story.Of course, that’s not all. The show introduces more girls into Seiji’s life that adds more humor into the show. Yuzu (half-sister of Akane) adds some subtle yuri context as she seems to be in love with Akane. Her relationship with Seiji is mixed as she sees him as an obstacle but also seems to falling for Seiji as the story progresses. Shikimi Shiramine (Yuzu and Akane’s cousin) adds perhaps a more dramatic element of the show. She doesn’t seem to get along with anyone and sees life like a game. Manipulative and cunning, she enjoys afflicting people and having fun with her games. The relationship she share with Seiji can get quite indecent at times. Unlike Akane, she doesn’t seem to be actually in love with Seiji but often tries to seduce him for the fun of it. Her role in the show adds more drama than any others as some of her actions really influence the plot and characters.Despite the amount of humor injected into the show, there’s also some genuine relationship building in particular with Seiji’s sister, Aqua. As the tomboyish sister, Aqua seems to have a rocky relationship with Seiji and we’re shown why through some background storytelling. The series takes a more realistic approach at developing that relationship after certain evens happen in the show. So in a way, not every relationship in this show is a comedy gag. Akane also faces emotional troubles of her own and the series brings that into more light in later episodes.As most viewers can expect by now, Renai Boukun is pretty much saturated with comedy that doesn’t even feel like rom-com. Some may can it at a harem given the male-female ratio of the cast. I would say that the show can be enjoyed if you watch it for humor. However, the storytelling itself isn’t well written and in particular, I can’t really connect with the plot from most of the episodes. Only a few episodes portrays itself in a more serious manner and even then, it brushes off in a quick fashion afterwards. The supernatural context can quickly grow dull once you’ve seen it a dozen times. One other issue I find in this show is the presence of Yuzu. This girl has a personality that seems even more childish compared to Guri and I find her presence to be extremely annoying. Seiji himself isn’t an interesting character either. In retrospect, the characters in this can easily be distracting to watch and despite their humorous roles, they don’t stand out particularly much on their own.In terms of animation, I have some rather mixed feelings. Characters such as Guri, Akane, and Shikimi stands out by their designs while others such as Seiji and Aqua looks too normal. Comedy is portrayed through character expressions that is effective to sell its comedy. However, it sometimes relies on it too much at times that feels uncanny. Oh and some characters just looks ridiculous. I mean, a demonic penguin? An angelic cat? Really? The character designs also has some distracting outlines around them that can be bothersome to look at.To say the least, the soundtrack of Renai Boukun is just silly. The OP and ED theme songs parodies character relationships and puts little effort into the choreography. It’s only catchy enough with its lyrics although on most parts, I find it to be absurd. However, I would add that character voice mannerism is memorable particularly with Akane’s yandere tone and Shikimi’s manipulative voice.Should you watch Renai Boukun? Is it worth the time? Honestly, the answer to that is up to you because supernatural rom-coms like this is adapted to create laughter. By the end of the day, it hopes to make you laugh rather than getting you invested into the story. When I finished watching this show, I can’t really look back and say “I should have watched this sooner”. usual. That is, until one day…he encounters Guri, a female Shinigami who shows him a Kiss Note. It’s a supernatural notebook that makes anyone who has their name written together instantly fall in love if they kiss each other. Things take a weird twist when Seiji’s name gets written into the book and he kisses his long time crush, Akane. See where this is going? A bizarre rom-com that adds in supernatural context to entertain the viewers. For me, I think it’s some popcorn comedy that will easily draw some laughs.If there’s one thing to mention, Renai Boukun excels at selling its humor. The show has romance but delivers it in such a way that you can’t help but laugh at it. The comedy is played out that can feel ridiculous with characters such as Akane, the beautiful and popular yandere. In almost every scene they are together, she obsessively attaches herself to Seiji. Whenever she senses that Seiji may be “cheating” on her, she goes into full yandere mode in comedic fashion. On the other hand, there’s Guri who seems rather oblivious to the concept of love. The first few episodes shows that she is a very playful girl with a childish personality. Akane doesn’t get along with her as she sees Guri as a “love rival”. In essence, the show portrays their rivalry as a humorous gag rather than a serious drama story.Of course, that’s not all. The show introduces more girls into Seiji’s life that adds more humor into the show. Yuzu (half-sister of Akane) adds some subtle yuri context as she seems to be in love with Akane. Her relationship with Seiji is mixed as she sees him as an obstacle but also seems to falling for Seiji as the story progresses. Shikimi Shiramine (Yuzu and Akane’s cousin) adds perhaps a more dramatic element of the show. She doesn’t seem to get along with anyone and sees life like a game. Manipulative and cunning, she enjoys afflicting people and having fun with her games. The relationship she share with Seiji can get quite indecent at times. Unlike Akane, she doesn’t seem to be actually in love with Seiji but often tries to seduce him for the fun of it. Her role in the show adds more drama than any others as some of her actions really influence the plot and characters.Despite the amount of humor injected into the show, there’s also some genuine relationship building in particular with Seiji’s sister, Aqua. As the tomboyish sister, Aqua seems to have a rocky relationship with Seiji and we’re shown why through some background storytelling. The series takes a more realistic approach at developing that relationship after certain evens happen in the show. So in a way, not every relationship in this show is a comedy gag.

Spoilers ahead!)When I think about romantic love, simple thoughts come to mind: signs of affection, the giddiness, deeper connections, a feeling like nothing else in the world. Love takes on many different forms, and it means something different to everyone else, but love is lovely all the same.In Renai Boukun, love attracts the not-so-normal, too. An angel-devil hybrid. A machete-wielding woman. A shield-creating girl. And a sadistic-happy psycho. For them, love also takes on multiple forms and multiple meanings – and with it all comes a lot of comedy to at least like along the way.STORYRenai...Boukun reaches a boiling point right quick. Guri, the demon-cosplaying cupid, shows up out of nowhere at Seiji’s doorstep. Not to share the Bible. Rather to inform him of his impending death lest he kiss someone soon. After she demonstrates the power of her angel tool called the Kiss Note (copyright laws be darned) and her subsequent meddling brings Akane and Yuzu into the mix, this recipe for comedic craziness prepares itself for further taste testing.In terms of flavoring, the anime seasons its content with almost entirely character-based escapades, delivering funny moments left and right as they act and speak out among the harem. For instance, in episode five, Guri tells Akane that kissing Seiji may bring him back from “death,” so she smooches the lifeless guy for a solid fifteen minutes to the point that his body shrivels up. In other episodes, Yuzu steals Akane’s thrown-out tissues and bathes in her used bathwater in an attempt to wrap herself in her older half-sister’s essence. As for Guri, her constant carefree attitude inherently creates opportunities for silly situations and sillier reactions.Besides the character comedy, the anime also leverages other avenues. It has running gags (in a figurative and literal sense) as Akane constantly chases Guri around whenever she gets too close to her beloved Seiji. It has hand-waving workarounds like the evil demon-penguin Stolas “communicating” with just his eyes. It has quips like Guri commenting on the fact that Seiji and herself have matching wounds after Akane’s mother’s words stab him in the head (in a fourth-wall-breaking maneuver).There’s more. Escalating jokes with Coraly the angel and his ever “prettier” forms. Subverting expectations with Guri’s transformation into a school swimsuit instead of her fancy angel outfit. Joking in the background like Guri eating a dozen-scoop-stacked ice cream or police officers fearful of Akane. Reacting similarly several minutes later as a callback to an earlier scene, specifically Yuzu’s reaction in episode three to the Kiss Note burning up.As can be gleaned, Renai Boukun’s comedy clearly takes on multiple forms much like love itself. Not wanting to tread down too much stagnation, it then attempts to space out its comedy with a smattering of drama here and there. However, the anime loses a bit of steam in the back half of its run when said drama takes higher precedence than the comedy that it touted.Especially Guri’s final conflict. Without too much fanfare and resolved rapidly, the extra backstory feels less important and more tacked on. The show also ditches the Kiss Note idea almost entirely in the last six episodes of the season, calling into question the show’s general level of focus.The even weaker premise overall also contributes to its decline. At a surface level, the show is about a guy and a bunch of girls in a love polygon. At a deeper level, it’s about Guri and the gang realizing what love means. Unfortunately, the in-between levels do not have enough creativity to carry themselves all way to the finish line. Another way to view it is that there’s a lot there, but there isn’t a lot “going on.” As if the anime cares only about its characters rather than what is actually happening around them. All because these happenings are a tad too underwhelming in their delivery.Nevertheless, the jokes do what they can to derive from said premise. Case in point: Akane’s actions. In most other anime, the yandere does not get to harm her beloved for fear of killing him. Yet, thanks to Guri’s angelic powers, Akane is free to stab Seiji as many times as she so pleases. Or take Part B of episode six, a test of courage. Within a haunted section of the school, references to classic Western horror icons like Ghostbusters, Jigsaw, and Chucky pop up while showcasing a few romantic asides between Yuzu and Seiji.And the anime still has a few words about that aforementioned deeper level. Akane sees love as something that personally resonates. Yuzu sees love as something that cannot be tossed aside. Guri sees love as something that must be experienced rather than explained. Shikimi sees love as something that one desperately craves.Through these forms, love seeps into almost every aspect of the anime: comedy, drama, or otherwise. Not to mention that the anime contains more standalone kisses than a public orgy. As such, the consistency here offsets some of the issues from the mishandled focus and misplaced premise, keeping the structure of the show in good graces.ART & ANIMATIONRenai Boukun takes advantage of its visual space to follow its genre quite well.Key among its artistic choices is the “degradation” of the characters designs. On a regular basis, the anime reduces their integrity to strong effect. Akane’s appearance becomes slightly rounder for a cuter chibi look. Seiji’s head turns into a ball with three spikes jutting out the top. Guri practically morphs into a minimalist, avant-garde piece when she loses all details save for her ahoge and maybe some duck-like lips depending on the joke at hand.This contrast works because normally the designs are either interesting or attractive. Colors capture: Seiji’s light-blue hair sticks out even more than usual for such a plain protagonist, Shikimi’s pink motif masks her vile personality. Akane’s large bosom (which the opening track’s visuals even hone in on) and Yuzu’s cute demeanor are traits that immediately appeal. And Guri dons almost one new costume per episode, going so far as to have a complete redesign after becoming a devil.Movement likewise “degrades,” skipping out on strict fluidity and replacing it instead with exaggerated motions for even more comedic opportunities. Yuzu is prone to such actions when she flails her arms in frustration or runs away in panic, but Guri can show it too when she runs with speed as Seiji holds onto her hand for dear life. The show even combines the degraded designs with the degraded movement such as when Akane cuts up a bunch of vegetables when making dinner while at Seiji’s place (with everyone else, much to her chagrin).Not to say that the art and the animation defaults to degradation all the time. Guri’s sweet scenes and Shikimi’s attacks represent a couple of examples that highlight this statement well enough. Plus, the anime goes out of its way to add additional flair where possible. Out-of-screen speech bubbles. Camera shakes. Smaller details like hearts and sparkles.A lackluster setting does hold the anime back though; the city and the school do not represent a source of intrigue since they exist to provide little else beyond an area for the characters to run around in. However, the inclusion of goofy, starry, or otherwise imaginative backgrounds continue to aid the comedy in their one-off, supportive behavior.CHARACTERSThe cast of Renai Boukun fit rather cleanly into tried-and-true roles.It has the self-insert protagonist in Seiji. It has the yandere in Akane. It has the tsundere in Yuzu. It has the genki girl in Guri. It has the sadist in Shikimi. Such roles are not inherently a negative; it’s simply an observation and an easy way to succinctly describe those in the show.Indeed, the characters rarely deviate from their associated actions. Akane threatens Seiji himself for “cheating” on her with other “homewreckers.” Yuzu acknowledges Seiji’s kindness but qualifies most of her responses with a variation of the classic “but that doesn’t mean I like you” phrase. And so on and so forth. However, what they lack in uniqueness they make up for in their connectivity and individual focus.Looking at the relationships within the harem, they have a level of interaction that brings out more comedy from them than otherwise possible. Akane does not like Guri, often calling her “stupid monkey” and conceding to the fact that the two are rivals in love. Yuzu is in love with Akane so hard that she melts into goo when the crazy woman simply kisses her (on the forehead) for the first time. Shikimi “toys” with these two female cousins of hers. Guri sees the truth within Shikimi’s soul and is arguably Yuzu’s best friend.Per the harem and the roles they play, each girl also has an affinity for Seiji himself. Akane is madly (read: insanely) in love with the lad. Yuzu cannot help but fall for him as he almost always catches her when she literally falls. Guri adores his reactions and teases him regularly. Shikimi wishes to steal him away from Akane to hurt her as much as possible.Seiji himself does not get any notable information about him, letting the anime focus on the girls instead. He is nice and normal and therefore not that interesting, but he is still a likable dude nonetheless. If only because he approaches the situation he now finds himself in with a lot of relatability. Guri annoys him to no end. Akane scares him despite the crush he has on her. He chooses to go along with Yuzu’s nonthreatening insults. He wants nothing to do with Shikimi whatsoever. So, while he takes a backseat with everyone else in the cast around, he does not go unnoticed.Related to Seiji, their feelings and wants do not appear out of thin air. Renai Boukun makes sure to not let that happen when it actively takes the time to showcase more of the backstory, the reasoning behind the affection they carry.For example, Akane earns much of that time. Growing up, her mother instilled in her the need to suppress her emotions without reservation, training her instead in the ways of the blade rather than the ways of the heart. Boys would confess their love to Akane, but she turned them down since they only viewed her in a superficial sense.She bumps into Seiji randomly one day in an alley where his cat has clawed his eyes shut (setting up an indirect joke in the moment). Without sight, he double checks that she is okay and remarks on her kindness towards him, valuing her as a beautiful person on the inside and winning her over indefinitely.Having never expressed emotion and now finding her one true love, it makes sense then that this complete 180 in her thought process turns her into the yandere of today. Even when her mother forces her back home and prevents her from ever seeing Seiji again, she cannot discard the feelings she now holds. After Yuzu’s words, Guri’s actions, and a like-mother-like-daughter bit of exposition, Akane successfully pushes back against the naysayer, finding solace in the love she shares with her blue-haired boyfriend.To reiterate, Renai Boukun investigates and expands on Akane’s past the most out of the characters, meaning the others do not have the same depth. But they receive attention nevertheless. For example, Guri is God’s daughter, but her (unknown) mother is a demon. Thus, her abilities as a cupid are not as fine-tuned as those in heaven, leading to her keen interest in love and what it means. Yuzu devotes herself to Akane after she saves her from falling in a fountain filled with vicious piranhas (pretty extreme but that’s how Shikimi operates). As for Shikimi herself, her desire to obtain what she doesn’t have and everyone else does stems from the flaunting nature of people and the need for attention that nobody gives her.Like Akane, they improve for the better, too. Guri returns to angel status when she realizes that the best part about love is having the person one loves love them back. Yuzu slowly but surely appreciates Seiji more and more. And Shikimi even seems to find a teeny, tiny bit of gratitude by the end of the season.None of the writing involved hits any high notes, but it is still nice to see the anime go out of its way to bolster its crew even if the execution isn’t all there. To that end, smaller side characters help to round out Renai Boukun. Tsuruoka, Yuzu’s (unfortunate) butler, adds a few small comedic asides. Mari, the student (somewhat secretly) in love with her teacher, shows a different kind of love. And Coraly, Guri’s heavenly guide, provides useful information now and again for the characters (and the audience).The most intriguing side character, though, is Akua, Seiji’s younger sister and therefore potential love interest. Not only does she garner attention but also she has what can only be described as tangible development. In a three-part act of sorts, her encounters with Stolas give her new insight and new chances of her own. In part one, Seiji saves her to let her know that he is the same brother he has always been despite the gaggle of girls who surround him. In part two, Akane saves her, batting away the penguin and earning some encouragement from the frustrated (soon-to-be) sister-in-law. And in part three, Akua saves herself, finally overcoming her longstanding fears.Altogether, the cast is a net positive. The harem works, they play their roles well, they receive more attention beyond their base characteristics, and the extra side characters pepper in something different when and where they can. Not too shabby.MUSIC & SOUNDStanding above the rest of the sound within Renai Boukun, the opening track forms fun and frivolity with its upright catchiness. The reserved and occasionally weird instrumentation in the first half gives the clapping, the lyrics (with its emphasis on “daisuki” and “baby”), and the harmonized vocals the room they require to invite the audience with the start of each episode. Eventually a more involved second half rolls in with grander sounds, different lyrical approaches (namely punctual, crescendo-like and back-and-forth styles), and even more harmonizing.Unfortunately, the rest of the music does not hold up.The ending track, “‘Suku’ wo Oshiete”, has its heart in the right place, showcasing a softer piece with piano and xylophone. But the methodical pacing and the (low) emotional appeal of the song prevent it from reaching full strength alongside this fast-and-funny show.As for the rest of the original soundtrack, it too fades away without much to say let alone listen to. Save for a single track: Shikimi’s theme. The heavy pipes, the grating background noise, and the male vocals ooze an ominous atmosphere to a scary degree.Going in the opposite direction again, the voice acting performances deserve a sizable shoutout. Yoshino Aoyama as Guri infuses the air with a chipper cadence, and Manami Numakura as Akane creeps out the audience with her maniacal mannerisms and evil advances (e.g., “The only one who may hurt Seiji-kun…is me” line from episode two).Most of all, Yuki Nagano as Yuzu, in her first ever role, nails a proper, shy, and cute voice to make the kindhearted girl one of the funniest characters in the show.ENJOYMENTWhat a darn fun anime.Almost every character had me laughing on more than one occasion. Especially Akane, Guri, and Yuzu. Akane literally dying of shock at the mere envisioning of Seiji eloping and starting a family with another woman. Yuzu poking Seiji’s eyes out twice: once for ogling at Akane’s bikini and once more right after for giving Yuzu herself a compliment about her own swimsuit. Guri so happy-go-lucky about almost everything despite the slapstick abuse she experiences or must avoid. Alongside Seiji being at the expense and mercy of these three, I was consistently entertained throughout the show’s season.My only major gripe is Shikimi. I liked her at first given her rather (shall we say) in-your-face introduction. But afterwards, when she became much more annoying and infallible and lame, I often frowned upon her arrivals. Worse still that the ending implied that she would (someday) be officially accepted into the harem. Yes, I’m supposed to dislike her, but that doesn’t stop me from actually disliking her, too.That’s about it. The anime doesn’t have incredible moments, amazing writing, or nuanced, tangential details for me to praise or hate. It’s simply a fun show that’s at least worth the time invested. And sometimes – when we shift between the ultra horrendous and the utterly stupendous anime out there – we do not need to ask for much more.Renai Boukun may not have a huge presence within the medium, but it still has the execution present to push it a tad bit higher than the average. Quick jokes, a host of (in a positive sense) silly artistic choices, and a couple of notable music tracks argue in its favor even if the rest of its offerings do not invoke a ton of specialness. To put it differently, it brings to mind a more than passable form.SUMMARYStory: Fine, a rom-com with a strong helping of comedic chops and several words on the meaning of love, hampered by weak drama and a weaker premiseArt & Animation: Good, from the contrasting “degraded” designs to the exaggerated movements to the goofy additions, the visuals aim for comedy the whole way throughCharacters: Good, Akane, Guri, Yuzu, and Shikimi work well together and on their own within the harem format, Seiji is a likable dude, and extra side characters like Akua round out the cast in their own wayMusic & Sound: Fine, a forgettable ED and a lackluster OST hold back a catchy OP and strong VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, minus Shikimi, romance plus comedy equals a pretty fun timeFinal Score: 6/10 Boukun reaches a boiling point right quick. Guri, the demon-cosplaying cupid, shows up out of nowhere at Seiji’s doorstep. Not to share the Bible. Rather to inform him of his impending death lest he kiss someone soon. After she demonstrates the power of her angel tool called the Kiss Note (copyright laws be darned) and her subsequent meddling brings Akane and Yuzu into the mix, this recipe for comedic craziness prepares itself for further taste testing.In terms of flavoring, the anime seasons its content with almost entirely character-based escapades, delivering funny moments left and right as they act and speak out among the harem. For instance, in episode five, Guri tells Akane that kissing Seiji may bring him back from “death,” so she smooches the lifeless guy for a solid fifteen minutes to the point that his body shrivels up. In other episodes, Yuzu steals Akane’s thrown-out tissues and bathes in her used bathwater in an attempt to wrap herself in her older half-sister’s essence. As for Guri, her constant carefree attitude inherently creates opportunities for silly situations and sillier reactions.Besides the character comedy, the anime also leverages other avenues. It has running gags (in a figurative and literal sense) as Akane constantly chases Guri around whenever she gets too close to her beloved Seiji. It has hand-waving workarounds like the evil demon-penguin Stolas “communicating” with just his eyes. It has quips like Guri commenting on the fact that Seiji and herself have matching wounds after Akane’s mother’s words stab him in the head (in a fourth-wall-breaking maneuver).There’s more. Escalating jokes with Coraly the angel and his ever “prettier” forms. Subverting expectations with Guri’s transformation into a school swimsuit instead of her fancy angel outfit. Joking in the background like Guri eating a dozen-scoop-stacked ice cream or police officers fearful of Akane. Reacting similarly several minutes later as a callback to an earlier scene, specifically Yuzu’s reaction in episode three to the Kiss Note burning up.As can be gleaned, Renai Boukun’s comedy clearly takes on multiple forms much like love itself. Not wanting to tread down too much stagnation, it then attempts to space out its comedy with a smattering of drama here and there. However, the anime loses a bit of steam in the back half of its run when said drama takes higher precedence than the comedy that it touted.Especially Guri’s final conflict. Without too much fanfare and resolved rapidly, the extra backstory feels less important and more tacked on. The show also ditches the Kiss Note idea almost entirely in the last six episodes of the season, calling into question the show’s general level of focus.The even weaker premise overall also contributes to its decline. At a surface level, the show is about a guy and a bunch of girls in a love polygon. At a deeper level, it’s about Guri and the gang realizing what love means. Unfortunately, the in-between levels do not have enough creativity to carry themselves all way to the finish line. Another way to view it is that there’s a lot there, but there isn’t a lot “going on.” As if the anime cares only about its characters rather than what is actually happening around them. All because these happenings are a tad too underwhelming in their delivery.Nevertheless, the jokes do what they can to derive from said premise. Case in point: Akane’s actions. In most other anime, the yandere does not get to harm her beloved for fear of killing him. Yet, thanks to Guri’s angelic powers, Akane is free to stab Seiji as many times as she so pleases. Or take Part B of episode six, a test of courage. Within a haunted section of the school, references to classic Western horror icons like Ghostbusters, Jigsaw, and Chucky pop up while showcasing a few romantic asides between Yuzu and Seiji.And the anime still has a few words about that aforementioned deeper level. Akane sees love as something that personally resonates. Yuzu sees love as something that cannot be tossed aside. Guri sees love as something that must be experienced rather than explained. Shikimi sees love as something that one desperately craves.Through these forms, love seeps into almost every aspect of the anime: comedy, drama, or otherwise. Not to mention that the anime contains more standalone kisses than a public orgy. As such, the consistency here offsets some of the issues from the mishandled focus and misplaced premise, keeping the structure of the show in good graces.ART & ANIMATIONRenai Boukun takes advantage of its visual space to follow its genre quite well.Key among its artistic choices is the “degradation” of the characters designs. On a regular basis, the anime reduces their integrity to strong effect. Akane’s appearance becomes slightly rounder for a cuter chibi look. Seiji’s head turns into a ball with three spikes jutting out the top. Guri practically morphs into a minimalist, avant-garde piece when she loses all details save for her ahoge and maybe some duck-like lips depending on the joke at hand.This contrast works because normally the designs are either interesting or attractive. Colors capture: Seiji’s light-blue hair sticks out even more than usual for such a plain protagonist, Shikimi’s pink motif masks her vile personality. Akane’s large bosom (which the opening track’s visuals even hone in on) and Yuzu’s cute demeanor are traits that immediately appeal. And Guri dons almost one new costume per episode, going so far as to have a complete redesign after becoming a devil.Movement likewise “degrades,” skipping out on strict fluidity and replacing it instead with exaggerated motions for even more comedic opportunities. Yuzu is prone to such actions when she flails her arms in frustration or runs away in panic, but Guri can show it too when she runs with speed as Seiji holds onto her hand for dear life. The show even combines the degraded designs with the degraded movement such as when Akane cuts up a bunch of vegetables when making dinner while at Seiji’s place (with everyone else, much to her chagrin).Not to say that the art and the animation defaults to degradation all the time. Guri’s sweet scenes and Shikimi’s attacks represent a couple of examples that highlight this statement well enough. Plus, the anime goes out of its way to add additional flair where possible. Out-of-screen speech bubbles. Camera shakes. Smaller details like hearts and sparkles.A lackluster setting does hold the anime back though; the city and the school do not represent a source of intrigue since they exist to provide little else beyond an area for the characters to run around in. However, the inclusion of goofy, starry, or otherwise imaginative backgrounds continue to aid the comedy in their one-off, supportive behavior.CHARACTERSThe cast of Renai Boukun fit rather cleanly into tried-and-true roles.It has the self-insert protagonist in Seiji. It has the yandere in Akane. It has the tsundere in Yuzu. It has the genki girl in Guri. It has the sadist in Shikimi. Such roles are not inherently a negative; it’s simply an observation and an easy way to succinctly describe those in the show.Indeed, the characters rarely deviate from their associated actions. Akane threatens Seiji himself for “cheating” on her with other “homewreckers.” Yuzu acknowledges Seiji’s kindness but qualifies most of her responses with a variation of the classic “but that doesn’t mean I like you” phrase. And so on and so forth. However, what they lack in uniqueness they make up for in their connectivity and individual focus.Looking at the relationships within the harem, they have a level of interaction that brings out more comedy from them than otherwise possible. Akane does not like Guri, often calling her “stupid monkey” and conceding to the fact that the two are rivals in love. Yuzu is in love with Akane so hard that she melts into goo when the crazy woman simply kisses her (on the forehead) for the first time. Shikimi “toys” with these two female cousins of hers. Guri sees the truth within Shikimi’s soul and is arguably Yuzu’s best friend.Per the harem and the roles they play, each girl also has an affinity for Seiji himself. Akane is madly (read: insanely) in love with the lad. Yuzu cannot help but fall for him as he almost always catches her when she literally falls. Guri adores his reactions and teases him regularly. Shikimi wishes to steal him away from Akane to hurt her as much as possible.Seiji himself does not get any notable information about him, letting the anime focus on the girls instead. He is nice and normal and therefore not that interesting, but he is still a likable dude nonetheless. If only because he approaches the situation he now finds himself in with a lot of relatability. Guri annoys him to no end. Akane scares him despite the crush he has on her. He chooses to go along with Yuzu’s nonthreatening insults. He wants nothing to do with Shikimi whatsoever. So, while he takes a backseat with everyone else in the cast around, he does not go unnoticed.Related to Seiji, their feelings and wants do not appear out of thin air. Renai Boukun makes sure to not let that happen when it actively takes the time to showcase more of the backstory, the reasoning behind the affection they carry.For example, Akane earns much of that time. Growing up, her mother instilled in her the need to suppress her emotions without reservation, training her instead in the ways of the blade rather than the ways of the heart. Boys would confess their love to Akane, but she turned them down since they only viewed her in a superficial sense.She bumps into Seiji randomly one day in an alley where his cat has clawed his eyes shut (setting up an indirect joke in the moment). Without sight, he double checks that she is okay and remarks on her kindness towards him, valuing her as a beautiful person on the inside and winning her over indefinitely.Having never expressed emotion and now finding her one true love, it makes sense then that this complete 180 in her thought process turns her into the yandere of today. Even when her mother forces her back home and prevents her from ever seeing Seiji again, she cannot discard the feelings she now holds. After Yuzu’s words, Guri’s actions, and a like-mother-like-daughter bit of exposition, Akane successfully pushes back against the naysayer, finding solace in the love she shares with her blue-haired boyfriend.To reiterate, Renai Boukun investigates and expands on Akane’s past the most out of the characters, meaning the others do not have the same depth. But they receive attention nevertheless. For example, Guri is God’s daughter, but her (unknown) mother is a demon. Thus, her abilities as a cupid are not as fine-tuned as those in heaven, leading to her keen interest in love and what it means. Yuzu devotes herself to Akane after she saves her from falling in a fountain filled with vicious piranhas (pretty extreme but that’s how Shikimi operates). As for Shikimi herself, her desire to obtain what she doesn’t have and everyone else does stems from the flaunting nature of people and the need for attention that nobody gives her.Like Akane, they improve for the better, too. Guri returns to angel status when she realizes that the best part about love is having the person one loves love them back. Yuzu slowly but surely appreciates Seiji more and more. And Shikimi even seems to find a teeny, tiny bit of gratitude by the end of the season.None of the writing involved hits any high notes, but it is still nice to see the anime go out of its way to bolster its crew even if the execution isn’t all there. To that end, smaller side characters help to round out Renai Boukun. Tsuruoka, Yuzu’s (unfortunate) butler, adds a few small comedic asides. Mari, the student (somewhat secretly) in love with her teacher, shows a different kind of love. And Coraly, Guri’s heavenly guide, provides useful information now and again for the characters (and the audience).The most intriguing side character, though, is Akua, Seiji’s younger sister and therefore potential love interest.

Renai Boukun is a parody of the Harem genre: in a time where we had the Superhero\\Shonen Parodies, Adventure\\Fantasy Parodies and even Daily life parodies, we never actually had a fully developed parody of the Harem genre. Renai Boukun starts incredibly well, it takes some of the worst and best elements of the Harem genre and makes fun of them in a clever and funny way, the characters are walking parodies of typical Harem...stereotypes: we have The Yandere, The Good guy everyone falls in love with, the Tsundere eccetera...The biggest problem lies in the rundown of the show, in fact the more we good deep in the show, the more we approach the end, the more the show falls in the same Cliché abyss that it tries to make fun of, it never loses its identity but it loses a lot of steam and that entertainment shown in the first 3 episodesStory 6.25The story is simple and effective, and it should have stayed that way the entirety of the rundown, shows like these don\'t need a convoluted and serious story, however, during the end, the show  makes the enormous mistake  to take itself too seriously with a subplot that could have been easily avoided. The parody elements are quite funny, it takes a little bit of everything that we know or have seen and parodies them in a really fun way, just look at the Akane characters, she\'s a walking Yandere and Rias(HighScholl DxD) parody. Here everything is overly exaggerated  and approached in a humorous and, i have to say, kind of unique way: it\'s nothing new, but some of the directions of the story are pretty unexpected in their exaggerationCharacters 6.5The characters are, by far, the most entertaining part of the Anime, Aino Seiji is your typical  stereotype of the genuine good guy that everyone fall in love with, but everyone that surrounds him is that damn good. Akane is your typical Yandere, but she\'s so exaggerated and she\'s put in so many incredible situations, all in order to show a different take of the Yandere character and, at the same way, parody the Yandere in general. Yuzu is your typical Tsundere, she\'s bipolar and could be annoying sometimes , but if you take her as a parody of all of the Tsunderes you know and, maybe, love, if you see her in a different light, you can actually see and get what the author tried to express trhough Yuzu, a good and charming parody of the Tsundere. Shikimi is the least developed and, to be honest, her character arc is nonexistant, she\'s just there for the sexy shots and for the sadist moments, not that good. But the best character also is  the incarnation of the theme of the Anime: i\'m talking about Guri, she is the quintessential essence of the parody part of this Anime, she\'s funny, charming, she doesn\'t care about the story, spits references every 5 minutes(some really funny) and acts like she wants the story to follow the patterns of the genre, while at the same time parodying them. Too bad that Guri suffers from the same problem of all the characters and the story itself, her character arc is wasted and it takes itself too seriously, taking all of her magic and charm awaySound 7The music perfectly gets the tone and, Satoshi Motoyama really did an incredible job capturing the themes and parody aspect of the show in his compositions. The Opening, done by Wake up Girls, also is perfect fpr the show, energetic, dynamic, exagerated and over the top. The soundtrack is energetic thourghout the entire  show, never goes beyond that, and it has not the need to do it, the music\'s fine as it isAnimation and Direction 7The drawings and the art are pretty cool, the white and trasparent lines add that little bit of exaggeration needed to the characters. The frames look good but some of the drawings, especially in the background, are lackluster. The direction is standard, it\'s good but it suffers some problems, especially in the ""FanService"" shots, which become tiring really fast. The animation is solid and the bright colours fit the parody element really wellEnjoyment 7.5I had a lot of fun with this Anime, even though i didn\'t like the serious tone that the final episodes take. Comedy can be subjective, i know that, but the parody elements and, knowing the Harem genre, the way the show parodies them, makes fun of them and basically spits in some of the most famous tropes. Quick mention to some of the reactions and faces of the characters, they\'re really cool and pretty amazing at times, they have that Gintama vibe that\'s always appreciated. I laughed at some of the references, there are a lot of them, and a pretty fun time overall, i really enjoyed the jokes and parody element, and Guri was always entertaining, until the end of courseSo this was Renai Boukun, a really fun show, a really interesting parody of Harem  genre while, at the same time, being a funny take of some  of the most common characters in Anime industry. It could have been a really fun satire\\parody if it just didn\'t take itself too seriously at the end end if ti didn\'t add a characters who\'s just there for, i guess, sadistic purposes(I think). This, however, doesn\'t take that much away from what Renai Boukun really is: a nice, funny and amusing to spend your time, just turn your brain off for a little bit and enjoy this really fun ride that was ""Renai Boukun"".

I am just going to give you a straight  reviewStory 5\\10First off, its a parody of death not and a slice of life\\comedy anime so not really looking for much.  The story is based off our MC meeting Guri an angel trying to make couples. This is done through the kiss note which is essential the death note but you write two peoples names and they fall in love. This anime follows that story for a bit than focuses on the characters...more or less the second half of the anime.Characters 7\\10The character are not linear and have backstories that are explained properly or given a good shot at least. The characters besides the MC make the show worth watching. Most of them have some generic tropes along with there own spice or something totally new and the show made me laugh quite a bit.

But short notice, this series is not for children, if you are not over 15 years old, I do not recommend it, I\'m kidding. it is very funny, you must see it.Story, Characters, Animation, Soundtrack:Story: The story of this series is really interesting, it\'s quite similar to the ""Death Note"" series only in reverse, instead of doing bad things it does ""good"" things in a way. That\'s why sometimes...this series it scared me quite a lot. Anyway, the story is really quite interesting, you have to see it, you will die of laughter.Characters: The characters are extremely funny and cute, even if they have a diabolical personality, they still remain kawaii. Especially Guri-chan, but Akane-san sometimes scares me extremely hard, I can\'t understand how Seiji-san is with her. Or that angel cat, the first time it even scared me, but even now we don\'t know what happened to that penguin who talked with his eyes.Animation: The animation is really good, plus it\'s one of my favorite animations. Especially in the transformation moments it looks so good, but still sometimes it\'s too much even from this type of animation, sometimes it can scare you.Soundtrack: The Soundtrack bro is really good, I can\'t complain about it at all. I even like it in some funny and cute moments. It should always be like this in all anime.My personal opinion:This anime taught me a lot of things, no matter what, never trust strangers, even if they seem to be good or good, the appearances here can be mistaken, that\'s why we must always be careful when we see new and dubious people. However, I didn\'t really like the opening of this anime.Short opinion and rating: Master Piece 9/10 this series it scared me quite a lot.

This show tends to take the piss out of the genre.I wouldn't be so quick to classify this as a harem series. While yes there is more than two love interesting wanting this dudes D for some reason. The show focuses on two love interest the most. Akane and Guri.Akane . With Akane she is a Nice, Pretty and the main love interest of the MC. As soon as she realizes that the MC had kissed another girl she legit tries to kill him.Guri . While being my favorite character she...has the less amount love interest and character development of the two. She is an angel who cosplay's as a wanna be demon. She also has the Kiss note ( Yes it's just as it sounds ) Honestly i feel she more time on screen. And for also being a character who cosplay's she gets very little of screen time of her changing outfits.Would love to see more of this. The MC does fall into the stereotype of anime MC. I also feel this anime gets more hate than it deserves. Not great but would recommend it. has the less amount love interest and character development of the two.

Not great but would recommend it."", 'I wouldn\'t usually say such things, as I\'m a massive connoisseur of lowest-grade anime trash, but this series is atrocious even by my low standards. While some of its faults, like lack of character progression and ""jokes"" being repeated ad-nauseam, are typical for the formula, other parts can\'t be justified this easily. The main pieces of the crap puzzles are:1. Horrible pacing. The series has some moments that look cool as clips, but the whole thing is disjointed and offers no buildup for the comedic moments. Then, at the very end, it tries to provide a profound ending with some kind of emotional message that...is so unearned that felt laughable at best. It\'d be passable as purely episodic comedy, but couldn\'t even commit to that formula, ending up plainly bad at everything it does.2. Zero depth. Comedies often rely on one-note characters, but to work they also need some element of believability or charm, something that makes you ""buy"" them as people and care about what they go through. I find this cast particularly charmless and Guri as the central character that drives the plot forward is particularity lame, doing nothing that would make me like her on any level.3. Lack of chemistry. Even poorly-conceived characters can bounce of each other in a fun way if the comedic writing is good. Here, the comedy feels bland and poorly timed and the harem has nothing interesting going on, despite the outlandish fantasy elements. With poorly timed gags, bad referential humour and inability to build heroines\' stories with any emotional impact, it seems that even throwing a cupid, an assassin and a magical girl into a pot won\'t help much.I won\'t talk in length about the production quality, as it\'s mostly just average, with occasional cut corners in animation that were particularity visible/jarring. In reality, even great production quality wouldn\'t make this any less of a waste of time. Love Tyrant is not good and neither it is ""so bad it\'s good"". It\'s a cup of the blandest brand of instant noodles that spend a few months too many at the bottom of your wardrobe – I guess it\'s watchable, but unless you\'re completely desperate, you should choose pretty much anything else. is so unearned that felt laughable at best.

This sort of humor drops off pretty quickly, and isn\'t indicative of the show.As I kept watching, I found myself enjoying the show more and more. I stopped taking the (frankly repetitive) jokes so seriously and allowed myself to become more invested in the show. As an aside, there are five or six jokes that...show up at least three times in each episode, if not more. The appeal for me was that it was a show that was, in some respects, truer to life in how it portrayed it\'s MC and his thought processes. He\'s level-headed, but still cares about his friends/lovers.This is a show that I thoroughly enjoyed, but could not recommend to personal friends. Renai Boukun has an issue with repeating the same jokes and some overly rushed personal growth, but I loved it all the same. It\'s a bit campy, and shouldn\'t be taken seriously for any stretch of time. It\'s fun, the characters grow on you, despite a lack of personal growth, and a opening theme so catchy I listened to it each time. show up at least three times in each episode, if not more.

This has led to all media having a large amount of these stories becoming so recurrent that they can lose the charm quickly. For that reason, in the anime, they often seek to be different by putting fantastic elements to distinguish themselves from the crowd. That\'s what brings us now with Renai Boukun, let\'s see if it manages to excel.What is Renai Boukun about?Seiji Aino is a teenager who gets a strange girl named Guri. She tells him that she accidentally wrote him down on...her Kiss Note (""wink wink""), a notebook where if you write down the name of two people with an ""X"" in the middle, they have to kiss to fall in love because if they do not they will die Seiji is upset because he does not want to die and has to decide who will he write to kiss and fall in love with, so he chooses Akane Hiyama, the prettiest girl in his school. What was not expected is that Akane is obsessed with him and that Guri (who reveals to be a cupid) also wrote her name making the three become a couple, opening the way to many crazy situations.Do this offer something new?The plot will advance almost episodically at the beginning so that later it starts to have consistency. At first it will seem to be simple with the only mission of writing names on the Kiss Note so that Guri can fulfill his job as a cupid. That\'s fine because the main thing at the beginning of this series was the comedy, and the premise gave way to various situations to give laughter. With the progress of the chapters we see that the series begins to ambition a little more, using drama that consists of problems with the family and what is love. This is not strictly bad because it is good to see that the series aspires to be more than it shows, but leaves so aside what it showed at the beginning that one wonders if it was really necessary, there are chapters where Guri\'s work is not even mentioned and nobody seems to worry. Something curious is that at least the changes are warned with elements that are mentioned above, technically these are not things that come out of nowhere and that is to recognize, at least was interested a bit in having consistency (especially seeing that many others do not even try). It seems that in the end you end up watching a different anime, although the change is sudden, if the series had maintained its initial concepts to a lesser extent then there would not be so much trouble in this section.With the characters we find a good though questionable diversity. On the one hand Seiji is the ""rational"" character in charge of being the ""finish off"" in the tsukkomi jokes, otherwise they do not tell us anything about him, being more than anything the character so that people are inserted by having a null personality or characterization. On the other hand we have Guri, who is a fujoshi, extroverted, silly and crazy girl who acts in a random way depending on the situation in which she finds herself or provokes. It is an empty character whose appeal is focused on characterization instead of development, her very madness and lack of brain avoid her possible depth. The funny thing is that the most ""interesting"" character is Akane, who has the distinction of being a yandere expert in combat with kukris, they manage to make her funny, at least for a few chapters. She was someone who could get a lot of potential in the comedy, but she only has a joke that is repeated constantly until her arc, where they give a little depth, beginning and ending, after that it seems that her attitude changed, I am grateful for not repeating the joke, but at the same time you feel that she gets completely out of character. To finish we have Yuzu, who is only known for obsessively loving Akane (her sister who is not her real sister), otherwise there is nothing special about that.The others do not provide anything relevant so they are not worth remembering, they are just stuffed to give guidelines for some chapters or the main plot. There are even some who in the last chapter try to excel showing some kind of background, but it is so fast and hurried that you do not feel that they have told you something, apart, as they appeared until the end you can not give anything for them because probably you would not see them again The section of the characters would not be so negative if the series would not had ambition beyond being a comedy. When it introduced the drama it was when the characters fell because of how little built they were and that was what it threw everyone.If the series had been kept only as a comedy with romance being a joke as it was then, there would be no problem. The jokes at various times are fun ... the first few times. This series makes the common mistake of repeating the same jokes, transforming them from funny to annoying in a short time, without forgetting that it uses the tsukkomi humor, which can quickly become unbearable. When it decides to leave aside the comedy, drama appears and this has several disadvantages. The first one was already mentioned and it is the little construction of the characters, avoiding the empathy that you feel towards them, the Akane arc is an example of that, you can not sympathize with her because her characterization was completely a joke and at the same time did not had nothing to do with those events feeling forced in their execution. Then we have the conflict with Guri, she tries to deal with a subject as big as ""what is love?"", But crashes, to treat it so superficially and never develop it.It could be mentioned that it is not really drama and this is just another joke. If it\'s true, it\'s not a positive thing either, it\'s not funny because it really seems to want to be taken seriously. The only thing that could be considered a joke in those moments would be Guri, but, as she is, it is not a good reference either. It is impossible to take it as a drama because the tone and the constant use of ecchi avoid seeing it seriously and it would not be given the genre of comedy because it loses it with the advance of the episodes, in the end this anime has no place to fall dead.Generic animation and musicThe animation is standard, neither so good nor so bad. An interesting point is the expressive that Guri can be at different times with deformations that pull more comedy instead of bad animation or design, there are many moments and are appreciated. What can be considered a stain on these is the constant use of the ""funny"" form, its concept is understood, but neither is it so funny nor worth seeing it so many times. With the others they have a generic style that does not excel at all. Turning to animation in general there are no moments where you are surprised by what you see, the scenes of Akane using her weapons may look good, but they are a minority that can not be taken as something positive. Outside of that, resources will be used several times to present funny scenes where the characters become chibis or have fun movements. In a matter of animation and direction, it does not seek to go a step further, it remains standard and that is fine, up to a point.A similar case happens with music, which happens with more pain than glory. In many cases it will be, at best, audible. There are never any moments where you become prominent or complete for the setting, you could even see the anime without music and you would hardly notice the difference. Moving to the opening we can say that it does not come out of the generic to be a romantic comedy with elements of fantasy, the same with the ending that tries to be something more romantic, but it is still not outstanding. In the sound section you can not leave that to be desired if you never felt that you were there and that is sadder.You can not disappoint if nobody expects anything from youThe genre of romantic comedy is something so common that it could be considered cliché by itself and this anime is proof of that. It does not contribute anything to the public, even in comedy, it seeks to be taken seriously when its very construction prevents us from doing it. Nor can be taken as a comedy for its shortcomings to be repetitive and handle a mood that many would not support, and nothing feels romantic because of the poor construction and superficial way that touches the issues on which the drama is based. It was almost inevitable that it was a series of the bunch, its only characteristic, the Kiss Note, that differentiated it was quickly put aside (it could even help develop the theme better) to put what we have always seen in these stories with harem, ecchi and love triangles. Only the first episodes are worth the jokes, although they would still be taking a risk.Personal rating:3.5/10 her Kiss Note (""wink wink""), a notebook where if you write down the name of two people with an ""X"" in the middle, they have to kiss to fall in love because if they do not they will die Seiji is upset because he does not want to die and has to decide who will he write to kiss and fall in love with, so he chooses Akane Hiyama, the prettiest girl in his school.

Even while watching it I thought it was a joke thinking ""why the hell am I still watching this?"" Well, it kind of is a joke, in the sense that it isn\'t meant to be taken seriously, with the over the top absurd comedy and the out of place plot twists, but this isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. The fact that I was expecting it to be a joke actually improved my enjoyment of the show because I was expecting stuff even stupider than the silly plot twists and overly dramatic jokes. And this unexpectedly...hilarious show was tied together very well with lessons taught about giving a receiving love, which as a hopeless romantic, resonated with me (obviously not as deeply as with more serious anime, but enough to still catch me off guard given the silliness of the show). This is a surprisingly good show that I was not expecting to be good and it makes me happy. hilarious show was tied together very well with lessons taught about giving a receiving love, which as a hopeless romantic, resonated with me (obviously not as deeply as with more serious anime, but enough to still catch me off guard given the silliness of the show).

This is the arguably the most important part of a series, especially for viewers that don't follow the three episode rule.Renai Boukun starts off with a Death Note parody and a gimmick.It's funny, it's self aware, and it's for people that are familiar with the tropes and character archetypes often seen in anime. But this parody is only there to draw the viewer in, so once the parody angle gets ditched in an early episode, the anime focuses much more on poking...fun at other tropes.But this anime is mostly a fun, light-hearted stab at the harem genre. And IMO it does harem better than harem does harem.The subs are absolutely fine for this anime, but I definitely feel that Austin Tindle really captured the straight man/oblivious dickhead that is Seiji Aino in his performance for the dub, and this lends itself very well to the comedic timing.The characters do fall into the usual archetypes but a few interesting backstories and some great writing having the characters play off one another makes Renai Boukun worth watching and rewatching. I've found myself looking for clips of moments I really enjoyed to chuckle at them again.This is definitely worth your time. fun at other tropes.But this anime is mostly a fun, light-hearted stab at the harem genre.

It was used well until the end when the anime had the immortals die. Being immortal kinda means you cannot die so in it if an angel or God wants you to die you still die. It did not work in the last episode which Akane was able to kill herself to get to Hell to help the others in the harem.The relationship building between Seiji, Akane, and Yuzu was interesting. Guri was not on screen alot though when she was it was for a comedy reason most of the time.1...thing i wanted to happen that didn't was Seji getting with his sister Aqua. thing i wanted to happen that didn't was Seji getting with his sister Aqua."", 'Renai Boukun (""Love Tyrant"") is a series that I first found out about when a Facebook post gave a clip of a scene from the first episode titled ""Yandere Simulator: The Anime."" I decided to take a look at the series, and I liked the series.Story: 7/10The story involves a teenager named Seiji who is in love with a beautiful girl in his class named Akane. While he thinks that he\'d find a way to ask her out, he gets a surprise: A girl named Guri shows up and starts to turn his life upside down. She explains how she\'s a cupid from...Heaven and how she needs to pair up people through ""ships"". She subsequently ships Seiji, herself and Akane together. The series basically follows them and their friends as they go along their lives trying to deal with this harem.Art: 7/10The art was decent. Not one of my favorites, but I enjoyed it. The character models and proportions were good and some of the models were interesting to see. An example is Korari, with his angel form and his earth form, which is him possessing Seiji\'s cat, Blue.Sound: 8/10The OP and ED were nice to listen to, with the OP having a crazy yet cheerful tune, and the ED having a more soothing and romantic tune. The VA for this series was well done, and I liked the VA especially of Seiji since I felt that it matched his personality and of Yuzu since I felt the voice for a typical Tsundere was done well with her.Character: 7/10The characters are good and all, but I felt they were too much of a stock character. Seiji is the male protagonist, being a good guy and level-headed, all while trying to please the women that surround his life. Guri is the Female Protagonist, who is a Cupid/Angel who is sent from heaven to make couples and to understand what is love (Baby don\'t hurt me, don\'t hurt me... no more...). Akane is the ""Yandere"" of the series who develops feelings for Seiji when she realizes he likes her, and loves him very dearly, but she tends to pull out kukri knives to stop anyone who tries to steal Seiji, especially Guri or Shikimi. Yuzu is Akane\'s younger half-sister who is in love with Akane (both as a Sister and a Woman) and tends to be very clingy on her, but tends to be a literal ""Tsundere"" towards Seiji and gradually warms up to him. Shikimi is the sadistic and cruel cousin of Akane and Yuzu, who tends to flirt with Seiji only to do it on purpose to upset Akane.Enjoyment: 8/10The series was pretty humorous and I smiled a lot throughout the series. For the most part, it had various slice-of-life aspects (such as a beach episode) and the plot ran smoothly enough to make me enjoy the show and to want more. There were times I would get upset at certain points, such as time where Shikimi did her cruel acts to get something from Seiji or Akane. Either way, I had a nice time watching the show and I came to enjoy the scenes and most of the characters.Overall: 7/10The series felt pretty generic, but the idea of having a cupid/angel play as the ""magical girl"" was a nice touch and I was interested with how the series would play out. This isn\'t one of my favorite series, but it\'s a nice and cheerful one to enjoy. If you want a different thing out of rom-coms and harems, I would recommend this. Overall, I\'d say this was an exact 7.0 in terms of rating. Heaven and how she needs to pair up people through ""ships"". She subsequently ships Seiji, herself and Akane together. The series basically follows them and their friends as they go along their lives trying to deal with this harem.Art: 7/10The art was decent. Not one of my favorites, but I enjoyed it. The character models and proportions were good and some of the models were interesting to see. An example is Korari, with his angel form and his earth form, which is him possessing Seiji\'s cat, Blue.Sound: 8/10The OP and ED were nice to listen to, with the OP having a crazy yet cheerful tune, and the ED having a more soothing and romantic tune. The VA for this series was well done, and I liked the VA especially of Seiji since I felt that it matched his personality and of Yuzu since I felt the voice for a typical Tsundere was done well with her.Character: 7/10The characters are good and all, but I felt they were too much of a stock character. Seiji is the male protagonist, being a good guy and level-headed, all while trying to please the women that surround his life. Guri is the Female Protagonist, who is a Cupid/Angel who is sent from heaven to make couples and to understand what is love (Baby don\'t hurt me, don\'t hurt me... no more...). Akane is the ""Yandere"" of the series who develops feelings for Seiji when she realizes he likes her, and loves him very dearly, but she tends to pull out kukri knives to stop anyone who tries to steal Seiji, especially Guri or Shikimi. Yuzu is Akane\'s younger half-sister who is in love with Akane (both as a Sister and a Woman) and tends to be very clingy on her, but tends to be a literal ""Tsundere"" towards Seiji and gradually warms up to him. Shikimi is the sadistic and cruel cousin of Akane and Yuzu, who tends to flirt with Seiji only to do it on purpose to upset Akane.Enjoyment: 8/10The series was pretty humorous and I smiled a lot throughout the series. For the most part, it had various slice-of-life aspects (such as a beach episode) and the plot ran smoothly enough to make me enjoy the show and to want more.

I feel like this show shouldn't have gotten a below 7 score, but I guess too much stupidity really affects it all.I’ll say it right now, this show is dumb. Like, really dumb. So dumb that it’s one of my favourite anime’s of the season.I have read the manga and I know the events that are coming out as they unfold, but seeing it animated is a beauty to see. Don’t take this seriously. If you try to analyze andtry to criticize this anime, well, you will succeed. You’ll...find a lot of flaws with everything and find it easy to criticize it.This over-the-top harem parody anime is somewhat a nice fresh of air as it’s great to just sit down and laugh your ass off, because a comedy like this is quite hard to come by.The story itself is already dumb, it’s about a kiss note (clearly not a death note reference right?) which allows love to bloom once names have been written and those 2 people kiss. Guri, who is the “cupid”, has been put in charge of it. Seiji, our main character, has been pulled into a situation that any man would die for, but it is a living hell.Seiji’s crush is Akane, a yandere who also has feelings for Seiji. Guri writes those 2 names, they kiss, and boom easy relationship. Things seem to coast along just fine, until more girls come in. We have run away Yuzu, as well as Best Girl Shikimi. Those names are all written into the harem. Apparently you become immortal once you’re written into the book and gain powers, which is good cause if not for that trait, Seiji would’ve died already.So what happens when Seiji and Akane gets written into a book…Oh, plus like 3 other girls including Guri? Well, you get the harem that you would always want, but looking at the anime, it would make yo have second thoughts.You gotta feel bad for Seiji at least a little. He has the weirdest harem any man can hope to have, and he tries his best to treat them with kindness, despite the differences in their personality. But sometimes that kindness doesn't bode well with some of the girls.Of course this anime is not all comedy. There aren't certain points of the anime where it gets you thinking, and there are like tiny hints of drama in some parts. It takes on the topic with love most of the time, and coming to realize what love is and if you have feelings for someone. It’s interesting to see how the characters interact with each other in terms of love, but you can clearly see some characters trying to decide who they really want, but some, they seem pretty open about it (like very open).With the comedy, the slight drama, and the romantic realizations, Renai Boukun was able to deliver these certain aspects that make the story more enjoyable.Now I was quite surprised to see the studio behind this, and they haven't done many anime’s before. Some of their works are shorts, and some are just, not that good.I was kinda satisfied with their adaptation, although not “completely” faithful in terms of faithfulness, or just reorganization (which i’m pretty ok with)The art style really gives you a nickelodeon feel for some reason, the character design just feels cartoony it’s so weird XD. But of course, I got used to it over the time. But It’s pretty average and it stands out quite a bit.The sound track really fits all the scenes that it has. Not to mention the very catchy OP and ED. So I do like the soundtrack, but I wish there was more. I did hear some or lots of repeats, or maybe that’s just me.With Seiji and his harem, they need to solve conflicts together, and some characters have some thoughts on what their heart really desires.So why should you watch Renai Boukun?Pretty great comedy with “many” stupid facial expressionsGood deliverance with their story and how it’s presentedA Yandere, and a Sadist Masochist in one animeA Funny Parody of Death NoteCatchy OP, ED, and overall SoundtrackTouches on the seriousness of RomanceGuri is basically a yaoi loverA Pretty Good Harem SeriesAn interesting cast of charactersNow of course, this anime isn't the best, and it’s pretty average for its case. However, this parody, harem, and comedic type of anime is sometimes a nice catch to come upon.If you happen to like a nice parody, serious romance/comedic romance, harem, yanderes, sadists/masochists, funny faces, or very over-the top humour, then sit back, relax, and enjoy this cluster of madness. find a lot of flaws with everything and find it easy to criticize it.This over-the-top harem parody anime is somewhat a nice fresh of air as it’s great to just sit down and laugh your ass off, because a comedy like this is quite hard to come by.The story itself is already dumb, it’s about a kiss note (clearly not a death note reference right?) which allows love to bloom once names have been written and those 2 people kiss.

They’re right, as do my ratings for this 12-episode anime:Mediocre 5, Story:Well just like in any other anime with a harem genre, this was pretty much cliché in fact if you guys out there have watched “To Love Ru, Darkness”, you might say that the plot was taken from what could have been Momo’s harem plan, where the angle /devil is this cupid gone...bonkers with her job, that can be compared to that of another character from “Kaminomi” but that’s another story.Good 7, Art:Ok, so there were no very good boob flashes from Guri, but Akane and Shikimi panchira moments did make up for this plot-less anime, and that’s as good as it gets, cu’z I don’t give a fuck about everything else.Good 7, Sound:Screw the seiyuu as to whom did who, the score is just for the opening theme, titled ""Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!"" by Wake Up, Girls!.Dreadful 2, Character:Ok, so what do we have, here was a poor mixture and choreographed way as to how the characters were suppose to act in order to be  funny, the problem was that in the set of the 5 main characters, they way they were presented and executed were too  much on the off side due to all that plot holes about them, the support characters were pretty much as chaotic in the way they were presented, that one would find hard as to how they fit in, like Guri, she maybe a half angel and half demon, but she still dresses like a demon despite of being a Cupid, also, here supposed romance with Seigi was more like a double standard, where at one point she loves Seigi but doesn\'t make any attempts to thwart Akane and Shikimi from falling for Seigi, Seigi on the other hand was a big ""I DON\'T KNOW"" cu\'z he seemly acts as this character who can\'t seem to make up his mind cu\'z he is in a situation where he is a rock on a hard place, Akane, is at one point a wife material for Seigi, but oddly he is also this psycho girlfriend whom one would regret later, frankly she doesn\'t fit in that character and it would have been better if she would be tone down a bit when it come to her personality, Shikimi........well, she would have been a good 5th wheel if she isn\'t this devilish but the again she would have been better of if she is this devil that try\'s to undermined Guri\'s inheritance to being the head of hell, Now Yuzu, ok so she wasn\'t suppose to be in Seigi\'s school , so wtf did Mihoshi, Megane put her in such corny situation, also I kinda hate that she serves as this lesbian character where she competes for Akane\'s affection form Seigi.Good 7, Enjoyment:Well, it might be a chicken with its head cut off kind of thing, but it was still funny enough to be enjoyed, especially when Seigi gets to have Guri back, Man, I’d wish he dumps Akane so that if he does get killed, by her, he can be with Guri in Heaven, provided that Akane doesn’t chases him there.Poor 3, Overall:It may be funny, but the problem was that studio EMT and Original Creator , Mihoshi Megane, rely heavily on the clichés, with some parts being plagiarize from other anime/manga outfits, and frankly why have a season 2 when there’s going to be another one of these with the same thing, so…………Pres Trump OUT!!!!!! bonkers with her job, that can be compared to that of another character from “Kaminomi” but that’s another story.Good 7, Art:Ok, so there were no very good boob flashes from Guri, but Akane and Shikimi panchira moments did make up for this plot-less anime, and that’s as good as it gets, cu’z I don’t give a fuck about everything else.Good 7, Sound:Screw the seiyuu as to whom did who, the score is just for the opening theme, titled ""Koi?

This casual anime very simply story. art is worst for...2017 anime. 2017 anime."", ""TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.Renai Boukun (also known as Love Tyrant) is practically a parody to the ever so popular Death Note but in the form of a RomCom. Oh boy.Seiji Aino meets Guri and is told she'll die if she doesn't kiss someone in 24 hours, he goes for the power play and kisses her. Which wasn't the right move. At all. From here on out, he's forced into an unreasonable relationship with the self-proclaimed angel and now they're on a mission to make couples.Along the way, Seiji ends up picking...up Akane and Yuzu to add them to his harem of girls. All three girls are in relationship with him. Guri is a mischievous girl who wishes to ship yaoi couples. Yuzu is an earnest girl who wants the love of her sister, Akane, whom would kill for Seiji. Literally. With this cast of characters, a fun RomCom would be ensured, correct?Unfortunately, this is not the case.Many episodes are just filled with repetitive scenes of the same slapstick-esque gag humor that everybody seems to love. You can't go twenty seconds without Yuzu falling into Seiji's arms, Akane stabbing something, or Guri getting distracted to something she found interesting. The only time this isn't ensuing is when Seiji screws something up, so he gets monologued for about a minute by somebody (usually Yuzu) and then they set off to fix the problem. This in turn makes for a rather bland RomCom. Too much overused comedy, with the added fake and heavy romance they attempt to display is underwhelming. I guess it's worth mentioning that Shikimi, a girl who was surprisingly not added to the harem, was a major sadist.TL;DR: Renai Boukun attempted to be a funny, wacky RomCom that strayed off the beaten path at times. With really simple characters, the humor isn't as impactful as it could've been.

As you can pretty much tell from the little preface I made there. Guri is a top tier, waifu,. if you like cute, comical dere-dere types. She's goofy, cute, not overt about her feelings and all in all made the show awesome to watch.Now as for the rest of the actual show, I feel like the parodies here were a complete riot not of keijo proportions, but close. There are several nods, references and gags for the more thorough through-and-through anime watchers and manga readers here to at...least get a chuckle or two off.The plot itself is a pretty linear school harem with a few supernatural aspects here and there and I can't really grade the harem segements that well as that's not a genre I watch much, but the supernatural and comedy pieces of it hit nicely for me.What I really deeply loved about this anime --besides Guri-- is that it really has that light-hearted feel that makes your day better. I looked forward to every episode and loved it till the end.I may actually read the manga for it since the show left a great impression on me.Things I didn't like were namely Yuzu's character, she was the typical overbearing, unrequited love character that gets super annoying half-way through and then just stays that way. It detracted from my enjoyment but not enough to dread every episode though I did cringe a few times when she came up during the theme song. least get a chuckle or two off.The plot itself is a pretty linear school harem with a few supernatural aspects here and there and I can't really grade the harem segements that well as that's not a genre I watch much, but the supernatural and comedy pieces of it hit nicely for me.What I really deeply loved about this anime --besides Guri-- is that it really has that light-hearted feel that makes your day better.

But that curiosity is crushed immediately, watched 2 episode and I dropped this show. And that without a second thought. Why? because everything are joke at those point. Shallow characters representation, cliche and abnormal situation turn me off instantly. True, this anime supposed to be comedy,but I was hopping at least passable story to keep me interested.So that's how is it before, but why would I give quite good score on this? Well it turns out that I give...up too early. Because of my friend recommendation, I tried to continue where I left out. And to my surprised, started from episode 3 onward, this anime getting more interesting. Warning a little spoiler here: When I watch episode 2, I thought that's all this show will be offered for entire series. The story will be about matching other couple and not about main character relationship itself, continue with stupid joke every episode. But my first impression is wrong, because their romantic relationship will be developed.. a lot. There is a backstory for every character's behavior, and the angel is not that boring(whose my first impression on her is just stupid joker).So to make it short, this anime is romantic comedy that has gimmick and doesn't make sense at all, but behind that is decent story with good plot.

It follows pretty much in suit of a ""typical harem"" anime, a bunch of zany archetypes, Yandere, Tsundere ect ect. It has the typical big plot turn in the last two episodes which most harem anime\'s some reason feel they need to include. The episodes aren\'t distinct, the content is pretty much filler and any actual advance of the Harem is practically non-existent. It\'s only saving grace is its parodical \'pisstake\' at the deathnote style, and its occasional humorous moments, although...not in the laugh out loud kind of humour, more like the Big Bang Theory is on TV and you can\'t be arsed to find the remote.Overall the story gets a disappointing 6, and really weighs down the overall enjoyment.The art style presents itself as rather good in the first few minutes, but seems to lack a personality too it.

Still it has some good moments and aspect you could enjoy. If you enter this series not expecting too much (which would be weird expect too much from harem comedy), you can have some lighthearted ""cheaper"" comedy which actually works. My favourite part of it was probably Guri and her animations looking like egg with eyes and one hair.Story is again nothing revolutionary and every problem is solved in the end of the episode except...for last 2 episodes which is like the biggest ""plot twist"". Plot tries to parody Death Note from time to time and there are even few references throughout the show which I liked as a normie fan. Most of the characters were bearable for me and needles to say all of them were somehow extreme. I usually hate when there is MC which is constantly attacked by females or even males from jealousy like it usually is in harem anime, but it was put in a funny way like Akane with her knife so I took it with a grain of salt. If I should pinpoint  something I really despised it was MC. If he would be just another generic virgin MC it would not be such a pain in the ass. However on top of that he was even more clueless, useless, dense, dumb, bad around girls and all that other traits of useless harem MC you can think of, but multiply that all by 10! He was such an Homo Erectus he couldn’t even realize when he did something wrong even it was obvious and he was told so.To sum it up even though there is lot of things wrong and cliché, it can be still nice popcorn fun at the evening. If you gonna watch this just turn off your brain and have fun or simply choose another activity to it. for last 2 episodes which is like the biggest ""plot twist"".

People are harping hard in these reviews about it ""parodying Death Note"", but to be frank, the ""parody"" is only passing. I\'d call it more a reference than anything, and it goes full bore as a harem romcom for the vast majority. Don\'t listen to these next-level elitists who write essays when a show makes a joke out of something they like talk about how it doesn\'t match their expectations.Don\'t go in expecting a masterclass of drama; it\'s a harem romcom, and it doesn\'t try to be anything more. And it does well at...being what it tries to be. The jokes are good, the characters are alright, the story is surprisingly put-together for something of this genre, and the ending was a good one. It\'s a good popcorn flick, so just enjoy it y\'all. being what it tries to be.

Zombieland Saga was my first try, but while it had its moments it ultimately couldn\'t maintain its humor. Shinmai Maou no Testament was a worthy try, and while it has some pretty nice ""plot"" moments, it rapidly digressed into melodrama and I stopped being interested after five episodes. Would Renai Boukun do the trick and remind me of why I liked New Game so much?No.The first ten episodes were exactly what I needed to pull me out of Nana\'s forced malaise. It was cute, cheery, the...characters all had great personalities, and there was just enough world building to give me the impression that it was a well-crafted comedy--while not subtracting at all from the gags and goofs. I know the nods, homages, and parodies really made some people salty, but I thought they all fit right in with the general cheery atmosphere. And besides, the production values here were high enough that it never felt like a rip off, only a good time.And then episodes 11 and 12 happened and the show got cut off at the knees.""Comedy? Nope, let\'s add in mopey moments with a shitty subplot that\'s both generic AF but also entirely out of place"" -the producers.""Well fuck this series right into space"" -meI know I\'m extra sensitive to tone shifts in my entertainment, but I refuse to accept that it\'s impossible to just allow comedies to be comedies and dramas to be dramas. Genre-melding is always a failed endeavor because it alienates both sides in a compromising middle ground that\'s way too familiar in real life. Is escapism really that lofty a goal?Anyway if you\'re willing to only watch the first ten episodes you\'ll probably enjoy this. I wish I\'d done that.

I\'ll go over the intro first. The intro gives the song a lot of personality and up to this day I had the intro and the OUTRO stuck in my head! Honestly, I\'ve watched many more anime and I can say, usually outros suck. I think we can all agree on that. But the fact that one line from that outro had been stuck...in my head for over 1 year tells me the sound is great.The story is OK-ish? The two things that brings it down was the introduction of a certain yangire and getting into depth on Akane\'s home life. Not the fact that Yuzu is her kind-of-half sister, but her mom\'s introduction. Also, the ending. Really? About everyone\'s parents (acceptation for Seiji\'s parents, that one\'s funny) are pure trash. It ruins the story, but what saves it is the comedy.The art is perfect. All the light colors give a bouncy, playful personality to the show all in all. The attention to detail on Guri\'s ears and eyebrows distinguish her from any other anime girl. If I were to black her out and look at her silhouette, what would give her away is her ears. The only thing I would change would be to replace the chibis with The Ancient Magus\' Bride\'s chibis.The characters are great. They give off such personality and make jokes out of every trope. Akane and Seiji would be tied, Seiji being your everyday harem protagonist and says what we\'re all thinking when in that kind of situation. Akane\'s yandere-ism is took to the extent where it\'s like she\'s that one kid in a role-play wither their Mary Sue oc and has a tie between blood and love lust. The set of characters in their love (pentagon?) have such depth and personality, plus a funny overexaderation of tropes.I really enjoyed this anime, being a beginner in anime, yet I warn you, MANY PANTY SHOTS, if you aren\'t interested in that. in my head for over 1 year tells me the sound is great.The story is OK-ish?

But I have three major problems with this anime which I will get into later.So what did I like? Well, the music is pretty good actually. This anime has a pretty well made OST. The opening is catchy, and some of the songs in the anime itself are good too.I thought parodying Death Note was a pretty neat idea, having it be a kiss note instead. Akane is... Kind of a well made character. Some of it is funny. I found the anime to be decently entertaining in a general...sense.I thought it was interesting how hell was portrayed. I won't give any spoilers but I liked the way it satirized how so many people allow work to interfere with love and relationships.But there's three major reasons why this ended up getting the rating it did from me.1. Is the main character. The main character is just a dick a lot of times. Showing affection to the girls he is supposed to be in love with seems to be the most difficult thing in the world for him but he has no trouble saying incredibly mean and harsh things.2. Is that the story is really not very well done. There's not much emphasis on the romance, instead it seems more like a rescue shonen the majority of the time. The penguin B-story was incredibly stupid in my opinion and I found myself wanting to skip the scenes it was in.3. The third main reason, was because I was really disturbed at how this anime treats violence. This anime is really, really violent for a slice of life/romance anime. Now I'm not a squeamish person. I've seen some incredibly graphic animes like Corpse Party, Tokyo Ghoul, and Hellsing. But the difference is that I do feel, on some level, like all the other animes treat violence with more respect. The consequences of violence are shown, and the pain it causes is not made light of.The reason this anime disturbed me was the same reason Home Alone 2 really disturbed me once I watched it as an adult. A lot of sadistic and horrible behavior is treated as if its not a big deal. Something we should overlook as essentially childhood antics. I'm all for artistic freedom, but the way violence is portrayed in this anime disturbed me on a unique level. Not because it was super graphic (although it was surprisingly graphic sometimes), but because I got a weird feeling from watching the anime that the writers genuinely don't understand the consequences or gravity of this kind of behavior.I'm not gonna say that anyone who enjoys this is a bad person, or that the writers necessarily are. But it honestly rubbed me the wrong way and dramatically impacted how much I enjoyed watching it. sense.I thought it was interesting how hell was portrayed.

Starts off fairly well, then changes about halfway through. Has an awesome cast of characters with a well done Yandere, of which I am partial.The story might have been alright but it sort of falls apart about halfway through. The start of the show introduces a female angel who is working as a cupid. She accidentally writes down our MC's name in a notebook which is a parody of the DeathNote book. This sparks the start of our show with Cupid and the MC using the LoveNote to create couples.About...halfway through the show however the concept of coupling people together is no longer the focus. This was strange because they went to great lengths at the start of the show to make it the obvious premise. There was complex rules and penalties for not following them. However they decided to change it up and add a bit of drama. They introduced a new character who likes to ruin other peoples relationships. They also add in a heaven and hell based problem too which just adds to the drama.The art was nicely done. The opening song was catchy and the character soundtracks were pretty good too.The characters were lots of fun and where I think this show regains a lot of points. The main character was a typical average joe harem guy. The girls however were a bit new, or at least not used as often in the harem genre. You have the red headed yandere who is great. The Blonde haired girl loves the red headed yandere. The Cupid angel who is into yaoi and is very energetic. Then you have the pink haired girl who is supposed to be a temptress and sexy. They sound flat based on what I said here and depending on the person they might be. I however enjoyed the casts interaction with each other. If this show followed a more slice of life pace I'm sure they would have turned out a bit better.Overall I enjoyed this anime enough to give it a higher score. The characters really sold it for me as I really hated the direction they took the story in the second half of the show. The shows biggest flaw is its lack of depth. They started with what seemed like an episodic slice of life show about love and relationships. However that doesn't get much time to develop, and we are thrown into character drama without much character development. This makes this part of the show feel shallow and poorly planned. Overall I liked it because I wanted to see how the relationship worked out between all the characters. I'm sure a lot of people wont like it though, so I would recommend watching the first episode and if you don't like It don't bother watching the rest. halfway through the show however the concept of coupling people together is no longer the focus.

The animation was honestly flawless and it was just great to look at. Didn\'t bother me once.Sound/Music 8: The opening and Ending are awesome. The opening may be the best of the season IMO. The BGM was on point and just random moments with Guri playing music was hilarious.Character/VA 9: They were different which I thoroughly enjoyed. They were definitely Unique characters.Enjoyment 10:...Probably my favorite anime of the season. It gave me everything I wanted.Overall View:If there\'s one thing I can say about Renai Boukun is that this anime was so well balanced. Between Fan Service, Action, and Comedy moments it was very well done. Even when it came to the fan service it was not over the top. The action though was on point at times but never went that extra step to get too serious. Even the Drama in the anime was very well done.Guri was one of the funniest characters of the season in my eyes, she made me laugh literally every episode.If you\'re looking for an anime with great balance and near perfect animation I would recommend Renai Boukun.

An anime where characters actually kiss. I guess that is a strength amongst of countless harems where MC never kiss your favorite ship....- Concept. Death Note. Kiss Note.

I personally think this anime had potential if they took the plot and idea more seriously. There are literally Death Note fanatics who breathe and aspire to be like L and Kira.

The gags inbetween are totally tryhard. The dubbed version is specially mo~re shitty then the subbed one. The character design is not that great too.It would have been great if they added the harem element slowly as the story progressed and not just plug it all in the 1st episode.The later episodes are fine but...i am pretty sure the viewers lose intrest and just drop it thinking its a complete trash.

It shows how passionate a yandere can be to her beloved. In addition to having an amusing take on the yandere, Love Tyrant’s slapstick comedy also brings plenty of laughs which made the series interesting to watch. However, as the anime went on, it degraded into another regurgitation of a plot from other harem anime and disappoints people who were expecting something new from this series. The anime’s story becomes bland and feels dragged and its...static characters ultimately become annoyances, making the anime a chore to watch. Although Love Tyrant gives good laughs and innovates the heroine roster by adding a yandere to it, the anime destroys its initial charm by introducing a bland story partway through the series.At first, the plot of Love Tyrant seemed interesting with its parody of Death Note, but in a short while, it abandoned this concept. The Death Note parody should have been kept because using this concept, the anime was able to deliver many clever jokes and plenty of slapstick comedy that made the show funny and interesting to watch. But, after a couple of episodes, this idea was dropped in place for a melodramatic romantic series of events that usually happen in a typical harem anime. Thus, Love Tyrant turns into a bland story halfway through and this sudden shift in story introduces the audience to a whole different plot which in turn, confuses viewers and decreases any initial interest in the anime.With concern for its characters, Love Tyrant’s static characters benefit the comedic aspect of the anime. The main characters, Guri and Aino Seiji, made an amusing jokester and straight man duo. Along with the yandere, Akane Hiyama, the tsundere character, Yuzu Kichougasaki, and a cast of other side characters, the anime creates an interesting heroine roster and seemingly produces a comedy-focused harem anime. But, after the story changed, these characters continue to be static which made the rest of the anime aggravating to watch. It bothers the viewer to the point where she wants to punch each character in the face because the characters themselves and their relationships with each other don't seem to change at all.Regarding the art and music, the anime does have flashy animations that captures the charm of each heroine. The soundtrack also enhances the hilarity of comedic scenes and pulls on viewers’ heart strings during romantic sequences.Although Love Tyrant charms its audience with its unique heroines, clever comedy, and flashy animation, this anime is a satisfying watch to an extent. Because it abandoned its initial story in place with a plot with melodramatic romance, Love Tyrant destroyed the foundation that may have made it stand out from many harem series and conformed to other everyday harem anime.

The first episode really pulled me in. I was amazed with the humor and pulling in ideas from other shows. I thought this would be one of the greatest shows of the season.However that is where it ended. Instead I got a half assed show with boring, lame characters that never got developed. Sadly the only character that got developed was Guri.The rest of them I could care less about. Renai Boukun went downhill fast after the first episode. With nothing but poorly executed episodes trying to...push some bull shit of friendship, finding yourself, etc.This show slowly became a pain to watch.

I dreaded having to watch the new episode since I knew it would only let me down.I will say that it did add a new twist to the romcom. I just wish it was done better.Overall, I did not enjoy the show and I would not recommend it to others.', ""Warning possible SpoilersNow having watched Death Note myself and Love Tyrant being a parody of it that was pretty much my only reason for watching it and there was actually some enjoyment to gain from it.The story begins with Seiji Aino who is interrupted by a Cupid called Guri who need's him to kiss somebody in 24 hours before she dies, Keiji decides to chose Akane Hiyama a sweet, innocent girl who is really a Yandere however during the kissing process Guri added herself with them in her Kiss Note and now Seiji and Akane have to help her with her cupid business.If there's one...thing that Love Tyrant doesn't do great is it's story as the whole cupid business that Guri, Akane and Seiji had to do is quickly swept aside before the halfway episode and basically becomes like a harem anime where some of the girls start fighting over Seiji for attention while also having some arcs where the girls have their own problems to deal with like Akane and Yuzu's family issues which also involved their mothers because they didn't support what was going on or the fact that Guri doesn't know anything about love so Seiji has to help her understand it though he doesn't do a great job and she ends up becoming a demon until he says the right things to her, yeah the story isn't done well and was a pretty bumpy ride although the story isn't really the strongest part of the anime anyway it relies more on the comedic actions of the characters and using references to other things I mean this is a parody.It was actually pretty funny seeing the gang doing ridiculous things that always ended up getting everyone hurt, yes for once it wasn't the MC that suffered and instead because of some peoples actions if pretty much affected everyone, although what the story did do right was it showed us an interesting viewpoint of what heaven and hell might look like which was pretty funny and how important the concept of love is to everyone and what it means to them which is what Guri and even Seiji has to learn.The characters were a pretty mixed bunch luckily I liked most of them and each of them definitely has their own level of weird and craziness.Seiji Aino is the male MC and is pretty much like your usual Harem protagonist which consist's of a dense personality although he does see the feelings that some of the girls have for him except Guri since she is very random plus he also has a very short temper often shouting at Guri if she does something wrong or annoying or when it comes to Akane shivering in fear because of her extreme Yandere nature, however he isn't annoying just stupid sometimes as some problems happen because of his indecisive behaviour.Guri is the female MC and is a Cupid who goes around with her Kiss Note creating random couples, she is a very active yet lazy person and does things by her own accord since she doesn't follow orders very well which is a huge hindrance to Seiji since she always ends up dragging him and the others into bad situations that they have to clean up however despite being a cupid she doesn't fully understand the concept of love so seeing her trying to get past these problems like heartache or jealousy was actually interesting to see.Akane Hiyama is another female MC who is obsessively in love with Seiji as he was the only person who has made her feel love for anyone, however her love goes to the point of being a Yandere and she will pretty much kill anyone who tries to make a move on Seiji so being in a forced harem isn't really the best thing for her, her personality can change rapidly from being sweet, kind and protective to going into a bloodlust nature depending on who pisses her off which most of the time is Guri , though despite her Yandere nature she does have a troubled upbringing as her mother made her to be a cold person so seeing her overcome her mother's family traditions was actually pretty inspiring.Yuzu Kichougasaki is another female MC that got caught up in the harem except this time it was because of Akane instead of Seiji, Yuzu has feelings for Akane and joined because of her even though they are half-sister's however Akane only see's her as a good friend and always makes her love go unrequited, she can be pretty annoying sometimes mainly because she always goes into a fit if Seiji tries to do something with Akane though there are times where she can be a likeable character like her relationship with Guri which made them a pretty funny duo and other time she does actually start developing feelings for Seiji which does put her into a state of confusion.Shikimi Shiramine is both the cousin of Akane and Yuzu, she is an absolutely terrifying person who is an even worse Yandere than Akane mainly because Shikimi wanted to be noticed and loved by someone which she never got so instead she tries to steal things from everyone hence why she tries to mess with Seiji whenever she can get him alone because she enjoys messing with Akane's feelings too, she is very flirtatious and is very good at disguising herself well from anyone who isn't Seiji, Akane or Yuzu who recognise her instantly, she can also be very devious always luring her prey and slowly torturing them afterwards.Akua Aino is the younger sister of Seiji and does appear from time to time in the series, she is a tomboy Tsundere and always ends up arguing with her brother mainly because of the predicament he's in and how it is affecting their relationship too though overtime she does start to grow more attached to the girls after they help her multiple times from being attacked by Stola's who is a demonic penguin yeah I'm not joking.The artstyle is compared to some other anime's pretty smooth and some of the hairstyles on the characters like Yuzu and Seiji looked like play doh for some reason like I could touch it and it would just fall off of their heads, it was also interesting seeing the versions of heaven and hell in this anime, heaven just looked like what is usually portrayed in cartoons which is clouds and a bright sun while hell looked like a city with an incredibly gloomy atmosphere which is pretty much what it should be like.The comedy was actually pretty good as Seiji did suffer quite a lot from the girls, but the girls also had their setbacks too as Akane and Guri were always fighting for being the dominant girl for Seiji while Yuzu always fought against Seiji so she could be with Akane and then Shikimi would just come in and destroy everyone, pretty much most of the time everyone is getting knocked around by someone or something.While this is also a parody there are a lot of references to not just Death Note, but a lot of other things like in one episode where the gang went to the school at night there was a lot of horror references and even a Ghostbusters reference and there was even a point where the show took a stab at anime censorship like the beam of lights and convenient steam that would always block the private parts of a person.The Romance was pretty much a mess and I say that in a good way because even thought everyone is constantly fighting for someone in the group there are genuine moments where there is some sentiment like when Akane is trying to show her mother that being in love isn't a bad thing and Guri is trying to figure out how she feels for Seiji which she finds out the answer by the end of the series so amidst all of the fighting there are some nice moments although they do tend to get interrupted by someone.Overall this was an ok series not great, but not bad either. I'm unsure whether I want to see a season 2 though I am interested where this group will go after the last episode and makes me wonder if they'll concentrate on other characters since Guri seems to have accomplished her goals, well we're just gonna have to wait. thing that Love Tyrant doesn't do great is it's story as the whole cupid business that Guri, Akane and Seiji had to do is quickly swept aside before the halfway episode and basically becomes like a harem anime where some of the girls start fighting over Seiji for attention while also having some arcs where the girls have their own

Hahahaha"". Well that\'s mostly what I can say for a short review since the comedy factor of this always catches you off guard. If you want a longer review, then continue reading.Renai Boukun or ""Love Tyrant"" as it is translated, is about a demon main character whose job is to make couples by writing their names using a ""Kiss Note"" and they would immediately fall in love. Well.. that doesn\'t seem like it\'s not directly parodying anything. So regarding the...story, it was an average plot that met my expectations but it didn\'t fully satisfy me because it seemed to be a little rushed. It\'s not that bad but it could\'ve been better if it took its time with the character development. Over the course of watching it, I can happily say that some scenes cause you to burst in laughter because the comedy really knocks the story off course. I like how it does some parodies of certain things and since the main character has a straight attitude, it enhances the comedy factor. Overall, the anime has a lot of good points and you will enjoy it if you  like watching comedy. story, it was an average plot that met my expectations but it didn\'t fully satisfy me because it seemed to be a little rushed.

It is a harem-based anime, but with a slight (detached admittedly) spoof on deathnote.  The show is pretty fast paced and the main character is slightly dull, but somewhat relatable.If you are not a stickler to the manga (I have not read it, but seen the complains), expect this to be some monumental parody of deathnote, or have an aversion to fast-paced plot, then I believe you will enjoy this anime quite a bit.This show openly mocks the harem genre and does it well in my opinion.  I haven't a lot to say...other than this anime is a good time if you don't go in thinking it will be some kind of masterpiece; that kind of outlook and expectation ruins almost any anime that isn't like 1 in 500 or 1 in a 1000.This anime has a ridiculous plot, a fast-pace (which I like if coherent), enjoyable quips, and a pretty likable cast of characters.  If you are considering watching it, you should give it a shot. other than this anime is a good time if you don't go in thinking it will be some kind of masterpiece; that kind of outlook and expectation ruins almost any anime that isn't like 1 in 500 or 1 in a 1000.This anime has a ridiculous plot, a fast-pace (which I like if coherent), enjoyable quips, and a pretty likable cast of characters.

Things move really fast. Characters are completely\xa0ridiculous\xa0in terms of personality and actions. And the story is all sorts of\xa0wack\xa0filled to the brim with really random things. The thing is, that for a good portion of it, this works incredibly well. When the show is just being light hearted amusing randomness,\xa0it\xa0makes it all the more amusing. I really enjoyed the crazy love polygon, helping random couples, the...crazy penguin, immortality related\xa0weirdness, and the\xa0ridiculous\xa0amount of\xa0sudden\xa0kissing. Other than Seiji, the main characters are all crazy, but it’s really fun just to watch them be crazy with Seiji as a foil to the craziness. The humor is great and had me literally laughing out loud pretty often. This portion was hilarious, amusing, and greatly enjoyable. But, though this is how it starts, as it goes on this lessens in favor of focusing more and more on more intense and dramatic storytelling with that pretty much completely taking over at the end. However, it doesn’t become less chaotic. While with the more amusing parts you can just kind of turn your brain off and go along with it and have fun, that’s not really possible when you feel you’re supposed to be taking things seriously. The characters being chaotic now feels like them being inconsistent with motivations that aren’t clear, and the plot that arises as a result of this feels incredibly contrived and forced. It being really fast paced now feels rushed, with it feeling like it’s not properly explaining things and being hard to follow at times. It also seems to bring up random plot points related to characters that\xa0aren’t fleshed out properly and hence feel pointless. The crazy mechanics such as immortality just don’t seem to work well and the plot where such things should matter seems kind of off as a result. The ending while satisfying enough in general, comes at the peak end of all this, and hence really wasn’t all that enjoyable.

This anime did try to make jokes about these things, but on the wrong place and on the wrong time. This anime tries to break the ice in serious situations, but it gets annoying when you're trying to convey the plot to the viewer while making them laugh at the...same time.Also, don't get me started on the main characters.

It will go from one place to another in a matter of minutes. I overall had mixed feelings about Love Tyrant, so I am giving this a 7, as I felt a 6 would be too harsh..STORY: 6/10From the story aspect itself, I wasn\'t too fond of this. Just in the first episode, my head was so filled up with what was going in in a few minutes that I couldn\'t even pay attention. We are introduced to so many characters and other things at once you can\'t...even tell what is going on. But other episodes, the plot is slower. The plot speed varies from episode to episode and it can be problematic to have to pay attention to this. I feel like in some episodes it tries to shove everything down the viewer\'s throats that I feel bored. But this only happened occasionally.ART: 8/10Rarely can anime mess up on art. And Love Tyrant wasn\'t an example of anime that messed up on its art. But I wasn\'t sure about the outlining of the drawings, as they aren\'t the usual black. They are a grey-ish color that I just had to get used to. The art was overall very consistent, but sometimes the eyes can be painfully small and the color contrasts can be weird. One example was Yuzu\'s hair color with her eye color. I found this combination way too vivid for me but it was fine.CHARACTERS: 5/10This has to be the only problematic aspect of the show. Akane Hiyama was my favorite, so I will exclude her from this.Seiji Aino is your usual harem protagonist, and he was even called this in the show itself! The only exception is he has blue hair. Wow! So creative! Instead of giving him good traits, EMT Squared decides to let him get trampled on by all the girls and he won\'t react to this at all.Yuzu Kichougasaki was a character I thought I\'d like. But little did I know she was just another bitchy tsundere. She always complains so much and causes tension between the characters. Also her voice is annoying to hear and for a high/middle schooler, it sounds childish. Keep in mind I watched the dub.Akua Aino was really annoying. The thing is, her personality never develops. She is in a constant state of hatred for her brother Seiji and never even shows a bit of gratitude. She always assumes her brother is just screwing his ""harem"".And lastly, our main girl Guri. No matter how nice Seiji is to her, she always finds problems. I finally found the issue with most of these characters; they manage to make an issue out of everything. She is always causing issues. I have only liked her as a character for a few episodes.All of the girls in the show beat the poor man for no reason, even if it\'s simply because he doesn\'t follow their orders or refuses to do something insane. I couldn\'t even stand them.ENJOYMENT: 7/10It was okay. I would watch this again but have to forget the awful characters.OVERALL: It was okay. Just okay.MY ADVICE: If you don\'t pay attention to the characters too much, you\'re all set. even tell what is going on. But other episodes, the plot is slower. The plot speed varies from episode to episode and it can be problematic to have to pay attention to this. I feel like in some episodes it tries to shove everything down the viewer\'s throats that I feel bored. But this only happened occasionally.ART: 8/10Rarely can anime mess up on art. And Love Tyrant wasn\'t an example of anime that messed up on its art. But I wasn\'t sure about the outlining of the drawings, as they aren\'t the usual black. They are a grey-ish color that I just had to get used to. The art was overall very consistent, but sometimes the eyes can be painfully small and the color contrasts can be weird. One example was Yuzu\'s hair color with her eye color. I found this combination way too vivid for me but it was fine.CHARACTERS: 5/10This has to be the only problematic aspect of the show. Akane Hiyama was my favorite, so I will exclude her from this.Seiji Aino is your usual harem protagonist, and he was even called this in the show itself! The only exception is he has blue hair. Wow! So creative! Instead of giving him good traits, EMT Squared decides to let him get trampled on by all the girls and he won\'t react to this at all.Yuzu Kichougasaki was a character I thought I\'d like. But little did I know she was just another bitchy tsundere. She always complains so much and causes tension between the characters. Also her voice is annoying to hear and for a high/middle schooler, it sounds childish. Keep in mind I watched the dub.Akua Aino was really annoying. The thing is, her personality never develops. She is in a constant state of hatred for her brother Seiji and never even shows a bit of gratitude. She always assumes her brother is just screwing his ""harem"".And lastly, our main girl Guri. No matter how nice Seiji is to her, she always finds problems. I finally found the issue with most of these characters; they manage to make an issue out of everything. She is always causing issues. I have only liked her as a character for a few episodes.All of the girls in the show beat the poor man for no reason, even if it\'s simply because he doesn\'t follow their orders or refuses to do something insane.

Just okay.MY ADVICE: If you don\'t pay attention to the characters too much, you\'re all set.', ""I'm a huge fan of this one specifically the dub. I found it right after My First Girlfriend is a Gal. Had a colorful cast of characters. Akane is my personal favorite Voiced by the talented Amber Lee Connors who also voices Pieck from AOT and Mei Mei from JJK. Guri is also great voiced by Jad Saxton also known as Sena from Haganai. I found Yuzu the lesbian a little annoying but she has her moments voiced by the Goat Monica Rial. The story is basically a parody of Death Note which is funny. The soundtrack is great, and the opening slaps. If you...havent seen it I highly recommend this one. havent seen it I highly recommend this one."", ""Our shut-in, no real friends virgin main character is visited by a cupid dressed more like a grim reaper.

What I actually found interesting that at first, it wasn't actually a super lewd anime like To Love Ru or Infinite Stratos, and it actually had me surprised when they showed intimacy in the show without actually including the main character (I'm talking about the class pres and the...teacher here). I also feel like they could've done more and explained what Stolas is, why he is a penguin, and why he is particularly interested in Akua, or explain how Shikimi has those powers, what her branch family is like, and how she hasn't already taken over everything. I get that it's supposed to be a comedy and not meant to be taken too seriously, but for me, I could really only find joy in speculating the things that weren't really explained in the end. (References were decent, the comedy was not my cup of tea, but it did have moments when it was funny)Art: 5I actually didn't find anything wrong with the art at first, or how the characters looked, but sometimes you can find things at certain times which makes you question if the animators really paid attention or not, for example, episode 10 on 10:27 Seiji's legs are somehow inverted and the shadows are unusual as well, this one really caught my attention, besides that I could only complain about how sometimes the characters' eyes were sometimes a bit too high but that's easier to miss, so now I'm just venting.Sound: 4It mainly just used cheesy soundtracks so that didn't really get me anywhere, there was one song near the end of episode 6 that was decent but I couldn't really find anything about it, because the only song that the anime actually has is its opening...Character: 3Quite poor, even if they're literal representations of their own tropes, I don't think they were likable at all, or at least at first, the only interesting character development we ever got was Akane actually noticing Yuzu's existence and Akua kicking Stolas I guess? Besides that we've got :Yuzu starting to fall in love with Seiji (It's a harem anime, what do you expect?), and Guri trying to understand love, then trusting the same girl that once tied her friends up in front of her and tried to kill them. (I'm sorry if I come off rude, but Guri really was a nuisance at the beginning of the show, I saw no redeeming qualities later, but I guess we were meant to feel bad because she didn't get any attention? And that she actually trusted that kleptomaniac??? It's gotta be her own fault for being this oblivious I swear.)Enjoyment: 4There were definitely times where I stopped to think if this anime is going to better or not, and most of the times I was proven wrong, it rarely made me laugh, more-or-less actually annoyed at times (Comedy is subjective, forgive my shitty humor and me not enjoying this show) but the ending wasn't bad nor really good at all, it was a convenient way of ending the show, but in the end, it didn't make me hate it as much as I did, maybe the 12 episodes were enough to make the characters bearable at the very least from my perspective. (Except Shikimi)Overall: 4At most I would give it a 6 but with the plotholes, and some other minor mistakes I decided I would give it either a 4 or 5, then rated each piece of the anime (by that I mean story, art, etc.) and decided on a 4.

The art is fine and there\'s some decent character growth for some of them but the ending is weak as well as the main plot and the pacing is very jittery and nonsensical.It would have been better served with embracing fully the comedy andnonsense because that\'s when the show is at it\'s best but it tries too hard to act serious much too often at the ""plot points"" and falls flat on its face every time because of how shallow the underpinnings for those serious moments are.Bad but still worth a watch if clips of it or something about...it intrigues you. it intrigues you.', 'Trials and tribulations of the modern otaku reduxLove Tyrant is one of those anime that’s all over the place for me. On one hand it’s a parody of all too familiar character tropes. That I loved because then the story had to be tight unify these ridiculous elements. And in those episodes I saw the appeal of the show and understood why it was made. It was funny, the action was intense, and the drama was tense. Not to mention sexy at times. On the other hand, it’s a parody so it runs the clichés pretty hard. And when it does the plot and story...that brought all these characters together goes out the window. Thus becoming the very thing it intends to mock. And when the story isn’t moving it isn’t interesting. And when it isn’t interesting, I don’t want to watch it. Even the shit with his sister and the penguin was funny and interesting. But it’s yet another series that has action & comedy & sexy & drama & romance. Like Kill La Kill. Too much to not excel at one, but enough done well enough to justify recommending this series. And there it is, that’s the paradox. Who do I recommend this to? I can’t envision a target audience for this series. Teenage boys with a yandere fetish? If I were to ask me, “Should I watch Love Tyrant; yes or no?” I’d be forced to answer, “No.” It’s okay and has it’s moments, but you could get your kicks elsewhere and not be sorry for it.

But Oh Boy does Love Tyrant have some disappointment in store for you, sitting right there on the top shelf behind the glass doors of the security case! It's on clearance, too; no refunds, no exchanges.Now surely it can't be as bad as I'm building it up to be, right? I must be way off, I just forgot to turn my...brain off and ended up taking it way too seriously when Love Tyrant didn't even bother taking itself seriously, so this is just me being a Salty Sandra, right?Well, you tell me.I've managed to narrow down exactly what Love Tyrant does wrong and why it ends up the Jonestown Massacre it is by asking three key questions:1: Why did they ignore the fundamentals?In every harem, there is always a main girl, and protocol is typically to place the first girl the MC meets in that role. This anime places the Second girl in that role. Is that bad? No! In fact it's nice to have the trope subverted. The problem lies with the type the second girl is: she's a yandere. She is not sweet, she is not kind, she's an obsessive, violent berserker with no regard for human life. That is the exact opposite of the kind of girl you need as a stable main when building a harem. Yanderes are bad enough on their own, but they don't work as part of a harem and as the main, the girl at the core of the harem, it's a relationship structure designed to implode on itself.2: What are characters?None of the respective girls' redeeming qualities actually outweigh their faults except the little sister: Yuzu's moments as a true friend and voice of reason never have much of an impact when her role is basically to be a loud, squeaky third wheel. The fact that Guri is the life of the party hardly makes up for the fact that the party is nonstop cat fighting, conflict and constructing gay relationships on the spot for her own amusement. Then there's Shikimi, who doesn't even care about Seiji but wants to be included in the Love Club and does horrible things to everybody because she's an irredeemable attention whore. And of course, Akane is a jealous murder hound with a generous amount of sand up her pussy who stabs everybody at the slightest provocation. Imouto Akua, meanwhile, is a basically normal little sister who kind of resents the fact that her brother doesn't pay as much attention to her as he used to...oh yeah and she's being chased by a demonic rapist penguin. Basic Japanese Girl Problems, right? But that aside, she's just your average tsundere imouto, which is a breath of fresh air in comparison to all the legal, non-blood related women in Seiji's life. And when all the choices are basically shit compared to your sister, that is how you know you've Had Gone Done Been Went and made a gosh derned mistake there, buckaroo!3: What is pacing?!It's an established practice with adaptations to change the order of events so that the adaptation can wrap up one way or another. I have not read the source material so I'm uncertain if this is the case with Love Tyrant, but one thing is for certain: the placement of events is terribly weak and the directors chose this order for a reason: they were aiming for the harem ending. I saw it coming when episode 8 finally gave Seiji and Akane's relationship the validity it needs to function, made Akane human and relatable, and this is the point where I nearly dropped the series. I should have, and I recommend you do if you decide to watch this abomination, because it was a decisive, moving plot arc that felt like a series finale. They could have ended the show on a high note by making episode 8 episode 12 instead of dropping it slap bang in the middle and pulling the worst pump and dump on a relationship I have ever seen. First they cracked Akane's shell and made me care about her and gave her so many Best Girl points it was practically no contest, and then immediately took them all back and left her as we met her: a god damned nutcase that'll slit your throat if another woman so much as brushes up against you by accident (comedy at it's finest, people!)In closing, I guess it's not the absolute worst I've ever come across. The visuals are nice, I guess and it managed to keep me watching somehow. But good GOD, I'm gonna need a long shower to wash this one off me.Oh, and what's a Kiss Note, you ask?
