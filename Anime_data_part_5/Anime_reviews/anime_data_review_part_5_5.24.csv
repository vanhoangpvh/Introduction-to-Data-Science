Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume (1998),https://myanimelist.net/anime/375/Bannou_Bunka_Neko-Musume_1998,"[""This is one of the most under-rated anime series of all time, do not let it's low average score fool you, this is buried treasure right here.Story (7/10) -The story to Nuku Nuku is very simple - Nuku Nuku is a cat in a humans body and is an android. She goes to high school, and fights the evil Mashima Industries. That's about it. This anime is episodic, meaning that things happen by the episode, so don't expect any story arcs here.Art (9/10) -The art is a bit dated, but very well pulled off. All the colors and character designs are fitting, and the animation...quality is wonderful.Sound (9/10) -The sound is great. All the character's voices fit and the sound effects are also fitting. The only complaint I have is that often one male main character sings, and his voice gets very old, very fast.Character (8/10) -Nuku Nuku is really one of my favorite characters of all time. She is extremely cute and has a very good personality that anybody will grow to love within a few episodes. The other characters are great too, and are all funny in their own way.Enjoyment - (10/10)I enjoyed this series massively. Thus the 10/10 rating. I really think if you give this anime a chance, you will love it as much as I do.Overall - (9/10)This is a great series that is very under-rated. If you have an open mind and aren't expecting very much, you will love this anime. quality is wonderful.Sound (9/10) -The sound is great.

During that review I mentioned that, in addition to the OVA, there are multiple TV anime. The first was written by Yamaguchi Hiroshi based on the manga by Takada Yuzo. The Studio behind it was Ashi Productions, which was not the same studio behind the OVA. Let's take a look and see if it's as bizarre and humorous as the OVA.Story:There's no over-arcing story. The premise is that our cat-brained android protagonist, Nuku Nuku, begins attending High school in order to learn what it means...to be human. Complicating matters is the battle she has to wage against the evil Mishima industries. Naturally, this leads to wacky hijinks. Probably a good move since a more serious look at the basic premise would almost certainly be terrible.Overall, the humour does work pretty well. There are a lot of running gags, but they almost all get enough variation in execution that they do stay consistently funny. I also like the way they handle Mishima, with the young president having everyone dress in ridiculous costumes and going into rants about ruling the world while his employees just kind of go along with it because it doesn't interfere with them producing things too much and he's in charge. The series has a good blend of outlandish elements and ordinary elements that lends itself very well to comedic situations.That being said, there are some failings to it. The biggest one is the final episode. I won't spoil it, but they try to have a more dramatic moment and it utterly fails. While it is possible to have a comedy with serious scenes, it doesn't work when you have all of one such moment in a series comprised almost entirely of zany antics. There are also some jokes that aren't really funny. For example, one of the reoccurring jokes is having twins declare the snobby rich girl to be correct. It's funny because.... they're minions, I guess? The opening narration is also repeated every episode. The first time, it is a funny moment, pointing out the discontinuity between the TV series and the previous OVA. The other eleven times, it just seems like needless padding.Characters:This is one of those comedic series where the characters are almost exclusively one-dimensional stereotypes. The series, oddly enough, elects to have captions telling you those traits, which they use multiple times. That being said, the specific character tropes that the series uses do mesh well together for comedic purposes. Even the twins manage to have some funny moments on those few occasions when they get more dialogue aside from their standard line.Art:The TV series has basically the same early 90s art style as the OVA, in spite of coming out five years later. It is a little smoother and more detailed, but not the marked improvement you would expect. Possibly because they wanted to emulate the look of the original OVA as much as they could. It doesn't look bad, but it hasn't exactly aged gracefully. This series also does a lot less with unnecessary fan-service. By which I mean it really doesn't have any. About the closest you get is a beach scene but there's really nothing sexualised about it so I would hesitate to call it fan-service.Sound:The voice acting is excellent. Hayashibara Megumi reprises her role as the titular cat-brained android. Ikura Kazue, Hiramatsu Akiko, Kamiya Akira, Shimazu Saeko and Hisakawa Aya all reprise their roles as well. The acting is surprisingly subtle for a zany comedy, occasionally moving into exaggeration but largely featuring realistic emotions and responses. Odd that a comedic series can have more varied and realistic emotional content than a certain serious series could manage.There are multiple musical numbers within the episodes, including a karaoke episode and a musical episode. Most of the songs do sound, minimally, decent. Some are outright excellent, Hayashibara Megumi's numbers in particular. Some are deliberately bad and used for comedic effect. Fortunately, those are in the minority so they never really get tiring.Ho-Yay:The closest thing you get to ho-yay in this series is the dynamic between Chieko and her minions. At least in the latter episodes when they start getting varied dialogue. There's also one kind of gross joke involving possession and an alien mouse. The Ho-yay factor is a 2/10.Final Thoughts:Nuku Nuku TV is a fun little series. It has a good sense of humour, excellent acting & superb music. Where it falls a little short is that some of the jokes fall flat, it tries and fails at having a serious scene and most of the characters are pretty bland. Which isn't a huge issue for a comedy, but it's still a bit of a problem. All in all, the OVA was a little better but this is still good for some laughs. Final rating, 7/10.

.hack//Intermezzo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1143/hack__Intermezzo,"['I actually had watched .hack//SIGN in 2007, and didn\'t find it too crash hot. I don\'t think at the time, I had realized that there were more .hack series apart from Legend Of The Twilight and Roots, so I never got round to watching Intermezzo, and the others.STORY: Couldn\'t really remember much from the main SIGN series, and I was reminded today about how. .. average the story line was. Of course this is only a one episode special, so there wasn\'t much to it; Mimiru drags along Bear to check for something in a temporarily re-opened dungeon in The World. I mustn\'t have been...paying attention because of the overall story line, because I hadn\'t realized that majority of this episode is made up of reminiscent scenes, and it became a surprise to realize that the small, un-named 12 year old girl in the reminiscent scenes is actually Mimiru in the past. That made no sense to me, but whatever. Another turn off would be the MMORPG theme, and that would be probably because of the characters which I will discuss later.ART: .hack art, well, character designs remind me of Angelic Layer\'s and I honestly can\'t be screwed looking up whether it is designed by the same person. Anyway. The overall design is pretty smooth and bold, however the noses are a bit of a bother sometimes. Animation was par, apart from some parts, typically involving bright, flashy scenes, oh, and the opening.SOUND: The sound has always been good in the .hack series, even if I do have to strain my brain to remember. Same goes for both the ending and opening themes, especially the opening. I guess the \'chanting\'(?) used in the series is appealing to me.CHARACTERS: I\'m sorry but, do any of these people who play in The World actually have a life? If you completely ignore the fact that the players seem to be almost always online and how serious they play the game, I think I would probably give the overall series a 6. In Intermezzo, the audience is introduced to three 18 year old girls, taking turns to play a single character called Mimika. The three of them go on about how that they can be appreciated in The World, and not in actual life, suggesting that they are \'incompetent\' and \'plain\'. Sure, on the odd occasion I play MMORPGs, but only for fun when I have spare time and I feel like it. I don\'t take it very seriously, and I only play at my own pace. But is it really necessary to take a MMORPG, or any game, so seriously that it almost blends in with your own life offline? Many times during Intermezzo, and the other .hack series, I\'ve wanted to remind the characters that ""it\'s just a game.""This special was fine, and I honestly can\'t expand any further on it. Definitely something I would suggest to a .hack fan, and if you\'re not interested in MMORPG themes or you didn\'t really enjoy .hack//SIGN (however I\'m the type of person who HAS to watch every series\' special, movie, ova, etc, and I don\'t normally drop anime.), I do not suggest watching this. paying attention because of the overall story line, because I hadn\'t realized that majority of this episode is made up of reminiscent scenes, and it became a surprise to realize that the small, un-named 12 year old girl in the reminiscent scenes is actually Mimiru in the past.

That’s when .hack//SIGN aired and, while I had a high opinion of it at the time, more exposure to anime and thinking about the story soured me on it. The characters were fine and the music was straight fire (still one of my favorite soundtracks - Yuki Kajiura remains a force), but the narrate got strange and ground to a crawl at points.So I booted this up in the hopes of capturing some of what I loved about the series so long ago. Once the OP came up,...I certainly felt like I was chasing those feelings again, as I’m still quite fond of it.The rest though… yeah, I’m reminded of its flaws. The characters are even less interesting here, and given that the limited narrative doesn’t have much in the way of stakes or creativity to it (the monster designs are interesting, but that’s about it), I found this to be a dud. Its limited scope accomplishes what it sets out to do and nothing more. Character motivations are largely face value with a couple of strange turns that just felt like they were stuck in there to hint at more complexity. They try to make you believe there are stakes when it definitely doesn’t feel like it - they seem incredibly arbitrary, which is even more frustrating given that the issues involved are pretty relatable, at least from where I'm sitting. Overall, it’s just not interesting. There's not enough here to recommend it unless you want to check off the .hack entries.

The action part, in which the delvers purify the tainted, the ones that...want to ruin the whole plot, is very commendable.Art and Sound: 8/10The art of this anime is pretty good and decent.

I found it very disappointing to see such low scores as 3 and 4... because imo the characters and animation itself are very well done. I have read few works and my bachelor degree was about Dazai Osamu, that's why I was very excited to see that he was in the main cast and I found the portraying done extremely well! The stories which were taken from works are shown shorty and with main point. This anime made me remember all of the authors and works I have read and made want to read it again, that's why...for me this anime reached it main purpose. I think the way it revived japanese literature is fine! Colorful animation and great seiyuus is a pleasant bonus.  The only minus here is story because we never got to see alchemist himself and storytelling about saving literature was a little bit confusing. Also, never got fully explain how their world work, only few phrases covered that. The only thing I would justify is why there were two Akutagawas - I think the writers referred to Akutagawa having hallucinations at his late years.

The plot is different and concept is new. The basic idea of this anime is ""The world would become barren without literature"". A group of historical writers use their special abilities to rescue books that have been cursed by the \'taints\'. Taints are evil force that take over the world inside the book and manipulates it at their own will, and make them disappear from the reality itself. The writer who have been reincarnated,...delve into these tainted books, and give it the proper conclusion that it deserves by fighting off the taints.This show focuses on Japanese historical writers, who have contributed a lot to the society in the form of their work in literature. The idea that this show focuses on is how the world will change if literature ceases to exist, in the episode 4, it is clearly shown how a book can effect the perspective of a person about oneself and the world he lives in. If you are a literature person then you would understand that there are so many books that change our lives for better, but what will happen if they just cease to exist?After watching 5 episodes of this show, I can clearly say that, this anime is not for everybody, though it gives a good message to its viewers, but as I said this show focuses on Japanese historical writers, so if you don\'t have idea about Japanese literature, you won\'t be able to connect with the story, basically this show demands some research on japanese classic literature, and nobody\'s gonna do that probably! and that is basically the reason why this show struggles to connect with its audience. Anime is watched all around the world but not many of them would have much idea about Japanese literature.Well, the animation is pretty decent and soundtrack is also okay. If you are a fan of Japanese literature or you have some idea about them and you like some action twist, you might enjoy this show, but if you are finding an interesting anime without bothering about the backgroud, this is not for you. delve into these tainted books, and give it the proper conclusion that it deserves by fighting off the taints.This show focuses on Japanese historical writers, who have contributed a lot to the society in the form of their work in literature.

If you're willing to do that, I definitely recommend this to you, but if you're not, then I would say try something else."", ""To be honest this show was a pain in the ass to watch.The story-3/10Before I say anything let me preface this.The concept is really interesting and unique.You have these historic Japanese authors all going into novels to fight supernatural creatures from destroying literature.So good so far right?Well it went pretty good for the first 2 or 3 episodes.The pacing was solid and actually really interesting but its after the first few episodes that it fall apart.After the a fore mentioned first few episodes begins the shitstorm. They have a episode about farming for no damn reason then have a weird yaoi romance arc for an...episode where the writers go to the real world or something.I am not sure as to whether that was a in a book but I do believe it was not and literally just took place on Earth.They constantly add new characters out of nowhere,something that mind you was an important part of the cohesion of the story.In 2 episodes they somehow managed to cram around 20 new characters all without descriptions.The pacing was almost like someone was forcefully trying to fit over sized gears into a complex clockwork mechanism.It all just fell apart from there.Although I say that I must admit the last few episodes were very good.The psychological and character drama was well represented and honestly carry the show.Art-8/10This is probably the place where the show really manages to shine.The character designs are really unique for the main cast.Specifically the designs of Akutagawa and Dazai were some that stuck to me.The contrasting colors between the two were a very pleasing aesthetic which means quite a bit because the two show up almost every episode.This doesn't apply to the sub cast.The designs at that point got really similar to the point of me constantly mixing them up.The weapon designs were over embossed and complicated with pointless decoration but cool I guess.The the side characters felt way too similar to each other.Besides that the only other shortcoming I feel was the overuse of flashy cuts and transitions during fights which is a damn shame.The animation is smooth and pretty.The fights are really well choreographed as well.All in all this show had some really amazing artwork that really grew on me.Sound-6/10The OST is really good.The sound direction and foley is very well done and there isnt anything I can call out the show for.The voice acting for the anime was also well done and gave the characters much needed life.Characters-2/10Oh boy.Theres just nothing to say here.The authors themselves were stereotyped to death,felt boring,were unoriginal and nothing worth remembering.Beyond all of that there is also the overly concentrated sub cast.Theres wayyyyyy too many side characters and they dont even get properly introduced properly.Some of them were extremely annoying too and the bromance was unnecessary.I swear the only good character is Akutagawa.Enjoyment-4As mentioned before there were a few episodes I really enjoyed but the horrible  middle episode really threw a wrench in the works.The  humor didn't work well for me  other than the Bungou Gourmet sections.Overall-4/10I do think this is worth a watch if you have spare time but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to any body.There are way too many missed opportunities and much wasted potential which is really disappointing.All said and done this a below average show due to its crappy pacing and oddball humor. episode where the writers go to the real world or

designs of Akutagawa and Dazai were some that stuck to me.The contrasting colors between the two were a very pleasing aesthetic which means quite a bit because the two show up almost every episode.This doesn't apply to the sub cast.The designs at that point got really similar to the point of me constantly mixing them up.The weapon designs were over embossed and complicated with pointless decoration but cool I guess.The the side characters felt way too similar to each other.Besides that the only other shortcoming I feel was the overuse of flashy cuts and transitions during fights which is a damn shame.The animation is smooth and pretty.The fights are really well choreographed as well.All in all this show had some really amazing artwork that really grew on me.Sound-6/10The OST is really good.The sound direction and foley is very well done and there isnt anything I can call out the show for.The voice acting for the anime was also well done and gave the characters much needed life.Characters-2/10Oh boy.Theres just nothing to say here.The authors themselves were stereotyped to death,felt boring,were unoriginal and nothing worth remembering.Beyond all of that there is also the overly concentrated sub cast.Theres wayyyyyy too many side characters and they dont even get properly introduced properly.Some of them were extremely annoying too and the bromance was unnecessary.I swear the only good character is Akutagawa.Enjoyment-4As mentioned before there were a few episodes I really enjoyed but the horrible  middle episode really threw a wrench in the works.The  humor didn't work well for me  other than the Bungou Gourmet sections.Overall-4/10I do think this is worth a watch if you have spare time but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to any body.There are way too many missed opportunities and much wasted potential which is really disappointing.All said and done this a below average show due to its crappy pacing and oddball humor."", 'I found this while doing a random anime challenge with a friend, where you watch 1 episode from a randomly chosen anime on MAL. I saw the score and immediately rejected it, so I went into the first episode expecting trash. However, maybe it\'s because I\'m slightly familiar with the story they featured in the first episode or because of my inability to hate pretty anime boys, but a week later I found myself coming back to watch the next episodes. ""And it went a little like this"": *Story: Not going to lie, the whole ""let\'s revive historical Japanese figures"" has been done quite...a few times, and to a foreigner it loses some of the appeal as we don\'t know as much, if anything, about them. THAT SAID, I find the story of this anime very interesting. I\'m not a huge book nerd, but I found the plot unique and intriguing. I appreciate the way it explores famous works, and the impact of that literature on the world and other authors of the time period. The plot twists and inter-character drama is very *cough* anime, but fun nonetheless.Art: If you want to know why I love the art in this, watch the opening. Its not mind blowing, but it\'s very pretty and the action scenes are pretty well done. And once you get to the 3rd episode or so, you just stop questioning the oddly idol-ish outfits these 1900s authors seem to wear, and chalk it up to the studio\'s decision to  ""make pretty anime boi look pretty"", which is something I dont have any big issue with.Sound: I haven\'t really taken notice of it for anything in particular. :/ The OP and ED are pretty good.Characters: More than the books, the authors are really the center of this anime, adding another layer of interest but also confusion for those who don\'t know much about their history. However, I believe the way they present the author\'s characters using anime character archetypes makes it easier and more enjoyable to follow along with their interactions. However, I fear it has not allowed for much character development, as the characters just revert back to their cliches after any emotional arcs. Though they make good use of character comedy to keep the anime from dragging too much.Enjoyment: 9/10 I have enjoyed this more than other anime on my list that are rated MUCH higher. I learned a lesson about judging a book (lol) by its cover. And I will recommend it to friends who I think would enjoy this type of anime in the hopes that we can raise it above its current dreary 5.xx score.Overall: 7  Not the best anime out there, but definitely worth at least some of your time, in my opinion. :) a few times, and to a foreigner it loses some of the appeal as we don\'t know as much, if anything, about them.

I feel the characters are a closer representation of the authors, than Bungou Stray Dogs, especially because they really focused on the possible mindset of the authors.It shows very nicely the struggle that authors generally face when writing, the effects of criticism and the aftermath.On top of that, through the anime, I got to learn a bit more about the Japanese Literature and it's encouraging me to read more about their works.I guess in a sense, they are trying to promote Japanese literature through the...anime.The art style is immaculate, it just left me speechless an in love with it, especially for Akutagawa, Dazai, Oda and Sakaguchi. anime.The art style is immaculate, it just left me speechless an in love with it, especially for Akutagawa, Dazai, Oda and Sakaguchi."", 'In literature, there are a lot of quotes that become lifelong mantras that we live by, and whether it is a novel that moves us to tears, a play that intrigues or a poem that rouses our passions, a piece of well-written literature can have an impact on our emotions and behaviour that become value-added systems in life. But adapting this into a medium can be the hardest thing to swallow. Literature, like a play, when done right, it can be an adventure worth the long journey, and in the case of this show, it has a promising start and build-up, only to let that...effect relinquish more on the enjoyment.

The characters are generally not poorly proportioned or poorly colored. The color palette is generally pleasant. There is even some level of depth to the shading. It hardly if at all qualifies for action but the action scenes in it are decent.Sound: 5It\'s not terrible, it\'s not great.  Nothing I will remember after the show but nothing that will make me watch the show muted either.Characters: 4The idea is to take historical writers (of Japan) and take an interesting spin on them. Having knowledge of Japanese literary...figures really help understand what they are talking about. Without them, you will be completely lost. Even having knowledge of some of the most prominent figures and their works, such as Akutagawa and his Rashoumon, however, I still feel that the characterization was bland at best. The characters didn\'t have  any relatable growth. It felt like a shounen boyband.. . except without the coolness of a typical actual shounen boyband.Story: 3This was like a Sailor Moon of JP Writers and Boys. The conflicts were pretty much monster of the week, the final conflict not that far from just Big Bad at the End. We don\'t really see magical girl transformations but if it had that, it might as well be a Sailor Moon featuring boys. The sophistication of the the works by JP\'s classics writers were entirely not present, ironically.Overall: 5It\'s a show I can watch while I play some games on my PC or phone. In fact, mid way through this show, I picked up an investments book and just read that because studying finance was more interesting than the ""plot"", and since I understand spoken Japanese, I still was able to follow along.[No who it\'s for/not for section because for once I\'m not sure who this is targeted towards.] figures really help understand what they are talking about.

It definitely won't appeal to everyone, as you can see from the 3/4 star ratings. But in my opinion, this anime is really well made.First of all, people's feelings towards books, which I thought was the main message of the anime, is portrayed incredibly beautifully. As a fan of the books, I was captivated. I even cried at episode 4 where it was depicted.Secondly, the presentation of the authors. I haven't read much about Oda or Ango, but I got into Dazai. It was really well and compositionally presented. We didn't play around with making the author shallow. We had the...whole thing presented here.The next thing, the animation and the line work. It was pleasing to the eye and the fight scenes were interesting and well done. The interior of the books and the landscapes in the nuch were beautiful.It's not perfect, nor is it the best anime I've watched. There is a lot of ambiguity and nonsense, but in my opinion it doesn't deserve such a low rating.

The writers also do NOT think poorly of the player in the game and aren\'t trying to escape like in the anime!!!!But this last episode was the last drop that broke the camels back........i never thought that they would actually go there.....but they sure did!!!!!!!I blame all the people that complained that Katsugeki Touken Ranbu was apparently NOT ""dark"" enough for them, so DMM games took their ""suggestions"" more like finger pointing and calling them cowards, weak and whatnot and implemented them into Bungou to Alchemist instead, thinking that this was a ""good"" idea, fucking no!!!!!! IT WAS NOT!!!!!!!!!I won\'t continue watching this and neither any sequels it may have because i absolutely despise the direction this anime is heading and i sure as hell don\'t want to see THAT again!!!!!Unless they are making a new Bungou to Alchemist anime handled by a different staff and studio and is more aking to Touken Ranbu Hanamaru, i\'m done with the anime!!!!!!!! >:( The battles are alright, definitely much better than the embarrassing light show clashes that were in the adaptation of Namu Amida Butsu!: Rendai Utena!Sound: 7/10The OP & ED are ok but nothing that amazing, i wish they would have made it like in Touken Ranbu Hanamaru where each episode, the ending song is sung by different character(s) seiyuu, would have been much better and more appreciated by the fans i think, potential wasted here....then again they didn\'t do this for the adaptation of Namu Amida Butsu!: Rendai Utena! either, which i think is a real shame....The seiyuu\'s did a good job vocing the characters, especially Dazai, hilarious as always whatever he\'s voiced by Mamoru Miyano or Yuuichi Nakamura(here)!Characters: 9/10All the writers are great, and of course Odasaku is still the greatest friend anyone could ever hope for, whatever that be in Bungou Stray Dogs, Bungou to Alchemist and i\'m sure was in real life as well!Story: 5/10I admit, it had potential, the fact that we get to relive the stories writen by the writers by delving inside the books is a great idea, i actually liked that, but.....that\'s where it stops.It\'s pretty poorly executed, you are just thrown inside the episode with absolutely no explanation whatsoever and are expected to just go along with it, even from the very first episode, this can at times be confusing and it won\'t tell you anything untill near the end of the episode if at all.One episode took place in the ""real"" world with some no name characters going about their daily lives and i began to wonder if i accidentally somehow clicked on the wrong anime by that point....this episode felt just like a blatant embarrassing advertizing attempt at making people interested in literature(if they weren\'t already) a waste of an episode that could have actually been used to move the story further along but nooooo.....Enjoyment: 2/10They took huge liberties with this adaptation by making it almost completely different from the original game it originated from, basically pissing on everything that made the game enjoyable, this anime feels as cold and distant as the alchemist in this anime is(player character)There\'s no connection of the player character to the writers at all, unlike in Touken Ranbu Hanamaru, here it\'s like both parties don\'t give a shit about each other(the writers trying to constantly escape from the library and being unhappy there and the Alchemist not caring for their well being nor happiness at all, even denying them proper food for God\'s sake!!!!!That was not the case in the game at all, they had different meals every day(with changes during the summer and winter months) and you could interact with them and give them gifts to raise your relationship with them!!!!!

Back in the 2000s, this was visual novel adaptations and ecchi stuff. In the 2010s, isekai stuff began saturating the market, and still does to this day, and as of recently, the newest trend comes in the form of cellphone games. Naturally, anime is made to promote the source material they're adapted from, be it a manga, game, or a light novel, with Bungo and Alchemist: Gears of Judgment being no different. Mobile games have gotten immensely popular as...of late, bringing in millions of dollars, so it's no surprise corporations would want to capitalize on this success and adapt some famous games into anime, even if said anime are just glorified commercials for the game in question. There are some mobage anime that I like, such as Kemono Friends and Granblue Fantasy (Still waiting for the second season to get dubbed!), and there are just as many that are good, bad, average, mediocre, or just...dull. Unfortunately, Bungo and Alchemist has mobage game adaptation written all over it, and I don't mean that as a compliment.The story takes place in a labyrinthine library where the world's greatest writers are reincarnated and...basically made into pretty boys. Their mission is to delve into the stories of old in order to protect them from evil beings known as the Taints. Yes, that's the name they went with, and it's as stupid as it sounds. The Taints corrupt books and intend on either changing the stories completely or outright erasing literature forever, so it's up to the authors to put a stop to them. The premise of jumping into books and saving their content is nothing new, but is actually one I like. There are even some books I've read that have used this to great effect, such as Anna James' The Bookwanderers series, and some that don't do it as well, such as James Riley's Story Thieves series. I've always been of the mind that it doesn't matter how unoriginal or cliche your story is, as nowadays it's impossible to make something original, so long as you create good, deep, interesting characters that can drive the story and are passionate about what you create.But passion project, Bungo and Alchemist is not. All the characters save for one are just static archetypes that you've seen in pretty much every other anime before this, all made to look like generic over-designed bishounen made solely to make girls squeal. None of them change or grow over the course of the series, and the show itself is fairly formulaic on principle: Characters go into a book, find the author of the book, fight and purify them, bring them to the library, rinse and repeat. There's just no reason for me, and by extension the audience, to really care about them as characters other than what's on the surface. None of them really stand out, nor do the writers really try to make them interesting and three-dimensional in any way. Not helping matters is that the cast itself is pretty large, and if there's one thing Lapis Re:Lights taught me, is that if you want to have a show with 20-something characters in it or more, 11-13 episodes is absolutely NOT the best length for a series with that big a cast.That being said, Bungo and Alchemist does have its good points. For one, the animation is solid, but nothing to really write home about. Would you believe that this was actually done by the same production company that worked on Pokemon, OLM? Seriously, I had no idea until I looked it up. Also, it seems like the show's budget went into the opening at the expense of everything else, because not only is that opening theme really creative in its animation and imagery, it is amazingly well done. Why the hell is this better animated than the entire series?! Why couldn't the entire show been as creative and fluidly animated as the friggin' opening?! Don't have much to say about the soundtrack, other than that it really likes to abuse one particular instrument that I don't even know the name of. You'll know it when you hear it. As far as good things go, there is one thing that I really liked about Bungo and Alchemist: A certain revelation behind one of the protagonists and his connection with the villain. I really liked the twist about him, and it actually made the final two episodes somewhat better...though not by much.In the end, Bungo and Alchemist just comes and goes, yet another mobage game adaptation that's just there to promote the game and not much else. It's not offensively bad, nor does it really reach any highs. It's fine if you want a nice little time killer, but you're not going to find anything groundbreaking with this one, and there are lots of other things that tackled the same ideas and concepts much better. of late, bringing in millions of dollars, so it's no surprise corporations would want to capitalize on this success and adapt some famous games into anime, even if said anime are just glorified commercials for the game in question.

For one, the animation is solid, but nothing to really write home about. Would you believe that this was actually done by the same production company that worked on Pokemon, OLM? Seriously, I had no idea until I looked it up. Also, it seems like the show's budget went into the opening at the expense of everything else, because not only is that opening theme really creative in its animation and imagery, it is amazingly well done. Why the hell is this better animated than the entire series?! Why couldn't the entire show been as creative and fluidly animated as the friggin' opening?! Don't have much to say about the soundtrack, other than that it really likes to abuse one particular instrument that I don't even know the name of. You'll know it when you hear it. As far as good things go, there is one thing that I really liked about Bungo and Alchemist: A certain revelation behind one of the protagonists and his connection with the villain. I really liked the twist about him, and it actually made the final two episodes somewhat better...though not by much.In the end, Bungo and Alchemist just comes and goes, yet another mobage game adaptation that's just there to promote the game and not much else. It's not offensively bad, nor does it really reach any highs. It's fine if you want a nice little time killer, but you're not going to find anything groundbreaking with this one, and there are lots of other things that tackled the same ideas and concepts much better."", ""I've seen that people giving this show higher ratings tend to think its low overall ratings come from it appealing to a specific audience only, an while I do agree it's not for the big masses, that's definitely not the actual reason (the current rating is 6.46). Bungou to Alchemist has some big, too hard to ignore flaws.The story has potential, and I would have loved to see how the biggest classics in Japanase literature fight for its existence, but the execution was just horrific. I don't think the writers knew from the start where the whole plot is going at all. Aside that, they...didn't even know what kind of anime did they want it to be; at first, you'd think it's the episodic type (I mean, there was a farming episode with no action just because), but then they quickly throw all the ideas in at the same time in the second half.

Good work on it.The sound was alright as well, the voice actors did their job properly. The OP and ED were actually pretty good.The characters are the other major flaw of the show. The fact that there are a lot for just 13 episodes aside, they are just too shallow, especially for such praised intellectuals. Their chemistry isn't really that great either, and the relationship of the two that are the highlights of the show, Osamu Dazai and Ryuunosuke Akutagawa, isn't any better. The characters themselves are all, or most of them, undeveloped, and the ones that get the chance of being something by having more screen time end up as failures. They feel more like some cheap copies that the writers tried helplessly to make more interesting by giving them personalities that don't really seem to suit them. The number of characters and the lenght of the anime aren't a good match at all, so it's kind of understandable; however, that doesn't make it better.Overall, Bungou to Alchemist is another failed show with potential.

Itou Junji: Collection,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36124/Itou_Junji__Collection,"[""Junji Ito deserves better than this.As he is one of the most talented horror creators, I was eagerly anticipating when his work would finally be animated. It pains me to say this, but Studio Deen fucked up this adaptation big time. It was inevitable that at least one of his mangas would be adapted, and they chose to adapt dozens of his best stories. Any fan of his works would be just as hyped as I was… but as we now know, these adaptations aren’t even half as good as the originals. Even with some of his most beloved stories like Long Dreams, Tomie, House...of the Marionettes, and many more, it still turned out being a pile of garbage.What’s interesting about the Junji Ito: Collection is how faithful it is to the source mangas, but simultaneously awful. I’m not saying I dislike the mangas, of what I read they’re incredibly frightening and layered with social commentary. So how can a faithful adaptation of a good manga be bad?I have two words for you, Studio Deen.Each panel of Junji Ito’s mangas is drawn with expert detail. Nothing is rushed, even the most obscure entries are passionately drawn to deeply disturb his legions of horror fanatics (I’m one of them). This guy seriously lives for his work, it’s no surprise he has risen to become one of the most revered horror creators to this day. It was inevitable that a TV anime adaptation couldn’t live up to his lofty achievements, but there was hope for it to at least do it justice with an equal amount of effort put into it.Keep in mind, anime adaptations of manga aren’t expected to be 1:1 perfect recreations. They compensate by breathing new life into the panels with animation (not Studio Deen’s strong suit). What we got from the Junji Ito: Collection is nearly a shot for shot recreation of each manga chapter, destined to disappoint fans. This adaptation comes with almost none of the detail lovingly put into the original work. Instead we get choppy animation, bland colors, ugly background art, oversimplified character designs, all with a fraction of the style and detail applied to the mangas.The biggest problem with this series isn't just that it fails to capture any of the style of the source materials, it’s that it fails to be remotely scary. A horror anime doesn't have to be terrifying at all times. Horror can come in many forms; it can get under your skin, it can disturb, disgust, linger, etc. But here… the art is so oversimplified that Ito’s horrific creations are no longer scary at all. Instead of a giant intimidating spider, we get an animatronic looking one that evokes laughter rather than the intense fear of Ito’s work.It is the worst form of an adaptation. A cheap imitation living in the shadow of something greater. However, there is one thing I can partially credit this adaptation for; sound effects. The squelching of blood, reverberating of a heartbeat, visceral slicing of flesh. The best noises are rarely used, keeping them from becoming repetitive, but it’s enough to get under your skin. For me, being moderately grossed out (oh god the pimple episode) was the extent of the ‘horror’ I found in this series. But for every good sound effect there were three mediocre ones that are either absurdly fake sounding or have just plain out poor audio quality. This quality issue extends to the subpar voice acting. Voices don’t match what you would expect of the characters on a number of occasions. And even when they do fit, they sound markedly worse than most other anime.I did actually find the Souichi chapters quite funny as some nice dark humor in between the grim chapters. His obnoxious voice, goofy stupidity, and extreme nihilism made him the most surprisingly funny demon summoners I’ve ever seen (not that the list is very long).It was quite an odd choice for them to start the first episode with a Souichi comedy chapter even if I enjoyed it. Although I didn’t mind that the show ended with one of his chapters it felt like rather than bringing out the best they can, they end on a low note. This series was marketed as horror so to see comedy like that in place of scares is a recipe for disappointment. Given the high drop rate right away, it’s clear people understood this was going nowhere fast. Anthology series are after all inconsistent by nature, it’d be unreasonable to expect perfectly equal adaptations across the board. But when you’re this blatantly not giving a shit about how the final product comes together, then I don’t feel the need to mince words on how bad the end result is.Make no mistake, not every one of Junji Ito's mangas that were adapted is great. He has written dozens of them so it's expected that not all of them would be stellar. Typically they have uneven lengths ranging from 18-2 minutes each, but typically they last half an episode. Many of the stories lack endings, fitting for the mysterious atmosphere, but annoying when every story one after the other has no definitive conclusion. Some of the stories fail to establish characters worth caring about then hinge dramatic stakes on them, while others may rely too heavily on a mysterious supernatural element leaving it difficult to connect with. In turn, draining most of the potential for scares.I was never bothered by the fact that Junji Ito’s manga doesn’t always have the most well developed of stories while reading his mangas. After all, the uncertainty of what is really occurring in the story is part of their mysterious charm. This mysterious atmosphere is usually brought on by the understated supernatural elements, which are rarely explained for the sake of simplicity.You’d think that this embracement of an underdeveloped story would work well for a two chapters per episode adaptation, sadly the pace is botched a bit too badly. The stories we get are rushed, lingering on the underdone horror spectacles much less than the mangas. Instead, this show prays that we’ll latch onto Ito’s stories to make up for the lackluster presentation. Needless to say, they’re forcing a formula onto already established works and it just does not work.There were a few things from Junji Ito’s mangas that made the transition from paper to screen decently. Junji Ito himself is quite aware of the world he lives in and provides us with thought-provoking social commentary. It never failed to give me an idea to chew on, distracting me from the show’s mediocrity. There are his constant jabs at overbearing family expectations, the pressure we put on ourselves and others, but most importantly his many criticisms of how he believes people can be shallow.I doubt anyone expected Ito Junji: Collection to be perfect, given the famous horror author Junji Ito has never had his work adapted into an anime until now. Especially given the studio adapting it is the definition of inconsistency, Studio Deen, it was very nearly dead on arrival. It didn’t help that the director of the infamous dumpster fire Diabolik Lovers was at the helm of this ship. Steering it off course and into every pitfall it could.Score Breakdown:[Story: 6/10] Mixed bag, supernaturally driven, retains social commentary.[Character: 3/10] Only goes as far to connect you to the horror, paper thin.[Art: 2/10] Janky animation, poor quality, ruins Ito’s aesthetic.[Sound: 3/10] Poor voice work, some scary sound effects, mediocre music.[Enjoyment: 3/10] Boring, rarely scary, occasionally funny.[Overall Score: 3.4/10]You were good Studio Deen! Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju was great! Of all of the animes to put barely any effort into, why this one? A low effort cash grab like this is unfit to bear Junji Ito’s name.

Based on the collection of manga of the same name, these stories depict various abnormal occurrences and happenings. From what I know, there isn’t a pattern as to which stories were picked.Ito Junji surprised me in many ways, one of those being the creepy atmosphere. Many of the stories are quite unnerving at times, especially with how crude the artstyle is. The fact that the overall art looks quite bad, as in the character models aren’t anything special and the backgrounds...are rather cheap-looking only adds to the tone, which is fitting for a show like this.One good thing I can say about the characters, or rather, character in this case, is that our main protagonist, Souichi, is a nice addition to these stories. His peculiar and bizarre nature makes everything just a little bit creepier, especially with how he behaves around others. Whenever he’s on screen he does something weird or funny, and it wouldn’t be the same without him.Even though Ito Junji is a horror anime, it has a surprising amount of outright hilarious moments, like the whole circus story. The way everything played out felt like an unintentional comedy of sorts, although it worked in this case since it was genuinely funny and not just ironically funny like some “so bad it’s good” shows which don’t try to be funny but end up actually being funny.All in all, I quite liked Ito Junji: Collection, and I plan on checking out the manga in the future. are rather cheap-looking only adds to the tone, which is fitting for a show like this.One good thing I can say about the characters, or rather, character in this case, is that our main protagonist, Souichi, is a nice addition to these stories.

The unique and atmosphere way in which he tells stories, paired with his surrealistic, almost confrontational art, has made him a household name regarding both the short story format, and the horror manga genre, some even going as far as saying he is the most influential, and subsequently the best. Admittedly, I am a huge fan and must agree, but the real question lies in whether the transition from panel to animation is as smooth as we all wish. So far, I can at least state that this collection is worthy of being titled after...the man himself.Story – 8As we get into some of Ito’s more famous works, I imagine they will span the length of entire episodes, but so far, they are half to three quarter episode length stories. I was surprisingly unfamiliar with a lot of the stories, and I’ve concluded it actually works to its benefit, rather than its detriment. The decision to choose some of Ito’s lesser known work is an interesting one - likely in order to save his more famous stories until the end, which I’d rather that then the other way around. By presenting the collection in this manner, it also gives viewers time to appreciate the oddness of each individual story and adds an interesting texture in the process.I like that some of these stories just boil down to “daughter turns into a doll” or “I met a creepy looking model”. While these straight-forward stories don’t work as well as they do in panel form within the manga, they work to a comparable effect, and have proven to be able to draw out tension in a similar way. I can see why some may find issues with this simpler, no-twist method of story telling, but I still think there is a lot of enjoyment to be had here, and more to come! As stated earlier, the fact that most of these works aren’t even well known, make them that much more fun to watch unfold. The more elaborate and well known Ito stories are what I came for and am most looking forward to. Thus far, they've done a great job sprinkling them in here and there.Art/Animation – 8I've heard discussions on Studio Deen’s attempt to imitate Ito’s highly detailed and refined line work, and it’s clear they’re still experimenting with how to make it look more natural and fluid in animation - sometimes it can add to the composition, sometimes it takes away from it. Evidently, if it works, it works really well, effectively intensifying certain scenes and making imagery more unsettling in the process. I admire the decision, and the stylistic liberties taken, as they feel like the classic early 2000s Junji Ito art style from the manga, and I think fans and new viewers alike will find a nostalgic quality to the show in that sense. The animators/designers seemingly have trouble retaining this ‘older look’ throughout, and again, there are some awkward frames and angles, but the art direction and animation are continually serviceable and appealing. Some may even argue that this could enhance the ominous aspects of the experience (Fashion model chasing scene comes to mind) and I kind of would agree as Ito’s work is known not to shy away from the unpleasant.Sound - 10Sound direction is probably the most important thing within the horror medium as it drives atmosphere and tone. A lot of the darkest, scariest moments of the episodes so far were multiplied by the excellent sound direction and I recall thinking to myself that they did a great job with it.OP and EN aren't what you'd expect from a dark horror anime, but the subversion of expectations is what makes it interesting and the are serviceable as well. Perhaps a little forgettable, but only time will tell.Characters – 8This section has been included out of necessity as short horror stories don’t tend to be as heavily character driven as other stories (not to say they can’t be, but the nature of a short story is that they don’t have be reliant on the same characters throughout). With that being said, there is a good amount of attention and time that has gone into each character, their thoughts, developments, etc. Attention to detail is important and it is things of this nature that can sometimes make or break whether you actually care about what’s going on. In that sense, Junji Ito’s Collection is doing a lot of things right as I found myself caring, and fully interested in events to transpire.Enjoyment – 9Overall – 8 {Mastapeece}Mysterious, atmospheric, and unpredictable.Junji Ito continues to set a great example for the horror community within, and outside of manga/anime, that keeps viewers on their toes, and in the moment.

Nothing...nothing at all.If you've thought that a mere 12 episodes can cover the VAST majority of works of Itou Junji throughout the years, don't expect too much: it's up to the studio helming the project (that is Studio low-budget Deen) to pick the stories and feedback from the creator himself to see which stories are worth watching onto the main screen.The first nitpick that (not only) I (but others too) see is that the stories are picked at random, and the reason for that is actually the idea of Itou Junji...himself to give us jump-scare surprises when we watch the episodic story episodes every week. Props for the well intent of the creator, but that may also be the reason why it backfired because of our certain requirements as to which story SHOULD be animated. If that was the case, with everyone having their own requested story, it's not gonna be enough to fill in the 12 episode void, so good job on cleaning the shit there.Again, for people like myself who typically don't like the horror genre (movies included), this is definitely NOT a great representation of justice to the man who's works expand years that frighten people off (of reading the manga source) with the sense of foreboding. Granted, there are numerous problems with the anime adaptation but I'll give my 2 cents and let you decide whether if this is worth your time.The art...isn't horrible by any means, AS IN the ways of illustrating the story of choice, the manga was terrifying enough to make you pee your pants, but the anime adaptation (for some reason) had to be dumbed down (in case of violence and gore). The move is understandable, but the creative content by itself STILL shouldn't sell off what started off as gore and when translated, almost the entire substance feels off. Moreover, the hand-drawn art indeed gave me chills, but mildly. Overall, it's Studio Deen, what do you expect???The sound could use some refining too, especially the VAs working on the different characters each week, they get the job done...but mildly as well. I will give an honorable mention to the OST, especially the rock-based OP that's supposed to reel you in the horror, and the calm but sometimes nauseous ED that if honestly there's something good about this show, it's the music that sells.Overall, Itou Junji: Collection is not a bad show per se, but the redeeming qualities are outweighed by the factors that hint this as a sub-par, mediocre show. Combined with low ratings, and what you have is a recipe of nothingness that only excels in letting people be more disappointed than the horror it should have promised from the start. himself to give us jump-scare surprises when we watch the episodic story episodes every week.

Starts with an M and end with Arriage. A miscarriage. Ayyyyyy, This joke never gets old, and neither does the baby.This joke is quite accurate way of introducing just about anyone to Itou Junji\'s anime. It offers similarly tasteless jokes about rather abstract events that are presented as a horror comedy. It\'s a collection of tales that  varie from snail using a human head as a shell to a person drinking so much grease he turns into grease himself. Lovely. This was my favorite story for sure. His palms were sweatier than Eminem ever thought was possible.Approaching this...series with open mind and owning a sick sense of humor will definitely help oneself to enjoy this DEEN\'s newest animated masterpiece. The series comes with a lot of quality differences and won\'t appeal to most of its viewers. Pretty much no one thinks anything special about it. This because it really isn\'t anything special. It\'s different for sure and worth of giving a try for that reason no doubt.The characters are pretty memorable. Especially the guy who eats nails. I don\'t mean his own nails, but literally iron nails. He was pretty cool. Would definitely befriend if I met a guy like that. Other characters aren\'t really worth of noting, but DEEN did pretty good job when designing them for this anime. The voice acting is what you would expect. No nyaaas or ara ara\'s are given. These people are weird, but sound realistic.I recommend watching this series solely for the scene where giant woman comes out of the swamp and be like ""ain\'t no Shrek gonna take over what is mine.""

This is mainly because every ending to a story is anticlimatic and makes no sense; it\'s not satisfactory. Most stories are not understandable and each story gets more and more ridiculous. However, the best story i\'ve seen in this anime was Long Dreams; it had a really interesting plot and idea, therefore I really enjoyed it... until I watched the story ""Slug Girl.""

And the overall color palette is too bright, not moody enough.Needless to say this doesn\'t do justice to Ito\'s work.

Jump scares and gore are instant scares that are one timer moments that easily get boring or predictable but the mundanity of the normal brings in the our usual day lives and makes the horror stick from something we do in our repetitive usual day lives and by far Junji Ito knows how the mundanity works to the horror\'s advantage.

The unknown is scary as we DON\'T KNOW IT ITSELF, thus facing the fear of the unknown can be scary as hell as there will be no way of knowing the end result and Junji Ito eats the carrot he\'s been dangling at you for the last 10 minutes or so giving us a cosmic horror of the unknown.So about the lackluster animation, well the animation done by Studio DEEN for LA was ok enough but the animation tries to get Junji Ito\'s horror down into a verbatim animation with somewhat intentionally dull, dreary atmosphere with some interesting sketchbook-like character designs and backgrounding.

I\'m now reading the mangas since I became utterly obsessed with souichi thanks to this anime, so I hope this helps:)Now I can see why some reviews of old readers are low. Meanwhile the anime can give you chills, or moments that you think ""wow gross, that\'s scary"" etc. you are not really scared but more interested. When you read Junji Ito\'s original art it gives you more creeps, a purest feeling of terror, in my opinion a kind of art that can\'t be animated to be as scary.Don\'t worry!! you don\'t get as...much as terror, but double of fun. The job they did animating Souichi\'s curses was really amazing, his character essence was at his highest version. The laughs, voice, animation... everything fitted perfectly, making shine the funny side of him that you can read on the manga but can\'t really feel... the same emotions I tried to explain before with the terror speech but viceversa.You can see 2 different stories every chapter, so it\'s easier to watch and enjoy, the best overshadowing the less interesting ones.

If you like creepy things you will absolutely love it!!', ""Yeah, it's bad.To talk about why Ito Junji Collection is a terrible mess is to talk about what makes a horrible anime adaptation. I'd like to first establish what was expected of it, and explain why it failed (even if most of it is obvious at first glance).The bottom line for a decent anime adaptation is to provide an alternative way to experience the original work. More often than not that means a panel to panel adaptation with worse pacing and art, but now in color, fully voiced, scored and animated. Might sound fine on paper but it usually doesn't make the manga obsolete...as anime rarely manage to adapt entirety of the story, and for many people the lack of detailed and stylish art can be a massive downside.At best it can become something like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. An anime that takes the original work, captures what people loved about it, and then goes an extra mile to use every strength anime medium has to offer to enhance it. Making the world come to live with vibrant colors, and turning action scenes into real spectacles by utilizing many talented animators. All while fatefully telling you the original story.The possibility like that is what made the prospect of good Junji Ito anime so appealing. And then everyone saw that DEEN is behind it, snuffing any spark of hope that existed before. Then it actually came out and somehow managed to be even worse than I expected.Junji Ito Collection doesn't just fail to meet the bottom line, It starts below it and then actively digs itself further down, as if looking for remains of Berserk's 2016 adaptation.To start with, the directing is nearly non-existent. Shinobu Tagashira mindlessly follows manga chapters panel by panel without adding anything to them. More often than not he's actively making it worse since he doesn't translate the dramatic framing and progression of said panels, leaving you with a picture that always feels lifeless, flat, boring. Junji Ito is a master at capturing the reader's attention with his acute understanding of manga. He puts in a lot of effort to build the tension and increasing it all the way to the climax when the horror starts to spiral out of control. All of this is lost.In part this is due to inadequacy of art in IJC. It would be one thing if they just failed to capture the complexity of Ito's haunting art, brimming with attention to detail that pushed it from creepy to genuinely unsettling. No, they once again dip below the lowest standard. While I'll commend Shinobu Tagashira for managing to adapt the manga designs for animation, none of it matters when they're badly drawn with depressing consistency. From derpy eyes that float all over the face, to stiff poses, to things that barely look human. Already souless anime becomes even harder to get invested in when it looks like that.Animation blends perfectly with the rest of the adaptation in its ability to undermine the source material. There are multiple times throughout the show where IJC just gives up on even trying and shows you a still cutout moving around on the screen without anything to try and hide it. If it was any worse it would be a camcorder footage of someone waving a stick with a drawing glued on top. It's not always that terrible but it never adds anything of value. When Kagewani and Yami Shibai exist and manage to tell imaginative horror stories with minimal animation there's no excuse. It doesn't make for a great adaptation but it would still be an improvement compared to this.Ito Junji Collection is not thoroughly bad, but most of the positive things I have to say about it are elements of original work left unbutchered in the process of adaptation, oversight on DEEN's part no doubt. While the impact is ruined the stories are still recognisably that of Junji Ito and his wild imagination. The selection is not weak either, it adapts some of the more memorable stories, some of which are consistently brought up when talking about Junji Ito's writing talent and/or art. Other than that the voice acting is pretty standard and the only real standout are the excellent OP and ED that capture the tone and bizarre nature of Ito and sound amazing.In the end, Junji Ito Collection is just a bastardization of original work. It keeps the stories intact but it removes all the things that made them work.

Please, don't watch it."", 'JUNJI ITOU COLLECTION (24/3/18)This anime is to Junji Itou’s work is what Shyamalan’s The Last Airbender was to Nickelodeon’s Avatar series. It’s an adaptation so crude in its execution that the original’s fandom will deny it ever happened.ART (0/10)The Junji Itou Collection has what is easily the worst “animation” I have seen in anime, that is to say there is barely any. Most of the shots are static and the illusion of movement is created by camera pans or sudden shaking. What little animation feels obligatory, like adding a couple extra frames to make a character’s mouth look like it’s moving, and often looks convulsive...and unnatural. Characters will either shake violently to make it feel ~scary~ or if the animators are feeling especially lazy then some characters may slide across the floor instead of walking.The art style is vaguely like Junji Itou’s, but it’s so watered-down that it’s offensive. While Itou’s manga is characterised by the intricate details that make the experience truly captivating and beautifully grotesque, this anime aimed for the bare minimum and missed it by a few miles. The otherworldly creatures that Itou is famous for come to life as something out of a children’s bad horror book and... what looks like CGI? I don’t know, not even CGI in anime has looked so unintentionally comical. The only time when the anime looks good is when it directly copy & pastes a panel from the manga and adds colour to it, but even when it redraws scenes it makes them absolutely devoid of the atmosphere and horror that the original is so rich with.CHARACTERS (2/12)As the stories are short one-shots that usually span 10 minutes there is obviously not much time to flesh out any characters. However the anime never makes even an effort to go beyond what the source material gives it. Although the characters in Itou’s work are only secondary to the horrors that each story recounts, each character still has some sort of motive. Sometimes it’s to become independent, other times to satiate their curiosity, but most times to survive.But again, the Junji Itou Collection fails on this front where the characters don’t seem to be passionate about anything and most of their decisions seem to come out of nowhere. This is because the anime decides to leave out some parts that may be unimportant to the main storyline but give us insight into the characters’ heads, leaving the audience with an abridged version of the original, and not even a good one.The only thing I can give this aspect of the show is that it doesn’t add unnecessary characters to the show, which is something that always bothers me. But it’s not like they had the initiative to.SOUND (2/6)The theme songs are good to listen to and suit Itou’s style. The opening gets you excited and the ending lulls you to an almost suspicious rest. Unfortunately none of your anticipation is met.The OST is basically nonexistent and I cannot remember a single piece that I heard watching this show. Even some stories that require a good sound design to make any sense at all were neglected in this part, such as an episode where characters lose their mind over an unbelievably good music CD, but, AGAIN, the show fails to make an effort where it counts to make the CD sound at least good. The voice-acting is subpar and when combined with the badly drawn facial expressions it makes a lot of the characters’ reactions unrealistic and therefore impossible to relate to.STORY (0/12)Another defining feature of Itou’s manga is its bizarre premises and how, with careful pacing trepid developments, what may be an unrealistic reaction becomes understandable. However this adaptation rushes the stories and completely misses their point and what makes them effective.The biggest offender is the much-anticipated story Painter, featuring Itou’s most famous character Tomie. The story requires previous knowledge of the main character, which isn’t a problem in the manga because the chapter is published after the chapters that introduce us to Tomie. Seems obvious that you need the start to get to a side story, right? Not to this anime’s staff.Another issue is that in the manga chapter the titular painter loses his sanity over Tomie slowly and steadily, whereas in the anime because the staff felt obliged to cram in two stories for every episode without exception, the painter’s descent to madness feels more like a leap.OVERALLThe anime takes Itou’s ideas and throws them with as much power over a rock-hard road, then runs them over with a lorry and pours paint over them. It’s the very definition of doing the bare minimum. Don’t watch unless you want to pretend Itou isn’t a great author.Final score: 1/10 and unnatural. Characters will either shake violently to make it feel ~scary~ or if the animators are feeling especially lazy then some characters may slide across the floor instead of walking.The art style is vaguely like Junji Itou’s, but it’s so watered-down that it’s offensive. While Itou’s manga is characterised by the intricate details that make the experience truly captivating and beautifully grotesque, this anime aimed for the bare minimum and missed it by a few miles. The otherworldly creatures that Itou is famous for come to life as something out of a children’s bad horror book and... what looks like CGI? I don’t know, not even CGI in anime has looked so unintentionally comical. The only time when the anime looks good is when it directly copy & pastes a panel from the manga and adds colour to it, but even when it redraws scenes it makes them absolutely devoid of the atmosphere and horror that the original is so rich with.CHARACTERS (2/12)As the stories are short one-shots that usually span 10 minutes there is obviously not much time to flesh out any characters. However the anime never makes even an effort to go beyond what the source material gives it. Although the characters in Itou’s work are only secondary to the horrors that each story recounts, each character still has some sort of motive. Sometimes it’s to become independent, other times to satiate their curiosity, but most times to survive.But again, the Junji Itou Collection fails on this front where the characters don’t seem to be passionate about anything and most of their decisions seem to come out of nowhere. This is because the anime decides to leave out some parts that may be unimportant to the main storyline but give us insight into the characters’ heads, leaving the audience with an abridged version of the original, and not even a good one.The only thing I can give this aspect of the show is that it doesn’t add unnecessary characters to the show, which is something that always bothers me. But it’s not like they had the initiative to.SOUND (2/6)The theme songs are good to listen to and suit Itou’s style. The opening gets you excited and the ending lulls you to an almost suspicious rest. Unfortunately none of your anticipation is met.The OST is basically nonexistent and I cannot remember a single piece that I heard watching this show.

But...I have been very disappointed. The anime is lazy, lifeless and has no real impact, full of washed out colors, bad cuts and technical errors.The Collection is boring, and so painfully mediocre - but the work it is based on is not. It doesn\'t fully harness the terror and detail that Ito puts into his work, his heart and soul and every painstaking detail that is put into...the panels. I feel like this.. ""adaptation"" is an insult to his work, ignoring the symbolism and depth in his works and turning them into flat scenes with horrible animation and terrible story boarding.The Collection also doesn\'t harness the use of Ito\'s horror, tension and anticipation, either. It falls flat on the scares and gore and Ito\'s use of the page turn, something unique to manga and books, as a way to show horror that could have been so amazingly adapted into something that could only be used in animation.

Most of them have been  cut short and have no conclusion whatsoever. The artwork is incredibly poor compared to Ito's originals (sans a few), which heavily minimizes the shock factor. Most of the stories involving monsters are awful because if this. Needless to say, the best of the bunch are the ones which center around a concept rather than on shocking imagery (mostly due to Ito's storywriting).Overall, I wouldn't recommend this.

There\'s something about a creature being animated, or a body getting ripped apart that just doesnt have the same affect as the real thing. Most horror anime almost always have to resort to be labled as: ""action suspence"" to get any fans attention. Shows like Helsing, Tokyo Goul, Parasyte, ect all rely on action and ultra gore to get any viewers. Then comes the work of manga artist Junji Ito. The man responsible for so many...creepy pop up images that make people just go ""The 7#(% am I looking at?"" His art has a purpose to make anyone who views it genuinely uncomfortable, whether through gore, gross out, or basic confusing endings. So with such a huge cult following it was only a matter of time that they give it an anime adaptation. But is it any good?Lets see what the series does right, first and most important is they follow Ito\'s stories exactly as he presents them. No cutting anything too graphic, no adding pointless scenes, its all as he intended it. Unlike another adaptation of his work Gyo: Tokyo Fish Attack this refrains from making any changes from his story so he\'s only person that could be blamed for poor writing is Ito himself.But you can blame the show for adapting some of Ito\'s more boring/poorly written stories. Some of the stories especially in later episodes can be extremly confusing if not entirly anticlimactic. Stories like a circus that murders its performers to feed the ringleader. Or an elderly woman is being haunted because her town doesnt know how to properly hold a funeral. Some can be extremly boring if not leaving you wanting there to be more explination to the story.Another thing the show does well is its building of atmosphere. The shows segments are always shown at night or in cloudy whether building atmoshphere mixed with the shows slow and creepy soundtrack setting up the mood briliantly. Its tone is also very quiet and sneaky ofen taking you by surprise when the scary stuff goes down. No build up in the music, no panning for a jumpscare. Just WHAM scary!Now when it gets down to it the show I feel the best way to watch it is at night, or when its cloudy. Preferably with friends because your more likely to react if others do. And there are some episodes that I feel are much better then others and are a must:1. Anything with Souichi: 1A 5B 12B His charecter is creepy enough and the stories show Ito\'s world perfectly2. Fashion Model: 2A The most intense, and the payoff is really effective.3. Window next Door, Gentle Goodbye: 6 Both stories show how diverse Ito\'s stories are. One being on campground urban legend level of creepy, and the secpnd being the most emotional episode and a facinating twist on a ghost story.4. Painter: 9A Sets up the upcomming Tomie OVA and has the most disturbing final image.Some of the weaker episodes are:1. The Circus comes to Town: 8B Ends on a clifhanger but didnt really deserve it.2. Greased and Bridge: 10 The first part is disgusting as in a girl gets pimple juice poured all over her face nasty(and that\'s not even the scary part), and the second part is built up for no payoff whatsoever.So is this the perfect horror show we\'ve been waiting for....not really, but it\'s creative, has good atmosphere, and if you like genuine creepy horror give it a watch! creepy pop up images that make people just go ""The 7#(% am I looking at?""

He can captivate an eerie feeling in all of his stories, even if the horror itself isn\'t obvious. A lot of this is tribute to the way he draws, it all just has a darker feel to it, not comparable to today\'s recognisable \'horror\' Manga. So an anime adaptation is really tricky to pull off. I reckon, if it was given under the right hands, this would be very successful and possibly inspire animation...studios to not be afraid of animating this genre. But sadly this adaptation is a massive let down, I\'ve just finished watching episode 10 and I\'m at the point where I\'m lucky to be watching this as it comes out weekly... Other wise I probably would have dropped it by the third episode. Anyway this is all my opinion, if you enjoy the anime this isn\'t an attack on you but the anime itself, heck I love Junji Ito\'s work. Anyway lets get into the nitty gritty of this shall we?...Story 6/10:This isn\'t a big surprise but most of Junji Ito\'s One-Offs rarely focuses on story but more on the actual horror that is being represented in his works. Lets use \'Fashion Model\' as an example. The main character barely gets developed and all we pretty much know about him is that he ""Knows when something isn\'t right"". Its more focused on how the main character acts towards the main force of threat, being the \'Fashion Model\'. This is evident in a lot of his stories. The only characters in this adaptation I can say gets some sort of character development is the Shuichi and Tomie stories. Even then its still not great. One thing I can say which is a good positive is that it keeps loyal to its source material... Most of the time. The longer stories like \'Lovesick Dead\' and \'The Street With No Roads\' Just get butchered. I mean, it does leave people who have read these stories with a disappointing take on it. They could have dedicated a few episodes to bigger stories instead of following the rule of two stories an episode.Art 5/10:-sigh- This is something I really don\'t want to write about as this is one of the adaptation\'s worst points. The art is poor, especially with far away shots. One of the \'Fashion Model\' Far shots had me in tears. Not in tears of fear. But in laughter. Some of the close up shots are alright but definitely not up to the Manga\'s standards. Even then putting the Manga out of the equation, the art seems just like a generic anime. The art is at its best when someone reacts to the horror close up. There is a sense of dread at times that do change the experience from being just plain dull. But there isn\'t nearly enough of those \'good, close up shots\' to be passable. So the art is very mediocre. Oh and just as a side note. I hate it when anime uses real f****** pictures. The \'Honoured Ancestors\' had one particular scene where they used a REAL LIFE image and just pretty much zoomed in on it. Like really? If you have watched the anime up till now you probably know what I\'m talking about. Case in point, not as terrifying as the Manga for sure.Animation 6/10:Not much I can say here other then the fact that its just okay. Not great. But not bad. I think the only time where I dislike the way they animated things was in the \'Marionette Mansion\' episode. I felt like they could have made much more of the movements fluent... They pretty much float around the room as if they were in space. They don\'t even feel like real puppets and thats what they are supposed to be! Other than this story; animation is good.Sound 6/10:It feels like its pretty much a gamble with sound really, sometimes its used effectively and other times its not really used as well as it should. The opening is fantastic if that counts as sound. When sound is used effectively (Fashion Model probably had the best sounds that fit the atmosphere of the episode) it can change the mood and make things feel more scary. Overall. Again, it has its highlights but most of the time its just okay. Thats pretty much the trend of this review. The voice actors are again not bad, but some just aren\'t trying at all. Especially some of the monsters. I feel like Fuchi had the best voice actor, as despite her horrifying appearance, she is calm and opening which definitely makes things more creepy.Enjoyment 6/10:So my feelings towards this adaptation is pretty much just full of false hope, that they would be able to adapt a story perfectly. There are were few that have been good, like \'Fashion Model\' \'Painter\' etc. But a lot of the time stories just don\'t meet expectations. Stories that are supposed to be creepy and make you think, are let down by mediocre art and half-assed animation. \'Long Dreams\' could have been far scarier if the effort and detail is put into it, but we are left with just mediocrity, like most of the anime. I recently just finished \'Greased\' which, arguably enough, was the reason I wrote this in the first place. The original made me feel ill on how well detailed and creepy it was, you\'d think the anime would make it even grosser but no. It didn\'t. It was pretty tame actually. So I will probably watch the final two episodes. And never comeback to it. Such a shame...Overall 6/10:This is probably the most disappointing anime of this year as of writing this... Junji Ito is a legend among all horror writers and going back reading his works reminds me of the sense of fear I felt the first time I read those stories. Heck, \'Fashion Model\' made me have trouble sleeping. So I was excited for this adaptation, but I knew from the first episode that I was gonna be left disappointed, from the half-assed animation, to not being able to properly capture the sense of fear that Junji Ito is known for. It\'s just passable as a mediocre anime. Trust me, writing this has been quite sad actually. I was really hoping this would be amazing and change a lot of \'horror\' that has come out over the years. Maybe in a couple years time we will get a second season in which a different studio will have an attempt at animating it. But for now. This anime adaptation of the horror legend himself... gets a score of 6/10. Its not terrible, but just disappointing.Thank you for taking your time to read this. studios to not be afraid of animating this genre.

Its not terrible, but just disappointing.Thank you for taking your time to read this.', ""This collection was one of my most anticipated anime projects at the time and when it released it was the biggest pile of shit ever junji Ito has always been the greatest mangaka there was at writing bone chilling stuff with some of the greatest art I've seen and this is just a stain that carries none of the impact.Furthermore the art just feels flat it's a massive nothing burger with no soul behind the art just a cheap imitation of something superior. The voice acting is also lackluster and doesn't fit well it's like watching the Schneider cut of Batman Vs superman in German. "", 'Story 10/10Of course the stories are good, they\'re written by Junji Ito for goodness sake! He\'s the best horror manga writer of all time and this anime practically made him into a comedy. If anything I\'ll use this space to just repeat again: Junji Ito is a fantastic writer and a lot of his works actually make my skin crawl they\'re so creepy and vivid- but this anime was a far cry from that. Saying the art is pathetic is an understatement. I was wondering eagerly how they would transfer Junji Ito\'s creepy style into animation like ""Are they going to make it all black...and white? Is it going to be really sketchy, pencil-line style? Is it-"" No. Just no. They barely tried. It looks as generic as some random high-school anime (no offense to people who like generic high school anime but it just doesn\'t suit horror at all). I think the series would\'ve benefited so much from just being in black and white. It also felt like they modernized some of it? I liked the manga because it sort of played to the same western slasher aesthetic (even though the manga probably came first) but that whole energy was just gone? They really missed the mark on this. and white? Is it going to be really sketchy, pencil-line style? Is it-"" No. Just no. They barely tried.

They really missed the mark on this.', ""Why should you watch Junji Ito: Collection?Stories are Outstanding (10). The title says the story out loud. This is a collection of horror stories based on the horror collection of the father of modern Japanese horror, Junji Ito. If you are not familiar with him then think of him as the Stephen King of Japan but more bizarre. The stories of this series are the strongest part of this anime. They are broken down into 2 stories per episode with varying run times, so it is always fresh and you can watch the episodes in any order as they stand out on their own individually....Each of the stories evokes a sense of helplessness, dread, and eeriness that sends chills and uneasiness down your spine. They are meant to be that way so If you are looking forward to jumping scares, there isn't much here.Art is Mediocre (5). Yeah... why did the story get a perfect 10 and the art got a 5? It is simply due to one reason: The manga series that it was taken from is way superior to the animation that you can't 100% transfer the experience you have when reading the manga in animation or live-action format. This has been the ongoing problem of adapting stories from Junji Ito's works. So If you want the full experience read the manga and you will understand what I mean.Sound is Fair (6). Sound in Junji Ito: Collection is fair enough to justify the emotion it tries to evoke from the audience but it is not master quality. I watch each episode usually alone in a dark room and it fails to make me feel uneasy which totally breaks the experience for me. The opening and ending songs are just fair as well. They don't stand out as much.Characters are Great (9). As with the story, I love how the characters are made and imagined in the story. When I say characters here, they are not the people, but the supernatural entities who cross the world of the living. Characters like Tomie, Soichi, the professional model Fuch, and more, are the stars of the series hands down. They are all unique enough to have a mini-series or movie of their own which is saying a lot about how the character design and personality were presented.In general, I came in to watch Junji Ito: Collection with a grain of salt. And my assessment was still spot on. The animation failed to capture the manga. Future adaptation of the manga should learn from this, and the previous feature films that came before it. If they are going to adapt any story from Junji Ito's Archives, they should not try to make it 1:1. They should make it for what would work for animation and just get inspiration from the manga.7 blood bubbles out of 10. Each of the stories evokes a sense of helplessness, dread, and eeriness that sends chills and uneasiness down your spine. They are meant to be that way so If you are looking forward to jumping scares, there isn't much here.Art is Mediocre (5). Yeah... why did the story get a perfect 10 and the art got a 5? It is simply due to one reason: The manga series that it was taken from is way superior to the animation that you can't 100% transfer the experience you have when reading the manga in animation or live-action format. This has been the ongoing problem of adapting stories from Junji Ito's works. So If you want the full experience read the manga and you will understand what I mean.Sound is Fair (6). Sound in Junji Ito: Collection is fair enough to justify the emotion it tries to evoke from the audience but it is not master quality. I watch each episode usually alone in a dark room and it fails to make me feel uneasy which totally breaks the experience for me. The opening and ending songs are just fair as well. They don't stand out as much.Characters are Great (9). As with the story, I love how the characters are made and imagined in the story.

At no times i felt the same horror when reading the manga, only the horror of wishing it would end already.This is just a huge waste of time and i hope the works of Junji Ito get one day the adaptation it deserves. "", ""If you're looking for a comedic, bad art style collection of things not to do in any horror situations then congratulations, you've got a 10/10 anime right here, go ahead.If you're looking for an anime creation of some of Junji Itou's sickest works then you'd probably have better luck creating it yourself.Now, a lot of fellow Junji Itou fans warned me off watching this. Being a relatively new fan, I took their warnings into consideration but I still chose to watch this with a friend as something for us to do in the evenings. Part of me really wishes I'd listened to other fans...of Itou, but part of me is also now glad - at least I know now that when I read the mangas I have yet to read, I'm going to enjoy them ten times more.Although the storylines in this are spectacular and follow Itou's work perfectly, the art style in this let it down. The only word I can use to describe it is just. Lazy. Terrible pan shots, notable repeated uses of the same frames, and just some generically bad drawing where some characters didn't even have their full noses drawn on. Each episode seemed to drag on longer and longer and the only reason I continued watching this was to avoid dropping an anime and having my first red mark on my MyAnimeList statistics. It was simply shocking. Although the sound work and seiyuu's brought this to life, the artwork fully ruined it. As many other's have said - this is somewhat of an insult to the beautifully constructed art frames that Itou spends so much time and energy to create.Maybe they were rushed and that's why it just seemed limp and pale, but there was no excuse for this to be rushed. They should have tried to hire Itou on board as the art creator and director, frankly. This was just an abomination and I wish Splatter would work on sections of the brain so I could forget I ever forced myself to sit through this.I think truly the thing that most disappointed me in this was just that I ended up laughing through a lot of the scenes. I ended up sitting and laughing through scenes that were meant to be sad or disturbing because the artwork was so bad and - if I'm honest - that actually hurt a little bit. I shouldn't be laughing through the work of one of my favourite authors for his disturbing and intriguing work. It's just not right.Miss this, if you're an Itou fan, truly miss it.

Junji Ito Collection tries to copy Ito\'s panels beat for beat but loses so much tension and character in it\'s poor execution. I feel bad for anyone exposed to this show before having read the manga. Ito\'s mastery deserves a more fair amount of gravitas and care in order to translate to animation. This extremely sloppy rush-job of a production is obviously meant to cater to Ito fans, but the staff who has handled this project seems to have little to no passion for what they\'re putting out there. Ito\'s stories are carried by his...stark artistic style; shadows are black as can be, blood spatter looks like it came from a real crime scene, he always pushes the uncanny valley with his monsters so that when they are revealed in the manga you will be frozen in surprise in the presence of the image. While I can say that the color palette used is relatively accurate to his own color choices, the ""style"" used by studio DEEN is rather understated and cheap. It\'s obvious the animators did not want to stay true to Ito\'s style, as characters will frequently snap in and out of states of generic seinen style and ito style, often being in the same scene, in adjacent frames; that is when anything is being animated at all. Get used to long dragged out scenes aimed at being atmospheric, ultimately coming off as a thinly veiled excuse to pad out time so they don\'t have to put in any effort. Every moment of this show feels like they\'re cutting corners just to make the deadline. The features of the characters change drastically as you can plainly see the animators becoming bored with a project that\'s way over their heads. I hate this anime so much because the source material is really important in the scope of Japanese art, and people who are new to the guro genre would see what could\'ve been a classic and instantly dismiss it for being conveyed so poorly. 1/10 do not watch. It\'s even worse than Gyo.

Exactly, the anime.This is where everything becomes ""horrifying"", since the work of Studio DEEN is very bad, it has very static animations, flat and very badly drawn faces, so it is difficult to take everything that happens, if we add that...the bad lighting that all the scenes have seems like a bad parody of youtube.Sound has good moments where the touches of suspense and tension that catch us are achieved, but not equally fail because together with the animation you lose all the emotions that each story can generate. the opening becomes good only by repetition and the ending is passable.The landscapes or scenarios are very beautiful, so much that it seemed that they spent all the budget in making them, hopefully the whole series would have looked like this.Finally falling into the following conclusion.This anime was made with a lot of reluctance, trying to imitate every vignette of Ito\'s work but failing in a huge way, the only thing that is achieved is that the viewer starts laughing at work and can not get that experience of horror that promised so much this series. This was the only series that I expected this winter with very high expectations, but now I do not make high expectations for horror series.

There are very few decent horror anime, and while it is definitely true that all these stories work much better as manga, it was still enjoyable and scary to watch compared to other horror anime. It is all credited to the creativeness of Junji Ito's mind. If this anime used this same format with less compelling stories, I would have rated it MUCH lower. Fortunately for the producers, they were using Ito's stories and character designs. Ito's genius is the only thing keeping this anime from being trash. "", ""(huge reminder that I'm not that good at writing review so I apologize if it's messy and few bad grammar)(also another reminder that I may edit this review)This is actually the first time I got to read the manga that I buy before the anime adaptations (I didn't get to read all collection however but I do get some of them). When I found out that junji ito's manga will become an anime I was about to get interested as 11 - 12 year old me was a huge fan of horror and creepy stuff (yeah I don't know why I was like that...either but I still like watching creepy stuff ofc).I still remember when I read the manga and got a creepy vibe after read it. I remember felt itchy when I read this one part where a main character's dad in this one chapter got holes all over his body, probs because that was first trypophobia image I ever seen at that time.However, when I watch the anime, it just.. not as good as I hope. Not really sure if I can say it's kinda disappointing. I can't really say much since I only watch like 3 episodes that I found on YouTube. I just didn't get any creepy vibe or scary feeling to it.I'm not really sure if it's because the manga is in black and white, or it might because the style just didn't get as appeal as the manga. Or probably because they cut some part in the manga? I know that might sounds dumb but it could be the reason I didn't get interest in it? There this one chapter about leech in the manga and its only like 4 minutes in the anime.I don't really know much what to say about the story since this anime is mostly a whole collection (probably not all) of junji ito's horror manga. Each chapter shows different stories and different characters (besides that weird nail kid thing). Not to mention, the animation is sometimes okay sometimes horrible. Sound was okay or nice? The voice isn't that bad though I'm not really sure about the ost. Well that's Studio Deen for you I guess.Overall, I give this anime 3/10 but I might giving this 4 as well? I'm not sure if people who didn't read the manga or not a fan of junji ito at least think this is a decent anime, but what I know is it's a huge downgrade compare to the manga. either but I still like watching creepy stuff ofc).I still remember when I read the manga and got a creepy vibe after read it.

I was looking forward to see some of Ito Junji\'s work in animated form. I tried to be scared or suprised or whatever.

But unlike Toei that could create quality content every once in awhile, Studio Deen seems to have a problem on creating an adaptation that is on par nowadays. For those who wants to defend Studio Deen, this anime is not the hill you want to die on.Ito Junji Collection is a collection of...Ito Junjis work that works as an anthology series. This means that we will see a collection of separate horror stories. Now as this anime might seem to have no problem regarding having continuous story with just show different scenarios. Yet! They find a way to even mess those things up. I’ll explain that one in just a moment.As you might know, sometimes some scenes or some moments needs to be compromised. The artwork of the creators can be very unique when someone going to copy it, especially when you are going to animate it. But when you do compromised things, you need to remember that it should still show the quality in of the artwork in another ways. With that said and done, do you think they did a good job? Because I don't think they did a good job.You have choppy character movements, goofy execution, gray visuals instead of good contrasts, scenes that has less impactful cinematography one chopped still image. They even photoshopped an image of a spider in one scene. I’m not even joking, the spider looks so fake that I noticed the second it appeared on screen.They even compromise still shots! Wow! This isn’t something that moves that much or in the background, it’s in the center of the screen and it’s a still shot! You couldn't even bother giving this horrendous women some time.And that's what the anime fails to do, to make the character look intentional horrendous. The details and the contrast from the Black and white from manga are gone. The charm of the surreal illustrations are tooned down and how they are delivered in the story is watered down. This is a shame for any horror story, especially for this anime.But Taff, you have just talked about the animation and how it reflects the story elements. You haven’t actually talked about the story ITSELF.Well here is the thing, despite Ito junji being a good artist, he isn’t always a good story teller. He usually make stories where people does illogical choices regarding how they feel and know about the situation. Some are excusable, others are not.With that I mean that character does some stupid shit that makes you think if they just wanted to die. Now now, I do understand when something that motivates them to do something else with affection or with the information they have at hand, this can easily be understanded in stories like Tomie and Lovesick Dead. When someone is madly in love or distracted, they do stuff they would normally wouldn’t do.What I’m saying is that not all stories does focus on these topics. It’s the mentality of the characters. How should I put? If a character saw a train coming towards them and they yell that they needed to move away, they would still be in the rails and not even attempt to move from their position.Sometimes we have stories like the circus where we are to believe that none of the audience objected when each and everyone of the performer suddenly died infront of them. I mean, characters are yelling that the circus is cursed and then get murdered in front of the audience. Is really nobody in this massive audience going to do anything? In fact, when the host speaks to the audience that he needs their help to recruit replacement for the now dead performer, they all seemed to be willing to join in because of the girl. Wha-what!? This would make sense of the audience was cheering for these murders, but they aren't doing that. They show a clear disgust of what has happened. See this is why episode 8 is the worst episode.And sadly, this anime has more of his lesser work than his best work. And the team didn’t even looked over these things. Hell, you could argue that they even made some stories worse.Isn’t the productions team job to evaluate someone's story to another medium and sloppy copying pasting it?For those who wonders, yes there are good parts in this anime. Like I said, the collection does include good stories. In Fact most of them are in the Opening.For example: it has the Slug Girl, Long Dream, Tomie, Lovesick Dead, My Dear Ancestors, hell they even have stories of our favorite pathetic and pale boi! Yes Souichi is finally in animation!However, if you expect these character to appear frequently, then you are not in luck. Yeah, Lovesick Dead that supposedly have a continuing story spanning 5 chapters, only has one. This is coming from me who liked that story allot.Even best pale and pathetic boi doesn't get that many episode where he is featured. If this series was just about him, then this anime might have been much higher on this list.Can we also talk about the OP? I get an impression that they fought that getting into the mood for scary imagery was by having a rock music and present their monsters like they are a crime fighting team. In other words, I think it doesn’t fit the show. Now the ED, is more fitting.I mean this anime is just a waste of time.If you want to read Ito Junji collection, that is fine, you got many chapters which will are a feast to the eye.

I could never get enough of his creative ways of twisting the reader's minds. But I do not like how forced this anime was. It gave the manga no justice. It was almost as if this anime wasn't even based on Junji's mangas at all. I really really tried to enjoy it but they did Ito Junji so wrong with this rushed mess.Art: 2/10 The characters were lifeless and draw very poorly. Look at how eloquently Junji draws his manga and spends so much...time on shading to make everything come to life and look believable on the pages and then compare it to the lifeless soulless mess they completely rushed out of the studio.Sound: 1/10 The characters were voiced right some of the time but my biggest issue is with the ear-grating music that they chose. I seriously don't know what they were thinking when they rushed this out to the public.Character: 6/10 they stuck to the manga's portrayal of the characters so there are no complaints there. Just some of the interactions were rushed or ignored completely to fit the time frame for each episode.Enjoyment: 6/10 I am so very desperate for a GOOD horror anime that I'd watch just about anything at this point.Overall: They did the Junji so wrong with this adaption. I normally don't like to read manga unless it truly interests me but I'd rather read Junji's works than watch this. Reading his manga is actually enjoyable and I feel as if I am there with the characters which is rare for me when reading manga. I am so disappointed by how they did this series.Now don't get me wrong, I am open to watching anime based on Junji's works again but I just hope that they don't rush it and bunch all of the episodes together in such a small timeframe. time on shading to make everything come to life and look believable on the pages and then compare it to the lifeless soulless mess they completely rushed out of the studio.Sound: 1/10 The characters were voiced right some of the time but my biggest issue is with the ear-grating music that they chose.

After reading that, I kinda got obsessed over his works. Within a month or so, I almost finished the whole Ito Junji manga collection. His style of writing and art were so bizzare, weird and complex, that they sometimes seemed relevantly scary, albeit with their own symbolism hidden inside them, some in plain sight. As the newfound fan inside me got hyped up on hearing that his works were going to be adapted into anime, I...was pretty excited. But after finishing the anime, my reactions are pretty mixed.For starters, I expected more from the studio which developed some of my favourite anime, like Sakamoto desu ga? and Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou. The starting episodes were pretty messed up, but the later episodes containing stories from \'Long Dreams\', and my personal favourite, the story of the seductress succubus, \'Tomie\', were made really well. The opening and ending songs(Shichiten Battou no Blues by The Pinballs and Otagai no Uchuu by JYOCHO) really complement the anime, with a mix of peppiness and eeriness, which haunt you for a while.The art style seems a bit out of place, compared to the pen work of Junji Ito himself. His art is the best feature of his works, which show a gamut of emotions using facial expressions. Droppy eyes, exaggerated mouth, pointy teeth, etc are his trademark strokes.Overall, compared to the manga, Studio Deen has done a decent job on adapting the manga onscreen. Nevertheless, it was good to watch his creations come alive on screen, much like my dream of seeing the characters from Goosebumps onscreen, a distant dream. was pretty excited.

Unfortunately it fell short, and I apparently felt so strongly about it I was urged to write my first review here.When it was announced there was to be an anime adaption of Junji Ito's work, I think we can all agree there was a lot of anticipation, Ito being one of the best horror artists in manga. There was, however, many disappointments. As the anime progressed, I desperately hoped it would pick up or find its rhythm, but it never did.The first flaw was splitting up multiple stories into ten minute pieces. As a result...of this decision, it often feels lackluster - things don't come to any sort of conclusion (which I know is sometimes a feature of some of his stories), it left me feeling dissatisfied and made the stories seem almost unfinished. Various stories have multiple different lengths, so sometimes they had to spread it out unnaturally long, or in the case of stories like Tomie - cram in a lot of material into only ten minutes. I feel if the anime focused on just one of the stories, this could have been resolved.Another issue was the art. The art, for me, was another one of the biggest disappointments of the anime. His work, as many raised concerns over, is often rather difficult to translate into animation. While in the manga his art tends to be detailed, intricate, striking, the anime completely failed to deliver - while at times there was unsettling and interesting imagery, the art was often incredibly bland, poor and dull. There were occasions in the anime where the animation was literally so terrible, you could tell they were blatantly running over budget.Partly as a result of failing to translate from paper to screen, some of the horror is missing too - and to such a degree that the anime at times felt silly. There simply isn't the creepiness factor to the same degree as in the manga, minus a few frames.Overall, i'd say this adaptation was incredibly underwhelming and failed to contribute anything worthwhile in terms of the recreation of his work. However, if you are a fan of Junji Ito (or horror in general), I would still recommend watching it and see how you feel about it yourself, (Even better, read the manga!) While my review is not particularly favorable, the anime did produce some enjoyment. As a fan of Junji Ito, I was intrigued to see where it went - and it was interesting to see it adapted as an anime, even if just making me wonder about the possibilities of a better quality adaption. of this decision, it often feels lackluster - things don't come to any sort of conclusion (which I know is sometimes a feature of some of his stories), it left me feeling dissatisfied and made the stories seem almost unfinished.

The Anime Man describes some of the problems with manga to animated translations in general. A large portion of the shock and horror factor in Junji's horror manga is that you can go at our own pace, absorb all details, and should the next page turn be suddenly disturbing, it's a small jump scare without...being as cheesy and overused as an actual jump scare. Without this pacing, it is entirely on the anime's shoulders to effectively shock and scare, because now rather than imagining how this page would look in detail or color, or how it would move, it's all able to be taken at face value based on the animation.This being said, the attempt at slightly mocking Junji Ito's art style was beneficial to keeping in tone with the mangas. Something that desperately should've been taken advantage of but was neglected almost entirely, however, was visual atmospheric effects. Lighting, color palettes, etc. Everything was so dull and dreadfully boring and plain looking, and while in some stories this could work to it's advantage, in many I couldn't help but feel that it would've greatly benefited from doing so. This was especially disappointing, as upon seeing the OP I was incredibly hype. The style of it, the coloration, patterns, everything - but this all was left for only the OP.The story selection weren't some of my favorites (I was hoping for more Tomie ;w;) but they definitely weren't bad and even introduced some to me I had not yet read. Souichi's stories are far from bad, but I feel they were a poor choice in this collection where it's overall tone seemed to be entirely horror based, whereas Souichi's story is moreso pitying the villain. I wouldn't mind his inclusion as much had he not been the very first story for the very first episode, but that was unfortunately the case and I'm sure that 1st episode alone steered away many disappointed Junji fans.Overall: It's... okay! You will enjoy it if you enjoy Junji Ito's work, but likely not as much if you're a die hard. It's a step in the right direction for possible future additions, as it did not try to stray away from the stories or make sense of the unknown and nonsensical. I hope this adaptation does not steer away from more, as I'd love to see it nailed near perfectly. being as cheesy and overused as an actual jump scare.

Excited, but sceptic at the same time. Putting my reservations aside I finally decided to start watching it.And well... It's a 5/10 show. Boring at every step with no standout moment nor quality. Why 3 then?The answer is simple - the source material.The last thing that should've been said about adaptation of one of most disturbing mangas ever created is that it is forgettable. But to the shows defence - maybe there...just is no better medium than manga for Junji's art? But on the other hand, there are some disturbing shows out there like Texhnolyze... I dunno. What I can say tho is that il just looks like the creators bit off more that they could chew. just is no better medium than manga for Junji's art?

The stories have no relation... at least, the most of them. But something in common in the stories is that all of them have suspense, horror and all of them are strange, bizarre and supernatural. Some stories are REALLY great (like the Model) and there are some really short and forgetable stories.The worst thing here it's the animation: it seems that kids did the animation....This anime deserved something better than that.The opening and the ending are great, really fits the premise of the Collection.So, if you are looking for a horror anime with no long story (actually, a lot of stories) this is the one for you!

These adaptations of Junji\'s short stories have varing qualities, mostly from awful to serviceable, with a few good ones in the mix. I am not a horror fan to begin with, but I was able to finish Junji\'s original manga anthology out of some morbid and OCD-ish curiosity. This anime series can be a serviceable introduction to Junji\'s extensive works, provided that you can stand the unstable art and barely-moving animations.There are many problems plaguing this anime series. Though to be honest some...of these issues are inherent to Junji\'s original manga. Junji might have created a new genre (or that he perfected a certain style pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft)--""slice of darkness"" or ""slice of nightmare"" (as I named it). His stories often starts and ends abruptly, without proper closure or epilogue. What were left in the audience\'s memory are usually the most nightmarish images, and those become slices of bad dreams looming in your subconsciousness. Adapting these stories into anime naturally invites problems of pacing, framing among other issues. With that said, Studio Deen could have done a much better job.Baseline impression: 5.5-6/10. Many sequences show a lack of commitment that it becomes a bit repulsive.Recommended to: only those who are curious to know what\'s Itou Junji is all about but find themselves unable to get into the manga. These short ""motion manga strips"" might give you a fair appetite for Junji\'s works.Pros and Cons:+ Mostly conveys Junji\'s art style and horror elements. Some sequences can be as effective as the manga.+ If you ever want a motion manga from Junji with professional voice acting, your dream has come true.- Ugly and unstable facial art takes you out of immersion a lot of times.- Too many still frames. Many intense sequences are also made of a few sliding paper cutouts of characters. I don\'t think Junji Itou intended for his work to look like that in motion.- Unsatisfying and fragmented adaptation of longer stories. You\'d think the Intersection\'s Pretty Boy would last at least 3 episodes, but no, only about 20% of that story made it into the anime.- Some masterful horror moments were ruined by cheap treatment or laughable timing/pacing.Long Review (moderate spoilers):This is far from the worst anime, but its low rating here is understandable. Then again how would you rate a horror show properly? If you soil yourself watching it, does it mean it\'s worth a 10? If it\'s somehow not scary enough, is it a plus or minus? In my case I prefer serious drama or tragedy with light horror elements.In any case, the animation is faithful to the manga but also basic. Many sequences are just manga strips with still characters. Perhaps Junji\'s most works do not need to be adapted into anime in the first place. Likeable characters? Thoughtful themes? Those are not the reason his fans read him. And the anime has the unfortunate 1st episode of a obnoxious boy cursing others with Japanese hexes.If this anime intended twisted humor, then I would say it succeeded. But I doubt that\'s the case. The timing of jump scares and voice acting sometimes created unintentional comedies. And I am not talking about the Souichi episodes which were intended as horror-comedies. Some of the most unnerving moments in the manga made me LOL in the anime, for some reason.There are some short stories which are more accomplished and mesmerizing. ""Lingering Farewell"" in EP6 is one of them. Yet it\'s mind-boggling why they would not adapt more of these type of melancholic and thoughtful tales. However, this criticism of mine is also applicable to 90% of Junji\'s manga. Most of his works focused on disgusting body-horror rather than more human aspects of urban legends/ghost stories.There some absolutely atrocious adaptations mixed in this anthology. ""Second-hand Record"" for example, ruins the most unnerving sequence/ending of the original short story. Perhaps animating corpses singing the harrowing song is too difficult to pull off? When read on manga, the ""song from the other world"" is all left to the readers\' imaginations. In this anime adaptation, the song actually does not sound too bad, but much weaker than what the readers imagination can do.Similar issues can be found in adaptations of longer stories. ""Further Tales of Oshikiri"", for example, are a series of urban legends revolving the main character\'s house which serves as a hallway to alternate dimensions. You\'d expect the full storyline of Oshikiri from this anime, but it ended abruptly without any satisfying development.There are some more interesting stories with spicy social commentaries (The Town without Streets, for example). You can sense Junji\'s talent for blending cosmic horror with societal issues of modern times, even when the anime quality is serviceable-to-decent at best.Some stories will gross you out so much that you want to pinch yourself to get away from the ghastly visions depicted in the anime. the infamous greasy nightmare scene in ""Glyceride"", for example, still worked effectively despite of the poor animation/facial art. However, the facial art is often just ugly. No wonder why Studio Deen in recent years has garnered an awful reputation.In conclusion, if you are a fan of Junji, do not mind this anime.

Then again, it's extremely hard to translate the intricate art of Junji Ito into anime, especially when a lot of the horror is left up to the readers and the timing of scares is originally left up to them, too. It makes me sad, this could've been a lot better. However, if Ito himself said he was satisfied with the end product, I guess I kind of am, too. I just feel that a lot of the weight some of the art and scenes had were taken away in this adaptation. It's not good, but it's not really terrible or unwatchable, and someone...who isn't really all about Ito and his works can still enjoy this and get scared if it's their first viewing. who isn't really all about Ito and his works can still enjoy this and get scared if it's their first viewing."", 'IntroI have taken some time to give a proper review of this anime. As a self-proclaimed fan of Ito-sensei’s creations, I consider it a responsibility to make my opinions known about his creations.In this article, I will be discussing the first anime adaptation of the master of horror manga, the Junji Ito Collection.StoryI think all fans of Ito’s work will agree with me on one thing: this anime had everything to be great and yet it wasted the opportunity. Lots of manga don’t make it to anime because of their delicate content or high level of detail. And that’s why Ito’s works have not been...adapted… until now.I don’t feel like I have much to say about the story. To me, most of Ito’s work are undeniably good. They are characterised by their brevity and abrupt endings. Personally, short horror stories fascinate me (like Yami Shibai) and that’s why I liked this format. Now, the studio did a good job after all in accommodating two stories per episode.In addition to the unsettling horror, the comedy factor is a key point in Junji Ito’s work, especially in the Souichi timeline. I don’t think they have captured it very well either.My favourite episode was Intersection’s Pretty Boy, which was adapted in its first part, and I thought it was okay. Other episodesI enjoyed are Slug Girl, The Woman Next Door, Blood-bubble Bushes and The Long Dream. The Woman Next Door tale gave me real chills. I think it was the episode that scared me the most.Some say that the author’s best stories were not chosen for this adaptation. I think it would make no difference if one tale or another had been selected.Each of Ito’s tales has its charm. And if it is the case that one of them was not so popular, I think it is good that they have made it known. Personally, I think they have made a good selection, from the cumbersome to the certainly disturbing.Overall, I can say that the stories are well-paced in terms of the length of each episode. Perhaps this is the only good thing they have done.CharactersAmong my favourite characters in this selection series are the intersection’s bishounen, the vampire from the Blood-bubble Bushes episode, Ryuusuke, and Yuko, the slug girl.They were all well portrayed, but unfortunately due to the poor animation, they didn’t stand out much though.AnimationThis is the weakest point of this anime, as many would say. The rigid drawing quality with which they have portrayed each character could even qualify as mediocre. This is very frustrating, considering that Ito’s art is drawn with exquisite detail. And it’s true that the adaptations will never be as accurate as of the manga, but still, I can see the lack of commitment on this one.The adaptation of Ito’s art into anime carries great hype among fans. And, of course, we can expect nothing less, however, the animation and, mainly, the design of the characters and environments left a lot to be desired. The drawing looks sloppy and rushed.Another bad point as we all know is the censored scenes. By now we should know that this anime was produced for an open audience. Although Ito’s drawings are not excessively gory nor has too much explicit nudity, they did censor these two aspects anyway.A clear example of the producers’ lack of ambition in animation is Gantz. Unfortunately, Junji Ito’s works suffered the same. That is why I strongly recommend reading the manga before passing any judgment on the mangaka’s art style.SoundtrackJunji Ito Collection’s soundtrack goes completely unnoticed. I don’t recall jumping in fear, or going through any frustrating tension (except when I was waiting to see the bishounen). Mind you, in the episode Used Record, it was terrific to learn about the cursed melody that led people to a tragic death.As I understand it, the ambient sound is supposed to accompany or even heighten the tension of the psychological horror scenes, which the whole series lacks.The voice acting is fine overall. I single out Souichi’s seiyuu for pulling off the essence of the character. Also, the voice of the Intersection’s Pretty Boy also matched him perfectly.As for the opening and ending songs, I didn’t enjoy them as much as I’d like to. But I know of people who really liked the opening song and I must admit that it fits well with the cinematics.Final ScoreJust because I was so excited about this adaptation, I have given it a final score of 6. After all, it will always be exciting to see your favourite manga characters animated. Studio Deen could have done much better, but I don’t regret watching it. If you don’t want to scare yourself too much, I’d even recommend it if you’re new to Ito’s work.Unfortunately, the Junji Ito Collection anime didn’t live up to my expectations.You will understand why I consider this adaptation a missed opportunity. I just hope they do justice to Uzumaki’s production. Ito-sensei deserves to have his art properly adapted. If not, please don’t do it. adapted… until now.I don’t feel like I have much to say about the story. To me, most of Ito’s work are undeniably good.

And, of course, we can expect nothing less, however, the animation and, mainly, the design of the characters and environments left a lot to be desired. The drawing looks sloppy and rushed.Another bad point as we all know is the censored scenes. By now we should know that this anime was produced for an open audience. Although Ito’s drawings are not excessively gory nor has too much explicit nudity, they did censor these two aspects anyway.A clear example of the producers’ lack of ambition in animation is Gantz. Unfortunately, Junji Ito’s works suffered the same. That is why I strongly recommend reading the manga before passing any judgment on the mangaka’s art style.SoundtrackJunji Ito Collection’s soundtrack goes completely unnoticed. I don’t recall jumping in fear, or going through any frustrating tension (except when I was waiting to see the bishounen). Mind you, in the episode Used Record, it was terrific to learn about the cursed melody that led people to a tragic death.As I understand it, the ambient sound is supposed to accompany or even heighten the tension of the psychological horror scenes, which the whole series lacks.The voice acting is fine overall. I single out Souichi’s seiyuu for pulling off the essence of the character. Also, the voice of the Intersection’s Pretty Boy also matched him perfectly.As for the opening and ending songs, I didn’t enjoy them as much as I’d like to. But I know of people who really liked the opening song and I must admit that it fits well with the cinematics.Final ScoreJust because I was so excited about this adaptation, I have given it a final score of 6. After all, it will always be exciting to see your favourite manga characters animated. Studio Deen could have done much better, but I don’t regret watching it. If you don’t want to scare yourself too much, I’d even recommend it if you’re new to Ito’s work.Unfortunately, the Junji Ito Collection anime didn’t live up to my expectations.You will understand why I consider this adaptation a missed opportunity. I just hope they do justice to Uzumaki’s production. Ito-sensei deserves to have his art properly adapted. If not, please don’t do it.', ""This is one of my favourite horror series, it's so good i'm craving for another season. Few weeks ago Netflix announced Junji ito Maniac & from the trailer it seems that it's going to be a Tomie focused anime, the opening just gives of them vibes. I mean she's the whole trailer. I was hoping that it was going to be like the first season where nearly every ep is a new story. But unfortunately it doesn't seem to be that way. I'm still excited for it even tho it's most likely going to be evolved around Tomie.Here's some horror series recommendations:  Theatre of...darkness: Yamishiba & Kowabon.

Most of them are myths but they can make the story become interesting in this anime. Not only horror, but several episodes is quite sad too...Art (9)The art of this anime is very good. I like how they use color, shadow, and concept art in this anime. I really appreciated where they make every ending is different and adjusting to the story of that episode.Sound (10)All the sounds they used are very good and adjusted to the animation....Character (8)The main character is memorable, especially in the first episode where the MC is shown in several next episodes.Enjoyment (9)It's enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.

If this is a step to more horror anime being produced in the future then I can't be that mad. I very much understand the tone that was supposed to be reached here but this adaptation stinks. But I've never read the source material so don't judge me.Isn't it kind of embarrassing for the creators that everybody hates this show? BD numbers will surely disappoint too. If a second season is announced that means people don't read reviews.My favorite stories were Long Dream and Grease. You might get sick watching Grease spoiler alert....Try watching this show alone and in the dark. That might add some atmospheric edge. Try watching this show alone and in the dark. That might add some atmospheric edge."", ""I had high expectations for this anime, as I am a fan of Junji Ito's work. Perhaps I should not have, especially since I have seen the terrible movie adaptation of Uzumaki, just because it is an adaptation of Junji Ito's work, it is not necessarily good. And here is why this one fails at adapting it's source:First of all, while it is a faithful adaptation of Junji Ito's short stories, that is simply not enough. The essence of Ito's manga is not exactly in the stories themselves, it is in the presentation. While they are good stories reminiscent of urban legends, they do not...feel as anything more than that. Urban legends told by children at a playground. Without Ito Junji's way of telling these stories, they lose all the things that make them exceptional. This brings me to my next point: the art.Oh the animation. It is absolutely dreadful.  The lines are strange, thick, uneven and heavy; the colours are dull and utterly uninteresting; and the movement is lacking. Honestly, sometimes it looks like paper cutouts being dragged around in front of a still background. It is lazy, uninspired and ugly. The way the characters are drawn especially. While, I believe, the beauty of certain characters in Ito's manga serves an important purpose: to enhance the presentation of the horrors shown in the stories. On one hand, their beauty strengthens the contrast between the main characters and the monsters they encounter. In other cases, the beauty of an evil character can appear otherworldly and creepy. But whichever case we are talking about does not matter when it comes to this anime, as the characters just don't look all that beautiful at all. They look awkward, their faces seem off - and not in a creepy Junji Ito way -, and the lazy linework combined with dull colours  does not do them any good either. Luckily, the dreadful art is the worst part of this anime, all other aspects are decent at the least. And after the worst aspect follows the best.Here's a thing I actually loved about this show: the sound. For the most part. What got me to watch this anime aside from the fact that it is a Junji Ito adaptation was the OP. It is energetic, memorable and very cool. Though I am not sure if it is a great match for the mood of Junji Ito's manga, and definitely nothing like the actual anime. The ending surprised me by being even better. It is just the right amount of calming after an episode that was (supposed to be) stirring, while it keeps a sense of strangeness to fit the source material. It is quite a lovely song, I never actually once skipped the ED. As for the general soundtrack, it was nothing special. Just your average creepy ambient music. When there even was any music. This I honestly didn't really mind. While it could've been done a lot better in order to enhance the creepiness of the stories told, this at least was not absolutely terrible.The voice acting, while criticized by many was quite good in my opinion. The voices were fitting to the characters (I especially enjoy the fashion model's voice), and while they did sound strange at points, mostly they seemed natural and fit the rather dull and mundane design of the show well. It's important to mention that the voice actors did not have much to work with, as there was not too much personality to most characters depicted (except for the few whose personality was an important factor). Which normally would be fine, Junji Ito is not beloved for his character development. The characters are supposed to be there to be a witness of the terrible, inexplicable happenings around them. Shells whose shoes we could place ourselves and our friends into. As I said, normally this would not be an issue in a Junji Ito story. But in the case of this adaptation the boring and lifeless characters just add to the dull and gray feeling the show emits.Despite everything, I enjoyed this anime enough to keep watching all 12 episodes. Though I don't believe I would've kept watching if it was any longer.  Perhaps I enjoyed being reminded of all the good reads I had before. Maybe the anime did a good job at enhancing the more humorous side of Junji Ito's manga that sometimes appears. I honestly can't say if I would have enjoyed this anime more or less if I hadn't read a portion of the source material. I would argue that without any pre-established connection to the stories, you'll find nothing enjoyable in this anime. On the other hand, it's faults might bother you less if you don't get your expectations high after the manga. I do not know whether you will enjoy it, but I say if it doesn't seem worth watching after two or three episodes just drop it. It is not going to increase in quality the least bit.Overall,  I gave this anime a rating of 4 (Decent). I considered giving it the 'Poor' rating, but I decided this might not be as bad. It was not laughably terrible, nor was it unwatchable. It just felt unmotivated and seemingly made on a very low budget. Therefore I came to the conclusion it was decent.Now to summarize my points: My biggest issue was with the lazy animation, awkward artwork and dreadful colour design. Otherwise I found the show painfully average and uninteresting, not in any way reaching the greatness of the source material. The OP and ED are definitely worth listening to though, as they are great songs, completely unfitting to a dull anime such as this one. I am not saying you should avoid this anime at all costs, but if you feel like dropping it after a few episodes, do so, there is nothing worth staying for. feel as anything more than that.

I was really anticipating Junji Ito Collection on seeing it announced, as Ito's shorts were my introduction to his work, and to see some of the best among them animated was an exciting prospect. This anticipation, and my enjoyment of Ito's work definitely informed my scoring, as I have to say, after having gotten around to viewing it all the way through, what could've been a great homage to a legendary horror mangaka, was instead severely underwhelming. A few of the shorts really shine above the rest, and...at its high points, the series really captures the eerie, atmospheric, and distinctly Japanese feel that Ito pours into his manga. However, what seemed to me to be a middling animation budget, as well as, at times, surface level takes on the source material left a lot of these shorts really wanting. I really hope that the Tomie OVAs airing this month and next will do her justice, because she, at the very least, definitely deserves better than the mediocre end of average that this was. at its high points, the series really captures the eerie, atmospheric, and distinctly Japanese feel that Ito pours into his manga.

But then again, I wouldn't compare IJC at all because it is actually coloured (!), and one of a kind.Every episode features two stories, making it an episodic anime. This reminded me of American classic cartoons, stuff that aired in the 90s and which I absolutely love....They are proof of Ito's wild, unbound and vivid imagination. Shocking, ridiculous events and a strange kind of comedy kept me glued to the screen while I tried to make sense of the weird events …  or brought me on the edge of falling asleep. Unfortunately, IJC has its bunch of bad episodes which lowered my rating.The perhaps biggest issue for every horror anime is the question of whether it can scare its viewers or not. That's where most of them fail. Another question, however, is if it is even possible to lure out that feeling of unease. Most don't, but there are great examples –  Shinreigari and Lain are good ones – that have managed it.So, is the IJC scary? Without spoiling too much I can confirm that it has its moments.Fans of flashy animation and music better look for something else to watch. IJC is minimalist, spartan if you want, but the simple truth is that it doesn't need more.Animation is used rarely, which can either be seen as the directors means to tell the stories or the producers greed. We all know which it is, but it works surprisingly good; most of the time it's the character's thoughts and their interactions that are in focus, but even hot pursuits are told just fine this way and made me realize that most shounen anime simply are a waste of money.As I mentioned, music is rare, too, but there are a couple of nice sounding tunes that repeat itself during the cour and build a creepy atmosphere, all to my liking.The characters are IJC's strongest point. It's them with their sleep deprived, dark underlined eyes that give the stories their faces (pun intended). Due to the episodic structure there is of course no development, but that isn't needed. In my opinion, IJC features some of the most unique and unforgettable persona you will find in anime, like Souichi, a serious nut job of an primary-school pupil, the ugliest supermodel ever and a scary French doll called Jean-Pierre. These three also appear in the best episodes and make it a must watch.Ito, creator of the infamous Uzumaki (Spiral), and his works are true originals, combining horror, dementia and his weird sense of humour, better than Ed Wood, weirder than a David Lynch from the Twilight Zone. To put it shortly, something unique.IJC oozes charisma, something that is rare to find in an industry that bombards us with fifty new series every three months.

Only recently have I gained the courage to start playing horror video games, and watching horror anime. I stumbled upon Ito Junji: Collection by chance, and thought I'd give it a try. After watching the 12 episodes, I can't say I'm overly disappointed. That was probably the best train wreck I've ever watched.The Ito Junji: Collection comprises of 24 (?) short stories. I think most of them are suppose to be horror but a few of them had a lighter, comedic tone. I believe only 2 or 3 of...the short stories actually spooked me, and again, I am a scardey cat. However, one great thing about this anime is that its all short stories. When you start to get bored of one short story, you are only minutes away from the next one. There is some great variety here, but I would've preferred to be scared 70% of the time opposed to 15% of the time.The art in this anime, is mediocre at best. The animation is stiff, the art and characters could have definitely been more detailed. It was by far the worst part of this anime. Some characters aren't animated in some scenes as well. There are some still frames for many seconds, where a characters mouth should be moving, but isn't! Lazy, and an injustice to the creators original work.The sound isn't much better. I think the music in this anime is fine, but doesn't really contribute to make the stories any scarier. I watched the dub, and the voice acting wasn't anything to get excited over. Not terrible, just not anything worth mentioning. Thats basically all of the sound design in this anime. Horror needs to have good sound to help set a tense, atmosphere for the viewers. And that just wasn't the case for this one.Few characters stand out. I have a handful of favorites but the large majority left a lot to be desired. There was one character that ruined some of the stories for me. I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror, or a comedy when he was on screen. Other than him, nearly everyone else was mediocre. I wasn't expecting huge character development in 10ish minute short stories, but there were A LOT of generic characters. Most of them don't have unique character designs so everyone ends up looking the same. Few characters stand out, but the ones that do were a good change of pace from the rest of the cast.I know I've really dumped on this anime, but to be honest, I REALLY enjoyed it. While not the horror I was looking for, I wasn't bored very often. And while the animation quality was poor at times, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen, waiting for the next mystery, the next plot twist, the next scare.I recommend giving the first 2 or 3 episodes a try. If they don't do it for you, then I don't think you'll enjoy the rest of it.

While Ito Junji: Collection isn\'t great overall, I did appreciate the way in which it went about trying to portray it\'s horror. Rather than fear, this show will try to creep or unsettle you more than anything else. For whatever reason it reminds of the Goosebumps books I read when I was younger. Also Ito Junji: Collection has a tendency to sometimes be unintentionally(or maybe it\'s intentional) funny which definitely helped me enjoy the show more.As the anime\'s...title would suggest the story here consist of a collection of Ito Junji\'s work.

I say it was just an interesting experience to read the manga. My first impression of Junji ito's works is that they were the works of ghosts and demons that possessed or haunted people, but he proved to be more than that. Junji Ito messes with people's psyche rescuing phobias you didn't even know you had and transforms them into a real fear.Among the episodes, there were some stories that I liked more, others less, some caused me horrendous discomfort and others made me laugh.The design doesn't look...anything scary compared to the manga designs.

Minha primeira impressão das obras de Junji ito é de que seriam obras de fantasmas e demônios que possuíam ou assombrava as pessoas, mas ele se mostrou mais que isso. Junji Ito mexe com o psicológico das pessoas resgatando fobias que você nem sabia que tinha e transforma em um medo real.Dentre os episódios, teve uns contos que eu gostei mais, outros menos, uns me causaram um desconforto horrendo e outros me fizeram achar graça.O design não se parece nada assustador comparado aos desenhos do mangá.

This happened because the character Souichi is very peculiar, he is one of the few characters that you will see in more than one story.The thing about this anime is that the stories in each episode are very strange and absurd, so the suspense...works throughout the plot, but I wasn’t scared to death with the stories.The animation is a separate show, the characters' strokes are marked with thick black strokes, everything is always quite dark with always very dark colors, visually the anime works for the proposed terror.I recommend anime and don't worry if you are scared, anime is not all that.

I don’t see psychological or horror anime often nowadays so when they release one or two every season, I expect to see something at least decent. I thought it was okay to have my expectations high after seeing how amazing the art in the manga is. Yet, I was disappointed by what this anime has offered beyond what words could express.Story: Just as the title says, this is a collection. Meaning, it’s a number of stories collected together with most of them having no relation at all to the others. Every episode includes two...stories. I want to note that I had an initial idea of how this anime was from the beginning, but choose to wait before I give it a review in hope that things would improve with some sort of interesting story in the end. I mean, they might have kept the best dish for last. But, no, the stories didn’t improve. At least, not so significantly that it would improve my score at all.The stories were felt nothing as natural. This is the first anime that makes me feel it’s so forced. In most of the stories, from the way the characters speak, you’d be constantly thinking of how uninterested the voice actors were. I felt no immersion from the characters and they were very distant from the story as if they weren’t even from it.Art: I thought this was going to be the one thing I would like about this anime even if the rest is terrible. However, it didn’t work well as expected. Sure, the style of drawing is something I like. But, when it’s lumped in with poor, pardon, terrible animation you can’t expect me to like it. I don’t even know what they were thinking to release something with animation like this. Apparently, there was no effort exerted in turning the manga into an anime, so they relied heavily on the art style that the manga is infamous for as well as the stories they mistakenly thought would entertain the viewers.Sound: This is probably the only thing this anime has got going right and it’s not even that much. It’s just that the opening and ending themes were quite good and I didn’t feel like skipping them, but that’s all there is to it.

The same as for the more recent Netflix Maniac.Horror is quite a peculiar genre, requiring a lot more suspension of disbelief than others and is usually much more effective the more it leaves to the imagination. Which is why it tends to work much better in prose, or graphic novels, where your mind has to fill in a lot more between each sentence or panel with your own personal terrors. This is true for all the greatest horror writers like Poe, Lovecraft, or Stephen King,...with very rare exceptional adaptations actually doing justice to the original work. In the case of Lovecraft, i'm still waiting for a good one, despite all the attempts.When the suspension of disbelief is stretched too far, horror quickly turns into into its opposite - comedy. And the line between these two genres is surprisingly thin. Often fused to great effect in many movies - Peter Jackson's early filmography being a prime example in my mind.Junji Ito in particular doesn't really know how to end a story most of the time and he tends to lobotomize his characters of most of their common-sense... This is fine in manga format, where the ambience and pacing superbly make up for it. But on screen they just become exacerbated. I refuse to believe it's impossible to adapt and i rather think the story-boarding work for this anime was rather lazy - basically adding frames to Junji Ito's panels, beat by beat.This is the third peculiarity of horror adaptations: different media require different approaches and the more faithful you try to be to the written word the less effective you will generally be in a visual format. This becomes a huge problem where you are much more likely make a good horror movie, the more you stray from the original work (and the more you risk alienating fans) - a fact that is masterfully evident in The Shinning. But you wouldn't need to go to that far to make a better adaptation, had the story-telling not been absolutely flat and linear, had there been more creative applications of rhythm to the scenes, paired with better sound design, better animation, better camera work, better almost everything...... This could've easily been double the score. with very rare exceptional adaptations actually doing justice to the original work.

By far Junji\'s Ito main selling point is his incredibly detailed art. Previous adaptations of his work have always struggled because, either live action or anime, replicating them is pretty much impossible. The art for JIC is considerably less detailed, leaving incredibly disturbing characters looking just kinda wonky. The animation also isn\'t great. Well animation is going far, most of the show is still images that slightly move when...an action is necessary.The JIC sticks really close to the manga, so closely in fact that the directors forgot the conventions of horror for manga and anime are MILES APART. Ito\'s dramatic reveals are always after a page turn, letting the reader build up anticipation, who are then met with a full-page terrifying illustration. It has the effect of a moment frozen in time, like a car crash in slow motionThe show adapts these moments into a straight cut into a slowly panning stationary frame (that already doesn\'t look that scary because of the bad art. This format simply CANNOT WORK in animation, and a better director could have changed them for more animation-appropriate techniques, but JIC just decided to adapt them literally, without thinking if it would be scary----A gripe I\'ve not seen a lot of people talk about is how it can\'t even adapt the stories right. Ito\'s stories are often super simplistic, serving only as a vessel for the scares, so you\'d think it\'d be easy to adapt them, but the show somehow fucks it up. Most stories miss subtle details or whole scenes that make the stories much less statisfying than their original version. Let\'s take a look at ""Shiver"" SPOILERSThe reveal of Hideo\'s condition is pretty smartly set up in the manga. Yuuji searches for the jade and finds nothing, the reader thinks ""maybe it\'s not there anymore"". Rina is then shown fully healed, confirming something happened to the jade. Hideo is then shown wearing a trenchcoat (the person who gave Yuuji\'s granddad the jade also worn one to hide his condition), making the reader kinda suspicious. It is then revealed he indeed had the jade that\'s killing himTheanime spits in the face of the manga by placing Rina\'s healing after the reveal and simply omitting the other details. It instead just flats out show Hideo taking the jade... May I repeat: THEY CHANGED SUBTLE FORESHADOWING INTO JUST SHOWING THE REVEAL BEFORE IT HAPPENS.----If there\'s one positive, the sound design is pretty good. ""Used Record"" in particular is enhanced by being able to hear a music-centric story.----If you\'re a Ito fan, you\'re gonna get incredibly annoyed by how badly it adapted the manga.

I have...seen other animes that don't have the genre of horror yet it comes off as a horror anime, but this wasn't it for me. There was a slug scene that was disturbing and it was decent but other than that it was just boring. I can't remember the rest of the scenes since it wasn't that enjoyable to me.

All I can say is that the Junji Ito: Collection is extremely underwhelming. The stories presented portray Junji Ito stories to a satisfactory level but some stories don't make sense without other chapters related to that story. The animation too me is eerie and captures the art style of its source material. the soundtrack is easily the best part and seeing characters brought to animation is extremely satisfying.While each story is unique and creepy, I'm...not certain whether they were well presented in animation. As I haven't read those stories. However, the Tomie episode to me felt like it didn't contain enough. Tomie at first is presented as a woman who is very arrogant. You would never assume she could regenerate into other clones, to me this would appear extremely random for someone who hasn't read Tomie.The art style has this eerie aesthetic that creeps me out. The way the environment has been created makes me feel uncomfortable. What I found interesting is that in the earlier stories of Tomie, the art style isn't as detailed. which was prevalent in the anime where the earlier story of Tomie had the older art style. while the later stories had more complex and detailed animation. Although many movements to me felt unrealistic and janky.The soundtrack is creepy and unnerving and I would say is great within this horror anime. Despite this, some of the music is relatively underwhelming. Most anime soundtracks must consider the emotions of a scene, the world of the anime, and its genre. Which this anime effectively considers. Although, the best part about the music was the opening which I do listen to religiously.Characters are all unique and make each story presented memorable and unique. However, characters rarely make second appearances. If they even do make more appearances they are most likely monsters or antagonists. Tomie in the original story did have multiple stories but I find that each character was made memorable in their own distinct ways. I can remember certain characters by their experiences and attributes. Yet I can hardly remember any character that wasn't an antagonist.Junji Ito: Collection is obviously an underwhelming piece, trapped in the massive shadow of its source material.

That is why if you initially thought the stories were decent at first but, comes off as spookier in its original manga format or even retold as a campfire story. If you want to support Junji Ito I would suggest purchasing his manga instead of watching this poorly made adaptation. As another anime connoisseur once said, (""Junji Ito\'s manga has a unique black and white style to it in the physical manga that cannot have the same effect when you read it online or even...in animation.

Period. However, this show struggled with some elements that bogged down the final product.The biggest issue with this is its selection of stories. As with all writers Ito has some hits and some misses and this series adapts more misses than hits. It also adapts only parts of some stories, such as the Oshikiri stories, which are some of my favorite, but it would have been better to adapt the full Oshikiri stories. It also adapts two chapters from Tomie.The thing...that is going to bother people more than probably anything else about the show is the animation style. The animation is very static and there are lots of still images used in the animation. I personally think that this works well for animating Ito's works, but people who enjoy more dynamic animation may find this frustrating.All told, this show has both ups and downs. Here are a couple of the best stories it adapts: Glyceride (I've rewatched this a few times because it's so good), Long Dreams (Also incredible), The Girl At the Crossroads (Part of a longer story). that is going to bother people more than probably anything else about the show is the animation style. The animation is very static and there are lots of still images used in the animation.

Buzzer Beater,https://myanimelist.net/anime/406/Buzzer_Beater,"[""Buzzer Beater, a Basketball anime, I love basketball, never thought this anime would work, the first time I saw it, I shared that opinion, the second time too, but now I've watched it for the first time I really enjoyed it.So it's about Basketball, intergalactic basketball that is. Which is a pretty cool idea, if they used basketball like it would be in real life, it would've been just as good as now, but perhaps the intergalactic part brings the anime more out to the public, sin...ce it's something special.I really enjoyed the characters, the main character is like most shonen-kids, loud, irritating and cocky,...but since it's a regular thing, you probably won't mind it. The other characters are really cool too, they look normal, some even plain, but that's a cool think, I wished they would've worked them out more, but maybe that'll happen in the sequel(?) &quot;Buzzer Beater 2007&quot;. But how they want to create a human team to enter the intergalactic league is cool, since we got underrated too much by those stupid aliens.Oh, the aliens, that part could've been better too, it's an intergalactic match, but in the entire show, we get to see 2 races, Gorans and Humans. They should've expended that view on races more.The art is good, at first I got annoyed by it, because when they spoke or awed, their lips hung out, that's kinda annoying. But if you get further to the end that dissappears, or I just got used to it. The animation itself is from mediocre level, and in the field/matches/games it's entirely different, sometimes they use CG/3D art, for example the ball or if they shoot hoops. And sometimes they use this special form of camera work.The motion is smooth yet simple, and the envirment moves like crazy, which makes it look like a drunk is holding the camera, this was weird once I saw it, but sometimes it gives out a cool scene, the matches itself are sometimes simple, but exciting. The normal things you see in these kinds of anime's, the training and the result of training, can't be seen in this anime. The end of the last match was a bit too.. weird? It didn't fit the character that much, nor the anime itself.We can see the main character en the head point guard train in one episode, but there's no result left to be seen, not enough, but that could be that the opposing team was just to strong. Kind of disappointing, the length of this anime could've been increased too.It's just 13 episodes, and how the story goes now it's fine, I don't know if the viewingrate was good, but when it was, they should've lengthened it, maybe to the mediocre 26. Since now it still ended in the smaller league.Besides that it's actually a quite enjoyable anime, there are funny sequences, but also tense one's. For a basketbal-lover, it might be a bit disapointing, but it should be watched since it's pretty good. but since it's a regular thing, you probably won't mind it.

This creates a nice atmosphere but it seems overdone.Sometimes there are reused &quot;action sequences&quot; where a 1v1 follows practicalyl the same pattern with perhaps a change in character.There are frustrating skips in every match, where you go from a third way through the match and suddenly *CUT!* and it's all over with a nice shiny score of 100 - 40 suddenly popping out of nowhere.(abit of an exaggeration)Basically there are only a few (about 3 in total) mediocre, animated basketball games with perhaps a special &quot;shonen&quot; scene of amazing styalised &quot;epicness&quot; occuring such as: growing magical angel wings!(not really a spoiler)Character - 5/10All the characters apart from Hideyoshi are underdeveloped at best, which really makes it almost a one-man show with some help from the cool looking guys with fancy hairstyles and dress-sense (everyone else on his team). It's a shame though cause they all had alot of potential.Art and Sound - 6/10Reasonable art. The main few characters look alright, but the minor characters and the backgrounds are nothing inspiring. The art does suit the anime, yet the sci-fi aspects are especially pathetic.In the sound department we dont it's all acceptable stuff, the OP, ED and soundtrack are pleasant enough. I do wish Hideyoshi's voice wasn't quit so girly, it was rather painful at times.Enjoyment - 3.5/104 being decent and 3 being poor, 3.5 reflects a feeling of something not worth the time. It isn't very enjoyable and isn't special unless you've yet to have seen basketball before.Not as enjoyable as I had expected, especially so after watching Slam Dunk (which may be the cause of my biasedness).Overall - 5/10It's a shame but there's just not enough to this anime. It has a rushed feeling. Too few episodes for what should have been some nice, spaced out matches. In hindsight it may be because the creators didn't feel there was anything &quot;important&quot; that needed to be shown, but it makes the experience feel cheap.Buzzer Beater gives off the feeling of an anime targeted at kids who in a cheap attempt at combining sci-fi and basketball together to grab some attention.For a serious or mature anime watcher, Buzzer Beater in my opinion should be a miss.If you want depth, storyline or just some good sports entertainment, watch the far better, though older alternative of Slam Dunk.

Though unlike slam dunk and dear boys which leaves a huge impact on the audience, it is somehow entertaining. i read some reviews about this anime and saying that it suck is totally unfair. It is not as exciting as those i have mentioned earlier but it's entertaining or maybe i'm just a huge fan of basketball. hehe  i'm not a fan of its art but it has some attratctive guys or gorans there.The story obviously revolves around a blue-haired kid (hideyoshi) with extraordinary talent he always bad mouth his opponents saying he'll win and he makes sure...he does. but knowing the nature of the game, nobody wins it straight. in a world where aliens(gorans) dominate the court, the humans are underestimated saying they can never enter the major league and so this old man decided to form a team of earthlings with one goal that is to make it to that impossible league. our protagonist entered this team gathered by the old man and so their struggle began. challenges were inevitable and one pops out after another and hideyoshi's feeling ill during the most important games. i guess i'll leave it up there. i dont wana give any spoiler.this could have been a better anime though the idea of a basketball battle between humans and aliens was a little unusual, but if they had made it longer maybe this anime could be more enjoyable. it only has 13 episodes each season, what could you possibly show in that little amount of time right?  in summary, it's like slam dunk and yu yu hakusho combined.well, that wraps it up for me, it's just fair enough anime. he does. but knowing the nature of the game, nobody wins it straight. in a world where aliens(gorans) dominate the court, the humans are underestimated saying they can never enter the major league and so this old man decided to form a team of earthlings with one goal that is to make it to that impossible league. our protagonist entered this team gathered by the old man and so their struggle began. challenges were inevitable and one pops out after another and hideyoshi's feeling ill during the most important games. i guess i'll leave it up there. i dont wana give any spoiler.this could have been a better anime though the idea of a basketball battle between humans and aliens was a little unusual, but if they had made it longer maybe this anime could be more enjoyable. it only has 13 episodes each season, what could you possibly show in that little amount of time right?  in summary, it's like slam dunk and yu yu hakusho combined.well, that wraps it up for me, it's just fair enough anime."", 'Note: this is from a video review, look for links on my profile page.It is, nominally, about a game, but as is regular in the genre it turns out to be about the characters, although mainly focusing on a few. Like its similar predecessor, SD, BB is comedic and has a personality-driven protagonist that, despite the differences in height and blue, instead of red hair, can get into mischief. The comedy springs from there principally, but both have differing approaches to their relationships with other characters (SD has more of an attempt at romance); both, clearly, have a dissimilar number of episodes, and so can...express each personality for a longer or shorter time, but BB could have included more of them (besides the central cast), although in the end it is still sort of a microcosm of the author\'s previous manga.It doesn\'t exclusively focus on the sport, but it is in the background and integrates along with its other narrative details. It tackles a concept that not many other \'casual\' anime in this genre can address, ""what if whole teams were much taller, stronger?"" - since, like in SD, they\'re set not in a hypothetical near future, but likely in schools where everyone has basically the same strengths and weaknesses, with only a little variability (and even then, with usually at least the same amount of tall people in each team) - but not BB, it isn\'t even set in any kind of school (which already makes it different from most others in the genre), and instead wonders whether those with talent potential, no matter their background circumstances, could succeed in a competitive environment. Of course, this isn\'t any scientific evaluation, and the protagonist specifically clowns about, often with his street friends (who are more alike in height and personality, as opposed to the differences in Sakuragi\'s group), which makes this a fundamentally comedic narrative, but it does have its serious moments even for Hideyoshi. The comedy can focus more on height here, whereas in SD it wasn\'t as possible since the protagonist wasn\'t as short.The science fiction elements are also an obvious difference in comparison, and while the most immediate effect this has is on, as mentioned previously, the opponents the protagonist\'s team play against (who, despite being from another planet, are shown to be relatable and not at all dissimilar to Earth\'s team) - the sci-fi is also very much in the background, with flying cars and apparent differences in technology shown in between discussions and games.Also, what is apparent from watching is that decisions were made to contrast the hues in the anime; protagonist\'s blue, so his opponent\'s red, but that doesn\'t stop there at all  as even environments are usually one or another, kind of like how in Tatami Galaxy one hue is more likely to envelop most others, except in BB they\'re more \'solid\', more bright (as even street lights are), and this presumably was made so life could be felt emanating from, mainly Hideyoshi, but also societies at large.So, this anime tries to differentiate itself as much as possible, especially from its predecessor, and it succeeds to be sufficiently different (just not as long). One doesn\'t then quite understand why, on average, it seems to be perceived as inferior, by not even a margin, as it is fundamentally similar, actually. In addition to the comedy it adds imaginative, sci-fi elements, with architecture pronounced to an extent that it needs to be highlighted - SD doesn\'t have such, mainly due to its mundane settings, and so the geometry can\'t be seen as unique in as much as it is similar to most other, usually slice-of-life anime out there, whereas in BB it adds a background to what is, still, a familiar narrative.It is grounded in any reality potentially common to many, with aspirations possibly matching too, as is SD, but it looks upwards and asks what and how something as mundane as a team game can be combined with a concept as grand as the universe. While it does not explore everything that may be as most other sci-fi do (e.g. Kaiba, about memories, but then again how tall players are is more relevant than their memories in a game), it is still very much solidified as a background in its multitudes - architectural sci-fi, if such a genre were to exist.It is a story about change, growth, substance. Even the wealthy owner of the team is shown as seeking something other than what is material, and while the protagonist\'s comedy doesn\'t always coincide with the owner\'s desires, it still works well to cover any ground between the serious and the ridiculous. It isn\'t quite a complete story, but then neither was SD, although it was still appreciated for its comedy mainly - viewers might have bonded with the characters more due to being four times as long, but then, if one was to evaluate the comedy on its own both can be enjoyed in their own way.The male protagonist has a comedic relationship with their female counterpart, as in SD - although both approach the dynamics from a different point of view, as with the latter it is more romantic, whereas in BB a sibling rivalry is more the feeling (notice the red-blue differences, such contrasts not present in SD). What this anime combines well is differences - whether the story is situated in this world or in another in outer space, it can be quite seamless, but still obvious as the hues are, almost always, clearly distinct. The very fact that it attempts to deal with a mundane sport, only for it to be exported to a hypothetical future where intergalactic games are possible, is, at the very least, an interesting intertwining. Even the protagonist\'s name comes from Japanese history (a daimyō from nearly a century before Yoshimune, a shōgun, also the owner\'s name in BB), thus merging the past with the present and future. Hideyoshi was historically known as a ""great unifier"", so Inoue Takehiko, the author, is possibly making the protagonist in the anime a similar figure when it comes to winning or losing games.Sometimes the anime even tries to make viewers think it\'s some detective story (mainly instigated by journalists) or even a neo-noir, especially in the latter half, and so appropriately it utilizes jazz to instill vitality where otherwise there is either comedy or competition.This is a city most would recognize even today, with existent buildings, but then suddenly it\'s outer space and the travel is much easier and as omnipresent as the flying cars that also silently create a technological norm within the anime. What makes it different from sci-fi like Kaiba is that the entire world isn\'t unrecognizable, the geometry isn\'t so unique that even the art style is idiosyncratic (although every anime\'s art is different, it shares with SD certain comedic indicators e.g.) - it is a world that could easily be reality animated, but then it goes further and asks ""what if?""It is a journey of maturation, not unlike most other narratives, but yet it is done in a certain optimistic, zesty sense of mockery that Sakuragi, in his \'genius\', would surely appreciate. It is a tale of hope, possibilities, and the many impressions light can have. It is a visual feast, and while not perfect or complex, it is surely about as enjoyable as its older \'sibling\' anime. Just as this is a shade of blue, the red contrasting \'beetle\' is just as hilarious.

The 11th episode poorly explains Aion's need to decapitate the Pandemonium's head. Aion is the personification of the 7 Deadly Sins (6th special) and those sins are capable of influencing and controling people's lives. The Pandominum's head holds the wisdom and violence that Aion needs in order to increase the influence and power he has over people.

100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41380/100-man_no_Inochi_no_Ue_ni_Ore_wa_Tatteiru,"[""There is an interest for me when it comes to this anime, and an interest could be there for you too! Let me explain.As the story goes, it's not a normal kind of Isekai, something different that makes the story interesting. Classes aren't the usual either, or least for our main MC that is. Which honestly is a nice touch from the anime. Given that we've seen countless times of magic users, or sword users. So to see something else, is a welcome treat. But there is so much more to the story that hasn't been touched upon, like why is this all even happening,...or least are we sure we can trust what is going on? Stuff like that is good for a show like this.The characters may seem like your typical kinds of characters. But I cannot really say a bad thing about them. Each of them seems realistic, and the kind of normal person you'd see in real life, when it comes to who they are. As if they each have a set personality trait, and it's very welcoming, and makes it easier for you to get to know the characters. By adding issues to said characters, to make them seem not over powered in early stages, which will be good for progressing the story.The art is very nice, much like the sound is. It really fits in well with the themes of the show, no matter what scene.Should you give this anime a try? I'd say go for it, it might not blow you away, but it's looking fairly decent so far. With my interest still strong after the first few episodes. or least are we sure we can trust what is going on?

With my interest still strong after the first few episodes."", 'To be honest, I really want to commend this show for doing something different in the oversaturated space of the overly generic Isekai medium, but as it stands, it fell short of expectations when things were only starting to get better. But then again, it\'s one of those ""go read the source material"" shitty settings that I\'m honestly very tired of and lament in the usual practice of marketing, but in this case, it\'s for a VERY GOOD reason. Why and how is that so? Let\'s take it from the top.As far as Isekai standards go, 100-man does showcase the usual tropes and clichés, but...further down the road, it becomes something that takes the same concept and flips it around on its own shell, making for a boring world somewhat unique on its own. It starts off as the stereotypical Isekai type of show that goes on and on with a large class of few characters that are nothing special to rave about, even with their ""wheel of luck"" skills chosen by the GM (whoever he, or ""it"" is) that tells them: ""Whatever skills and techniques that are given to you, please utilize them to your advantage, no matter how strong or weak your class will be. Any quests that follow, please complete them like you would in a bog-standard RPG. Questions-wise, the quest finisher may ask me only 1 question and I would answer your assumptions.""Pretty conventional and shallow stuff (except the ""class setting"" anyways), but the world-building gradates at a snail\'s pace to the point of excruciating-ness (due to the many fillers that was placed in the anime for time-padding, that took off valuable screentime for the adaptation, sad but I kinda understand after finishing the anime). I know this because all of this is not what it seems deep down the rabbit hole in the manga, but to be clear, all of what the anime has showcased, ALL OF IT, IS JUST A PROLOGUE. Ever thought what will it be like if the Isekai world is in parallel with the real world? We\'re only just getting started! And yeap, there\'s a Season 2 coming soon in the Summer season next year to expand this story.What\'s unassuming at first is the cast of characters, with the misanthrope of an MC and diverse personalities of the girls (because harem, yes, but not in the way you\'d expect):Yotsuya Yuusuke is your typical braggart kind of character, the lonesome loner and a vehement hater of humanity. All he desires for is a world that twists logic and explanation that favours his way of thinking, and be the protagonist of his own ""idealistic heroism"" villain hero tactics, while at the cusp of people far more popular than him. Case in point:Shindou Iu, a multi-faceted girl that\'s the ""school idol"" for everything, from studies to athletics. Beyond all that however, she\'s the opposite of Yotsuya in ""another world"", and that she\'s a confident but nervous wreck that needs assistance, because of societal implications that could affect her popularity in the real world of trying to ask Yotsuya, would brand her as a normie. Yeap, very stereotypical.Kusue Hakozaki, think of her like Bofuri\'s Maple, but average in every way. Like Shindou, she is someone that relies on people to get things moving while acting as normal as they could be. Oh, did I not mention that these 3 are classmates who can get Isekai-ed back and forth to their original and ""another"" worlds? Well, that\'s a first (and a very important plot device later in the story).Yuka Tokitake, she\'s the messiest of the group. A girl who\'s constantly being bullied (until Yotsuya saved her), and an otaku, not to mention their version of PreCure\'s. If anything, she is one obnoxious girl that many of us will feel like she has no place in this story plot, but I\'d guess feeding her ideals DID at least move the story forward in a crucial episode of the \'heroes\' group\'s lives.Kahabell (or Kahvel as the anime applies), a fierce ""knight in shining armor"" of a girl fighting for her justice. And oh look, another NPC girl to ""fall in love"" from! Like seriously, can\'t this show relax its ""romance"" aspect one too often? Luckily, Yotsuya is anything but a typical MC, sincerely rejecting her appeals and going in for the cause instead of just pandering around (like so many MCs do).An interesting team of characters, and while I would say that none of them really stand out on their own, you could easily guess that their selling point is indeed, their individualistic ""realisms"" and how every step of the way expands on the story and world-building. Though small efforts, but big ones as the story setting and plot progresses from form to function, pacing the main cast together with every struggle along the way, and for good measure. On a side note, never mind my sadness, because where the anime lacked, the manga made it up by a ton.And the animation, oh golly god. For a small and inexperienced new studio like Maho Film to work on 2 simultaneous adaptations in the same season (this ""action-heavy"" one and Kami-tachi, the slime ""Iyashikei"" SoL one), that\'s really stretching their miniscule ""number of (40) employees"" to the limit (to which I\'d put a pun to say: Limited Budget Works). Remember, their very first animation work of Uchi no Musume (the ""For my daughter, defeat Demon Lord"" show because I\'m too lazy for super-long LN titles), that was released to moderate fanfare in Summer last year, it was just okay and really nothing special. So to work on 2 shows within the span of a year, that\'s quite the crunch I would expect the anime industry to imitate suit from. All I can say for 100-man, is that if you\'re expecting some decent action, don\'t hold hopes for this one as it\'ll only feed you just enough at the very bare minimum to keep things going. Interestingly enough, the cartoonish art style at Episode 1 is also not just for show, it\'s just an extra in aesthetics, so props to experimentation?The music however, may just be the star of the show itself. More than the standard OST that was given of songs that fit the series well, another experimentation of that one episode of the annoying otaku Yuka\'s dreams, they actually made an opening sequence just for cringe-fest and laughs, but it\'s real (it\'s even on YouTube so you can check that out if you\'re so inclined). Honestly, the OP/ED range from decent to fairly good, and that\'s as much about it that I can say in the music department.If I have to recommend which is the better one, after some ranting in-between (of which whether you caught or not), you don\'t need me to infer that the manga is the way to go if you want to experience 100-man at its best. As much as the anime adaptation did somewhat a loose job at recreating the ""series of unfortunate events"" of heroes with good intentions gone wrong, I can tell you to binge the first few chapters, and the estimated reading time will be faster or on par with a single episode\'s runtime (compared to how the anime took 3 months just to reach to the plot twist).Good try Maho Film, but this is a disappointment, and the 1st fail out of 2 concurrently airing shows. Go read the manga instead if you feel so inclined to know what\'s beyond the surface for now, and wait upon Season 2 coming soon in July. further down the road, it becomes something that takes the same concept and flips it around on its own shell, making for a boring world somewhat unique on its own.

Here coms the perverted gamemaster and forces him to play with others in a game were there life is on the line (heard this a thousand time).The first ep starts somewhat good but nothing really interesting happens through out the whole anime. The only good ep is the last in my opinion but from what I saw about the second...season its not that exiting. If you want to watch it just because you like the iskia genre go for it, but don't get expect anything good season its not that exiting.

While everything seems borderline cliche, the content that is given stems different from the generic shit you see most of the time.Story: The story is a bit of a mystery, what is this game-like world, what are the quest for each round, why does the time skip for each round, why there may be many questions I can't help but believe they are skipping over something important here. Hopefully in future episodes we will see their actual importance in this world.Animation/Art: From the character designer of trinity seven to what...appears on the cover a generic isekai, the designs are alright and fine. The animation on the other hand is mediocre, still frames and visual novel scenes, I can understand this fairly well since this is a new studio, but I have to say the VN format is a smart move. The budget saved from those scenes play in favor of the action, in episode 4 we got to see a bit of goodness at the end. Animation is definitely not the best, but the studio knows how to save it's budget for things.Sound: The opening of this show, has a nice melody that I can safely say fits the show. The ending of this show is also great and has the best visuals overall. Not much else to say.Enjoyment:Well there may be slideshow animation for certain scenes, and the plot and story being pretty average for now. I believe it has it's positive points with the comedy and a nice twist on the MC's character. For future episodes, WARNING: SPOILERS: the main cast becomes more dependable on themselves, and they won't be relying on the MC all the time.

So, obviously I didn't have much of a different expectation of the isekai that were coming out this fall. Well, 100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru(100man for short) is different.There isn't any significance mentioning the plot since it is almost the same as other isekai other than that they can return to earth. The main appeal of this show is...that the protagonist isn't a wussy soft hearted baby. Instead, this guy thinks of this world as a game and doesn't care two shits if they get killed or kidnapped or whatever. I am glad to see an anime of this type cause I was bored of all those simple and pure dudes getting isekaied. And it doesn't seem like he had a weird trauma or such, but rather it's his nature to be edgy and uncaring. At one point, he did something genuinely nice and then the next day, he's back to being edgy. All the other characters seem to be traumatized or bullied.

Actually comprehend what the Mc just said.WHAT THE FUCK...AMAZING ANIME 10/10!!!!JUst Cause of that ending i swearI highly recommend if you you're patient, you overthink things too much and you like being mindfucked AMAZING ANIME 10/10!!!!JUst Cause of that ending i swearI highly recommend if you you're patient, you overthink things too much and you like being mindfucked"", 'When I read the title of this anime, I imagine that the show would be the complete opposite of what was presented to me. 100-man chose me to be an anime that would have content involving fantasy and isekai, but that perhaps would create some element focused on battle royale. Why did I find that? Well, when you look at an opening in which a badass man becomes the only one alive in a pile of dead, it is evident that something happens by gigantic. But the show is deceiving, it does not develop a war, nor does it leave the comfort zone of the...generic isekais that we see every season. Incidentally, 100-man is the bad isekai this time.Basically, 100-man tells a normal story, without much news, but that creates a concept that I admit I liked. When it comes to isekai, we imagine a complex of several times, after all, who is transported to a different world, has to race against time to survive daily. The anime reversed that, using an idea of \u200b\u200brespawn after death. Games like this are common, with League of Legends being one of the most popular worldwide. The show brought a deep idea, but developed in a peturbating way, since the very beginning of the series has holes in its use. This problem would be to revive in a condition in which it would not normally survive. This leads us to believe that certain types of death, such as beheading, being swallowed by a monster or being drowned are ways in which the character would be in an infinite loop of death and resurrection. But the very idea is broken at first, when Kusue is killed with a cut in half and manages to return to life normally, without any explanation. But it\'s not just that, Kusue doesn\'t recover his arm, which there is no explanation in my opinion. It was an abysmal mistake of a very poorly executed proposal. And it gets worse, when Yu is swallowed by a monster and does not last a little time inside it. Again, it was cut in half. It would be acceptable to put this problem aside if it doesn\'t happen again. And in fact, this failure was diminished and began to make sense as the episodes progressed.However, the anime has not seen any signs of improvement since the beginning. It was a show of ""doing missions"" and ""a pseudo-strategy"" involving the death of the characters, where what would happen once or twice in each episode is actually repeated several times until it gets sick. And more than that, it is uninteresting and bad to see such ridiculous dramas about it. First, there is Yu, a girl who suffered from losing a dear friend, then there is Kusue, who has an exaggerated inferiority complex, because she finds herself a hindrance in relation to others. And there is Yuka, who was bullied, but who internally disputes the possible idea that she deserved it. These banal dramas keep hammering the audience\'s head every second of the characters\' calm. It is no longer enough to see a show of ridiculous missions, we have to listen and endure conversations about how to improve your personality, for the good of all. I agree that this is necessary, after all, every serious anime should develop the psychological and as actions of the characters in order to consider a personal and social improvement. But 100-man not only makes all this ridiculous, but he didn\'t know how to create a decent story for each one. That is, they missed the easiest thing ever.Oh, and I couldn\'t forget about our protagonist. Is he a little better than that? NOT! He\'s also awful. Yotsuya is his name. He is more of an MC who tries to solve everything himself and who forgets his friends when he thinks he can deal with some giant creature. He is anti-climatic and has no charisma. He is a character that puts other protagonists at an inferior level, which made me hate him. And all this is added to the common idea of \u200b\u200busing an MC who despairs of having a girlfriend and who is always getting in trouble with any of the female characters. In fact, as their struggles are as ridiculous as possible. Remember Hachi-nan tte? So, the way the studio decided to ""show"" the fights is exactly the same. An absurdly uncomfortable amount of static frames and no flexibility in character movements around it all. It is as if we are seeing a lot of screams, where the next scene is a cheap and cringe resolution of a fight that we did not see, precisely for that nutty direction.The only thing I would save on this show is the interactions between the characters. As strange as it may seem, the anime manages to maintain some advantage in this, by creating in the second part an interesting productivity of the actions and a team interaction that can favor the anime for its future (in fact, a second season has already been confirmed). The character with half a head is also not all bad. He really emits some humor in his incomplete dialogues and manages to keep the cringe amused, however ridiculous and painful it is to watch it. I even confess that I didn\'t drop this anime just because of it. I really wanted to see him scare everyone and disappear mysteriously, like a ghost. Well, he is just a moderator who inserted the characters in this world, but we don\'t know what his intention is (that is, if the author really thought of the answer to that question).Another interesting thing is the CG. I really liked your visual output, although it is still below average. But he is not as bad as Arifureta or Gibiate, two of the worst animes in terms of visual production. 100-man was competent for the small amount of money he had and made an anime that, although weak and with a visual widely repeated in the isekais, managed to bring a good execution. It is worth saying that it is not the merit of the studio, nor of the designers, after all, this does not mean that anime is good or something, just that it is a positive aspect in the midst of an enormous amount of problems.Ultimately, 100-man has more things to fix than to maintain. It is not an anime remembered this year, nor does it deserve any merit other than a brief competence and proposal. It was a show that poorly executed an idea that seems to be excellent. I wish I had seen more of it this year, even though it was an anime cringe and hard to watch. It\'s an anime that I still see a potential, because it brings things that I like in isekais. It is a pity to see that he is nothing but cheap entertainment material, but it was fun to follow his funniest moments and his ridiculous missions. generic isekais that we see every season.

It is as if we are seeing a lot of screams, where the next scene is a cheap and cringe resolution of a fight that we did not see, precisely for that nutty direction.The only thing I would save on this show is the interactions between the characters. As strange as it may seem, the anime manages to maintain some advantage in this, by creating in the second part an interesting productivity of the actions and a team interaction that can favor the anime for its future (in fact, a second season has already been confirmed). The character with half a head is also not all bad. He really emits some humor in his incomplete dialogues and manages to keep the cringe amused, however ridiculous and painful it is to watch it. I even confess that I didn\'t drop this anime just because of it. I really wanted to see him scare everyone and disappear mysteriously, like a ghost. Well, he is just a moderator who inserted the characters in this world, but we don\'t know what his intention is (that is, if the author really thought of the answer to that question).Another interesting thing is the CG. I really liked your visual output, although it is still below average. But he is not as bad as Arifureta or Gibiate, two of the worst animes in terms of visual production. 100-man was competent for the small amount of money he had and made an anime that, although weak and with a visual widely repeated in the isekais, managed to bring a good execution. It is worth saying that it is not the merit of the studio, nor of the designers, after all, this does not mean that anime is good or something, just that it is a positive aspect in the midst of an enormous amount of problems.Ultimately, 100-man has more things to fix than to maintain. It is not an anime remembered this year, nor does it deserve any merit other than a brief competence and proposal. It was a show that poorly executed an idea that seems to be excellent. I wish I had seen more of it this year, even though it was an anime cringe and hard to watch. It\'s an anime that I still see a potential, because it brings things that I like in isekais. It is a pity to see that he is nothing but cheap entertainment material, but it was fun to follow his funniest moments and his ridiculous missions.', ""It is common for an anime full of potential to be adapted without a decent investment, and the example of this season is 100-man in Inochi.Story(7): it's simple but interesting, it revolves around the premise described in the synopsis, but it is visible that it has some extra complexity that probably will not be fully explored this season.

It had such a unique concept and a unique promise. But the way the show executes it is just horrible.From how they introduce each character and how the world plays out is just to generic. From when they first start there journey to how they end there journey just doesn\'t add up. The way things are going from one thing to another is pretty rushed and had plenty of Bullshit plot armour.it feels like when you made a apple juice but decided to add broccoli and whip cream on top of it,...which makes it disgusting and doesn\'t make sense. this show had so many potential but none of it came through. it\'s not everyday you can see a edgy MC with a class farmer as a hero which made the show unique as i was saying.But there is soo many probability on how they could execute the anime better from the battle scene to the ""sudden plot twist"" and unexpected event that was happening could be better if they re-adjust it. which makes it disgusting and doesn\'t make sense. this show had so many potential but none of it came through. it\'s not everyday you can see a edgy MC with a class farmer as a hero which made the show unique as i was saying.But there is soo many probability on how they could execute the anime better from the battle scene to the ""sudden plot twist"" and unexpected event that was happening could be better if they re-adjust it.', ""Let's get started:Pros:•The humour can be enjoyable sometimes• The female Knight Shabell is hands down best girl.Cons:•There are three female main character and all 3 of them are more useless then Sakura.

I have mixed feelings on this.Story: 6/10In terms of unique story, this is not it. An Isekai anime with very unoriginal and overused ideas for the most part. However, the ending, to me, was amazing! Totally steered from my original expectations, and raised the score a lot. I really really like the realisation from Yotsuya about his actions and the consequences. Really developed his character a lot. I am excited for season 2 due to this ending alone!!Art: 7/10The art style was pretty, though the animation was cheap. The scenery, however, was beautiful!...I loved looking at it and there was never a dull scene.Sound: 9/10Aah!! The opening and ending songs for this anime were phenomenal! Beautiful songs that I would love to hear again. Voice acting was also exceptional, no part was dry or out of place.Character: 7/10To me, the only interesting character is Yotsuya. He has very twisted ideas and I like them a lot, reminds me a lot of Sora from No Game No Life.

At this point we expect 1-2 each season, and if you aren\'t expecting that, you\'re a beautiful untainted flower. What we have here is pretty simple, a game-based Isekai, where you slowly gather members one by one, and build a party. Problem is every person is some broken member of society so they all have their own social-anxiety/personality disorders. There are plenty of unique twists that have kept me interested so far, but without spoiling, I figure we just get to the grading and you can decide if you want to give it a shot/continue watching.Story: 7/10It\'s an...Isekai, so I\'ll judge it based on that. We all know how most Isekai work, transport to another world/reincarnate/fantasy something something magic and swords. This one is no different, however there are some unique twists. For one, it involves some form of time-travel/time related elements. Another being that the way the system works is similar to something like Log Horzion, with a bit of death game tossed in. So far the story and plot look like they\'re going to be linear, and follow a straight line with maybe a few curve balls thrown here and there. However I\'ll hold out hope because of how the characters are, and the way they structured things like the Game Master, the world, the quest, the real world, and so on.Art: 6/10I\'m going to just say this, it\'s nothing spectacular, it feels very formal and uniformed to the rest of Isekai anime, if not maybe it falls below ones like Re:Zero. Some of the art is nice, and the animations are easy to watch and fun, but at the end of the day, there was no way the animation is what kept me watching.Sound: 6/10It\'s fair because, for starters I\'m a harsh when it comes to this category because sound helps emphasize everything. It can set the stage, the mood, hype you up, make you excited, sad, or elicit a multitude of emotions. This... Just barely passed the bar for ""I like it."" I can\'t recall any moments where I picked out the track, or really listened to the opening. For stuff like that I\'d turn to Jujutsu Kaisen.Character: 6/10Man, what a flipping trope-fest we have here. My very first thoughts were ""Oh cool, Edgier Kirito."" And I wasn\'t wrong. Every single character has an overused trope-tag stamped onto their heads, the Chuuni, the Shy, the Damaged, the Edgy/Loner, you get the drift. I\'m willing to bet that this will continue to pop up, and at some point we\'re either going to be hit with the Ditzy, Super cool, or Tsundere. That being said I\'ve been too negative lately, so here\'s some good points if you stuck around this long:Our MC doesn\'t fall that heavily into tropes, he\'s not being edgy to be edgy, he\'s just oblivious of how bad of a person he is. At first you think he\'s aware of it, then he hits you with this scene where you\'re wholly convinced he\'s not a bad person just misguided, and you kind of like him... Then he immediately erases that moment and goes back to being... Himself, lord Edgelord III.  At this point he can go either way, good or bad, and I think it may be worth watching to see that.Our supporting cast aren\'t a total train wreck either, I haven\'t mentioned this, but my favorite character is the true comic relief, the Game Master. He changes his voice, tone, and speech pattern each time, and does NOT know how to speak proper Japanese, for those reading subs, no that is NOT a typo on Sub.Enjoyment: 6/10I\'m still on the fence, I didn\'t come out feeling strong, but I some how stuck around this far and will continue to see how far into it I go. Watch at your own discretion but remember, it takes a butt load of tropes, and tries to spin things on its own way. At least unlike other Isekai it\'s making an attempt. And when you try something new-ish, and do things your way, you either fail, or succeed.Overall: 6/10If you read this far, you should get what I\'m trying to say. This one unlike many of my other reviews is a coin flip at this stage. You very well may not enjoy it because the characters are insufferable to you, the story is overdrawn and overused and you\'re sick of it, or some other reason. Maybe you\'ll like it cause you\'re an Isekai trash lover and you gobble this stuff down like Gigguk who will slave over a stove of anime-waifu to give us the best content he can.

Once again we get a isekai story, and maybe a lot of people are bored with it and immediately give a story like this bad marks. But, putting aside the slightly random story and animation work that I think is lacking (stiff graphics, etc.), this anime is still worth enjoying.I don't know how the story revolves at the source (manga) and just watching the anime leaves me still shrouded in mystery about the story in this anime. But that's not a bad thing, the more curious the audience, the more they...want to know what happening next. However, indeed, there are many repetitions of the past of the characters that I think are going to be made a mystery, but instead seem unclear about the purpose of expressing them.Regarding the story of the isekai, in my opinion the story of 100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru is quite good. The thing that underlies my opinion is because of the unique story. Yes, only that. Unlike other isekai stories, 100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru has many uniqueness that other isekai stories don't have. Apart from maintaining a balance between the two worlds, this story also has a new beginning and purpose.In essence, if you are not bothered by how the studio is working on this anime, and also the ending part of each episode that I don't understand for what it is, this anime is worth watching. want to know what happening next.

Rounds three and four which our main character is introduced, are also well thought out regarding what the game master is asking for, and I really can\'t find any fault in those two rounds. In fact, I\'d argue those two rounds and how they work out are definitely what draws the audience inThere is also an attempt to utilize unique character types...within this series, but this is also where the series starts falling apart. Effectively, one can summarize the issue as the creator of this series decided what character archetype they wanted to work with, only not to work out the small details. These small details, in turn, are important to the narrative. That\'s, of course, the short story, with the longest being that some might pick up on a bit of an ableist attitude towards individuals who are socially inept, with the narrative effectively putting forth this idea that those with social issues can be fixed if they simply find some way to contribute to society ignoring the fact it is possible for someone who is socially inept at contributing to society while still remaining socially inept.This particular issue shows the most in the main character, who the creator of the series attempts to present in a negative light from the very start, treating him and his social ineptitude as some sign of being a psychopath rather than simply being a pragmatic person regarding the way the world works. His hatred for the world ends up feeling like an extreme, something left completely unexplained, almost as if the person who created the series didn\'t actually understand those with social issues and instead looked at them through a biased lens of how they felt they could confirm. Of course, here is where I do admit that something may have gotten lost in the translation of the series in the adaption process and that the fault may not lie with the actual original creator but those taking their characters to the Manga.The issue with not thinking through the details when it comes to the character types shows up the second most in the second character to be dragged into the quest in that we\'re informed she has an illness, which effectively is her entire conflict in the series with its own set of complications because the small details weren\'t thought out as well as they should. But effectively, with this character, we have a character with a mysterious illness that leaves her physically weak in the real world. What is the illness? Well, we never find out beyond the fact it is hereditary. This can be brushed off as something writers do a lot in stories they create because it\'s just easier not to have an illness that is named, and readers can go, ""That\'s not accurate,"" but in this particular case, it informs her entire identity. Her worldview, like the main protagonist, is treated as wrong and in need of being fixed despite her reason for having the social issues she does is justified by her health issues.Or perhaps it\'s not so much her worldview that is being challenged here. Still, the idea that someone with extreme health issues isn\'t justified for having the social issues they do because of their illness, and by that merit alone, the fact they have social issues is enough to deem them not to be a proper contributor to a functioning society simply which is its own can of worms and much more problematic than simply questioning this characters world view.Speaking of questioning world views, the first character with social issues who can be described as socially functioning effectively has coping mechanisms that help her function, treated as if it is garbage because there is nothing wrong with depending on friends and no indicator at all that she\'d ever been too co-dependent. This, in turn, begs to question what her purpose within this series is because, as another character states, she is effectively perfect only for the narrative to find ways to try and make her come across as flawed, which is problematic because the flaws end up being flaws within the game mechanics, not with the character.As for the fourth character, she is more fleshed out than the others. In her particular case, her social issues aren\'t a problem with self but instead an issue with society, in particular a school system that allows such social issues to occur within their system. The first problem arises when - well, she\'s effectively a character we\'ve seen before, the bullied character. Still, in this particular scenario, the whole bullying thing is downplayed, although how I won\'t go into it to avoid spoilers. She\'s also a character we\'ve seen before who fulfills the role of the perverted geek, which seems more there because of the obligatory perverted geek than as a real narrative point, although it does try.From here, some of this won\'t be a problem with viewers, but for others, it can be. For me, it definitely left me questioning if the person who created this is someone who actually understands people who have social issues or if they\'re working with certain talking points regarding certain beliefs regarding those with social issues. The latter is honestly problematic and something to be wary of going into the sequel series. within this series, but this is also where the series starts falling apart.

Still, in this particular scenario, the whole bullying thing is downplayed, although how I won\'t go into it to avoid spoilers. She\'s also a character we\'ve seen before who fulfills the role of the perverted geek, which seems more there because of the obligatory perverted geek than as a real narrative point, although it does try.From here, some of this won\'t be a problem with viewers, but for others, it can be. For me, it definitely left me questioning if the person who created this is someone who actually understands people who have social issues or if they\'re working with certain talking points regarding certain beliefs regarding those with social issues. The latter is honestly problematic and something to be wary of going into the sequel series.', 'Nowadays we always see an isekai anime where the MC is overpowered. Yes, it was enjoyable to see how the MC bully their enemies. But, this kind of isekai anime is excluding them.The anime was slow in progress to characters strength which why we can feel their hardwork and challenges in a single quest. It shows how the characters are so weak and doing tactics to survive in the new world. Also, the good thing to the plot is, each characters has a role and develop by the time passing by.SPOILER ALERT!I considered the anime is unique with in comes to its plot. They...can go back to their true world and realize the differences of it. This character feels the new world was good because he/she can do things that out the real world. Then, this other character think the new world is just more hell and pain than the real world. You can easily determine the difference of each character on how they think the new and their true world is. And how important/useless the true unfair/beautiful world.PLOT - 9CHARACTERS - 8Well a little bit of disappointment to the animation. It feels something is missing?

This anime has definitely surprised me in some plot twists and there were indeed moments which I would give it an 8/10. Compared to other more popular anime’s this would be a 6/10.If this anime was more like a...comedy thing for pure entertainment it would be a good one to watch, which I enjoyed despite not necessarily enjoying these genres of anime’s, which surprised me.While watching the anime and taking a sneak peek at some reviews I noticed someone mention how “ if this anime took itself seriously… “   I don’t remember the rest of the sentence but looking back if the creators where trying to make this a good popular anime which could surpass other known and liked anime’s, then they have not done that.At some times there where very cringey moments that made it like a 4/10, it was very cliched and occasionally hard to follow the story or know what the characters are doing. But then again we had some very good twists and turns, character designs, and wholesome moments between the characters.there where so many good parts of this anime and so many bad parts. I don’t think one cancels out the other, I do not regret watching this anime it was very fascinating to see other genres I don’t normally watch.I have to say the first season was much better than the second. But that is just my opinion, how about you watch it for yourself and see.So if you are slightly interested in this anime then you should give it a try. If you’re clearly not impressed by it or don’t want to bother then maybe move on and come back if you wish.Hope this helped 👍 comedy thing for pure entertainment it would be a good one to watch, which I enjoyed despite not necessarily enjoying these genres of anime’s, which surprised me.While watching the anime and taking a sneak peek at some reviews I noticed someone mention how “ if this anime took itself seriously… “   I don’t remember the rest of the sentence but looking back if the creators where trying to make this a good popular anime which could surpass other known and liked anime’s, then they have not done that.At some times there where very cringey moments that made it like a 4/10, it was very cliched and occasionally hard to follow the story or know what the characters are doing.

Being thrown into a world and told to complete quests does not make a story, there is no real substance there, there is too much hidden and no explanation for any of this, if there was a reason for any of it, some substance something that acted as a driving force to a wider plot then you might actually care.I feel like I should put the animation in the negatives, it's fine for the most part, but there are times when it is just bad, especially the first part of the first episode, you can really see where they cut corners, scenes full of characters that are static and not animated, characters that haven't been fully drawn, static images of characters that slide across the frame to give the illusion that they are 'walking' static images that are devoid of any movement other than lip flaps...I was ready to write this off as one of the worst animated anime I've seen since the awful 2car, until the MC transported into a different world and the animators woke up and decided to actually start to animate scenes.To call this series a mess is an understatement, there are things I didn't like, much I'm just ambivalent about, and very few things I liked and enjoyed about it.It wasn't bad, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't good, it's barely 'passable' so while I wouldn't recommend it, I wouldn't tell people not to watch it either this, but it's a side character who appears later on, otherwise I find the characters to be bland or just unlikable.Which brings me to the negatives,The characters, I am just not that interested in them, they are bland or unlikable, I don't really care what happens to them, I'm not interested in following them.The plot...

A high school boy who is dissatisfied with reality and would rather live in the virtual world is hardly an original concept, and with the rest of the cast being as forgettable as the MC himself, I just couldn't invest myself into these characters and their goals.While there were some interesting aspects of the show such as the Game Master character and the way characters gained power was unique, the story itself and the quest that characters go one were not interesting enough...to carry the show, and alongside the bland characters watching the show became a chore.The show is passable art and sound wise. The show looked fine and the music was serviceable, but there wasn't anything that stood out either.Overall this show is another run of the mill Isekai show, and I wouldn't recommended this show to anyone unless they are an Isekai fan. to carry the show, and alongside the bland characters watching the show became a chore.The show is passable art and sound wise.

Changed the character score to a 5, and overall to a 5, enjoyment to an 7. Usually with isekai in the last decade unless its Sword art online or Re:Zero, overlord, etc (The bigger ones) if you like it your most likely an isekai fan. Im one of those people. Basically if you\'re like me and watch medicore trash for fun, this should be enjoyable. Oh and like most of my reviews this review contains spoilers.""Im standing on a million lives"" im kind\'ve tired of these long LN names....When I first saw the trailer for this...anime, the edgy name had me feeling like it was gonna be dark, also it shows someone dying in the trailer, and I can\'t read apparently so I thought if you die you can\'t be revived. Anyways this isn\'t a review of the trailer. BEFORE YOU WATCH THIS JUST KNOW THIS IS NOT A DARK ANIME! Seriously its actually kinda funny. Alright lets go over the pro\'s and con\'s:PRO\'S:1. The MC can be likeable for anyone who likes the shut in relatable generic MC, hes also not an overpowered nice guy.2. Pretty funny at times.3. There aren\'t harem plots in every isekai, I apologize for this trashy review, I was lacking braincells a few days ago. The point still stands, there is no harem plot.4. All the characters have funny personalities that carry the show.5. We basically have  a darkness that is obsessed with cutting flesh, if that doesn\'t make this show anime of the season, I don\'t know what will.Basically to sum the pro\'s up the characters carry the show. Obviously the characters aren\'t masterpieces that can be put in every show and make it good, but they are likeable enough atleast in my opinion.CON\'S:1. They took what could\'ve been a edgy isekai story, that could be in anime of the season conversation, and changed it to a pretty medicore quest anime. This may not be a con for other people but for someone who wanted to see a dark isekai this season, I was really disappointed.2. One of the characters is a cliche Useless female character. Now this could\'ve worked if like I said before they made it a dark, realistic story. Except this doesn\'t work with somewhat funny stories.3. This might get changed when the anime ends, but since were at episode 6 (Basically the half way point.), Im going to call them out on this. It feels like the plot is mostly the 3rd quest (Or 4th quest if im wrong.). The plot basically took the 1st and 2nd quest, and used it just to add in more characters. For the plot to literallyjust be them  trying to deliver goods to a village is kinda anticlimatic. I hope the show fixes that so I can delete this con, but for now its gonna stay here.Ok, so there are alot more con\'s than this, and while were on that I\'ll show you my full rating of the show:Story: 4/10Art: 5/10Sound: 4/10Character: 5/10Enjoyment: 7/10I feel like I enjoy this anime way more than I should...  If you read through this entire review and haven\'t watched the show yet, if you think the pro\'s outweigh the con\'s, or you just enjoy trashy isekai like me, I recommend you give this show a try :DOverall: 5/10A few days after reviewing this I checked my full anime list and I realized I gave this the same rating as Attack on titan season 2 and 3. It was also one score lower than violet evergarden, and higher than MHA season 1.Basically unless the isekai is something big like adding something new to isekai, don\'t rate it based off enjoyment.

The entire review will stay the same.', 'This is of course a preliminary review of this series, however, after having seen 9 out of the 12 episodes, this review will likely be my finishing score as well.--------------Story: 5/10:Compared to most traditional Isekai, this one does have an interesting and unique spin on things. The characters are pulled out of the ""real world"" and thrust into a ""game world"" where they have a set period of time to complete certain quests, so that they can then return to the real world again.None of the characters are OP, or even particularly skilled and 3 of them have reservations and issues adapting to their...predicament.However, despite the unique twist on things, the story doesn\'t really go anywhere and feels like watching a let\'s play of some very generic MMO fetch quests.This is supposed to be an action anime as well and I can probably count on one hand how many actual fights have taken place in the anime.As of episode 9, it is getting seriously boring and somewhat tedious to watch.--------------Art & Sound: 4/10 (respectively):Really nothing of note here. There\'s some OK CGI thrown in for good measure, but the backgrounds are really 50/50 on quality. Character designs are also very generic and not particularly interesting.Sound design is mostly the character\'s voices as most of the episodes (so far) have been exposition dumps. The V.As do a good enough job, but there\'s little else to even talk about sound-wise.--------------Characters: 3/10:Bland, boring, uninspired, cliché, dull and any other pejorative adjective could be used to describe them.The best characters are the guy, who I suppose is meant to be the MC and the NPC knight-lady. The MC\'s ""harem"" are barely memorable, to the point I forgot one of them even existed.The anime tries to flesh out the characters to a degree and tries to explain their backstories, so that we care about them, but honestly, I just don\'t.We get:- Edgy main dude, who somewhat softens up- Beautiful perfect ""maiden"" type girl, who had a ""terrible past""- Otaku gamer girl who is a massive cringe-fest- Shy, can\'t hurt a fly girl who I forgot was even in this anime to be honest. Oh yes, of course, she also has a tragic backstory of having an illness of some sort.--------------Enjoyment: 4/10:As I\'ve said before, this anime, after 9 episodes is starting to become very boring. The story seems to be spinning its wheels and not really going anywhere and the characters are too dull to care about.It\'s not quite as boring as the first few episodes of ""King\'s Raid"", which is also currently airing, but it\'s getting very close.--------------Overall: 4/10. predicament.However, despite the unique twist on things, the story doesn\'t really go anywhere and feels like watching a let\'s play of some very generic MMO fetch quests.This is supposed to be an action anime as well and I can probably count on one hand how many actual fights have taken place in the anime.As of episode 9, it is getting seriously boring and somewhat tedious to watch.--------------Art & Sound: 4/10 (respectively):Really nothing of note here.

Since I liked the intro I started reading the Manga and OH BOY DOES IT GET GOOD!Sadly this first season never reached those ""good"" parts. What you can see in those 12 Episodes is merely the introduction to a story, that goes very into detail about society, politics and consequences of your actions. But since this is a review for those 12 Episodes and not what comes after it:- You have very endearing characters and some you are meant to - and will -...hate. The male Protagonist is a little edgelord, but pretty decent otherwise. The first girl is kinda capeable, the second girl is the heart of the team and the fourth teammate that joins after the first adventure is a little shit that is sometimes usefull by accident.They are all flawed in their own way, but they all have their strong points as well.- The story is pretty mediocre, a lot of stuff is watered down (for example the riddles in the dungeon tunnel they have to cross as a shortcut) but all in all it is just an introduction to the whole setting. some may argue it is very long and I don\'t disagree.What is the story? A loner gets transported to another world with 2 of his classmates and has to do a single task. Failing the task will result in all 3 of them dying. They get assinged classes like in a fantasy game, the MC rolls very low and gets assigned the ""Farmer"" class while the others are a warrior and a mage. Turns out he levels up much faster and the other two are rather useless. They also return to life after 30 seconds as long as their body is not eaten and one partymember is still alive..Sounds silly, is silly, but trust me - it gets better.This is not an Isekai with  the ""you can\'t die"" plot like Re: Zero alone, but an Isekai that shows you the consequences of your actions. Why you ask?Because after they finish the task, the group gets transported back to the ""real"" world - where no time has passed. And after a few weeks they are back in the other world again. But 10 years have passed there.Art and sound are nothing special.so yeah overall i give it a 7/10 - but I\'m probably biased because of the Manga. Read that! hate.

The characters act a bit cringingly and there isn't significant action involved in the show.The show felt like a solid 6/10, something which was simply fun to watch only because there wasn't something better to do at the time.However, the final episode on its own was done in an exceptional manner. Even though each episode until that point felt shallow and very simple, they build up quite nicely for the final episode, revealing a deeper character aspect for the overall generic protagonist.There is a second season...confirmed, so I hope we see the show improving further through it. confirmed, so I hope we see the show improving further through it."", ""I guess this anime was trying for something new?

The only watchable episode was the first. It all went downhill from there. Almost nothing in this anime is even remotely original. Other unoriginal anime make up for this with interesting characters or cool art, but this anime has neither of those. The main character is transported into another world with classes and abilities. His starting class is a farmer and he\'s disappointed, as would be expected. Even if this concept is insanely boring, they didn\'t have to absolutely butcher...it in the way that they did.Art - 4Considering this was aired in October 2020, the art and animation were mediocre. I\'m aware that the characters\' designs were taken from the 2016 manga, but they could be mistaken for anime characters from 2010. Much of the land was barren and the color of the grass was extremely saturated, making it look like a cartoon instead of an animated TV show.Sound - 5The opening, ""Anti World,"" sounds really annoying to me for some reason. After the first ten seconds, it starts to become more bearable to listen to. The rest of the song is actually pretty nice. ""Carpe Diem"" is the ending theme of the anime. Honestly, this was a huge mistake. Now it looks AND sounds like a cartoon. The song just doesn\'t go with the genre of the anime. When I hear that song, it makes me think of a harem anime involving lolis.Character - 1I won\'t even have to say anything because it\'s so blatantly obvious. The characters are an absolute mess. I don\'t know how they accomplished it, but they somehow made weebs in anime even more unlikeable. The main character is a loner and outcast who becomes respected. Let\'s see what other anime have a character like this...KonoSuba, TenSura, Shield Hero, etc.Enjoyment - 2It\'s as though they had an incomplete thought and turned it into an anime. It seems like they drained all of their ideas on the first episode and the remaining episodes were thought up on the spot. I had no idea that 92% of an anime could be filler. If you watch one episode a week, you usually won\'t get bored of an anime. That does not apply to this show.Overall - 3There is nothing about the actual plot that is good. The only reason that I give this show a 3 is because the art was okay and the opening theme was pretty good. If you have about 20 minutes to spare with no anime to watch, I guess the first episode isn\'t horrible. If you intend to complete the entire anime, please proceed with caution. it in the way that they did.Art - 4Considering this was aired in October 2020, the art and animation were mediocre.

Not like many isekai films, when 4 characters go to another world, they can come back. Also, why they were chosen to that world the purpose that the future people want them to go to that world. The plot twist of the story makes the film to be more exciting. But the minus point of the film is the title of the film. In the first season, I don\'t know who stands on one million lives. Although, this film is still excellent.Art: 8/10The background, characters were drawn quite well....But why I rate 8/10, cause the fight scenes didn\'t interest me yet. Special at the fight scene in episode 7, the fight happened too fast. Don\'t want to say that it was quite easy for the heroes to fight that boss. So, 8 is a good score for the art.Sound: 7/10Don\'t want to say anything but the sound is so boring. Special at the fight scenes, it didn\'t help the fight to be more exciting. The voice of the characters were much louder the soundtrack. This is the worse thing of the film. But the plus point is Maho Film had invested in the music.Character: 8/10Like I say, the characters were drawn beautifully. ANy characters have their stories of their lives. But too many girls and just 1 boy make me think that the film is ""non-harem"", as same as Sword Art Online.Enjoyment: 8/10I really enjoy the film because of the story. But Harem is the genre that I really dislike, so sometimes I stop to watch.Overall: 8/10To sum up, the story, art and characters were good, but the sound was quite bad. In my opinion, Maho Film should invest in the soundtrack.Thanks for reading my review. But why I rate 8/10, cause the fight scenes didn\'t interest me yet.

These unique aspects the anime brought to the isekai genre were actually really intriguing and were the main reason for me to start the show since it seemed like it was trying to innovate within the genre, unfortunately, the story progression and the other aspects of the anime that I will talk further below didn\'t pull their wait to push this anime beyond the average making ""100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru"" be just another bland and forgettable isekai in the end.Art: The art style in the anime is a pretty standard one for isekai anime which means the characters don\'t have memorable designs making them really forgettable in the long run, however the monsters design was actually a pleasant surprise although you get the typical isekai monsters such as goblins, orcs and trolls they had some creativity put into their designs and didn\'t look like carbon copies of other shows; the gamemasters design was also really quirky and interesting and, honestly, it is the only character you will probably visually remember after some time passes. The animation is not that good and we can clearly see the budget for this show was not the best, we have several instances of poor 3D animation throughout the show that feel super out of place for example on those dinosaur looking creatures they use to pull the carts, but ultimately it is not bad enough to be a sole reason to drop the show and it\'s still pretty watchable although in some instances you will see something that\'ll get you thinking to yourself ""that feels out of place"".Sound: The opening song is actually pretty enjoyable and I\'m almost certain I didn\'t skip it a single time, however it\'s not good enough in my opinion to be added to a playlist and listened to outside of the anime. The ending song is a classic anime ending song just a smooth melancholic music with nothing remarkable to highlight; the ending is definitely worse than the opening and I skipped it for the majority of episodes. The voice acting is also nothing too special although decent and the sound effects, especially, during fights were a bit clunky and just felt a bit off in my opinion.Characters: In my opinion the two most important aspects in an anime are the characters and the plot along with the world building, sadly having this in mind, the characters are my biggest complaint with this anime since the cast massively brought down my levels of enjoyment for this show even though the plot and specifically the world building actually had tons of potential. The main cast is easily divided into two categories: the ones that are one-dimensional annoying and with not even and attempt buy the show to develop and the ones that the anime tried, with no avail, to develop and give depth to them which ended with them constantly contradicting themselves and merely become confusing and annoying characters. With this said the characters that fall into the first category would be ""Hakozaki"" and ""Tokitate"" whilst the characters that fall into the second category are ""Yuusuke"" and ""Shindou"". Ironically the main cast is a group of super bland characters while the few characters that were actually really intriguing are are a character that would only be developed near the end of the story itself or not developed at all a.k.a the grandmaster and a character that was linked to a quest and will probably not even appear again in the show a.k.a Kahabell.Overall: It\'s a bit of a shame that I can\'t brong myself to give this show more than a mediocre 5/10 rating, I seriously started this anime with high expectations for how the story would develop itself based on how the whole world works in the show. The music was average and the sound effects felt weird; the animations were lacking a bit even by average isekai standards; the plot started strong but the quests portrayed throughout the episodes felt a bit dragged and lacked cohesion; and the character were either getting poor development or non at all making them confusing and one-dimensional. All in all it is pretty watchable if you are bored and don\'t have anything much to do but it isn\'t anything you will profoundly enjoy.P.S. I don\'t know if a lot of viewers also felt this way or if it was just me but I was constantly getting annoyed by our main cast whilst they were completing their quests since they always seemed to make the worst decisions possible for the situations they found themselves in. gist of this anime to try and stand out from all the other anime in it\'s genre are mainly three aspects: 1st is the fact that our main cast goes back and forth between the two worlds rather than stay stuck in the fantasy world as the usual isekai goes; 2nd is the fact that our main cast is being guided by a gamemaster and ordered to complete various quest where after each of these quests a new member is to be brought from the real world and will join the party for the next quest; 3rd is the aspect of roles or ""jobs"" like warrior and spellcaster that traditionally are assigned to the characters and the show moves on whereas in this show the characters are assigned one of these at random and will have various opportunities to change these roles throughout the episodes.

The opening video and ending are also well-done and timed with the songs but there is a problem about those.Sound: 5Everything is forgivable, but when I really mean it.

The most interesting in all of that is the MC, he is a bit of a bad Light Yagami, but it gives him something that is very pleasant, he feels very human and his flaws are well-shown.

Or at least be on the lookout to see if it's good when it comes out. Don't let this first season turn you away, please.So, I'd written a review on episode 5 since I thought the early backlash was mostly a result of cynicism against the isekai genre and the fact that this series decided to do mostly all set up in the first few episodes. If followed through on, I think those early episodes would've been looked at as pretty good, because...by themselves those episodes don't do anything.However, the later episodes just didn't do anything. Each episode spent it's time on one or one and a half mini-plot points - if you couldn't tell by watching it, the specific events in the isekai world are not what the story's focus is. The pacing ground to a halt, and what was the final episode should've been on seven or eight.I just realized I haven't really summarized it, so here goes, without spoilers.Mc and a few people get transported to a sort of isekai, are given some quests that they need to fulfill within a timeframe. Once the quest is done, they go back to their own world with no time having passed - if they fail, they die.This is immediately a really solid premise - it should be the core of the show, but it isn't. And that's where a lot of the problems come in.A lot of everything else is like generic isekai, but with just enough of a twist to keep it potentially interesting. For example, the respawn mechanics and pain nullification make room for potentially incredibly brutal strategies, and the level down mechanic from hurting people in universe means human conflict rather than monster conflict is extra deadly.This almost goes somewhere and is played with slightly in the beginning, and even less later on. It's not leaned on as hard as it should be, because it's one of the main differences from generic isekai.In between each of the quests, one of them gets a mini-quest in world to find another person to join them on their missions. This is handled a bit unclearly - at first it seems like they get to choose, which is how the mc was 'accidentally' chosen. But when we follow mc on his miniquests (yeah he gets them by himselves after, the others have nothing to do with them anymore) he doesn't get to choose and is rather given someone to recruit.So you see the structure, right? Quest, some stuff happens in the isekai, return, recruit someone, go back, see how the isekai was changed from - wait, that's a spoiler. Why is that a spoiler? Because the very second quest with our MC, the first two girls, and the fourth girl that gets recruited, ends up taking 3 or four episodes longer than it should have - all the way up to episode 11.And that's where the entire structure is broken. We no longer have an interplay of real world and isekai - instead, the second half of this season is all isekai. Which is not the focus of the story - all the minor conflict in that universe is nowhere near as interesting as the meta conflict of going back and forth, and their end goal, what happens when they finish enough quests and recruit enough people, etc.^ This is foreshadowed by one of the questions they get to ask after finishing each quest, which is actually pretty cool.Notice how I haven't said anything about what the conflict in the isekai is yet? Because it's literally not relevant or fun.On episode twelve, they recruit the fifth guy - a 19 yr boy with some clear issues and interesting backstory. If only we'd gotten to him earlier, this anime could've been so good.With this all said - season two has already been planned, for July 2021. So yeah, episodes 6-11 are a bore. But there's a core of great and interesting ideas that might be tackled in season 2 - or they might spend another half season on the boring, useless, isekai world again.I had high hopes for this anime, and they weren't fulfilled. 4/10. But I'll definitely be watching season two, in hopes that they get to the interesting part.Update after going through the manga: Wow it's a shit ton better, but also the anime adapted it basically page for page. Basically, author was figuring out their stride, as it were. This anime is barely if at all indicative of what the series is about - I wouldn't mention this if it weren't for the fact that it's getting a second season, and that might be really amazing if they continue with the faithful-ness they have here.Although, I'm not entirely sure the second island arc is long enough to fit a complete 12 episodes, and there's no way they're getting through the drug war arc.So yeah - this series takes the parallel world/isekai concept to its core themes- the situations our heroes go in after this arc are directly parallel to current/several years ago modern events. The author does their research and doesn't make any presumptious (aka idiotic) claims about what should work, just uses literally what we have. The time skip means they don't even have to guess at what happens in the medium/long term (which would be quite a bold statement) and instead deals with it in isolation. Some people might dislike that because it's basically avoiding the issue, but I'm not sure there's any good answer when it's so closely tied to reality.If that sounds incredible to you, it's because it is. If it sounds very basic to you, it also is - but its done incredibly thoroughly - at least for anyone who isn't actively studying the topics, I guess - I'm not one of those people so i can't speak on their behalf.If you think the religious war part of this season was kinda like that - no, no, not even close. by themselves those episodes don't do anything.However, the later episodes just didn't do anything.

I f***ing hate isekai genre, because I personally feel it almost has no purpose other than being used as an escapism and power fantasy fulfillment for its watcher/reader. The basic premise of isekai genre makes no sense to me, because there is no point for a character to be developed being a better person (along with stupid OP cheat skills and bunch of harems which is pointless) when he/she was dead or didn\'t belong in the real world anymore.Isekai genre itself is nothing new. It\'s more like a fantasy story for kids (like Alice in the Wonderland or Peter Pan)...except it was mostly written by a delusional perverted grown dude.And now, about this anime... Okay, I might be a little bit biased since I\'ve read the manga and I really love the original author\'s other works (My Home Hero).This anime (or originally a manga) is a rare case isekai for me. I usually dropped any isekai animes/mangas after some early chapters because it bored me with its overused formula, but I actually enjoyed this one even though it doesn\'t offer anything groundbreaking to the genre.So for you guys who want to understand this anime in TLDR version:Basically this anime formula is1. mc is an edgy teenage ""anti-social"" boi who hates anyone and have a weird sense of moral value sometimes (you found this a lot in other animes)2. basic isekai formula (transported to another world, given a class/skills, etc.)3. GANTZ-like type of game (mission/quest, party/team-based, time limit, \'player\' can still get revived at certain conditions)So now what makes me enjoying this one other than isekai animes:- it\'s not a solo-type isekai story in which usually the MC is the only spotlight of the show with his/her OP skill for no particular reason. The MC actually working together with his team to clear the quest.- after a mission/quest cleared, players will go back to the real world. This make a lot of changes to the players who participate in the ""game"" because their hardships in another world is actually develop them to be a ""better"" person.-the story had a lot of depth to the conflict and its world building, especially later on in the manga. They used a lot of references to the real world problems (such as drug dealer, civil war, unbalanced economy, worker exploitation, etc.)-voice acting for the characters is pretty good.And then, here\'s the bad parts of this anime:- the animation in this anime SUCKS, It\'s so mediocre and even a lot of times the quality dropped below average. If you can read the manga, go read it instead of watching this anime.- ugh I can\'t say anything for the sound part since it\'s so generic and forgettable.- the main characters mostly fall flat to the generic/stereotype category. You won\'t find any remarkable characters here, although some of them are pretty likeable in a way.So overall, I\'m kinda sad that the anime adaptation for this manga didn\'t turned out great. With a better execution (especially on the animation and pacing), this isekai anime could be much better. But sadly it seems the budget for this one is pretty much low just by looking at a glance. Such a waste of potential in my opinion.I really recommend you guys to read the manga. It\'s really good and enjoyable. As for the anime adaptation, well it\'s not really bad or disastrous anime ever actually, quite enjoyable at times. But the true potential of this series can be found in the original manga.

I feel like my dislike for the show may just be down to the fact that Isekai is my fave genre and I’ve seen so much of it that I’ve become jaded. Regardless, I can only write and comment on how I feel.Premise wise, I think many people will enjoy what 100-man is about since it deviates quite a bit from traditional isekai tropes. For one, the characters are not permanently stuck in the new world, for two there is no harem and lastly, the MC is not super OP, but is in...fact pretty weak. The last point is quite significant. Mainly because one of the biggest issues people traditionally have with isekai is that the OP protagnoist removes all tension, drama or mystery in the series.No matter what, you know the MC will overcome it with some power-up. Yotsuya being stuck in classes that are not really suited for combat forces him to rely on his companions and creates a rather unique dynamic. So story wise, 100-man may be for you if you want to try something different.Personally, I found the characters to be quite bland. We get episodes that flesh out the characters backstories and their motivations, which I appreciated, but in shows like this that are pretty character driven, it’s important to connect to the characters and I just never could. From what I’ve been told, the arc that takes place after this in the manga is really good, so I will potentially check that out at a later time, but in terms of the anime’s arcs, I was not impressed.From a technical standpoint, I was underwhelmed by the animation and art quality of the show. It’s not bad by any stretch, but I didn’t find it particularly pleasing either. The fight scenes were “meh” for me and I never really got into any of the hype scenes.Overall, 100-man is a show that in all fairness does have some good things going for it. I appreciate that it tries to be unique, tries to introduce new concepts and does have potential. But, it just wasn’t for me and was my least favourite show this season. 100-man gets 5 game masters out of 10. fact pretty weak. The last point is quite significant.

But there has to be an appeal there for me to get involved. Some shows are unique in how they approach the genre, like a restaurant in another world or retiring in another world. But more often than not, the isekai genre, as of writing this, is headed out. Now what does this have to do with ""I\'m Standing on a Million Lives"" or ""Million Lives""? It\'s not that this show has an inherently bad premise or is incredibly boring, because I found myself entertained for a portion...of it...at least enough to watch and not drop. It\'s more that it\'s unable to stay on track and ends up sabotaging itself via means that were meant to make it seem original.This show makes an obvious attempt at being fresh and dark, but ends up losing itself in an identity crisis. It\'s clear they wanted to show a dark and disturbed world, and I suppose at times they do. More often than not though, I had no clue what each character was thinking. They ignore key elements while spending too much time on insignificant posturing, losing even more potential for an interesting plot.There are some redeeming elements of the series that come from the citizens of the alternate world. Their consistent nature with the random events occurring allow for a unique plot on their part. Fortunately this allows for a counter to the main heroes inconsistent and illogical actions. Had it not been for the side stories of the other worlders, this show would have most certainly been a complete waste of time.One ""other worlder"" girl, named Kahabell, is a knight that the heroes end up traveling with. She ends up helping them in a variety of ways and behaves in a reasonable manner, albeit unconventionally. Her story was a redeeming factor for the series, and though we do get to spend a significant amount of time with her, it just reminded me of how bad the main characters are. For some odd reason, she identifies with Yuusuke (the main protagonist), and ends up spending most of her story with him. This leads to an interesting potential romance between them, but of course it can never be since they are from two different dimensions/worlds...not to mention the significant time difference between their dimensions (one week in his world is like a decade in hers). Still, I found the breakdown of their relationship that never was, very touching. Later on in the series, and many alternate world years later, after Kahabell\'s already married and had children, the two reunite. In this scene, Kahabell reflects on her life and their time together, and realizes just how much her life has changed since they last were together. She realizes how old she\'s gotten and just how different her life is now as a house wife. She admits to Yuusuke that she\'s always been in love with him and takes the kiss she wasn\'t brave enough to take a decade earlier. It\'s both touching and heartbreaking to say the least, since they clearly love each other but are separated by time and space. It\'s stories like this from the citizens of the alternate world that kept me watching, but it\'s no thanks to the main characters, and is in no way redeeming enough for the main plot.I\'d say the top issue I had with Million Lives was the main characters. At no point during the series did I feel much of a bond between the team members that get transported to the alternate world, nor did I care for any of the characters as individuals...other than a few. They sucked as a team, and they suck as individuals. On several occasions, opportunities for growth would arise, but was always tabled for some other ""original"" story telling device...and the story telling method was worse than if they had just chosen to be predictable. Predictability isn\'t always a bad thing if you know it will benefit the story. Surprising the audience does nothing if the audience doesn\'t care or understand what the characters motivations are. The team member that bothered me most was the main protagonist, Yuusuke. I literally fell asleep listening to him drudge on about how he hates humanity. His story arc is literally just ""Me, me, me...let me talk about me and my thoughts some more"". For some odd reason he refuses to get along with his team and consistently talks down to them, although they also don\'t have great personalities either. His reasoning for his deluded ideology regarding humanity was not only flawed but inconsistent. Some people he\'s okay with, such as his home town friends or the citizens of the other world, while others, like the residents of Tokyo or his team, are the ""absolute worst"". If you ask me, this protagonist might as well have been an empty shell, because even the worst of humanity can still have conviction.The team he\'s with isn\'t much better. One of my least favorite of the teams members, Yuka, is introduced in the strangest way possible. Yuusuke comes in per the Overseer\'s request and sees Yuka being held down by some girls, that are bullying her presumably, with her bra exposed to their cell phone cameras. Now a normal viewer understands why he ends up rescuing her and destroying the bullies\' phones to get rid of the lewd pictures. But instead of gratitude, Yuusuke ends up being chastised for destroying the bullies phones and is labeled a pervert by the girl he rescued! Apparently he ruined her chances for popularity... To add to her already unlikeable personality, she\'s a streamer that is entirely focused on herself. While in her self delusion, she spreads negative rumors about Yuusuke to the other girls in the party (Iu and Kusue) and of course they take her word for it rather than Yuusuke (who they\'ve known longer and were rescued by), and end up shunning him. I literally cannot find one redeeming personality trait for Yuka...it\'s just endless sarcasm, monotony, and complaining from this girl.Illogical actions of the main characters are a constant throughout the series. As brief as my explanation of events was, it perfectly describes the upside down world the writers of this show are living. Scenes and actions don\'t make sense, and characters don\'t follow any sense of logic. Eventually Yuka admits Yuusuke did try and save her, and wasn\'t actually a pervert, but the other girls just shrug it off, and neither girl apologizes for ostracizing him. To make matters worse, the girls on the team don\'t seem to understand how useless they are without Yuusuke and he never really gets any form of gratitude from them. Moments that could have been heartfelt apologies, redemptions, or moments of appreciation are instead just glossed over. Emotions, other than anger and despair, appear to not even exist in this show. I can\'t explain how frustrating all of this is while watching.Even when a new team member joins, the previous players behave like jerks, not even bothering to explain the world to them. I suppose this is for the sake of comedy, but the new member\'s frustration is obviously expected after being transported to a world they don\'t understand, while being ignored by their other party members. One of the more positive members, Keita, is introduced in this manner, but is, of course, written off as hopeless by the other party members. The irony here is that his backstory was the only intriguing one, considering he\'s had the hardest life of the group. In a battle though, he\'s the first one to run in and fight, which isn\'t always the best move but shows his bravery at least. The girls consistently call out their male counterparts as dumb or illogical, when they end up being useless and never put forth any of their own plans. It\'s not that there isn\'t truth to their statements, I just don\'t want to hear it from the characters that aren\'t any better.As I mentioned earlier, there aren\'t many redeeming factors of this show. The action isn\'t particularly exciting to watch, the music was fairly generic, and the plot was confusing. Since the side stories/characters are apart of the series, I can\'t say that the show as a whole was a waste, but the main characters and plot took some getting used to (to say the least). I scored the series as average due its inconsistency, with some parts fairly enjoyable and the rest being mind numbing. How you decide to take that is up to you. I can\'t say that I recommend it as a whole, but some of the side stories are actually worth watching. I get what the creators were going for, and appreciate that direction. I just wish the dialogue, characters, and plot had more appeal. I supposed there\'s something for everyone, so I wouldn\'t be surprised to hear some people love this show, but, to me, it was nothing more than a wasted opportunity. of it...at least enough to watch and not drop.

Moments that could have been heartfelt apologies, redemptions, or moments of appreciation are instead just glossed over. Emotions, other than anger and despair, appear to not even exist in this show. I can\'t explain how frustrating all of this is while watching.Even when a new team member joins, the previous players behave like jerks, not even bothering to explain the world to them. I suppose this is for the sake of comedy, but the new member\'s frustration is obviously expected after being transported to a world they don\'t understand, while being ignored by their other party members. One of the more positive members, Keita, is introduced in this manner, but is, of course, written off as hopeless by the other party members. The irony here is that his backstory was the only intriguing one, considering he\'s had the hardest life of the group. In a battle though, he\'s the first one to run in and fight, which isn\'t always the best move but shows his bravery at least. The girls consistently call out their male counterparts as dumb or illogical, when they end up being useless and never put forth any of their own plans. It\'s not that there isn\'t truth to their statements, I just don\'t want to hear it from the characters that aren\'t any better.As I mentioned earlier, there aren\'t many redeeming factors of this show. The action isn\'t particularly exciting to watch, the music was fairly generic, and the plot was confusing. Since the side stories/characters are apart of the series, I can\'t say that the show as a whole was a waste, but the main characters and plot took some getting used to (to say the least). I scored the series as average due its inconsistency, with some parts fairly enjoyable and the rest being mind numbing. How you decide to take that is up to you. I can\'t say that I recommend it as a whole, but some of the side stories are actually worth watching. I get what the creators were going for, and appreciate that direction. I just wish the dialogue, characters, and plot had more appeal. I supposed there\'s something for everyone, so I wouldn\'t be surprised to hear some people love this show, but, to me, it was nothing more than a wasted opportunity.', 'By far one of the best Isekai manga. It nailed why I watch isekai exactly. I have read the manga and watched and endless amount of isekai anime and manga. This anime had the perfect mix between tension, mystery, action and comedy.It started of with a great interesting concept and slowly revealed more mystery and questions. It slowly builds up an interesting story and ends on a high point. Each and every episodes were just simply so good.

The fighting scene may not cater to action-maniac people but for people who seek story its pretty good. Sometimes art may fall off but when compared to other isekai anime.

However, other characters fall a bit short. The characters aren\'t ""triple-A"" quality and pretty hollow and annoying at times. However, when compared to other isekai anime again, it stands quite better and are more relatable and realistic.Enjoyment - 10/10 - Haven\'t watched such a great anime for such a long time.

If you don’t mind storytelling incompetence, this might be worth the watch.  It's only 12 episodes, after all.)Crunchyroll certainly picked a fine couple of anime to promote for simulcast this season, didn’t they?  Noblesse kinda gave them a giant pile of nothing, but at least this gave their viewers some fine entertainment value.  Well, OK, maybe “fine” is not appropriate, but this show was nonetheless consistently among my...favorite viewings all throughout the season.  The reason for this varied greatly from week to week, because boy howdy was this a roller coaster ride of quality.Like all good stories, things start off innocently enough.  Yuusuke Yotsuya is an unpopular loser whose only skill in life is at video games.  He holds a grudge against society for how his life has turned out so far and hates or at the very least distrusts everyone he knows.  Suddenly, he is transported to another world that functions on RPG logic along with two of his girl classmates who have been there previously, where he learns that they’re heroes meant to save the world etc.  He learns this from the Game Master, who is this reliably funny (no seriously, he’s actually funny) entity in the role of DM.Much of the early discussion about this show was based around comparisons to KonoSuba, likely due to the early emphasis on humor, which centers around how laughably underpowered and useless everyone is because they’re so comically low-leveled, and Yuusuke has a hyper-niche (read: useless) character class to boot.  Additionally, the instructions everyone was given are extremely vague and unhelpful, resulting in our heroes stumbling their way to success.  A lot like KonoSuba.Which turned out to be an unfair comparison to make, not only because KonoSuba is the best at what it does, but also because Million Lives isn’t really supposed to be a comedy: it’s a drama, people.  See?  It says so quite clearly on the sidebar.  What do you mean you couldn’t tell; don’t you remember our protagonist menacingly saying he wanted to destroy the entire city earlier?  Clearly this show demands you take it seriously.  I certainly didn’t, though, so maybe that’s why the comedy was so effective on me, both at the beginning and when the show very occasionally got out of its bad-drama-induced stupors.Because oh my god this drama is terrible and impossible to take seriously.  I haven’t seen anything quite like it, really, because on paper it’s perfectly fine.  Good, I dare say.  But the execution, the way they adapted these ideas visually… it just didn’t work, to put it mildly.  One scene from early on that sticks out in particular is when Yuusuke’s three women compatriots were captured by bandits.  One of the guards says something to the other that implies that he’s going to sexually exploit the ladies as he opens the door and enters their cell, and then we cut to Yuusuke leading the rescue operation with the knights he spent the episode recruiting.  When we cut back, bizarrely, the scene in the bandit’s dungeon is shot exactly like it was before we cut away.  After a few seconds of not even acknowledging what went down before the cut away, it’s then revealed that the ladies somehow fended this guy off.  Even though it’s already been established that none of the heroes can harm humans in this world without losing a ton of experience, but whatever I guess since they never address the consequences of this.  This information was conveyed in a way that was supposed to be comedic, I think.  This is a standard example of how this show executes its drama scenes.  You saw how I mentioned this idea of the heroes suffering a loss of experience when they harm humans, even in situations where no rational person could say this harm was being done immorally.  This is a fantastic idea to incorporate into one’s story, but, even though the idea had already been incorporated, it was completely forgotten in this scene, and in the greater story it doesn’t come up all that often outside of this arc.And that’s the gist of the show’s problems, really.  Writing quality is an especially important element of dramas, as your story needs to be at a baseline level of consistency to make your audience emotionally connect with your characters.  The drama in this show feels so ineffective because issues like I described in the above example are everywhere.  The elements to make the drama work are all there, and we intuitively feel like this should be affecting us more, but because they’re so incompetently assembled it just doesn’t work.The characterization is in the same boat.  Much to my surprise, despite the best efforts of the actual storytelling, by the show’s conclusion 50% of the main 4 characters had undergone convincing character development and had appeared to grow from their journey.  So a thumbs up is in order there, I guess.  Additionally, everyone has a perfectly serviceable backstory and acts in much the way you would expect them to, given those backstories.  The problem is, not much is done with these backstories outside of giving everyone their shounen hero moment after they flashback and suddenly find the strength to break out of the cornered situation they were in.And just when it’s enough to make me tap out, suddenly the drama ends and the comedy act returns.  Comedic scenes are clumped together throughout the show, and overall don’t have much of an impact outside of the few episodes they’re focused on, but they’re a real godsend once you get to them.  They definitely aren’t anywhere close to the quality of KonoSuba, but they’re still effective.  They’re just like any decent shounen’s comedy, just a silly series of events that will probably put a smile on your face.  Or at least make you less miserable.So how did this show end up like this?  A lack of experience is my best guess.  I can’t speak to the writing quality of the manga, but what is notable for this anime adaptation is that the director (and most of the staff in general) are brand new to their roles.  The director has only ever worked as an assistant director on a couple (by which I mean literally two) shows prior to this, and that is the entire extent of the experience that was brought to this project.  Suddenly, the incompetence makes sense, doesn’t it?  It’s hard to be angry with the directors in situations like these.  It’s still a real shame though, because, although the manga is far from perfect itself judging from its MAL score, there are so many potentially great ideas bubbling below this show’s surface, in addition to its other qualities.  The show looks pretty good in general, with great visuals all around and competent enough everything else production-wise.Studio Maho Film likely assigned their staff with learning in mind.  And while I think it’s considerably unlikely that the writing in each episode was produced chronologically (though maybe it was, I don’t know anything about TV production), I like to believe a lot was learned on this job, because I genuinely thought the final arc of the season was an incredible improvement that I really enjoyed watching, which is hopefully indicative of a much-improved season 2.  The storytelling suddenly improved drastically, and it honestly became quite hype.  This was of course immediately followed by a return to old habits as the show suddenly remembers how much of a psychopath Yuusuke supposedly is even though he spends 99% of the season not being one, but by that point the show’s tendency to do things like this became quite endearing.I’ll be honest.  This show is mostly complete trash, but I can’t help but kind of love it, even the unbearable drama.  Not even in a guilty pleasure kind of way, I just genuinely love how hard it tries.  It’s the epitome of the little engine that could this season.  Said engine combusted into a fireball before even getting out of the station, but it kept trucking along anyway.  You gotta respect that.  In conclusion, I can’t wait for season 2! favorite viewings all throughout the season.

The art and animation is dogshit. You can see where the corners are cut in both cases. Any action taken never takes up more than five frames. A lot of actions are done with two or three. Whether it\'s a massive sword move or the movement of the hair. The movements are left stiff and lifeless as though they were animated by an amateur using flash for the first time. The art itself is a copy paste of any generic ""how to draw anime characters"" art book and a poor one at that. You can tell...this thing didn\'t have budget but what makes this worse is how clearly this didn\'t have any effort put into it either. None of the movements feel well choreographed and everything is left stiff.The expressions on the character\'s faces are a little bit better but not by much. Their faces aren\'t deadpan entirely but the simple fact is that though they convey expression they\'re not exactly animated. Expressions change with as little effort as humanly possible. The movements aren\'t animated. When you\'re watching say someone respond with shock in Jujutsu Kaisen for instance in the first 20 seconds of the latest episode you have a couple of frames shifting the head back, raising the eyebrows, the shoulders raising slightly, the eyes widenning a little bit. The small shifts and changes all working together to be a little bit more expressive without being over the top. You don\'t have that here. It doesn\'t exist.Then again, it is 2020 and there does need to be some leniency for such things. With everything that\'s happened this year it\'s not hard to imagine how their work and their work ethic might be compromised. At the same time how badly this thing turned out is still disgraceful.Then there\'s the padding. Oh boy, the padding. Okay, so here\'s the thing. We spend the first five minutes after the opening in the first episode going through our protagonist\'s real life. The first minute and a half of which he spends saying nothing and just silently brooding. The first time he says anything at all is when he\'s playing video games in his appartment. For comparrison\'s sake, the first two and a half minutes of the anime aren\'t in the manga at all. Unless it\'s in the novel, which it could well be, then this was added in post production.As it stands, what takes three pages in the manga has now taken almost 5 minutes to see unfold. Then we have another 45 seconds thrown in just in him getting there instead of him fading out and finding himself there in a couple of seconds as they did in both the manga and literally two episodes later. These largely unneccessary additions are frequent throughout the entire series. That is ignoring the fact that when the animators have an excuse to make something take longer they tend to take it. The first quest lasts about 2 episodes, with each episode adapting the equivalent of about half a chapter of the manga. This is perhaps one of the more aggregious examples but comparing them and considerring the anime it\'s not an entirely uncommon thing. I\'d have been fine with these instances of padding if they didn\'t make the characters worse as a result.You see, Yotsuya looks a lot less competent in the anime than he does in the manga. He feels a lot less capable and has a lot more teenage angst in a sense. He\'s not a character you can take seriously which is well... Problematic because he\'s the main character in a series which is intended to be taken seriously. This applies to all of the characters in this anime honestly speaking. This is worsened by the changes in both the order of events and their subtleties. Every character in this show looks like an incompetent, brain dead halfwit in this anime as a result of the changes made. The worst traits are enhanced whilst the better ones are removed entirely. The content added in only serves to make me hate characters which I would have otherwise been okay with.All of which only gets worse as the series goes on and decides to continue butcherring the characters.The music is pretty boring and forgettable for the most part. There are times where it doesn\'t quite fit what\'s happening but otherwise it\'s not worth mentioning. Same goes for the sound effects. I haven\'t paid much attention to either one as there have been far more glaring problems with everything else in this show.I wouldn\'t have watched it past the first episode if I didn\'t read the manga. I\'ll be celebrating it being over next week.Overall, I give it a 2. this thing didn\'t have budget but what makes this worse is how clearly this didn\'t have any effort put into it either. None of the movements feel well choreographed and everything is left stiff.The expressions on the character\'s faces are a little bit better but not by much. Their faces aren\'t deadpan entirely but the simple fact is that though they convey expression they\'re not exactly animated. Expressions change with as little effort as humanly possible. The movements aren\'t animated. When you\'re watching say someone respond with shock in Jujutsu Kaisen for instance in the first 20 seconds of the latest episode you have a couple of frames shifting the head back, raising the eyebrows, the shoulders raising slightly, the eyes widenning a little bit. The small shifts and changes all working together to be a little bit more expressive without being over the top. You don\'t have that here. It doesn\'t exist.Then again, it is 2020 and there does need to be some leniency for such things. With everything that\'s happened this year it\'s not hard to imagine how their work and their work ethic might be compromised. At the same time how badly this thing turned out is still disgraceful.Then there\'s the padding. Oh boy, the padding. Okay, so here\'s the thing. We spend the first five minutes after the opening in the first episode going through our protagonist\'s real life. The first minute and a half of which he spends saying nothing and just silently brooding. The first time he says anything at all is when he\'s playing video games in his appartment. For comparrison\'s sake, the first two and a half minutes of the anime aren\'t in the manga at all. Unless it\'s in the novel, which it could well be, then this was added in post production.As it stands, what takes three pages in the manga has now taken almost 5 minutes to see unfold. Then we have another 45 seconds thrown in just in him getting there instead of him fading out and finding himself there in a couple of seconds as they did in both the manga and literally two episodes later. These largely unneccessary additions are frequent throughout the entire series. That is ignoring the fact that when the animators have an excuse to make something take longer they tend to take it. The first quest lasts about 2 episodes, with each episode adapting the equivalent of about half a chapter of the manga. This is perhaps one of the more aggregious examples but comparing them and considerring the anime it\'s not an entirely uncommon thing. I\'d have been fine with these instances of padding if they didn\'t make the characters worse as a result.You see, Yotsuya looks a lot less competent in the anime than he does in the manga. He feels a lot less capable and has a lot more teenage angst in a sense. He\'s not a character you can take seriously which is well... Problematic because he\'s the main character in a series which is intended to be taken seriously. This applies to all of the characters in this anime honestly speaking.

The characters are dumped into a world with a goal and no other information. They must complete the goal within a time limit.Character wise, the selection is too varied. It\'s the closest I\'ve seen to an anime taking the personalities of real introverts and asking them to do heroic things. Interesting idea, poor execution. Well below average character intelligence (on par with 3 yo children). The main character is constantly being screwed over by the game mechanics and must find interesting ways of completing tasks basically alone, whilst carrying an increasing number of...useless liabilities (the other PCs) as the story progresses.The one positive I can talk about in the storytelling is how they handle the progression of time.I\'d suggest watching it when you run out of older series to watch and it\'s all that\'s left (as I am doing) useless liabilities (the other PCs) as the story progresses.The one positive I can talk about in the storytelling is how they handle the progression of time.I\'d suggest watching it when you run out of older series to watch and it\'s all that\'s left (as I am doing)', 'This one of the most plan isekai animes I ever watched in my time watching anime.

The only one I decently cared about was that one knight girl with orange hair. They tried to introduce the characters with plain out backstory without us trying to enjoy them.Another is that it felt like anything they did in the virtual world was straight garbage. Monsters were so bad!!! they...made goblins look so pathetic and not even good like in goblin slayer for example.

Not only this but the cast are not even terribly likeable, with a misanthropic and depressed MC explicitly valuing the lives of his two female comrades over his own and number four (another girl) being pretty contemptible as well as judgemental and useless.On the other hand all this leads to interesting interactions and actual character development, as the different characters get to see what their comrades are made of and sometimes surprise themselves.3) The characters are decidedly underpowered, rather than OP, with two of the three being out-of-action for most of the third 'quest' while the MC desperately tries not to die as he works out a way of beating a creature that clearly outclasses him.---Apart from this, yes the whole set-up is fairly generic on the surface, with 100-man taking the 'MC gets a raw deal' route rather than the 'MC is totally OP' option. There are classes, levelling-up, and since this is set up explicitly as a 'game' there is even a Game-Master handing out the quests. Except that he's a deliberately obtuse jerk and appears to be handing out all the crappy classes to inappropriate people and setting nearly impossible challenges.The difficulty of the quests is likely the reason for the title. The characters die and respawn a lot and while the experience and process is painless and game-ified as opposed to the heart-rending suffering of Subaru, it does create tension as a total-party-kill will apparently end in everyone's death; plus the characters are underpowered school-kids despite their designation as 'heroes' (one of the girls is classed as 'warrior' but can't even lift her longsword) and you can't simply respawn if your body is compromised e.g. by being in a troll's stomach or frozen solid by a blizzard.The production values are average, with the art style being run-of-the-mill, but the character interactions/development and potential for exploring serious questions about the genre made this well above average for me overall. itself and it has to have props for that alone.2) The cast are not all immediately friends or harem rivals, there is some tension present and only 1 supporting character gets really interested in the MC during the whole series.

It is a very confusing anime, it does not execute many things right. The theme of the anime is discovering who you are, or learning/having a deeper look into yourself. I will give a score for each element of the show along with my thoughts on it. Please keep in mind that if I write any spoilers I will put them between *\'s.Frist of all, the story. The story is honestly bad, or at least badly written. You know nothing about the world they get sent to, we don\'t know why they got sent there, we don\'t even truly...understand why they were chosen. On top of that, there is no end goal for us to look to, which makes the whole thing seem pointless. It feels like some sort of setup that would all make sense in later seasons, but it is so poorly executed that you are just left going with the flow without really learning anything, and gets more and more frustrating little by little. 2/10 for the story.The art is mediocre. It feels low budget and sort of like cutting edges where you can, which is understandable for a show in its first season and a studio that hasn\'t produced much work. It is not bad by any means, but it is also not good, let alone amazing or groundbreaking stuff. Overall, 5/10 for me.The soundtrack/music is a little worse than the art. It is also budget, and as mediocre as you can get. Nothing stands out, no ost really enhanced my experience of any scene, whether a serious, comic, or evil scene. The only reason I give it a little lower than art is because the only times I remember the ost vividly was when I thought ""what was that noise"" lol. That did not happen much, but the few times it did it took me out of the scene completely. 4/10.Finally, the characters. In a show where the story gives you nothing at all, those shows typically depend on the characters to keep the show alive. Sadly enough, the characters in this anime are also badly designed. First of all, every main character in every story should have some sort of defining characteristic or personality trait, a sort of ""backbone"" to the character. However, with the show\'s theme being what it is, we get to see Yuuskue discover himself with us. But that process is executed in a really bad and confusing way. You go several episodes in a row with Yuusuke displaying a certain persona, then go the next several episodes with him displaying the opposite persona, then you also have the episodes where he contradicts himself several times within that one episode. It leaves the viewer very confused as to his personality, because whenever he does an action he seems very sure of himself and with no hesitation, so you naturally assume that that is a part of his characteristics, only for him to flip around a few episodes later, and with no setup/lead up at all. You only get to learn about the main characteristic of him at the very end, which actually makes things a lot more understandable, and explains a lot and actually hits kinda hard. *(spoiler) This main characteristic is ""who am I?"", it is what makes up the persona of this character*. However, for 11 episodes before that, you are completely confused and lost. As for the others in the party, they are honestly pathetic attempts at characters. None of their backstories were compelling, they were either super generic or straight up delusional. On top of that none of them are decisive, useful, or important in any way. *Several times I saw them die and I never really felt anything for them at all*. Overall, I would rate the characters 3/10, and without that last bit explaining the main character, it would have honestly been a pathetic 1/10. Even with that last bit, I think it came too late.To sum up, this show has no real identity. It has no definitive mood. In most shows you see a certain mood, whether it is dark with some comic relief, or lovey-dovey with some serious moments and so on. However, this show has no one main mood, instead its equal parts several moods which leads to confusion and eventually frustration at the characters. It also has no world building, no character growth or development, and the relationship between the characters does not grow at all. The idea and theme behind the show are really interesting, but the execution is a confused mess that causes watchers to break their attention often or straight up get bored. The only thing that kept me going was seeing how the main character completely changes personality every few episodes, and that kept me interested enough to keep going to the end. It led to a relatively good ending  compared to the mess that is the show, but now that I am out of it, it feels like the whole show was badly executed, with A LOT of wrong choices made. understand why they were chosen.

An attempt at being deep and nuanced, and doing something new, but while the intention is commendable, the execution is shabby and boring. Almost clumsy.

The story was a actually mediocre, it was mixed up like you just dont know if its supposed to be comedy, dark, serious, light, or like a big joke. An isekai wherein you get transferred back and forth to the fantasy world and real world after completing a quest and...the time stops in the real world whenever the ""players"" or ""heroes"" get to go on quest and get to come back to the real world after they finish the quest. it was mixed isekai and virtual gaming cuz the rules are somewhat game-like but the fantasy world they get transferred to is real? its kinda confusing so if you dont get this i suggest you watch it so you can see it for yourself, but the point is the story and plot was jumbled like the writer cant decide between isekai and virtual reality/game so he mashed it up together. Another is the game master, he made demands but cant even answer normal questions and whats up with that look? Though i somehow enjoyed watching thats why i finished it in one sitting. I can commend on 1st, the music which i have commented earlier, and the male protagonist personality, it was great to see that he overcame his job/hero classification as a farmer then as chef to work in his advantage. Its nice to see tough protagonist with rebellious side which was backed up by a sob story. the time stops in the real world whenever the ""players"" or ""heroes"" get to go on quest and get to come back to the real world after they finish the quest. it was mixed isekai and virtual gaming cuz the rules are somewhat game-like but the fantasy world they get transferred to is real? its kinda confusing so if you dont get this i suggest you watch it so you can see it for yourself, but the point is the story and plot was jumbled like the writer cant decide between isekai and virtual reality/game so he mashed it up together.

I thought it was gonna sort of be like Sheild Hero in which this loner of a main character hated the real world and decided to make a living in this new world, not caring about his “companions” or saving the world he came from. But this was sadly not the case. Instead, it became a simple or sort of generic adventure anime. Even the MC’s main reason for hating the real world is bland and doesn’t really make that much of an emotional impact. It just came across that one...bad thing happened to him and he blew it out of proportion, taking it out on the world instead. There was a sort of moral issue near the end of the season and yet this still fell flat through the MC’s reaction, one that didn’t seem to fit the personality built throughout the episodes. Even the art style was sort of generic, sadly. Really, the only saving grace of this anime was one of the plot points, how the MC gets these seemingly useless roles instead of say warrior or wizard. They take these roles such as farmer and figure out a way to tweak it slightly to where he can actually stand a chance in a world full of monsters. All in all, this anime wasn’t bad but it also wasn’t all that good. It’s a nice middle ground, I suppose, if you’re just looking for something to watch. Who knows, if they make a second season, maybe it will be really great! bad thing happened to him and he blew it out of proportion, taking it out on the world instead.

However, there is more depth here than one might believe.The story is fairly interesting, but not at first. At first it feels bland and just like every other low budget isekai. Towards the end of the show the story actually takes an interesting turn. The first season ends strong, and I'm gonna watch the second season. Basically give it a fair chance and you might be surprised by it. Well maybe not surprised, nothing mind blowing happens, but it is much better than initial impressions might lead...one to believe. 8/10The art is just kind of eh... Not bad or offensive in any way, but not impressive in any capacity either. 6/10The sound is a little bit of a mixed bag. To be clear I watched the dub so your experience may be different with the sub. The voice acting is mostly good with the exception of a couple of characters. I won't go into it, but I found their voices to be slightly grating. Another issue is in some of the early episodes delivery is a little off, but that only happens in a couple of scenes. The ost was kind of generic with the occasional track that caught my attention. The intro and outro were good, but not great. 7/10The characters are the real meat of the show. They are actually interesting. 9/10... Just kidding there's more. I enjoy anime where the characters aren't one dimensional or flawless. This is an anime where, especially for the mc, that isn't the case. Characters don't have issues that magically vanish after a couple of episodes. Really the characters have unique and provocative points of view, which is extremely refreshing. Best part of the show by far 9/10My enjoyment was mixed throughout the show. The first few episodes held my attention, but I was only mildly entertained for a couple episodes after that. Then out of left field the show started getting interesting, and suddenly I was dreading the end of the season. The last couple episodes really got me into it, and I can't wait for season 2. Despite a couple of slow episodes 9/10Overall I would recommend this to people who like isekai. Also people who don't, but you need to have a decent attention span to get anything out of it. It's a hard anime to score because there are some flaws, but I really loved the last few episodes. So I'm gonna be a little more subjective here, partly because their are a lot of isekai that are similar in rating, but are way less interesting that this. 8/10 one to believe. 8/10The art is just kind of eh... Not bad or offensive in any way, but not impressive in any capacity either. 6/10The sound is a little bit of a mixed bag. To be clear I watched the dub so your experience may be different with the sub. The voice acting is mostly good with the exception of a couple of characters. I won't go into it, but I found their voices to be slightly grating. Another issue is in some of the early episodes delivery is a little off, but that only happens in a couple of scenes. The ost was kind of generic with the occasional track that caught my attention. The intro and outro were good, but not great. 7/10The characters are the real meat of the show. They are actually interesting. 9/10... Just kidding there's more. I enjoy anime where the characters aren't one dimensional or flawless.

Like the lack of character development so I see all the characters here are very weak and none are really strong.(Spoilers)3 women who are a burden and a man who is a bit strong but still noob. When I watched their action, I was really not blown away. Moreover, the oddity with changing skills in my opinion is not something good but unique in this story. And a master game design with a half head makes everything absurd.But the comedy element here is still there, but it's not too funny...either. The story is more focused on how they conquer the quest without failing at all so they don't die. And this story in my opinion looks relaxed, especially when it comes to girls, they really don't look like adventurers, their souls are still weak and too weak to fight the world. That's why the isekai and adventure genres are not felt here because their mentality is too weak.But overall, just enjoy it, but there are many shortcomings in my opinion.

I wanna support a bill (in the Japanese Parliament/Government) that benefits animators to not work under a very tight schedule & that they can bring their work tools out of the anime studio.

The pig tails girl with glasses started off as an annoying character for having taking the bullies side over the MC who rescued her from a ""incident"" but she ends up having character development and puts in an effort as well as is useful.

The MC is someone you can agree with while also agreeing with, up until the last episode where he says somethings that had me thinking ""Wait, nooo, now hold on, no"" and also thinking ""oh boy he is going to *** isn\'t he"" it keeps you thinking that something is going to happen, followed by another thing and it adds a little suspense which makes you look forward to the next season.

I do see some potential for decency as they expand on the world itself, but honestly with how sub-par the characters themselves are I wouldn\'t bet on it improving that much.The show started out okay imo, but the more they tried to do exposition on the characters the more I disliked it. They try to give backstories to evoke sympathy towards the characters, and give reason to their quirks or shitty choices,...but all of it falls flat. Pretty much everyone is irritating and incredibly useless throughout the show, with only the mc doing anything of worth aside from one moment of legitimate usefulness from one of the main crew. To me the MC is the most palatable of the main cast, but he flip flops back and forth between cheery and psychopathic in his reasonings; and nothing in his backstory (so far) has shown any sort of legitimate reason for his hatred of Tokyo and people.The world it\'s set in is so-so. Them going back and forth between worlds is interesting, and the potential of seeing what events led to such vast differences between the two worlds makes the possibility of the story going forwards being a bit better. All that said, it\'s still not that good.The story itself...well there really isn\'t that much story outside of what the alternate world is and how it relates to the ""real"" world.

The character designs feel disjointed and fail to fully capture the emotions and personalities of the characters. The animation is also underwhelming, lacking the fluidity and energy that one would expect from a top-notch anime production.While the concept of a virtual reality game where players must complete missions to logout is interesting, the execution falls short. The characters don\'t seem to have a strong connection to each other, and their motivations are often unclear. This lack of depth detracts from the...overall experience and makes it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the story.In conclusion, while ""Standing on the Shoulders of Million Lives"" has its merits, the lackluster art and animation ultimately bring the series down.

Because there are so many different titles offered, we witness the bold attempts of others trying to adapt the genre to make something different and unique. Although it is a commendable sentiment it does not always work and sometimes instead of standing out for the right reasons it becomes more of an eyesore.That being said, let\'s get to the actual review,Narrative: I can\'t really talk much about it because there really isn\'t one, not only did the story lack inspiration but the general scope of...it made no sense. Perhaps I didn\'t catch it while watching the series but it felt like individuals were plucked at random to conduct an experiment of sorts. It is never explained or given any form of meaning apart from being thrown into an isekai/game-like reality which is what\'s troubling. The caveat, however, is your typical permadeath nonsense within the virtual system. Even after such a lacklustre world-building, it goes into the psych! route and tries to bamboozle the audience and the characters within the series. (I guess, the author really wanted some form of twist to keep the audience engaged but because it was so nonsensical I really have no comments it was just bad.) [TLDR: There isn\'t an actual narrative]However, there are good points in the anime and these 2 factors are the only good thing about it and I am referring to the art and music.  (Well, that is if you\'re able to get through the first 5 episode threshold, I kid you not, the animations felt like they lost their budget during production. During the series, you will witness event logs and these are not animate you will be introduced to a picture drama or visual novel like setting which is kinda unique, I guess? But it didn\'t work for me, there was also a scene that made my eyes hurt because of how funky the animation was. [But the music will most likely grow on you if you watch it till the end.]On to characters: The series tries really hard to build an edgelord that suffers from a personality disorder, and not surprising the guy is practically the only useful person in the series. Not your average comedy? No problem, the way some of the main characters behave will make you believe that the drama is really there just for the sake of it. You will barely feel any form of worry of intensity from the action scenes because respawning is a thing ""just like a game"" and typically characters grow from some form of a traumatic incident, then they grow and become a better version of themselves. That is not the case for this anime, you will barely see any growth, in fact, you will start feeling sorry for the edgelord and start agreeing with his point of view, not saying that I do but it is kinda justified. As the party grows so does the burden one has to carry, imagine an NPC having more flavour than the main cast, OUCH. We have a few cliche types of personalities that do nothing but complain, literally freeload off the party and \'stir shit up\' I could go on but really some characters grow just to see a degression which is quite disappointing. The main problem is, trying to adapt the cast as being \'normal\' within a functioning society whilst being in a life or death virtual reality it feels paradoxical but really it is just trying to seem more intelligent than it really is. And honestly, edgy character work in some settings because the narrative made sense, you have characters here that perform ironically stating stuff like \'reading the room to survive\' and yet doesn\'t perform in that line of logic and because of that, the party gets thrown into another mess. Apart from multiple delusions and a bunch of rip-offs here and there, the characters are nothing but bland and in most cases irritating.Needless to say, I didn\'t really enjoy watching this title and I could not derive any form of depth from it because of its terrible character development and world-building. The potential was there but it just couldn\'t progress beyond being a generic isekai.Also, I would like to add, the direction of 100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru was rather interesting but it didn\'t work and that is because it tried to blend an isekai\'s reality with that of a normal-world reality. Anime is anime I get it, and even the best titles struggle with getting it right because when done right it works and suddenly that is the best thing people has ever seen. But when it fails, it is so jarring that it is painful. (Perhaps this would\'ve been something amazing had the direction been different.) it made no sense. Perhaps I didn\'t catch it while watching the series but it felt like individuals were plucked at random to conduct an experiment of sorts. It is never explained or given any form of meaning apart from being thrown into an isekai/game-like reality which is what\'s troubling. The caveat, however, is your typical permadeath nonsense within the virtual system. Even after such a lacklustre world-building, it goes into the psych! route and tries to bamboozle the audience and the characters within the series. (I guess, the author really wanted some form of twist to keep the audience engaged but because it was so nonsensical I really have no comments it was just bad.) [TLDR: There isn\'t an actual narrative]However, there are good points in the anime and these 2 factors are the only good thing about it and I am referring to the art and music.  (Well, that is if you\'re able to get through the first 5 episode threshold, I kid you not, the animations felt like they lost their budget during production. During the series, you will witness event logs and these are not animate you will be introduced to a picture drama or visual novel like setting which is kinda unique, I guess? But it didn\'t work for me, there was also a scene that made my eyes hurt because of how funky the animation was. [But the music will most likely grow on you if you watch it till the end.]On to characters: The series tries really hard to build an edgelord that suffers from a personality disorder, and not surprising the guy is practically the only useful person in the series. Not your average comedy? No problem, the way some of the main characters behave will make you believe that the drama is really there just for the sake of it. You will barely feel any form of worry of intensity from the action scenes because respawning is a thing ""just like a game"" and typically characters grow from some form of a traumatic incident, then they grow and become a better version of themselves. That is not the case for this anime, you will barely see any growth, in fact, you will start feeling sorry for the edgelord and start agreeing with his point of view, not saying that I do but it is kinda justified. As the party grows so does the burden one has to carry, imagine an NPC having more flavour than the main cast, OUCH. We have a few cliche types of personalities that do nothing but complain, literally freeload off the party and \'stir shit up\' I could go on but really some characters grow just to see a degression which is quite disappointing.

There is only about 6 episodes worth of animation and the rest is all flashbacks, sometimes even flashbacks of the same episode.

However, he is also shown to be deeply caring of others and desiring recognition from his female companions.This effectively makes...him the author's philosophic hail mary to fix any contrived piece of narrative.If the protagonist was either more evil and sociopathic or truly a heart of gold antihero the story lens would work better.TL;DR Watch for the world building and concepts.

Doing all this does not make them OP, this is just the barely minimum to survive.Since the passage of time in that world is different, every time the characters...goes back to earth and get isekaid again, they can see that the npc they met have aged (or even die), they can meet their decendants, and see the long term ramifications of their actions during their previous visit goes back to earth and get isekaid again, they can see that the npc they met have aged (or even die), they can meet their decendants, and see the long term ramifications of their actions during their previous visit', ""I started giving isekais a chance, this is the second one I'm watching! if the review is bad, forgive me, it's my first time 😵the anime as a whole gave me a good laugh, there were a few hours that it was impossible not to become joker and I was bordering on the insanity of committing 98 crimes.I ignored a lot of those typical obligatory isekai moments and found it nice to watch.the story is ok, I liked the plot that was having to scare them but like... out of nowhere I saw the birth of a Light 2.0 in this protagonist... and I was...nahhhh 😬✌️.6 is the perfect grade for this anime, he didn't deliver much but he didn't deliver anything either, he delivered what he promised. nahhhh 😬✌️.6 is the perfect grade for this anime, he didn't deliver much but he didn't deliver anything either, he delivered what he promised."", 'BINGEABLE!!!

It does well enough to get you to stick with it for a couple episodes to force you to just finish it. But it's just not that enjoyable. What starts out as a unique concept, where slowly the squad is formed as we progress and not all isekai'd at once, falls flat after we get our fourth member. We just begin to do mundane quests, accept dying since they respawn after a short period of time, have so sexual tension that nobody cares about, and this shallow dilemma...about killing there. There's a funny re-roll of roles for each person after they level up, with our MC always getting random ones. But even that wears off after the first or second wheel spin.

Suprised I kept watching tho cause fuck, I wasn't able to stay with one show at the time and I actually finished it but yea. I don't watch isekai much tho because shows like these repeating a similar storyline somewhere out there. The characters were mediocre. The main character had issues like every other. Nothing special but nothing to make me hate it.

The premise was clichéd in many ways and I almost didn't bother watching it because it seemed like just another trash Isekai that comes out every season. What convinced me to watch it was the unique spin where they split time between the real world and the other magic one. Coupled with the fact that they touted the protagonist as a messed up guy who is willing to sacrifice his friends without a second thought, I decided I would give the show a shot. I didn't have...my hopes too high, but I was still very disappointed.Firstly, the animation was extremely poor. If an anime has a good story and compelling characters, I can usually overlook the quality of the animation but unfortunately, this show has neither one. The movements of the characters were atrocious and the style was extremely forgettable. A lot of the backgrounds were super empty and boring. The protagonist actually looks like an NPC villager. I honestly don't even remember his name and I finished watching the anime a couple of hours ago. The CGI was even worse and I feel like they didn't even need to use it much of the time. The game master hardly even moves, why didn't they just animate him normally? I remember in the last episode they used it for a car that never even budged an inch the entire episode. It's so random.The characters were robotic and boring. Other than a few scattered moments here and there, there were no good dialogue or character building. The only one who was semi-interesting was the protag. I wish they would have gone in harder with his personality instead of just the occasional weird villain monologue. The romance was almost non-existent, thank god, this show would make a terrible harem. The side characters were beyond forgettable and sometimes downright stupid. Glasses girl was the worst by far in this respect. She was extremely irritating.The story was intriguing but didn't really deliver. There was enough mystery to keep me watching, I wish they had given more time to the non-fantasy world though. I think it would be interesting to see more character development or consequences of their experiences in the other world. They kind of delivered on this in the last episode which was probably the best one, but I don't think it makes up for all the squandered potential in the previous episodes. They tried to tackle death in a meaningful way in some of the episodes but it felt very unearned for me. I don't feel like the protagonist has a right to feel bad about any of this stuff, he's the one who just assumed things. I will not be counting on this show to try and go into mental health issues correctly.I'm not sure why, but I will probably watch season 2. I feel like there is a chance it could get better if it just improved its writing. And I am somewhat interested in where the plot will go and the overlaying mystery of the game master. That is not to say that I recommend it though, I don't even think this is worth a hate-watch, it's not quite bad enough for that. my hopes too high, but I was still very disappointed.Firstly, the animation was extremely poor.

F-Zero: Falcon Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3101/F-Zero__Falcon_Densetsu,"[""If your not very sure what F-Zero is let me fill you in since the synopsis doesn't really explain much. F-Zero is one of the first futuristic racing games produced by Nintendo EAD and is a good seller amongst their franchises. You may have heard of the franchises main character Capt. Falcon appearing more popularly in the Super Smash Brothers Series with his signature Falcon Punch. Its funny because the Falcon Punch wasn't really a thing until this anime came out and was then spread by the Smash Bros Series. This was a damn good anime for its time and I am surprised barely anyone...has actually seen it.Story 9/10The story is really deep and really focuses on explaining the F-Zero Universe. Most of the early episodes are somewhat filler as it usually follows a line of introduce one of the games racers and stimulate a plot based around that character. While most people don't enjoy filler episodes like this I actually found them to be quite enjoyable and learned quite a bit about the series in general. The episodes later on start really developing the story around the Mobile Task Force and Dark Million which had lots of tension. Not sure if any of it replicates any of the games storyline since its been a while since I played but damn is it good at providing a core plot and sticking to it and you can just see its evolution and its quite fascinating. I also found it quite interesting when they made references to like Capcom and Star Fox. They really have their way with pleasing Nintendo Fans.Art 8/10For an anime that released in 2003 it had really great animation and style and quite enjoyed the F-Zero machines and designs. It really makes them more recognizable now however I felt the anime's art may have been a tad to dark at some points. I felt like I could really see what was actually going on but other than that it was great.Sound 10/10What I really enjoyed was the fact they included big themes from the game into the anime like Big Blue Theme and Mute City. I really felt a rush of nostalgia hearing them in this anime. Also the OP and ED were fantastic additions well. They are  pretty recognizable and fit well into this animes style.Character 10/10They did an excellent job of portraying characters from the games series. Not only was our main character development amazing I really enjoyed the supporting/minor characters that made appearances in the anime. It helps the show really explain F-Zero as a whole. They even took another measure and evaluated the one character you came to see and thats Capt. Falcon. Most people expected the most baddest character from him just Falcon Punching everything in sight. Well, instead they made him mysterious. For the first few episodes they make sure you wanna keep watching just to see Capt. Falcon more and more. I really do believe he had the strongest role even though he had less appearance than most of the Mobile Task Force. Truthfully its worth watching just for Capt. Falcon and his story.Overall 9/10Putting it on to terms, this anime was probably meant for those F-Zero and Nintendo Fans out there wanting to view more about Capt. Falcon. Yeah, half of it is filler of the actual games it still can be good to watch and expand your horizon on the games. If you don't really care for F-Zero at all you will probably not enjoy this at all because it moves rather slow in the beginning. However, if you were just looking for something intense to watch don't overlook this for something newer/well known. It still poses a great act for story and action in general and you won't be displeased with it all. has actually seen it.Story 9/10The story is really deep and really focuses on explaining the F-Zero Universe.

The minimalist storytelling, yet heavy symbolism of Shadow of the Colossus, which says so little in dialogue, yet evokes so much emotion. The knee slapping satire of the first Bioshock against Randian Objectivism. The astounding amount of lore, world building, and background that went into the Elder Scrolls games, or Mass Effect. The lovable characters, excellent action, and vibrant imagination of the Final Fantasy games (well some of them). Then there is F-Zero. It was a decent racing game on the SNES.

This anime is also brought to us by 4kids Entertainment, so you can just guess what kind of QUALITY voice acting and brilliant Westernization you can look forward to.Here is the question you are probably asking: ""Why did I rate this as high as a 3?""

In anime, you have Captain Falcon leaping out of a car traveling at light speed, screaming FARUKAN PANCHU, and punching a cheesy looking villain so fucking hard that it destroys a large portion of the God damned GALAXY!

In classical music you have examples like the final segment of Tchaikovsky\'s 1812 overture, The fourth movement of Beethoven\'s 9th Symphony, the beginning of Act 3 of Wagner\'s opera Die Walkure. In anime, you have Captain Falcon leaping out of a car traveling at light speed, screaming FARUKAN PANCHU, and punching a cheesy looking villain so fucking hard that it destroys a large portion of the God damned GALAXY! Absolutely brilliant. A single tear of pure joy slid down my cheek while taking in such a magnanimous segment of animated glory!', ""F-Zero GP Legends known from its awesome game franchise on the various Nintendo platforms and also fairly known for the Falcon Punch by Captain Falcon!This anime series sure took me by surprise and on first looks it might not give you any wow effect when you just start the anime but the real action and story starts to develop right in the middle of the story which already starts to buildup development towards the last episode.The story takes such a turn in quality from start till end that this anime certainly is worth a try even if you have to search wide and for...for subs or even watch the raws but I can tell you it is totally worth it! Heck this anime even made me play the old games again!The story itself is fairly decent, a slow but quite decent build up together with various different ways like: racing,  action and even slight romance development.What I personally also enjoyed is that there weren't that much side stories and only one recap episode near the ending of the series so it's a fairly amount of good story and character development combined with futuristic racing!The art is a bit old but for the time it was created in combination with the CGI it is still pretty decent. The combination of the 3D models and 2D art of their vehicles is pretty well done! It's a bit getting used to in the beginning but when you're enjoying the racers it will only get better later on!The quality of the sound is a bit on the lower side as the dub wasn't always the best quality nor were the sound effects, although the casting for the Japanese dub was actually quite good especially for Black Shadow which was voiced by Wakamoto NorioThe Characters were quite unique and do follow the games character concepts quite good. The best characters in this are of course Captain Falcon, Ryu and Black Shadow as they're mainly the lead characters and more or less determine the whole story!I quite enjoyed watching this anime especially the last couple episodes where the quality really increased with really interesting story development and pacing! So all in all a pretty good anime which I'll give a solid 8/10 for subs or even watch the raws but I can tell you it is totally worth it! Heck this anime even made me play the old games again!The story itself is fairly decent, a slow but quite decent build up together with various different ways like: racing,  action and even slight romance development.What I personally also enjoyed is that there weren't that much side stories and only one recap episode near the ending of the series so it's a fairly amount of good story and character development combined with futuristic racing!The art is a bit old but for the time it was created in combination with the CGI it is still pretty decent.

So all in all a pretty good anime which I'll give a solid 8/10"", ""Let me be clear, I am a hardcore F-Zero fan. This anime is loosely based on the CHARACTERS of F-Zero instead of the story of F-Zero. Why? Because F-Zero never really had a plot. It took the series 13 years to give the characters back story. And what a back story they got. From superheros to supervillians, bounty hunters to intergalactic fed-ex employees to a disgruntled ex taxi driver using his cab as a racer. given these new intensive backstories, combined with the hardcore action and raw speed of the games, an F-Zero anime sounded like a great...idea.Where F-Zero GP Legend falls flat the most is story and the characters  in the anime. Ryu/Rick seems to have a pretty bad case of the Gary Stu syndrome early on, until you realize that he is useless. In fact, most of the characters are useless except for Captain Falcon. Jack Levin, a pop idol and member of a secret police force dedicated to shutting down the activities of several supervillians at all costs, gets his car jacked by some nobody that repaints it pink with flowers and enters the F-Zero race RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SECRET POLICE FORCE, WHO KNOW THAT THE CAR IS LEVIN'S. What do they do? They confront her before the race, she doesn't care, races, loses the race, gets cornered, and escapes, leaving the car behind. Most if not all the non-human racers form the games are reduced to petty goons regardless of backstory. all the characters seem about as deep as a puddle 3 sunny days after a storm.This anime should have had a strong point in action and animation due to the natural sense of speed the games offered, but the mediocre animation never allows the pace anything faster than a brisk walk. Once, Ryu/Rick completely screws the pooch, and rolls his craft at MACH 2. Instead of the fiery crash I was expecting, the Dragon Bird sort of bounced upside down for a little bit and slid to a stop after cutting several times to an interior shot of a constipated looking Ryu/Rick. The sum total of the damage was a scratch that may or may not have been there.I enjoyed this anime up until episode 17 or so, when the hilariously Engrish fansub I was watching suddenly became entirely incomprehensible so I switched to an English dub. This was a mistake. The dub I had chosen was the Stonestream dub, a fan made dub of ear-sodomy. after switching back to a sub that was of much better quality, I soon found the only source of  enjoyment was gone and I was forced to find another. I found this in the BGM. Compared to the rest of the anime, the BGM is a tasteful well done re-imagining of the source material. The original tunes from the games are remixed slightly. I recognized Fire Field, Mute City, Big Blue, and a few others. but these are really not enough since the rest of the SFX sounds laughably generic.Overall, I really wanted this anime to be good, but it just isn't. I was so much better at F-Zero than making friends growing up. I was excited when I heard of this anime. but instead of the tasteful tribute of a beloved childhood friend, I got a gibbering oaf doing a puppet show with crayoned in cardboard cutouts. idea.Where F-Zero GP Legend falls flat the most is story and the characters  in the anime.

The main parts of the anime do a good job from beginning to end. The cool parts happen and gives the fans what they want. I like how they handled and i find it odd that they gave Super Arrow a lot of attention through out the series. I really like the characters designs in the anime and i think that was a really good...art direction to take for these characters. All characters dont feel flat and its thoughtful that they try to use as many characters from the game.

Final Approach,https://myanimelist.net/anime/119/Final_Approach,"['Either bashing my cranium against a solid, brick wall because the main character, Ryo Mizuhara, is ceaselessly making stubborn and defiant choices -even though he is completely aware of hurting his fiancée\'s feelings- or because his fiancée, Shizuka Masuda, is almost annoyingly hell-bent on receiving affection from someone who obviously does not care, I\'ll have to admit that (most-importantly) my head seems to be in relatively good shape, despite a solid beating(s). And since my skull-bashing proved to be ineffective time-after-time, I could actually sit and enjoy some of the finer moments that Final Approach had to offer.Yes, it has the long-running and omnipresent anime...cliché of ""making horrible, dumb decisions in a relationship,"" almost to the point where all of us in real life actually start feeling better about our relationships.Yes, I\'ve already said it, but they really did make ""horrible, dumb decisions in a relationship.""Regardless, I (somehow?) still had a little sympathy for our destined pair. Maybe it was that pitiful? Maybe I\'m starting to get weak? Maybe it should not have taken 10 or so episodes for them to realize their callow mistakes? Who knows...But even so, being trapped within a torrential vortex of ""stupidity"" still brought a tear in my eye (I\'ll have to admit, painfully) and made me laugh like the little schoolgirl I most probably am.But hey! Final Approach was intended as a mixture of comedy and romance, and it certainly lived up to those expectations.The cast of characters: simply hilarious. Maybe I, in fact, enjoyed the head-bashing (masochist?). Even so, it was practically random, unprecedented fun which stemmed into bouts of laughter.There was no telling what would happen next between the zany characters, and that is simply what separated this ""typical"" romance anime from the rest, but not enough to noticeably distinct itself and turn into something absolutely amazing. cliché of ""making horrible, dumb decisions in a relationship,"" almost to the point where all of us in real life actually start feeling better about our relationships.Yes, I\'ve already said it, but they really did make ""horrible, dumb decisions in a relationship.""Regardless, I (somehow?) still had a little sympathy for our destined pair.

Not only does it strangle the viewer with absurd, illogical plotlines and unexplainable (and oftentimes incomprehensible) conclusions to cap 10 minute long episodes, but the characters can go from annoying to lovable in 0 to 60 without breaking a sweat.The story is supposed to be about a guy, Ryo, who is forced to marry this girl, Shizuka, because of a government program meant to up the childbirth rate. But the anime completely abandons that premise half-way through in favor of some kind of twisted love triangle between Ryo, Shizuka...and Emiho (who is truly this anime&rsquo;s saving grace.) that makes no sense and refuses to lean one way or the other.Now I will admit the story does have some interesting twists and surprises in a few of the episodes, originality that I would have thought was impossible for a series that basically spans a grand total of 130 minutes of viewing time. However, the bad often times far outweighs the good. It&rsquo;s unrealistic on every level and Shizuka is half the time, the most annoying character I&rsquo;ve possible ever watched. Her cheerful ignorance and gung-ho even in the face of obvious lack of interest from Ryo really started to piss me off after a while. For a little icing on the cake, the anime takes a few turns at tearful emotion at such terribly inopportune times that are so laughable that I actually DID cry!So watching this, I realized that the difference between my watching and then forgetting this anime completely in a year or regarding this as one of the worst anime I&rsquo;d ever seen all hung on the ending. If they did what I thought they were going to do, it was going to be the latter and I was going to have to throw my computer out the window so I could somehow be satisfied with not getting the opportunity to personally hitting Shizuka in the face. So what was the result? Well, let&rsquo;s just say the review you&rsquo;re reading right now was written on a brand new computer.However, the worst part about this anime is that midway through, it hinted at something that&rsquo;s possibly good. They just barely touch on something I could really get into and I was happy for maybe 20 seconds and then they took the final 6 episodes or so to crush me into oblivion while I was watching. THEN, the makers of this anime had the audacity to shove the fact that they squashed that mid-point possibility by reminding me of it in the 13th &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; episode.This is by far the biggest waste of time in my life and I thank God that it was so short. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this trash and stick to a good romantic comedy&hellip; or even go with more sanitary garbage.

It&rsquo;s better than this curse on humanity.', ""Final Approach is a romantic comedy with a total runtime of 2.6 hours (13 episodes X 12 minutes each). I can understand why the anime is short because it would make little sense for it to be any longer since the story and events of this show are quite simple. Although this is not the best anime out there, I have to say that it is not bad at all. It really depends on the audience. I am not really into the whole romantic comedy genre but I do not detest it either. I think this is one of the reasons why I liked this...show. If you hate romantic comedy, then I suggest you run a mile from this anime. Anyway, here goes my review:Story: 6/10Read the synopsis.Art: 7/10The art was generally good and suitable for this sort of genre. The way I understand art in the context of anime is based on it's suitability for the theme. Because this is a romantic comedy, it would be stupid to have buff looking characters with 28 inch biceps dressed in dbz outfits. The characters were drawn pretty well to reflect normal high schoolers and the general art was a well done job which reflected a normal high school and home environment.Sound: 6/10I cannot re-call the music being spectacular for this anime. I must confess that it has been a while since I watched this show so I am not completely sure. Having said that, when I usually find the music to be absolutely splendid for a given anime, it sticks in my mind. I cannot remember the music sticking in my mind so my conclusion is that it was not all that great.Character: 7/10The characters were perhaps the strongest element of the show. I found the relationship and chemistry between Ryo and Shizuka quite entertaining and hilarious. There were some really funny moments. Perhaps the weak aspect of the anime was that the characters did not really develop with time but were rather static in how they behaved. Nevertheless, they did a good job with the characters.Enjoyment: 7/10I completed this show on the same day because it is not very long and I must say that I found it enjoyable. I was tucked in bed with my laptop and I can remember clicking on the next episode button every time the previous episode finished. Since each episode is only 12 minutes, it was a unique experience for me. As a comedy, I think this anime is good and I am sure it will have you laughing.Overall: 7/10I recommend Final Approach to people who 1) enjoy watching comedy and 2) do not detest romantic themes. I do not want to compare this to other anime that I like because the genres are completely different. I feel that Final Approach has its own place, where it sits as a funny, light and entertaining anime worth watching. show. If you hate romantic comedy, then I suggest you run a mile from this anime.

For those who would like to make a review for this series, pls watch all the episodes first before doing so.[Story]: The story, I admit, seemed uninteresting at first, but got better and better as the story progressed. It got my interest, probably because of of its comedy-romance genre mix-up.[Art]: What more can I say? The anime character art that I've always loved. How they mixed the typical anime characters with chibis versions was very interesting. That really gave the series a great comedy twist...[Sound]: The...sounds in this anime (opening, ending, and insert songs, the seiyuus) got my attention, especially the insert songs. To how they chose the songs and how to place and insert them in certain scenes was very astounding... I don't know how they did that, but they really did a great job. Also, the seiyuus really gave life to their respective characters.[Character]: Character plots and personalities made this anime quite fun to watch. All of the characters had their own unique traits and personalities that (surprisingly) complemented each other. The most noticeable personality would be the ultimate &quot;sibling love&quot; of the main character towards his sister (ooops! Almost made a spoiler there... ^_^), but IT'S NOT INCEST...[Enjoyment]: Throughout the series, the development of the story and the situations of the characters made me &quot;long for more&quot; (want to watch the next episode right away).For an overall rating, I'm giving it a 9.

Yes, it's another release from Jumonji-Giri. They've been around re-encoding old series,those that aired when .mkv format was not so widespread, and widescreen broadcast was uncommon. After a quick look on AniDB, I downloaded this series. FYI, this time too, J-G peer swarms were small, and up/down speed was so low, around 8 kBps.StoryThis kind of theme has been recycled again and again for romantic comedy (particularly harem, and ecchi) anime. Although there's not much similarity between them, I am tempted to compare FA to Daa! Daa! Daa! (UFO Baby). No... no... don't ask me anything if you...feel this comparison is not really relevant. I just feel like it.On both anime, the hero and heroine live together like a newly wed couple, with less intensity in FA, for there is another girl with close age too. There, the driving force for this whole series are Shizuka's naivety and our hero's coldness. Many incidents here and there, could only count as really standard slapstick jokes. Each episode just passed away, with few laughters (sometimes rather forced ones) and went by, hardly leaving any traces in my mind.Several story elements' in FA also made me drop huge sweat from my chin. Those 'Agent Smith(s)', really freaked me out, feels like I'm seeing artificially bred and cloned human beings. I don't wanna think that they're cloned from Shizuka's DNA, for it's too gross. The arranged marriage, and a girl soliciting herself to a boy she never knows. It makes me feel really sorry for Shizuka. Really gross plot, I think.To sum it up, FA has many things any average (or better) romance anime offers, but it fails to deliver them well.ArtI'm not really familiar with romance anime art from that era (the time when this anime was aired, I have no access to any anime except those that were aired in local TVs). I could scarcely remember School Days or Daa!3x tho, and I could confidently say, the art is not superior compared to those latter two. The hero was poorly designed, his shoulder being too wide and his eyes too sharp, as if he was from an average beat-em-up' action anime. The girls were not particularly interesting, too.SoundNot really paying much attention. Not much special, but the insert song for the last episode (is it the same song as the OP Theme?) is quite good.CharacterNot much to say. Average characters, you'll most likely meet characters like those in FA in other countless titles you've watched, and other countless series to come.FYI, although she's not appealing enough to be admitted to my anime harem, I never refuse a girl like Shizuka, and Emiho's sanguine friend is interesting too (I always like that kind of voice character).EnjoymentAt least, worth for spending your free time.OverallRight now, out of about 400GB storage space (I'm poor, huh?), I'm considering freeing up more.

The length is short enough without dragging on like many romantic-""comedy"" series.It\'s a basic premise - a girl drops in from the sky (literally), and introduces herself as our main character\'s fiancee. This is where the response is markedly different from others - he gives a very definite no, instead of reacting in consternation or thinking he\'s never seen such a cute girl, or allowing himself to be walked all over.That said, he isn\'t the best of characters personality-wise, but isn\'t a polite wimp either.Several things stood out:- No jealous childhood friend-...No pre-pubescent girls- Our main character isn\'t starved for female attentionOverall, I\'d recommend this to someone who wants to watch a romantic comedy without the usual cliches.

The only reason these episodes have to exist is to provide fanservice, plain and simple. That said, are they good? Well, let's hope on and find out, shall we?StoryThere is no story! There are only random circumstances that place girls in uncomfortable situations just so that Akatsuki can take advantage of it and touch some breasts. Fanservice at its finest. At least the anime is self-aware enough to comment on the absurdity of these situations, but self-awareness is no excuse for mediocrity. (5/10)CharactersAkatsuki is still a first-class pervert and the girls...are his unfortunate victims. If there is a chance for fanservice, our Rogue Hero will take it, no questions asked.

I certainly prefer Felecia Angelle. On the other hand, I think Kana Hanazawa is a better fit for Kuzuha than Monica Rial, even if she is a bit more straight-faced than her peers. It feels refreshing to listen to Marina Inoue as the proud and haughty Haruka, the best character in the show, in my opinion, even if she is not given much to work with.

"Gyakuten Saiban: Sono ""Shinjitsu"", Igi Ari!",https://myanimelist.net/anime/31630/Gyakuten_Saiban__Sono_Shinjitsu_Igi_Ari,"['Ace Attorney, alongside Pokemon and JJBA, is one of my absolute favourite media franchises. I have spent countless hours playing the games over and over, producing fanworks, and discussing them at essay-length. So, as much as I appreciate the need to be objective and focused in my review, I feel that it needs to be said:I hate this anime. I hate it so fucking much.Sono ""Shinjitsu"" Igi Ari is an adaptation of the first two games in the series, and right off the bat we\'ve hit a huge stumbling block. Each of these two games would be more fit to a full 24 episode anime...in their own right than being crammed into one cour each. Unsurprisingly, a lot of content was trimmed in the process of fitting both games, and what content survived the cull is rushed through at breakneck pace.The dialogue is cut down the most, and being that the source material uses mostly text-based storytelling this is a huge blow. Losing so much dialogue not only robs the series of much of its charm, but also does serious damage to its characterisation. Phoenix in particular is characterised mostly through his constant snarky, quipping inner monologue, which is almost entirely absent here.We barely get to know most of the characters, making it difficult to be invested in their character arcs - and that\'s just the ones whose arcs were actually shown in the anime instead of being skimmed over. Many characters are stripped down to the barest of plot relevance, and others are reduced to nothing more than a cameo appearance.The bread and butter of Ace Attorney is its contradictions, the solving of which drives the murder mystery plots the series revolves around. Even these are changed, however, in the name of this streamlined approach. Twists are replaced with simplified, obvious alternatives that not only remove the satisfaction of seeing the more obtuse mysteries cracked, but also make you question the logic of everyone responsible for presenting these flawed arguments in the first place, making it much harder to take the prosecutors seriously as competent opponents.The trimmed-down dialogue also cuts key context on evidence used throughout the series. One of the most important principles of good detective fiction is that all clues used to solve the mystery should be clearly shown - that the audience should have all the necessary tools to solve the mystery themselves. While the games did this by sheer necessity of the medium, the anime makes no such effort, making the resolutions often feel cheap and unearned.This pacing severely damages the presentation of the anime, sacrificing any attempt to preserve the dramatic tension of the games - most contradictions are resolved almost as soon as they come up. And even outside of issues caused by the pacing, the presentation suffers. The quality of the art and animation here is appalling. The errors are constant and glaring. The animation is often comically sloppy. The character designs also stray from the original designs to their detriment, going with an oddly wide-faced look that gives the characters strange facial proportions. Also, they can never quite seem to get Phoenix\'s hair-spikes right, with them changing shape every time we see them. There is also an excessive overuse of CG animation to cut corners, most obviously in the CG court gallery that has, for whatever reason, been made so much more visible than it was in the source material, as if deliberately trying to highlight how poor the animation is.The effects used for dramatic emphasis are cheesy, and adapt the tone of the games poorly - the more abstract effects of the source are replaced with literal auras and dramatic gusts of wind.The voice cast is similarly poor, featuring many miscast or noticably inexperienced actors. The entire cast seems to either underact or overact with little middle ground. The only notable exception is Yuuki Aoi as Maya Fey, who seems intent on stealing every scene she is in.The anime handles Maya well in general, especially in comparison to its treatment of many other characters. Not only is her character arc left more or less intact, but the animators emphasise her goofy and hyperactive nature far better than a set of 14 sprites ever could.On the subject of things the anime did well, most of the anime-original content is quite good. Ignoring whatever logic lead A-1 to add anime-original content whilst also cutting game-canon content, the additional focus on Phoenix, Edgeworth, and Larry\'s shared backstory, and adding the Signal Samurai motif that represents their friendship (as well as giving some background to Edgeworth\'s secret love of Super Sentai series) enriches the dynamic these characters have.The cuts made do sometimes work to the series\' benefit, too. Turnabout Big Top, which is considered by many to be the worst case in the franchise (which it isn\'t, by the way - fight me nerds) benefits from reduced screentime on some of its more irritating supporting characters, such as Trilo Quist, or that fucking clown. There does seem to be a rule of inverse quality in this adaptation, though - the worst cases are the ones handled the best, whereas the cases that were the series highlight in the source suffer the most from these alterations.It\'s hard to say what the point of this anime is. It was made by A-1\'s b-team (now CloverWorks, a seperate studio) with little care or attention put into it. At worst, this was a shoddy adaptation by a studio looking to make a quick buck. At best, this was a misguided attempt to adapt a great series by people who have a fundamental lack of understanding of what made these games so good in the first place.One way or another, this is an awful adaptation that should only be watched by people who are already fans of the series, and are more interested in seeing another interpretation of the story than in seeing a competent adaptation - and even then, they should go in with low expectations.Please don\'t let this be your introduction to the franchise.Story/Plot: 3/10Characters: 3/10Animation/Art: 1/10Sound: 3/10Overall: 2/10For Fans Of: Detective Conan, Umineko no Naku Koro Ni(Side note: Yes, I\'m using the English names.

To transfer this from a platform that allows you to do investigation yourself, finding...clues, and uncovering the truth, onto the screen were you\'re a passive watcher... that\'s no easy task.To fairly judge the Ace Attorney anime you need to understand that it\'s not about copy and pasting the events on TV but that the producers had to neccessarily scrap some of the points they deemed too much for casual watchers who didn\'t play the game; but at the same time keeping the ones who knew the franchise beforehand at bay.The pacing for the first two cases started off quite nice, I really enjoyed the introduction though they should have made it more clear that ""casual watchers"" couldn\'t expect a serious anime about the law.

I know, it\'s hard when you\'ve been given a limited number of episodes to fit into a season but if that\'s the case, maybe they should have just covered one of the games and not two of them.Episode 13 was a very sweet addition though and I applaud them for giving us kid Naruhodo, Yahari und Mitsurugi.The art and animation was overall fine, sometimes... ""interesting"" (if you want to call it that).

You can\'t like a series if you don\'t feel the main character, and he gave Naruhodo that rookie attorney gone wild vibe.Overall, this isn\'t a masterpiece but it\'s surely not an anime made for the trash bin.

Both the prosecution and defense have their own reasonings for choosing their sides, and the verdict in the end is never the most desired outcome.  But we're not here to talk about everyone's right to a fair trial, we're here to talk about everyone's right to a fun trial with A-1's adaptation of the first two games of Ace Attorney.  Put on your attorney's badge and get on your tiny bike.  It's time for objections and nonsensical court cases!Story: Naruhodo Ryuuichi is a new defense attorney who just got his...license.  Upon entering the courtroom to deal with his first case, he finds himself defending his friend, Yahari in a court case against him on the accusation of MURDER!!!  Against prosecutor Mitsurugi Eiji, the two fight for Yahari's verdict and in spark a court rivalry over the two over the rest of the series.Taking the two first two games of the Phoenix Wright series, this adaptation...basically does what you would think it does, which is fully adapt all of the cases from the first two games of the series.  (Big shocker, I know.)  Because of this...there's not really much to say for the actual story of the series.  The main plotline is basically: Get involved with a case usually involving murder, have Naruhodo defend the accused while Mitsurugi does his best to prove someone guilty and ultimately figure out through a long hair-brained stream of hairbrained and highly improbable events, what happened with each case and who truly is the person who is guilty.Admittedly, the story for this series isn't really all that good.  The show's pretty stagnant as to what'll happen and since it's basically an animated walkthrough of the games, you can guess what the end result for all of these cases are.  Doesn't mean that they're not fun to watch, but don't expect things are pretty predictable.  Apart from that, there's really not much to actually talk about.  The problem is because the series is so focused on the gameplay aspect of the series that there's not really much left for anything else aside from the cases, even if they're all really fun to watch.Overview:+ Stays true to the Capcom game series-  Doesn't really show anything besides the court casesCharacters: The characters for this series features a large and colorful cast of nutjobs and basket cases that come in only during the case in which they're important or needed in, as well as the more ordinary but still somewhat crazy main recurring characters that you'll probably never actually bore seeing.  Probably.First we have Naruhodo Ryuuichi, or in the localization, Phoenix Wright.  Believing to stand up for the innocence as a defense attorney, Naruhodo doesn't really have much of a character beyond feeling a bit sick and tired of all of the crazy people he has to deal with from his hard to deal with clients and witnesses who bring their own brand of insanity into this joke of a courtroom, which is to be expected of a player character since it's easier to project onto them when they don't really have many character traits to them.Then you have Mitsurugi Eiji, the prosecutor and rival of our main protagonist.  Devoted to proving the accused as guilty, Mitsurugi plays as the 'villain' of the series and continuously spends his screentime to win against Naruhodo.  His motives are pretty basic and the development that he gets later in the series is pretty paper thin, so similar to Naruhodo, there's not really much to say.  The dynamic between the characters is pretty cool, but on their own, they don't work out all too well.Aside from them, we have recurring characters like Mayoi (or Maya), Itonokogiri (or Gumshoe), and the nameless judge who apparently doesn't know a single thing that goes on in his courtroom despite being the person who puts down the final ruling.  All of whom are on the same level as the rivaling characters in terms of development and actual character traits and really don't differ much from when they're introduced to when the series ends.  Side characters on the other hand, aka the characters that pertain to one or two cases out of the entire series are amongst the reasons why this series is so entertaining.  Every side character is so wacky, out there, and downright strange that it's extremely awkward to watch them, yet you can't look away.  Sure they're one time characters, but making a really good and memorable impression of them far exceeds any other kind of impact that they would've had otherwise.Overview:+ Strange yet memorable side characters-  Main and recurring characters are pretty paper thinArt: Produced by A-1 pictures, the style and quality of the series is...standard fare at best.

Being a large fan of the games, I was highly enthused to hear of an anime adaptation coming, however upon its release I was only met with a painful and bland imitation of the original games, and even separately so, this anime is still rather one-note and drab.To the Anime\'s credit, I was rather pleased to see a good chunk of the anime\'s script was directly adapted from the games, this atleast lead to a coherent and unique narrative; and the sound...design was even better, being quite possibly being the best thing in the series, and feels like a very pleasing overhaul of the original game soundtrack.However this is where my compliments to the series end. Moving onto the art design, everything seems somewhat... wrong... A friend of mine says that A-1 has ""SAO-ified"" all of the character designs, which I\'m unsure of how true that is, but everything looks stilted and off regardless. It would probably also be prudent to mention Phoenix\'s stilted running animation in the intro for a majority of the episodes before it was fixed in the latter half.On top of this, the delivery and general scene direction is probably the worst thing this anime has to offer, and moved this anime from ""Boring"" to ""Awful"" in my eyes, as everything is done without heart or feeling. This is a hard point to describe without spoilers but I\'\'ll try my upmost; in the original games where there were scenes of high-tension and desperate action, with races against time and scurrying to find the right answer, there were instead.. not... Characters that were supposed to look and sound devastated at something, instead sounded just slightly annoyed, moreso like the local takeout got their order wrong, and not the levels of upset that were supposed to be shown. One scene in particular where a character was supposed to rush in just in time, with the loud and epic soundtrack making the viewer pumped, was instead replaced by a fairly quiet scene, and the character just walking in, without so-much a hint of tension.Furthermore, I dislike how character relationships are handled. Characters whose relationships were supposed to feel slightly off and people were maybe untrustworthy, were over-clarified so there was no longer the tension of ""Should we trust them?"" or ""Is this person trying to deceive us?""This anime disappointed me. In my original list of things that upset me, I was also displeased that they had only adapted 2 of the original trilogy of games, however with the announcement of the second season of the anime just a few days before the writing of this review, I am hopeful that A-1 will infact have fixed the blatant errors in the anime and not ruin mine, and many others, favourite game in the franchise. design was even better, being quite possibly being the best thing in the series, and feels like a very pleasing overhaul of the original game soundtrack.However this is where my compliments to the series end.

We follow our protagonists in a fairly faithful (albeit, heavily condensed) retelling of what takes place in the games. The tone is more comic than that of the games, with the show being heavily embedded with puns as well as general sarcasm and wit from several characters (particularly Phoenix Wright himself, in response to the simple-mindedness of those around him), however this is not uncommon with other media related to the franchise, such as the film or stage plays. The comedy...that encompasses this show, combined by the nostalgia evoked by it and the fast pace which retains viewer attention, make for an amusing legal drama that is certainly worth the watch.The animation isn’t the best, but you can still feel the intensity of every “Objection!”, “Hold it!” and “Take that!”, which is all that really matters.The soundtrack is perfect, of course due to the incorporation of music from the original game which was intended to draw players in, maintaining their focus and attention (an effect which is preserved in the anime). The opening songs are genuinely brilliant and really amplify the positive spirit of the show.Both our honourable protagonists and the several antagonists they face, although much less fleshed-out than in the source material, retain their singularity and memorability. Phoenix Wright is, as per usual, an admirable main character who retains his ingenuity and perseveres in the face of injustice. It remains obvious that his opponent, prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, is the same austere yet honourable character he was in the games. Maya endures as innocent, charming, and devoted to helping Phoenix, regardless of whether it’s to his benefit or detriment! Others are similarly characterised as they were in the games.To conclude, I enjoyed every second of this anime and I’m looking forward to watching Season 2, which covers T&T. It not only kept me interested, but also thoroughly entertained.Thank you for reading <3 that encompasses this show, combined by the nostalgia evoked by it and the fast pace which retains viewer attention, make for an amusing legal drama that is certainly worth the watch.The animation isn’t the best, but you can still feel the intensity of every “Objection!”, “Hold it!” and “Take that!”, which is all that really matters.The soundtrack is perfect, of course due to the incorporation of music from the original game which was intended to draw players in, maintaining their focus and attention (an effect which is preserved in the anime).

Of course, this is spoiler free.Story 3/10:Since I've ever heard about this anime I thought I'd be awesome, I don't consider myself as a diehard fan of Ace Attorney, but man, I was very dissapointed when this anime got to the case 3. It was very awful, especially when it reached case 4. I've watched 12 episodes of this anime. Enough episodes to say that the story is a total mess, it doesn't make sense sometimes and they skip very important parts of the story. Sometimes you couldn't realize...(If you haven't played the games) why something was the way it was, like, when they don't even explain anything about the facts, the things that happened but Phoenix does realizes it and suddenly he objects and like I said before, if you wouldn't have played the game then you wouldn't even realize why something it's the way it is. The story goes super fast and that makes it difficult to understand, the explanation of the facts and things that occur during a trial is very poor and you can't realize what's happening.Art 7/10:It's good, though it has its flaws. There were episodes wherein it wasn't that obvious that the face of some character was pretty lame, and not well illustrated. However, I think that (and this isn't spoiler) in the episode 11, the art was pretty bad and it was the most obvious episode to have dreadful faces and a bad illustration.Sound 6/10:It lacks of epicness. In the game, almost every track was epic and made you feel like you really were an attorney investigating, or having a trial and suddenly having to use logic to think of a solution to a dilemma, or being in a trial and cornering a witness or cross-examinating a testimony. The anime version of Cornered was the track I liked the most out of all the other ones.Character 3/10:Not enough development. I know it is an adaptation of the game but come on the creators could've done this one right.Enjoyment 4/10:It'll sound weird but, I enjoyed one or two episodes of this anime but only due to the fanservice and the references to the game, it was well made. If you are a fan of the franchise, then you could watch until the end of case 3. I don't recommend watching beyond that, because seriously, one of the best cases in the game got ruined because of this bad adaptation.Overall 5/10:I gave it a 2 before this review. But now I'll be more just and I will give it a 5 because although it disappointed me a lot, it did good some things and that deserves at least a 5.This was my first review. Sorry if I had grammar mistakes in the review, this isn't my native language. Also, if you find this helpful, mark it helpful as well.

I know it doesn't reflect reality but using murder cases in this anime where they just seem to compete in who can make better statements is bad taste. Noone seems to care who is innocent (Naruhodo does but he just believes they are innocent and doesn't ask for any explanations).OST in this anime is good. Nothing extraordinary but didn't make me skip the OP or ED. Animation is poor. Too much still shots and visual effect is court are flashy but not very well done.Usually anime characters in...power positions have a glaring fault and due to that it falls to MC to do things but in this case the judge is just dumb. He has no good qualities, how can someone who is timid and dumb become a judge, he could be one of them but not both. A procecutor who had 100% win rate and was suspected off tampering for evidence was not checked. All I want is some common sense and logic in this anime but I found none.The court system is so that people are convicted on circumstantial evidence unless the defence can show otherwise. And they aren't given much chance to do so. The jails must be full of innocent people because the detectives are quite bad too.Overall, I can never like a court drame where you can't take anything seriously. power positions have a glaring fault and due to that it falls to MC to do things but in this case the judge is just dumb.

It may seem like a really absurd statement, but since Ace Attorney is an adaptation of a game, you need a good understanding of its game design, as to understand what would work on screen, since video games are executed in ways fitting to their gameplay. Sometimes, to make a game more engaging, you have to remove some realistic elements. Knowing this, I have decided to play the game myself, to understand why Ace Attorney is presented the way it is, some time during the time I was watching the anime. So I\'d like...to explain how the hook, the trials, work in the game, and why on screen the trials are really ridiculous.You see, in the game, you are handling the trials. What you say, what arguments you refute and how you refute them. The more you refute the arguments of the opposing party, the more flustered they become and eventually, they burst out and that is used as a sign that you are winning. Their reactions are over the top but that is done with the purpose of showing you that you are clearly on the right track. In the games, you are also tasked with gathering evidence, in order for you learn more about the case and piece everything together as to have an idea of what to do in court and have an idea of what the case will be, but also to have more involvement in the investigation process, rather than await evidence and use what the cops find to your advantage, like a normal lawyer would. You will also discuss with the witnesses about the case and learn more about the story that way. The game will make you handle cases that you personally figure out with the evidence you have gathered, by paying attention to the information that mismatches your evidence. In this game, you figure it out. As a result of such the game needs a balancing scale, where it teaches you the basics.You see, both Ace Attorney\'s start with a fairly ridiculous trial, where you know for certain who the culprit is, because the game states it from the very start. Your defendant is also a childhood friend which is explained as getting fairly often into trouble that usualy isn\'t caused by him. Now as an introduction to the game, it isn\'t a particularly stellar introduction, considering you\'re gonna defend someone to whom you have social ties with,  (that has a high frequency by the way for I assume dramatic effect) but it\'s a better than an UI prompt that says ""This is your goal in the game. Go from x to y. That is the defendant. Your friend. That is the actual culprit. The culprit."" The game actually gives you context and lets you learn by going along the way, in a manner that I\'d say is competent.In a series, however, you don\'t want to start off easy, but rather to impress the viewer since first glance. So since the same trial is presented here in the same manner, you will leave with a pisspoor first impression. You already know the culprit, the defendant has constant outbursts since his dialogue outside the court was mixed in, and the first episode is a gibberish mess. You have a culprit you already know, a defendant that makes no sense as to why he\'s acting in a manner that is incriminating, or as to why he wasn\'t instructed at least slightly to not have any sort of outbursts such as: flailing your arms wildly, screaming and hitting your head against a solid surface repeatedly. As I watched this, I immediately thought this is very stupid and since I\'ve seen the game, I am sure that whoever adapted this series doesn\'t understand the purpose of that trial. In the game, the trial is the starting point that familiarizes you with the game and its mechanics. You won\'t have too many complaints about how the trial emerges because YOU\'RE AN ACTIVE PART OF IT, and these things help you. In the game you have the choice to tell the defendant during the trial to asbtain from saying things and making them say the truth, and so on and so forth. You have control over him. His stupidity isn\'t an important factor. And the fact you already know the truth helps you plan out the case. But here, it makes everything seem really dull and ridiculousBut perhaps this means that they\'re just trying to stay faithful to the adaptation and they\'re not exactly incompetent in this adaptation. In that case, let me move over to the next trial. In this trial there is an autopsy report. The situation is as follows. You present a discrepancy in a testimony  that says that a victim that has died immediately after a sudden blow to the head, had enough time to write the name of their killer after the attack, at a time they were most certainly dead. However, turns out that another autopsy report was released the next day, that says that the victim didn\'t die immediately after the blow. This is the line delivery in the game ""A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request, that says: Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object. The victim might\'ve lived for several minutes afterwards."" Eloquent, to the point and most important, not ridiculous. This is the line delivery in the anime. ""Yesterday, another autopsy was performed, that changed the report from died instantly... to died PRETTY MUCH instantly.""  That\'s the wording. Pretty much instantly. So I reacted by walking around in the room a bunch with my hand behind my head, thinking ""This is so bad. It\'s terrible. I love this. This is incredible.""I expected at least some minimal level of professionalism and well defined thinking and reasoning, even if with any sort of logic gaps, but that, caught me completely offguard. I never expected quite what I got in Ace Attorney. I mean, you have cases where attorneys don\'t even talk to their defendants, like the first one. You have cases where the judge is bossed around by a guy and told to finish the trial, in front of everyone else, by the prosecutor. You have cases where the defendant, judge, defense attorney, and the witnesses, get repeatedly whipped. There\'s no professionalism in the trials.Okay then, perhaps it is because the series is quite lighthearted. Maybe it is not because the crimes themselves and the mystery aren\'t orchestrated well. Well, how does this sound? How about we frame the defense attorney that was defending the victim, as the murderer? Because that\'s the most logical way to go about things. Oh, okay, that sounds believable, right? How about keeping a bullet inside your shoulder after being shot for 15 years inside your body, a bullet that links you to an infamous incident, while also, somehow, avoiding lead poisoning and being able to function as healthy as a spring for said 15 years? Doesn\'t sound that good, does it? I think should be convincing enough, but lets ruin all credibility. How about shapeshifting your body in a trial, from a 8 year old little girl to a 27 year old woman with huge tits sticking out of her dress? Why do they shapeshift you ask? Oh, because of spirit summoning. They summon a spirit inside their body. Yes, this is an anime about handling trials in the courtroom. Yes, this is a recurring thing. Yes, it also is a recurring gag that nobody really questions this.These things are factors from the games too, but I have not crossreferenced everything I said to see if everything is the same in the game and the anime. And yes, these criticisms are fair for the game as well, if they are indeed there. But one thing that is clearly there is the spirit summoning, and in both cases, they take away from the trial, as Phoenix Wright couldn\'t have had solved the case, without outside intervention from an element that realistically wouldn\'t be able to be a factor. In the game itself, the literal second case, you can\'t solve this, without the intervention of the spirit. In other words, you, the player, can\'t solve your first case after the tutorial, on your own. But that is a flaw of the game, that I\'ve decided to state to say that the source material is far from perfect itself.Well, the next thing that you might think that, this was intended strictly for the fans of the game. Even then, I\'d say this is a pisspoor attempt that deserved no recognition, if you are to compare the animation quality, not to other anime, but rather to the game itself. The spritework animation in the game of Ace Attorney is absolutely gorgeous. It is incredible to see how much detail they have managed to add in spriteart, which is done by drawing everything pixel by pixel. Am I supposed to believe this is meant to be an omage to the fans of the game, when they couldn\'t even do proper shading on the characters in the anime\'s animation? Am I supposed to believe that when there\'s just the bare minimum of details in the animation, while the simple spritework of the game did so much work to convey as much detail as possible, am I supposed to think this is meant to be made for the fans? No, this is just someone exploiting the intelectual property for money. If this was meant for the fans, they would\'ve gotten far better animation, as I can\'t see how this anime could enrich the experience of the games, when they just have rushed in trials with pisspoor animationsWhat is left to say about Ace Attorney? It is a mess. It is terrible. But it was really fun to watch. It is flawed in so many ways and on so many levels, that I\'ve enjoyed it a lot. Seeing the constant flow of flaws that it threw my way truly entertained me, because I really enjoy when a series is so flawed, that I have to praise them for it. This series did nothing right, except for a single episode, where they\'ve shown the childhood of Edgeworth, Phoenix Wright and Larry Butz, strictly because it is unexpected and has nothing to do with the cases. I found it endearing because there wasn\'t really any of the elements that made me rant what I\'ve ranted in the review. But the trials, have so many obstacles to be properly consumed, so many discrepancies, be it logic gaps, be it unprofessional behavior that leads nowhere, be it blownout overreactions, be it supernatural elements that shouldn\'t be a factor in court, be it etc, that I couldn\'t just manage not to enjoy the obstacles themselves. The reason I have not stated as many of the flaws I\'ve seen in this series because the flaws of the series were quite honestly the sole enjoyment factor I\'ve got out of it. I think anyone that watches stuff and can enjoy a series for how bad they can be, would have a great time watching Ace Attorney. It is truly bad. Hence it is truly great. It is a great mess that should be watched solely for that reason. Because quite frankly, that is the only way not to be dissapointed with what you get. to explain how the hook, the trials, work in the game, and why on screen the trials are really ridiculous.You see, in the game, you are handling the trials. What you say, what arguments you refute and how you refute them. The more you refute the arguments of the opposing party, the more flustered they become and eventually, they burst out and that is used as a sign that you are winning. Their reactions are over the top but that is done with the purpose of showing you that you are clearly on the right track. In the games, you are also tasked with gathering evidence, in order for you learn more about the case and piece everything together as to have an idea of what to do in court and have an idea of what the case will be, but also to have more involvement in the investigation process, rather than await evidence and use what the cops find to your advantage, like a normal lawyer would. You will also discuss with the witnesses about the case and learn more about the story that way. The game will make you handle cases that you personally figure out with the evidence you have gathered, by paying attention to the information that mismatches your evidence. In this game, you figure it out. As a result of such the game needs a balancing scale, where it teaches you the basics.You see, both Ace Attorney\'s start with a fairly ridiculous trial, where you know for certain who the culprit is, because the game states it from the very start.

I received new evidence regarding this anime. The prosecution has been approached with the following review.Story:These court cases are taken from the Ace Attorney games, but as I never played them, I have no idea how much they left out or added. Whatever, the laws of the court in this anime are pretty weird. Apparently every suspect is guilty untill proven innocent, and even when proven innocent, as long as you can\'t present the actual culprit, the verdict is still guilty. This is of course absolutely ridiculous and makes it nearly impossible to take this anime seriously. The rest is standard ""main character showed...me the true meaning of (subject of anime)"" stuff.3/10Art:Phoenix Wrigth doesn\'t look good. The characters often look very disfigured and there isn\'t much love to details either. They tried to mimic the movements from the game for the anime, which just looks awkward. The backgrounds are also rather static, which isn\'t much of a problem, but more visible in a subpar animated show like this.2/10Sound:All the openings and endings are okay, though far from being great. I have no idea how one of them made it into the top 10 of the charts. Voice acting is okay too, there isn\'t much one can do with a one-dimensional character, so I can\'t critizise them for their work.5/10Characters:You know why Detective Conan is so successful? Because not only does it have interesting cases, but also interesting characters, with motives, emotions and personalities. In Phoenix Wright there are only good and bad people. The motives often seem very disproportionate, which would not be all that bad if we had something to back up their actions. Even the main characters are rather lame. Naruhodo is a goody little two-shoes, Maya only cares about food and samurai and the prosecutors just want to win by all means.2/10Enjoyment:Most cases were pretty boring and rather obvious to figure out who did it. Maybe this thing works as a game (and that seems to be the case, as many people love them), but as an anime, that is just not enough. The only case which I would consider good was the final one. Phoenix Wright is not insultingly bad (like Mayoiga for example), but there is nothing this show has to offer either.3/10Overall:3.0/10 me the true meaning of (subject of anime)"" stuff.3/10Art:Phoenix Wrigth doesn\'t look good.

But what makes us human is that we fight for others.But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That\'s the true measure of what human life is worth.""- Phoenix Wright 2004I am a big fan of Capcom\'s Ace Attorney series. With 6 mainline games, multiple spinoffs ,one crossover, an appearance in Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and Project X Zone, it is safe to say this series is popular. The Ace Attorney franchise also has various manga, 2 Capcom licensed doujin collections, and now an anime. But...then the anime got trashed on and condemned as a bad adaptation. Now I Corey Censoredlastname will defend this animated adaptation of one of my favorite games.STORY:The story of the Ace Attorney franchise is really simple at face value, but the cases  go into great detail and have lots of amazing plot twists. Due to spoiler reasons, I will refrain from describing cases. The main premise is that Phoenix Wright is a new attorney at law, just having passed his bar exam. He is taken under the wing of defense attorney Mia Fey and she taught Phoenix to think outside the box, not take things at face value, and always believe in your client. The series goes into cross examination of witnesses to point out contradictory statements in their testimonies, Crime scene investigation, hilarious characters, spirit channelling, and defending the innocent. The Ace Attorney series is overall lighthearted, but at times it can get really dark. This anime adapted games 1 and 2.(Oh boy just wait for Farewell My Turnabout the final case in Justice for All and where the anime leaves off, it is my favorite case) 9/10 where the hell are the psyche locks in the anime.Art:The art is what really made this anime adaptation not as good as it should be. Characters go off model frequently, some characters dont look right (Larry is a prime suspect), and the CGI is absolute TRESH. The backgrounds do look nice, and the text from the games are translated well, and some of the dramatic effects are amazing. I just wish the art was as good as the sprites, or the cutscenes in Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice which are animated by the same studio how did they screw up this badly wtf.6/10 its passable, and some things are great.Sound:The anime has some amazing sound design. The voice actors are amazing. Kaji Yuki as Phoenix was amazing. Better than those bit crushed GBA samples by a longshot. I am a big fan of his work so hearing him as Phoenix made me overjoyed. Edgeworth has a really good actor also, and Franziska has such a smug actress. The music is amazing too. As you know, the Ace Attorney franchise is well known for it\'s amazing music. The anime takes the approach to music similar to Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice, as all the music is orchestrated instead of using the GBA or DS ost and calling it a day. Holy shit the 2001 Objection theme never sounded more epic. And the Pursuit Cornered 2001 theme is amazing. Still can\'t beat the DS version of that song. However it seems that Justice For All\'s OST is mostly missing. That kinda sucks as I liked that game\'s OST a bit, and I\'ve heard the orchestral cd arrangements and it sounds amazing, and would sound amazing on TV. So the 2001 themes carry over to the Justice for All adaptation. So no Moderato 2002, or Pursuit Caught. I\'ll give it an 8 due to the missing music.Characters:The Characters are amazing listed below are main characters that do not spoil anything.Phoenix Wright: Newbie defense attorney who believes in his clients, and is highly intelligent, if a bit silly at times. He gets nervous, and is a friendly man. OBJECTION!!!!!Mia Fey: Phoenix\'s mentor. That\'s really all I can say without spoilersLarry Butz: Phoenix\'s best friend from gradeschool. Larry is a goofy and friendly character known to overreact, and has a bad track record of getting dumped. He is unlucky and always ends up in bad situations. If something smells, it\'s usually the Butz.Maya Fey: Phoenix\'s assistant who is a spirit medium in training. She is a comic relief character and is a very lovable person. She also has a bad track record being involved in many murder cases over the years. She loves hamburgers, ramen, and the Steel Samurai. She also seems to have a bit of a crush on ""Nick"".Miles Edgeworth: Prosecutor who does almost anything to get a guilty verdict as he hates criminals. However he doesn\'t resort to any illegal tactics. He is also a really nice guy he just acts like an emo kid on their period. That autopsy report is outdated your honor.Franziska Von Karma: Tsundere prosecutor who is a really cool character.Dick Gumshoe, lovable detective who is a bit of a dope. He doesn\'t make much due to always getting paycuts. He looks up to Edgeworth a lot.I overall enjoy the anime adaptation. It was a well adapted version of the first two Ace Attorney games for the given episode count. I also like the fanservice of there even being a Phoenix Wright anime. Also here is a note, The bonus 5th case for the DS version of the first game, Case 5:Rise from the Ashes is missing. However I didn\'t like that case very much as it was really long and boring, but I did like Damon Gant so I am indifferent to it\'s exclusion. However the first case from Justice for All, ""The Lost Turnabout"" is missing, and this might pose a problem for the upcoming second season. I might not have liked that case much, but it introduced Maggey Byrd, a character who later reappears in the 3rd game as a waitress in Jean Armstrong\'s café. Also Richard Wellington had a hilarious breakdown. My enjoyment is an 8/10 but the critical score is a 7/10. It is not as bad as everyone says.The games are amazing though and way better so you should definitely play those. They are 10/10 material no joke. then the anime got trashed on and condemned as a bad adaptation.

Everyone wanted it, but from the very begginig I knew, that adapting the Pheonix Wright games was not the smartest idea. For the most part the story was pretty predictable, but I had hoped, that at least it would be a decent adaptation. I was wrong.NOTE: I boosted scores by about a half or so, because of the second to last arc, that actually was really good in every aspect. Most of the stuff I'll write below does not apply to that arc.You might like this anime if:-You are a fan of the Pheonix...Wright gamesYou might dislike this anime if:-You never heard about Pheonix Wright. This anime does not have much to offer to you.Story: 5This is a mystery anime right? So why, for more than half of the cases, culprits are revealed at the beggining or in the middle of the investigation? It makes no sense. But hey, even if that wasn't the case, you can only guess who is the culprit, because most of the time, the evidence is provided way too late into the trial and at that point it's already obvious who did it. Though the cases can be interesting, the decisions that have been made concerning the story take away most of the fun of mystery anime, and leave you with a semi-decent drama. Also, let me mention the humour, that is at times decent and even better at a few select moments, but at others it feels incredibly misplaced. For example, a few seconds after an information about a murder occured, someone throws a joke. How can you laugh after someone told you that? I understand that it never is too serious to begin with, but when some events happen that are supposed to make you nervous, they don't, because you feel like it wasn't meant to do that. The games were never good in the story aspect, not counting a few cases, but this is a disaster. Overall, a first part of the long list of disappointments. The failed battle of silliness and seriousness does not help either.Art and Animation: 2This is an absolute disgrace when it comes to today's standards. Except for maybe Maya, everyone looks so wrong, and their animations are so weird. Even the main hero changes his face almost every scene. Honestly at some points it looks like some old animation from Newgrounds or something. It even made me burst out laughing because of how bad it was. It perfectly represents how little care was put into this. In the very last episode, the judge moves his mouth, but no voice can be heard, and the only sound is his hammer beating againts the palm of his hand. I usually leave the next part for the OST, so I though I'll mention it here. Overall, it's abysmal by today's standards. One or two scenes can't change that.Sound: 8It is.... good actually. The soundtrack from the game has been implemented here and the openings are catchy (the first opening ends in a weird, abrupt way though). There are some mistakes, the music at times doesn't fit the scenes and at some others it is dead quiet. In the last episode (again) there was clearly supposed to be a conversation, but instead we get a silent nod from a character. That lasts about 10-15 seconds. In complete silence. Some music would help at least, you know? Overall, pretty good, fails to fit sometimes.Characters: 4The characters were probably the strongest point of the games. Here they are bland and boring, maybe except Maya, but even she can often fall under that category. I did not care about anyone, they can all go disappear for all I care. No development, no interesting moments, nothing. They feel like butchered versions of themselves. I don't have anything else to add.Enjoyment: 3The only redeeming factor was the circus arc that I mentioned at the beggining. If not for that, this would easily be a one. It's boring, painful to look at and overall just a huge disappointment. I did play the games and I was a little bit excited, but after the second arc, I ended up mindlessly grinding it to the finish line (except for the circus arc, it was a huge surprise to me really).Overall: 4It has nothing that I would consider worth recommending. I will never look back at it again. This is only watchable, if you played through the games and you want to see them turned into an anime. Everyone else might as well watch a field of flowers or something, I don't know. I could probably watch another season, it would cover my favourite game after all, but this one was a pain to watch. Glad it's over.Of course, this is purely my opinion, but I can't recommend you to develop your own. Watch at your own risk.

I'm surprised the fandom was as forgiving of this adaptation.Nearly all of the problems from this stem from the difficulties of turning games that take more than 30 hours of pure gameplay to finish into a single season of a TV show. What made Ace Attorney memorable were the characters and the interactivity. Converting it to anime automatically loses the interactivity, so you lose the suspense or the feeling of being connected to the action. Then because...it's rushed, plot holes are created and you lose a ton of characterization. What results is a rather boring show with 1-dimensional characters. Not to mention the animation is just bad. All around this was not a well-done adaptation. it's rushed, plot holes are created and you lose a ton of characterization.

Even, the walkthroughs on YouTube are better to watch. The anime is only decent if you really want to kill time, but it does not cut it for me.The games do have several puns and memes, so this anime was a letdown for me because the execution was poor. If anything, I only like the opening because of my Feenie x Edgeypoo fangirl heart. "", ""STORY (7): This anime has good storylines. It takes 3-4 episodes to cover each case. In some cases, it feels like it can drag on but they touch on the details. It can also be pretty intense in court (between the Prosecutor and Defense) -- especially when both sides have to yell object and prove their case. During the examination of each witness, each of them brings something different. In some cases, they would leave us second guessing ourselves, but it can also be predictable.CHARACTERS (7): They are numerous characters that are introduced in this series & they have so much personalities.- Phoenix Wright...(Ryuichi): New Defense Attorney who works for Chihiro.

The most believable parts of the show are when the lawyers are defending scumbags and asking irrelevant questions. If I close my eyes and pretend that Mr. Ace attorney is not an attorney and more like a detective solving a case, I still find myself unimpressed with the show. I can\'t take anything seriously, so when \'serious\'...moments occur or characters preach about justice I just think "" You interviewed a damn parrot, the dead ghost of a 34-year-old woman possessed the 6-year-old again and gave her uncomfortable assets, the prosecution whips people when she is unhappy, and every fucking case has some last-minute-no-way-in-hell-it-would-ever-fly-in-real-court evidence that shows up."" In regard to the technical aspects of the show, animation is very basic and not impressive. Sometimes a rack of cleavage will just be a block of cleavage.On the bright side, the music is good, the dub is pretty good, and that\'s about it.

Sounds, great honestly. I would give it an 8 but, the execution is god awful. It's nothing more then a being mess with no attempts for jokes or character development, it's more of a thing that happened then the characters just move on. They forget about that the next episode.Art (2) - I love is art style of a video game, but...that's the only good thing about it. The art can be awkward and still at times that I wish I could look away but I can't then I'm stuck with a headache. Sometimes the animation looks odd as well, like in the opening.Sound (8) - Easily the best part about this show, the voice actors and actresses do an amazing job on there parts.

It sounds like effort has been put into them!Character (1) - Uh... who are these people? The characters in this show are so, boring. It makes each episode go for longer and longer.

Stay away from it. but if you want to find light and warm entertainment and not a very serious person, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU THIS SERIES!For starters, I never play the game before, I don\'t know any single thing about whats Ace Attorney. The only thing I remember was around 8-10 years ago I occasionally saw thumbnails of the main character at youtube and several meme site.Anyway, last week I came across the dvd dual audio and decided to watch the series, in English by the way. I...learnt Japanese first then English, but I decided to give the English dub a try for this one.At first, this show looks realistic, its a story about lawyers fighting each other in court. I\'m an engineering graduate, I have little knowledge in law and especially court. Therefore, I don\'t really mind how the system is being used in the story, regardless its pure fiction or not.As soon as the part ""spirit medium"" is involved, I know this show is not something to be taken seriously, so I decided to let loose and not taking the whole thing seriously so it doesn\'t affect my enjoyment. Kids or people that too into literature will not find the story attractable and definitely won\'t like it too.But I need to remind you, this review come from someone whom:1. Never play the game2. Doesn\'t care regardless its realistic or not (ex: spirit medium involvement)as some people would say its ""ridiculous"" , but not me, I\'ll allow it and take it as part of entertainment and enjoyment.So, my enjoyment? I give it 8/10 overall.Why?1. I like the English dialogues and the interactions, its written and played in a very enjoyable manner! (good job voice actors!)2. I like how the story gradually become one, piece by piece, and we ends up see the whole picture as we progress through the episodes.3. I personally like the setting, such as our main character being an adult pass 20 yrs old, freshly graduated college student. (I generally have no feelings to highschool settings anymore)4. After some research, i found out that this ""first season"" cover the first two game of Phoenix Wright, of which some people would call ""bright side of the story"". I enjoyed every parts of elements presented, theres both serious and hilarious moment I personally very enjoyed. One thing very memorable for me in this first season is Wendy Oldbag, shes so funny hahah. and not to mention, all those funny characters faces during funny moments, its all enjoyable.5. I like the development, I can see that the main character is gradually becoming more matured throughout the series. and I really like it. Also, there were some characters bond getting stronger with each other as the story progress. Friendship is the story\'s main arsenal to present to its audience. You will see if you watch this adaptation.and I think thats all , for now. I really like this adaptation, to the point I want to get to know the story\'s continuation by playing the game, but I\'ll do that after the anime second season.Watch this for fun, you will enjoy it! as I enjoyed it so much! learnt Japanese first then English, but I decided to give the English dub a try for this one.At first, this show looks realistic, its a story about lawyers fighting each other in court.

The wonderfully wacky yet also emotionally gripping visual novel/puzzle game series from Capcom. Full of great character designs, iconic music, over the top situations and dramatic stakes, it should make for a great anime adaptation, right?Well, no, not ""great"", at least not when the god-kings of shovelware anime, A-1 Studios, is the guys behind production.I won\'t beat around the bush: this anime is not -terrible-, but its got some serious flaws both in adaptation and as a stand alone product.Let\'s get to the biggest blemish to see: the art and animation. It is f u c k i n g terrible most...of the time. Characters are routinely off model, animation is very limited and choppy as all hell, props are messy and also off model, backgrounds are garrishly obvious digital compositions, which are ALSO off model sometimes, SOMEHOW, despite mostly being geometric shapes (when they aren\'t directly copied from the games backgrounds). Its bad, people. Its really bad.The next biggest flaw is the pacing and adaptation of the cases, though this is a mixed bag at points. The anime streamlines the ridiculous back and forth shenanigans of constantly presenting evidence, being objected, being overruled, and having to present more evidence for the sake of a smoother narrative, and that\'s honestly fine for the most part. It also cuts out a lot of the backtracking for investigating for more evidence in favor of more character driven scenes, which is an honest strength of the series it can boast.However, in exchange for this the trial segments seem to move at an almost breakneck pace, throwing off the timing that a lot of moments the game had for dramatic or comedic effect. Events are rearranged sloppily, and the overall presentation is a bit of a hot mess to watch.In spite of all this, the anime does retain a lot of the strengths of Ace Attorney\'s video game origins: almost every character is likeable and enjoyable to watch, especially frontman Phoenix Wright, his rivals Miles Edgeworth and Franzsika von Karma, his assistant Maya Fey and others. The music is directly taken from the games as well and generally sounds very nice, loaning a strong air of authenticity to the final product.I suppose my bottom line is that is you LIKE Ace Attorney the games, then you will probably enjoy watching the anime, provided the minor narrative changes don\'t bother you so much. If you didn\'t like the games, this anime will not do you any favors, and if you\'ve never played the games but are curious about their stories.... I would suggest just playing the games instead, but you probably would enjoy watching this if your standards aren\'t too lofty. All in all, the Ace Attorney anime is a serviceable if hideously ugly and uneven watch that will probably get a few laughs out of you at least, but won\'t be moving any mountains.Also, watch the dub, because Funimation is fully aware of the games\' weirdness to localize obviously Japanese set places in the games into American counter parts and it really plays up that goofy angle. of the time.

The games, as many fans claimed to be, are a parody of the justice system.As such, many elements regarding the law in this show could be depicted as inaccurate as...compared to its real-life counterpart. This show also bears strong supernatural elements, where the spirit channeling technique pretty much becomes the central theme of the story. Keep this in mind that you should not be expecting a fully realistic justice system.Even so, you will see trials being held in a courtroom, you will have witnesses providing testimonies, with the defense attorney cross-examining them, and you will see evidences and objections being thrown all over the place, with the two opposing sides, prosecutor and defense attorney getting into each others\' throats. So it could well be an entertaining ride if you are into this sort of thing.In the original games, you play as Phoenix Wright (Ryuuichi Naruhodou), a defense attorney whose job is to get his client (the defendant) acquitted, while his opposition, a prosecutor, would aim to get the defendant a guilty verdict instead. The game is mostly split into two parts: 1) An investigation part where you have to gather evidences, as well as clues from relevant people of the case; 2) The trial where you cross-examine the witness and search for contradictions, present evidence to prove why your defendant isn\'t guilty, as well as finding out the truth and the real culprit.The anime also works the same way.For most of the first half of the show, the scriptwriters followed the original script rather closely, but our producers did make more and more changes to make the story flow better. These changes are a hit and miss. Most of these changes are done just to speed up the case, cutting down lots of the mundane stuff, such as making witnesses blurt out highly relevant information at a much quicker rate (you often need to dig hard for them in the games), and investigations are becoming rather short and hastily went through in favor for the trial scenes, which are also sped up to a degree where it could become difficult for anime-only viewers to solve the puzzle themselves, instead everything was revealed before the viewers could actually fully grasp the full extend of the case.Indeed, pacing is the greatest issue of this show. I believe that anime-only viewers will struggle with the super-quick pacing and might have to pause/rewind various scenes so that they can catch up with the story. In the games, you could slowly browse through the profiles of all the relevant people and all the evidences of the case, slowly piecing them out together to discover the real truth. But here, you will have to think faster as time is always ticking for every episode have a limited airing time. This may prove to be a huge factor in determining the enjoyment value of this show. (Then again, you could pause and rewind the episode, if that is your thing.)Moving on to the art department, which is the weakest point of this show. The character models aren\'t really drawn well if you compare them to their original game counterparts. Phoenix (Naruhodou) has overly emphasized lightning eyebrows, Maya (Mayoi) is obviously moe-fied, Detective Gumshoe (Itonokogiri) always appear in varying sizes, sometimes plump sometimes malnourished, etc etc. Animation at most times, stiff and minimal. 3D-CG was also utilized poorly, most evident from the grotesque audience of the court. The art may scare viewers away at the first few episodes, for they are, sad to say, really poor. The art gets better during the latter half, but still pretty below-par according to modern standards.Sound-wise, I\'d say Kaji Yuki portrayed Phoenix pretty well, the oomph when he yelled out ""Objection""! (""Igi Ari!"") was there, and his performance was pretty consistent throughout the show. The other characters have voices fitting to their roles, which is really nice to hear, as most of them do not have a voice in the games. For the soundtrack, various themes from the games are remixed and inserted in various scenes, however, I feel that the soundtrack list is too short, for there aren\'t many songs in the show, as well as some scenes did not have the right music at the right time.The good thing about anime adaptations, is that you get to flesh out the characters a lot more as compared to the game. The games are known to have a penchant of quirky characters, and A-1 Pictures did well in preserving these quirks, at the same time amplifying them sufficiently to give these characters more depth.So, is Gyakuten Saiban worth watching? This is a tough one, for I am left a little disappointed at the latter half of the show, seeing how they changed so many things, mostly for the worse. Admittedly, as a fan of the series, I have been waiting for an adaptation, and the show is great advertisement for viewers to check out the games, which, I guarantee, will be very worth your time, for they have really good storylines, great characters and it is quite satisfying seeing how the case unravels itself. Therefore, if you like, you could come over and watch this, even better if you decided to skip the show and go for the games instead. compared to its real-life counterpart. This show also bears strong supernatural elements, where the spirit channeling technique pretty much becomes the central theme of the story. Keep this in mind that you should not be expecting a fully realistic justice system.Even so, you will see trials being held in a courtroom, you will have witnesses providing testimonies, with the defense attorney cross-examining them, and you will see evidences and objections being thrown all over the place, with the two opposing sides, prosecutor and defense attorney getting into each others\' throats. So it could well be an entertaining ride if you are into this sort of thing.In the original games, you play as Phoenix Wright (Ryuuichi Naruhodou), a defense attorney whose job is to get his client (the defendant) acquitted, while his opposition, a prosecutor, would aim to get the defendant a guilty verdict instead. The game is mostly split into two parts: 1) An investigation part where you have to gather evidences, as well as clues from relevant people of the case; 2) The trial where you cross-examine the witness and search for contradictions, present evidence to prove why your defendant isn\'t guilty, as well as finding out the truth and the real culprit.The anime also works the same way.For most of the first half of the show, the scriptwriters followed the original script rather closely, but our producers did make more and more changes to make the story flow better. These changes are a hit and miss. Most of these changes are done just to speed up the case, cutting down lots of the mundane stuff, such as making witnesses blurt out highly relevant information at a much quicker rate (you often need to dig hard for them in the games), and investigations are becoming rather short and hastily went through in favor for the trial scenes, which are also sped up to a degree where it could become difficult for anime-only viewers to solve the puzzle themselves, instead everything was revealed before the viewers could actually fully grasp the full extend of the case.Indeed, pacing is the greatest issue of this show. I believe that anime-only viewers will struggle with the super-quick pacing and might have to pause/rewind various scenes so that they can catch up with the story. In the games, you could slowly browse through the profiles of all the relevant people and all the evidences of the case, slowly piecing them out together to discover the real truth. But here, you will have to think faster as time is always ticking for every episode have a limited airing time. This may prove to be a huge factor in determining the enjoyment value of this show. (Then again, you could pause and rewind the episode, if that is your thing.)Moving on to the art department, which is the weakest point of this show. The character models aren\'t really drawn well if you compare them to their original game counterparts. Phoenix (Naruhodou) has overly emphasized lightning eyebrows, Maya (Mayoi) is obviously moe-fied, Detective Gumshoe (Itonokogiri) always appear in varying sizes, sometimes plump sometimes malnourished, etc etc. Animation at most times, stiff and minimal. 3D-CG was also utilized poorly, most evident from the grotesque audience of the court. The art may scare viewers away at the first few episodes, for they are, sad to say, really poor. The art gets better during the latter half, but still pretty below-par according to modern standards.Sound-wise, I\'d say Kaji Yuki portrayed Phoenix pretty well, the oomph when he yelled out ""Objection""! (""Igi Ari!"") was there, and his performance was pretty consistent throughout the show. The other characters have voices fitting to their roles, which is really nice to hear, as most of them do not have a voice in the games. For the soundtrack, various themes from the games are remixed and inserted in various scenes, however, I feel that the soundtrack list is too short, for there aren\'t many songs in the show, as well as some scenes did not have the right music at the right time.The good thing about anime adaptations, is that you get to flesh out the characters a lot more as compared to the game. The games are known to have a penchant of quirky characters, and A-1 Pictures did well in preserving these quirks, at the same time amplifying them sufficiently to give these characters more depth.So, is Gyakuten Saiban worth watching? This is a tough one, for I am left a little disappointed at the latter half of the show, seeing how they changed so many things, mostly for the worse. Admittedly, as a fan of the series, I have been waiting for an adaptation, and the show is great advertisement for viewers to check out the games, which, I guarantee, will be very worth your time, for they have really good storylines, great characters and it is quite satisfying seeing how the case unravels itself. Therefore, if you like, you could come over and watch this, even better if you decided to skip the show and go for the games instead.', ""Really good anime that does the games justice. (Did I really just make that joke?) The music was great, the characters were very entertaining, and the story was extremely engaging. Episode 13 in particular was really heartfelt and shed some light on the Phoenix/Ryuichi's backstory. Highly recommend to fans to the series, as well as newcomers who want to get into Ace Attorney.It starts out like the first game, where we see a young woman get killed in her own apartment, and the murderer stating he'll pin it on Larry Butz, Phoenix/Ryuichi's best friend. As you may guess, Phoenix must prove Larry's innocence to...avoid him from being sentenced to prison.The anime is charming and comical, much like the games, and it really makes being a lawyer look cool as heck (keeping it kid-friendly, I like it).Overall, great anime with fun mysteries that will keep anyone entertained. 10/10. avoid him from being sentenced to prison.The anime is charming and comical, much like the games, and it really makes being a lawyer look cool as heck (keeping it kid-friendly, I like it).Overall, great anime with fun mysteries that will keep anyone entertained. 10/10."", ""Let me start off by saying that I have not played Ace Attorney. I know some things about it from friends that have played the game, but characterization, plot, story elements and the like are foreign to me.Story - Strong 6 - Weak 7Obviously there are only a few cases a season, and this show would have benefited from the long running format of TV anime. But it was decided to make this a seasonal show and so be it. It think the show does its best to speed through the elements it has and while they aren't always done well, I'd say they're entertaining....Although I can see why people who had played the game might be frustrated at the cut down abridged versions of their favorite characters.The first episode is... It's bad. It's rushed, obviously to set the formula for the series and establish characters and set pieces before launching into it's first big case. If you already knew the Ace Attorney games, I'd say you could even skip the first episode entirely which isn't a good thing.The rest of the cases are pretty decent though. While I don't think it's possible to figure it out the solution most of the time, I also don't think the show is working under the illusion that it wants you to? It would have made the show better, but i don't think it detracts too much.Art - strong 6Look. There's like maybe three locations in an episode and the background for the courtroom are used repeatedly. But the art looks fine. There isn't any problems with perspective and key frames are all good. There are even some nice dramatic rotating shots used far more appropriately than in other shows (it should be noted these are all done in the courtroom, where everything at least has a 3D model to reference off)Nothing particularly of note.sound - 4It's not bad sound. The sound effects are just all ripped directly from the game. There's very little inspiration here.character - 6The characters here are not the characters from the games. They are far simpler and straight forward because the show doesn't have enough time to elaborate as much as it would like. They aren't exactly begging your investment. But they serve to get the story across.Enjoyment - 9I love it. It's fun, it's stupid. It has immense trouble trying to summarize the excuses for it's plot inconsistencies. I often have fun with not quite average anime. I do not think someone who loves the games will find the enjoyment that is probably tainting my review in their watch, because of the sacrifices made.Overall - 6So in summary- Story is cut down from source material and this weakens the plot slightly- Art is of average quality for this studio and did not impact the viewing experience negatively- It should be noted the rotating shots are of good quality and appropriately used.- Sound is fine, OPs are of decent quality.

All scenes that were not involving court were nice and would have loved more of it. When they get into the courtroom, nearly everyone should get accused of contempt to court, even the judge. I wasn't expecting Law & Order level of details, but having each prosecutors openly manipulate the judge blew it. Same with the aura-boom blowing people in court kind of get boring after the 2nd episode, not funny anymore. Yet, I've managed to get to the bottom of...this because the cases were nice. this because the cases were nice."", ""This anime was my entry point to Ace Attorney as a whole, but I didn't spend much time watching it, because there is no point to it. The games are just so much better.The plot is pretty much adapted from the games, but the main issue here is that most of the cases feel rushed. The character development and jokes are all mushed together with all the facts of the case. Also cases that take like 5 hours to complete in the games, here are put in three 20 minute episodes. There's just not that much enjoyment from watching these be solved instead of...solving them yourself. Don't get me wrong the anime is properly done it can keep you in suspense and be enjoyable. But there is a better alternative.The art is decent, although things in the distance tend to be very sloppily drawn. You can look at ace attorney from a little different perspective. The camera work is also good.In summery I can recommend this anime to people that are new to Ace Attorney. Just watch like 2 - 5 episodes. If you like the idea, then go play the games.

Okay one more: 'this anime was terribad'!I guess it's not easy to do decent anime based on two games. Games that takes about 65 hours to beat them. But on the other side I loved Persona 4 anime, and to beat game you need over 100 hours.I will start with acceptable things (don't confuse them with good!). Animation was goo... decent. Sometimes I wanted to pluck my eyes off but well Maya looked nice. If we would change Franziska's lips I believe it would fix her weird looks too....And hmmm characters looked kinda like the ones in game. But all the time I had feeling that they are weird and creepy! Bodies looked awkward. Dunno maybe it is me.So let's look at Voice Actors. They did decent job but I just didn't like Phoenix's voice. Same goes for more characters. But that is just my opinion as you know in game we could hear only few words 'objection' and 'hold it'. But that was the thing that made Phoenix Wright the game awesome. It fit in this game style and I really always was feeling like shouting with him while pointing my finger like idiot at my console.What else made the games so good? Soundtrack. Making you feel the mood. And we can hear poor versions of them in anime. And it is not even used properly! Yes they messed it up! While in game you felt fired up with 'cross-examination theme' in anime... eh I guess they used it somewhere? Music was building suspense but anime didn't provide it at all. Etcetera etcetera.And you know what? That was the 'not worst part of anime'. Really!Story. They showed sketch of intriguing and sucking in stories. And in anime we couldn't feel it at all. Shortened into absolute minimum, skipping factors that made the twists work so well left us with pile of s... ah no swearing. Sorry but I really was pissed off when I watched this and saw what they did to plot. Where was the investigation that made us think 'what the hell really happened here'. Where were some barely visible clues? Skipped!Instead of dialogue that built the plot we got exposition! To be honest it reminded me of reading the checklist. 1. Phoenix talks to cop, 2. Phoenix finds out something (skip it, we will show it in point 4 or 5). You get the idea.You still don't believe it was terrible experience watching this anime? Okay so let's look at characters. We don't get any development! For example my least favorite one: Larry Butz. It is hard to say if he has any personality. At the beginning we see Phoenix save him in the court, we get a little, tiny piece of explanation that he is quite immature guy. While in game we got his goofy character clearly showed to us here even that didn't work.Also how usually we develop characters? Through story. And while story was bad you know what that mean. Next example: Miles Edgeworth. The DL-6 Case was his nightmare and we saved him, we 'killed' that nightmare. In anime it is barely mentioned! And we don't get how he hurt Phoenix when he ran away. Ah wait we got information about this in one of the last episodes! No build up for his come back, no nothing. And I could talk about this for hours writing way more but it's waste of time.And watching it was waste of time!

There are some short scenes throughout the series that make no sense in the context of the show and seem to only be there because they were in the game. For example, there was an episode where they showed a person as if they were examined but were never talked to in the show. There's one scene where it looks like a person fell in paint or something but...with no context.

The first time I saw it, I personally thought it to be an enjoyable experience overall. However, I do have to admit that it went on the Persona 5 route when it came to artwork and design.The soundtrack, on the other hand, is pretty great. Thankfully, they're not just re-using the low-quality GBA/DS samples for the soundtrack and actually have put in the tiniest amount of effort to remaster certain tracks. Pursuit...and Objection are my favorites, although I really like what they did with DL-6 and the Steel Samurai theme. Also, there are brand-new tracks that usually match up to the standards of the originals, and these were great. I really liked the orchestral feel of the soundtrack.The story is virtually the same as the games, but cramming in the first and second games into a mere 24 episodes definitely hurt the experience. I would not recommend anyone to watch the Ace Attorney anime before playing the games. The amount of aspects cut-out in place of really strange additions was too much for me. You could point a gun to my head and I still wouldn't be able to tell you why Maya goes to the Prosecutor's Office to obtain the DL-6 pistol and bullet and why Larry disguises himself as Edgey. The changes truly hurt the experience. Also, as is to be expected with a format change from a videogame to an anime, major events are less impactful and emotional.Disclaimer: I did watch the dub instead of sub because that's how I like experiencing media that I began in one language. The English voice actors were really good at certain points, though you cannot get me to like Helium Maya. Maximillion Galactica, Edgeworth, Gumshoe, among others are some of my favorites. I did see a few clips of the JP version, and I personally do not like how high-pitched Phoenix's voice is.

The games are all very dear to me, and the first three are, in my opinion, especially spectacular. This anime covers the events of the first two games.So, first, let\'s talk presentation. I quite like the background music, it\'s pretty fitting and the main theme is super catchy. Some of the court themes are a little underwhelming, but overall I\'d say the music does its job pretty well. Both the OPs and one of the EDs are very idoly - if you like idol music, you\'ll probably like them. If you...don\'t, then you probably won\'t. The other ED is a (in my opinion) very nice pop ballad. Cool.So, the character design. I actually think the characters generally look pretty visually appealing. They all look pretty similar if not identical to how they look in the games. Well, when they\'re not moving. Unfortunately, the animation is not so good. The characters are nearly always horribly off model. Not in a good KonoSuba way, in a ""this anime was far too rushed and lacking a decent budget"" kind of way. The animations aren\'t nice looking or interesting, they\'re just dull and bad. Also, side note, the background characters\' faces in this show look hideous. I get that they\'re going to look as good as the foreground characters - that would be pointless - but they just look appalling in this, sometimes even to the point of being distracting. When the faces in your show look distractingly bad, that\'s when there\'s a problem.There are also some strange changes to the story. I should note first though that there were always going to have to be some changes when adapting this series to anime. I understand this. Some changes were actually really good. Having screens in court to replace the game\'s UI works really well. That was a good change. On the other hand, sometimes certain characters were replaced with other ones for no reason whatsoever. It doesn\'t improve the show in any way, and just serves to confuse fans of the games. It\'s not like it ruined the show or anything, it just seemed super weird and unnecessary. Oh well.But now I want to talk about what I believe to be the real problem with this anime is. The reason fans of the games and newcomers alike found it to be pretty ""meh"". These games just don\'t work very well in a non-interactive medium. The whole joy of the Ace Attorney series comes from that ""aha!"" moment when you finally find a lie in a witness\'s testimony, when you discover a damning piece of evidence, and when you nail a killer. The whole satisfaction of these moments is YOU working it out, and that just doesn\'t really work as an anime. Sure, it can still be interesting to find out who did it and how in the anime, but the real satisfaction, the thing that made the series as successful as it is, comes from the interactivity of the game medium.So I think this anime wasn\'t awful. It had many enjoyable moments, and there are aspects that I really do like about it. But in somes ways, it never could have lived up the the heights of the games for me, and I think for many others too. It can be an interesting companion to the games, and I enjoyed seeing the stories I loved animated on screen, but as a stand alone series, I\'m afraid that this anime was, in my opinion, a failure.Nevertheless, I look forward to the next season. Maybe the animation will be better. I hope so. don\'t, then you probably won\'t. The other ED is a (in my opinion) very nice pop ballad. Cool.So, the character design.

The whole satisfaction of these moments is YOU working it out, and that just doesn\'t really work as an anime. Sure, it can still be interesting to find out who did it and how in the anime, but the real satisfaction, the thing that made the series as successful as it is, comes from the interactivity of the game medium.So I think this anime wasn\'t awful. It had many enjoyable moments, and there are aspects that I really do like about it. But in somes ways, it never could have lived up the the heights of the games for me, and I think for many others too. It can be an interesting companion to the games, and I enjoyed seeing the stories I loved animated on screen, but as a stand alone series, I\'m afraid that this anime was, in my opinion, a failure.Nevertheless, I look forward to the next season. Maybe the animation will be better. I hope so.', 'If you watch this before playing the games, ur killing ur chances to experiment the amazing masterpiece Ace Attorney (AA) is, so pls, start with the games!!You only have to play the first one to be able to watch this anime!""Why is the anime so bad?"": It\'s NOT bad, is just that.... not even counting the immersion u get by playing the games and finding the truth by yourself.... the anime is just too short to be as good as the games. The character development, the scenarios, everything just in just 12 episodes of 20~ minutes is not even close to be enough! On anime...there\'s just seconds to watch some places, almost no time to watch closely each evidence, each person, each scenario, each crime scene.... no time to think either. That totally ruins Ace Attorney.If it helps you to trust this random u know nothing about (or not whatever), let me tell you I played....- AA1,2,4: More than 7 times each start to finish not skiping any case or text.- AA3: 12 times already, and thinking about replaying it soon (best one!).- AA5,6: Twice each not skiping anything (Unpopular opinion maybe but almost as good as AA3).- AA Investigations 1,2: First twice, 2nd once. These are spin offs btw.- Layton/AA crossover: Just once.I also played every Android version of the games once.PD: I know, I\'m insane playing a game (specially a  visual novel wich has no gameplay-reason to replay it) that many times hahah But that also shows how good AA is and how much I love it, so I really don\'t want anyone to kill their AA experience by watching first the anime! there\'s just seconds to watch some places, almost no time to watch closely each evidence, each person, each scenario, each crime scene.... no time to think either.

AA is a great series altogether, even with some hiccups here and there. And of course, much like with most video games, there's bound to be an anime adaptation to follow. I've already discussed my distain with the Persona 5 anime last year, so I guess you could day that my expectations for this one wasn't very high. With that said, while I don't think this is a better alternative to the games, I do think this is a pretty decent...adaptation, albeit with some caveats along the way.Story: A straightforward plot based on the games, but Ace Attorney focuses on defense attorney Phoenix Wright who became a defense lawyer to protect those who were wrongfully accused. During these trials though, he bites off more than he can chew when he realizes the courtroom is much more than just a guess who scenario. There's tons of reveals and secrets that I do not want to spoil here since it's heavily required to play the games to understand what I am talking about. Besides that, it's mostly fine for what it is. Obviously, there are cuts to shorten the episodes, but I don't find it as irritating here especially when it comes between the fluff that the games have at times. One of the biggest examples is...*sigh* Big Top Turnabout. While I do not like this case, I thought it wasn't as obnoxious here than in the games because of how fast it went, only clocking in around 3 parts (thank God) and getting rid of some annoying sub plots. Overall, a decent adapted plot, but not anything mind blowing. 6/10Characters: Again, as an adaptation from the games. the characters mostly remains the same way as they were. None of them were untouched or shifted in terms of personality. With that said, if we're going based off of the games, most of these characters are great. And in the anime, they do try their best to give these characters more depth. It's good. 7/10Art: Now THIS is where the anime really shines. It's animation. I heard horror stories about how poorly animated the show was. What's crazy is that it was done by the same studio behind Fairy Tale and Kaguya-sama: Love is War. So I have to ask, what happened here? It's NOT as bad as others point it out to be, but I won't lie when I say that the HD sprites in the PW: AA trilogy looked better than this. And I don't even like the HD sprites all that much. In close to the characters, the animation looks fine. But when they're far away, it's so funny to look at. Especially with the eyes. Not that good in my opinion. 5/10Sound: The soundtrack is mostly just renditions of the original soundtrack. I love the game's soundtrack. It's so good. and the anime does the games justice with these good tracks. The English dub is fine for what it is. I seriously thought it was Sam Riegel who was playing Phoenix only to find out that it wasn't. But still Eric Vale did a good job playing as the main character. 7/10Enjoyment and Verdict: In contrast to the Persona 5 anime, this adaptation is fine for what it is. I personally prefer you play the games over watching the anime any time of the week, but the anime isn't bad. I don't think every AA fan will love this anime, but it does a decent job of following the footsteps of the games, even if there are some sacrifices (though some of them are DEFINITELY necessary).

A skip here or there, avoiding pointless dialogue, that would be ok.However the entire anime was rushed. Instead of translating a single game into a single season, two games were merged. 2 cases were entirely skipped, one major, many facts have been hidden or changed. It was annoying to say the least. But this was bearable untill the very last case in which everything was changed, characters, story, facts, even ending. For what?...The anime even had audacity to make references to the case it didn’t show as was the case of blue badger.My verdict is clear. Not only the game is better, the anime is simply not an adaptation, but an author version. Don’t play the game, because it’s a game, play it, because it’s the true story and not a fake one like here.Other than that I really enjoyed audiovisual layer, although I watched dubbed since everyone plays game in English.

On the one hand, the plot around the court and this whole search for evidence and speculation was quite interesting even if the implementation is terrible.. On the other hand, the anime, really had properties that I kept thinking to myself ""Why are you doing this?""There were about 5 different cases that were worked out quite well and could be maintained over a period of 2-3-4 and even up to 5 episodes. . The characters weren\'t really bleak either, they had more human traits and were easier...to understand. Extreme exaggeration was lacking here, but it was not entirely out of the question.Unfortunately, the anime also had an urge to ridicule some of its cases. For example, that everything is set up properly and there is no resolution for a case. In the scenario, it is simply pushed over the table with some excuse, which has nothing to do with the actual events, only to bring an end to the case. See e.g. spoilerSpoiler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There is not enough evidence to defeat the perpetrator in court and he walks off the field confidently since there was no longer a target. But then a person comes up from the realm of the dead and throws a note on his head, in which the names of his blackmailed politicians are written and he suddenly confesses everything?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Something like that is of course just disappointing when you consider that 4 episodes were used to build this interesting case, just to insert such an ending. The same applies to some others.Most of the time, the appropriate reasons were simply missing. The structure and implementation of the cases were interesting, but they almost never managed to come to a useful end and somehow put everything together. There are also plenty of parodies on YouTube that convert these shortcomings into amusing gags.The thing with the spiritual stuff and the summoning of spirits was just completely inappropriate.Just like the character of the protagonists constantly giving up at the end of a case and dropping everything, just so that someone tells you not to give up and suddenly he no longer gives up. This property was also quite troublesome, especially since it wasn\'t just thathad a unique appearance. I also found the point that the characters were able to fire a kind of shock wave by hitting the wound point of a statement. It was weird but kinda funny after all.I don\'t want to start talking about the judge in the courtroom. I really don\'t know how he got his job. I had the feeling he didn\'t even understand why he was there in the first place.Story:The Main Story was missing the ""red thread"". It was a series of successive cases that occurred over a longer period of time. In other words, there was no real plot after all.There were certainly changes, characters came and went and relationships changed slightly, but there was nothing more behind the action.As interesting as the cases were, they only told their own short story without any connections expect for the first case.Animation / pictures:I don\'t know what to make of the animations. These were quite close to falling well below the average.These animations corresponded roughly to the level of the actual game, but the effort was hardly comparable to any other work.Also, the characters rarely had to move, which means that there were hardly any animations regarding the movement apart from the ""objection"".Characters:The characters were a little more satisfactory.The protagonist Ryuuichi was a typical clumsy and idealist. He tried to help people in the name of justice and to go his own way. His personality was not particularly sophisticated and can be summed up well with the above two words. He also had no real change in the anime, which means that he simply remained the same person from start to finish.Mayoi was the typical innocent good girl who was allowed to be in the courtroom for an unknown reason. Apart from that,she was a medium that could come into contact with the dead. About her personality there is to say that she was very excited, a fan girl for different superheroes and is often hyperactive. She hadn\'t gone through any remarkable changes and remained the same.Reiji, on the other hand, was already a bit deeper character than these two. He had a slight change in his character and was also dealt with a little more. His personality was very calm, cold and cool, even if he was often upset about surprises.Music:The musical performance in the intro was just average, and the endings were nothing special. There was one or the other useful East, but there was very little choice either. You can clearly see that not too much effort has been put into the work.My conclusiontoThis anime is a double-edged sword. On the one hand he had cases of interesting structure and the characters were not a disaster, on the other hand the cases were closed quite laughably and the actual story was often ridiculed. If you had put more effort into this work, it would have had potential to become very interesting.Until the end, i really wonder if the Games are actually better. to understand.

My expectations were on the floor, and it managed to meet that much at the very least. (It\'s my automatic reposnce to knowing A-1 Pictures was the studio behind it.)I have played the games. Which means I noticed where they changed the events. Some changes were really annyoing (the removal of big character building moments/heartfelt scenes). But I do love what they did for Big Top Turnabout and it\'s actually one of the better sets of episodes in my opinion. (Which I am really greatful...for cause that is my least favourite case in the trilogy.) They also added new scenes and more background for the Phoenix-Edgeworth-Larry dynamic that I actually really enjoyed. So there\'s a balanace of nice and not nice changes from the source material.I watched the dub. I normally avoid dubs at all costs, but because I knew this was going to be something not worth my full attention, I put on the dub so I can multitask with it on. And I think that\'s what made my experiance more tolerable. If I had to give it my full attention I would have given up within a couple of episodes as the animation is nothing interesting to actually look at. The amount of times I glanced over and fully paid attention, only to think ""what the-"" at the animation. I\'d be amazed if there isn\'t a compilation video of that weird jank.Oh, and the voice acting and dialog was as cringe as I was expecting. ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌Otherwise, it\'s just a condensed recap. So the only real audience I can imagine this is for, is people who don\'t want to play the games nor watch a Let\'s Play but want to know what happens story wise or as a recap.

TV series based on the context."", 'I fucking love Phoenix Wright - Ace Attorney. The original GBA trilogy is GOATed, some of the best video games of all time so damn good. They\'re on PC, consoles and handheld platforms remastered, I recommend playing them ASAP. This anime honestly isn\'t that. It\'s decent, and if you\'re an Ace Attorney fan you shouldn\'t miss it. But it takes the spark of the original series and does it a mid-job.Obviously a key problem is that the story designed for a Nintendo GBA game isn\'t necessarily going to translate well to anime form. Some of the most satisfying moments when playing the first two games...(the games this one adapts) are figuring out a key piece of evidence through deep thought. Sometimes your own ""genius"" shocks you when playing the game lol, but this isn\'t the case when watching the anime obviously. It\'s comical to say but in this series Phoenix seems way more competent than he does in the original games. Being kinda clueless but just going with whatever bluff he can make up adds to the humour of the original series, but those key moments of wit and frankly genius on the a part of Wright make for an interesting and well rounded character. This element doesn\'t completely fail in the adaptations but again, it just doesn\'t have the same spark. Figuring out an objection and having Phoenix scream object, without that damned background music playing anymore, was ample evidence that you had just kicked ass and found a contradiction. Such a satisfying thing. But I digress.It\'s a decently enjoyable show. The suspense isn\'t really there so the extent I would like it to be, it was way more enjoyable in the games. The story is paced well enough, with longer cases in the games being adapted over more episodes. It is a tad faster than it should be however, they fixed this in the second season. A key issue I have is how this show handles tone. There are some pretty serious moments in the original DS games, but this adaptation seems to gloss them over like they\'re no big deal. It\'s true that Phoenix and Maya were often light-hearted towards pretty dark things in the games but this anime takes it to a new level. The animation style just seems kinda generic, the intro songs are meh in my opinion as well. I guess I liked how the potential romance thingy between Phoenix and Maya was explored a little more here, even if comedically. Just my inner shipper I suppose.Ehh pretty mediocre show, but occasionally the great elements of the original games shine. 6/10.

I love these games, the original trilogy is among some of my favourite games ever released and I think that the rest of the series is also really good. I didn't go into this anime expecting to like it, I also wanted to watch the english dub so i could hear the names of the characters that I actually knew instead of the original names. To say i find the english dub the most entertaining part of this show is an understatement since they make it so much funnier.That aside, this show just proves that some games cannot be made...into anime, it just drags out things that went by instantly in the games and it doesn't do it well.It's a good anime to have in the background while doing something else, but that's about it. Play the games instead or listen to the bloopers for the English dub, they're infinitely more entertaining than the show into anime, it just drags out things that went by instantly in the games and it doesn't do it well.It's a good anime to have in the background while doing something else, but that's about it.

My only interaction with the games was through the memes, so I cannot comment on the anime's adaptation of the game. From what I have heard it was adapted quite poorly.That being said, the anime as a standalone piece of entertainment is pretty good. While a large part of every arc is pretty slow and not that interesting, the anime's intense moments in court scenes and the excellent choice of music in them more than make up...for it.The arcs are in the most part only a few episodes long, which is a good thing in this case, as the majority of time in every arc is spent gathering clues for the case. When the court cases get towards the end you get rewarded handsomely for sticking to it. The intense interactions make you cheer for the protagonist with all your heart.Overall the Ace attorney anime is pretty slow, easy going and very uplifting/cheerful. I consider it a nice mix of slice of life and action anime. It's perfect for when you want to relax and want to watch a few episodes (IMO best to watch an arc in one sitting, that being 3-4 episodes).If you are looking for an intense action packed story or a morally ambiguous anime this is most likely not what you are looking for, but it is a nice and wholesome change of pace to soothe your heart. for it.The arcs are in the most part only a few episodes long, which is a good thing in this case, as the majority of time in every arc is spent gathering clues for the case.

But here every character so far is so much simplifield, it\'s hard to take the plot serious. There is no tension like ""Did he/sehe tell the truth?"" or ""Wow! Didn\'t saw that comig!"" Instead everything is just so obvious and it\'s like the show doesn\'t even want you to think about the cases.On top of that, most of the characters so far behave like cartoonish morons, unable to...see any contradiction until someone says so.Also,if you know at least a little bit about lawsuits, you can already see mistakes for example how evidences are used, especially when they are new, or the ludicrous arguments used sometimes. And, oh, did I tell you about the outlandish behaviour of the most of the characters so far?To keep it short, if you\'re interested in at least somehow realistic lawsuits inside anime, better watch some episodes of Detective Conan.

Himitsu no Akko-chan 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3839/Himitsu_no_Akko-chan_3,"['Compared to the 1969 and 1988 versions of the anime, THIS particular remake is LESS of an improvement than those two.Made primarily using early digital animation, THIS remake series is NOT a very good one. The production quality has not aged well with time. At least, when you compared the art style to that of the 1960s version of it.I watched a few RAW versions of episodes that i could find online and i gotta say that i had found it okay. At least, by the standards of animes that aired around the late 1990s.But Japanese audiences seemed to have harsher opinions of THIS series...with regards of how cheap it looked. According to related online sources, merchandise sales were pretty ABYSMAL and considered as DEAD ON ARRIVAL.Combination of LOW related toy sales and POOR TV ratings had led to the series being cancelled within LESS than 1 year as well as NO theatrical movies released unlike the previous versions where the 1969 version had ONE movie whereas the 1988 version had TWO movies.Yikes.....Poor 1998 Akko-chan......At least, your outfit was.....cute.....kind of.....sort of......Do you want a hug from me to comfort you for this unfortunate failure ? with regards of how cheap it looked.

It all revolves around a psychic teacher who causes various problems to the school and makes everything seem much more funny and adventurous than normal.

However, this show is to be watched when someone feels like having a good time laughing a bit. Also, there were some episodes that dealt with the lifeArt:The art wasn't really interesting. I have actually seen similar types of art in anime that have just 5...minute episodes. However I must state that the art in the last episode looked so much different, though it wasn't the typical art you would see in a 2012 anime, but it was really nice, I like Reibai-sensei's character design.Sound:I don't really remember anything remarkable about the sound, except from the ending! It was really catchy.Character:There was actually some character development, the character personalities were intense and everyone seemed to have something like a label.

Reibai Sensei, a small class of students receives a new teacher: the occult-loving Kibayashi Juri who speaks with spirits and yokai and who promptly summons the spirit of Oda Nobunaga into the body one of her students (permanently), burning down her classroom as their new school life begins.Most episodes revolve either around the various classmates (some of them being an hilariously poor girl, a delinquent who kinda looks like a Cromartie High School character and an adorable aho-genki girl) interacting with Kibayashi and sometimes with the science teacher Nagara-sensei, her rival who doesn't believe in the occult, thrown...into the mix. Be it hosting a mystery hotpot party or infiltrating a mysterious inn in Mt. Cat to help their friend from another class find her missing cat, this teacher and her class never have a peaceful day. Let's also not forget the 4 or 5 episode long subplot revolving around the feline characters. There's Kuroneko, a male black cat with an extremely adorable voice who has a fateful encounter with the very own King of Cats and the three really cool space cats from the We Wanna Conquer Earth Squad who came to Earth in order to rule it with an iron paw.There isn't much to say about the animation, it kinda looks like it was animated in flash and is almost slideshow-like... except for the last episode which is very, very special and different, but that's something for you to find out. I wouldn't call the animation bad either way, I think the budget style fits this kind of anime well. The three different EDs are all amazing too, especially the last one, too bad they're very short. There's not much character development either if at all, but there are some small interesting moments where certain characters break out of their archetypes.All in all, this is a really good short with some laughs to be had and it's worth watching for Kibayashi's and the cat's designs alone, they're all very cute. into the mix.

Lured by the cover image, I pressed the play button and unexpectedly discovered that it is a gem and I\'m stuck at my pc screen for the following 22 5-minute episodes. Probably due to short episodes format the storytelling is bold and fast-paced (same as in Saiki Kusuo). Jokes are very random in first episodes, somewhat resembling a softer version of South Park or Robo Chicken, but after some time become repetitive, and stories gradually shift from fun to touching (strong Gintama vibes).I loved how artist put random funny stuff on background,...and the details put into every character: each of them had a strong presence and added value to the story (except for tsukkomi guy, but he was more or less fine too).One thing that somewhat ruined the mood was cliched settings of some episodes: ""festival"", ""beach"", ""scary stories"", sounds familiar? It only missed the school sports event for full set, but that\'s probably just because of insufficient air time. I swear there is some guy in editors board of every created anime that tells ""you have to make your series as unoriginal as possible at cost of your lives!""Well, that\'s all from me, I\'m off to reading the manga! and the details put into every character: each of them had a strong presence and added value to the story (except for tsukkomi guy, but he was more or less fine too).One thing that somewhat ruined the mood was cliched settings of some episodes: ""festival"", ""beach"", ""scary stories"", sounds familiar?

However, the plot moves a fucking mile a minute - bad anime misunderstanding that stretch out into 1-3 whole episodes in other shows get fucking slammed into 6 minutes and are done with, whether the characters really should be over them or not.Art:...4, looks decent but has absurd, erroneous cinematography issues.

A boy in a sweatshirt during episode 4 stands up in an up and to the right maneuver, which somehow results in him flipping 540 degrees, putting the sweatshirt fully back on, and grabbing a girl\'s midriff.Sound: 6, yeah, sounds fine, except for whenever someone gets slapped by a male and it shatters their bones and the sound barrier.Character: 2, dear god, what? Character motivations for being into the MC stand on barely any ground or none at all. Side characters show some spirit, but a lack of human logic.The main character\'s a bland shy baby that the girls like for no reason.Fuuka is an enjoyably enthusiastic character but she\'s insane - shatters his phone one day, asks to see the picture the next. Super sensitive about her panties for the opening plot point, but then hangs her ass in front of the MC\'s face in a swimsuit without any concerns at all for minutes on end (her end am I right?

This was not the best.First off, this show was one of the WORST dramas I\'ve ever seen in my life. It\'s so forced and the pacing of everything is terrible. Everything is forced i this show. Someone will say something then infer the exact opposite or take something personally that wasn\'t directed towards them.The pacing could not be any worse. One event will happen right after the other and then they\'ll get distracted and go on to something...else entirely. (Also their ""problems"" are always solved within one episode.) The ""drama"" is just a bunch of plot conveniences and a stupid love triangle that makes no sense in the first place. The love triangle consists of Yukka(I think that\'s his name), Fuuka, and Koyuki. Only problem is that Yukka shows in one of the very first episodes to be more committed to Fuuka, than Koyuki and he does it time and time again showing he\'s more committed to Fuuka. This shows that it is unnecessary to even consider Koyuki an option, But for the sake of forced drama........The charaters in this show are so bland. Starting with Yukka, he is the most boring. We all know that he is a stick in the mud,and he is antisocial??? That was all I could get from him. The blonde one is basically there just to clear up any ""drama"" between Yukka and Fuuka. Finally Fuuka,she is maybe the most interesting out of all of them. She likes to sing, she jumps to a lot of conclusions, and wants to make her own decisions. Fuuka never really goes beyond her character. She stays consistent with jumping to conclusions singing, and talking about bands, or wanting to start hers.The art for this show is good at best. At times it\'s inconsistant and almost jarring to even look at. It\'s color scheme it has is very cool, to which I have to commend them for. They made it so that the colors flow smoothly but the focus is still obvious.  It\'s character designs are good-looking, but like had said, it\'s almost jarring to look at them when they gook so off model with them.Overall I was neutral to this show it was boring to be honest and the only things keeping me hooked were the opening song and fanservice.

Fuuka, the main character, in my eyes is a person who doesn\'t afraid to take risks in her life but she is also too guarded and secretive.However the anime has suspense and it\'s being a little bit rushy at the beginning which makes you wonder, what it will become at the next episode? How things will end up now? So i see it as a positive thing!The art is magnificent and everything looks so...realistic to me! It perfectly fits with the story and some backgrounds were outstanding!The characters are all mixed up i\'ll say. Like our society, they are a variety of characters that they have different personalities, weaknesses and strengths but there is always a balance in between! They are all acting so realistic which satisfies me enough to not skip the anime!I am really enjoying the series, my overall score (by far) it\'s an 8 and if i\'ll enjoy it even more at the end i might give it a 9! The show is good i\'ll gladly recommend it to those who love Music and Romance type of anime!Reply       My Messages       Delete realistic to me!

It's also a music anime which you don't need to be ashamed of if any of your parents catch you watching it (No stages full of girls doing cringy cut/paste dancing in horrible fps). So the anime...starts off weird, i personally did not enjoy the first episode as much as the others as i felt like the meeting of the characters was completely unnatural and felt a little forced. Regardless, the characters develop a friendship in the first episode despite their rocky beginnings. The more episodes I watched, the more I actually enjoyed.Fuuka is a sweet, adorable girl with a passion for music, and is incredibly friendly, and cares deeply about her friends. She is shy, and unexperienced with love, and likewise with Yuu, so their characters are quite cute as they eventually develop feelings for one another despite Yuu and Fuuka have a slight speedbump in their relationship, allowing for them to discover what the other means to them.On to the music side of things, the sense of time in this anime is a little weird being honest, like at times it skips days,weeks, months which i personally feel works with this anime, as it saves having montages of characters developing their skills. The anime did make it seem like learning an instrument and making a song is childs play, which we all know for a fact that its quite the opposite. The first song the band learns is Climbers high by a band in the anime called Hedgehogs (whom also play a vital role in the development of the music),  and the song was played at the schools culture festival which had a shaking start, but as the band began playing, the crowd warmed up to them and it was a great success. I have no clue why, but when the band was playing and having a great time, I was always getting goosebumps while watching it, i guess I was so happy for everyone.Anyways, im sick of writing a review so imma just say again that lifes too short to hate things, watch an anime and look for the things you enjoyed about it, and not the things you didnt. starts off weird, i personally did not enjoy the first episode as much as the others as i felt like the meeting of the characters was completely unnatural and felt a little forced.

So HERE is what truly happened to Fuuka.Why is the manga 7,5 and this anime much more lower rated 6,6 and also ""hated"" by some other people.The first few episodes were like allright everything was going according to plan all just to reach a certain point in which in the manga actually made the story good, but in the anime they decided to throw all of it away.*SPOILER ALEERT*[spoiler]In the manga Truck-kun comes and sends Fuuka to isekai(not really she just dies) and then the protagonist becomes all depressive on how he could\'ve saved her and how he lost THE LOVE...OF HIS LIFE, other girls jump onto him later tho. ON THE OTHER HAND the anime decided to go on steins;gate timeline not some deviated shitty timeline where for some reason his lover goes to ""isekai"", BUT GUESS WHAT! ""The death of fuuka that actually made the Story good and how the protagonist deals with her death were just like MEH lets throw all of it in the trash"" - So the producers thought.I was Legit watching the anime Till I reached TRUCK-KUN scene, but then she escaped death And I was like ""IS this really Fuuka?????"" wtf happened to the original plotline. Then it went like ""aight"" she didn\'t dieded and the story took a whole other route[/spoiler].*END OF THE SPOILER*Don\'t get me wrong The Plot of this anime was already average/good on the manga, but they just decided to take a bit of Pity on the Protagonist, after What happened to him in the original plot, and this actually took out the one thing about this show that made it different from many others.IN Summary: Read the manga if you want Depression PlotlineORSee the anime if you want Average Plotline OF HIS LIFE, other girls jump onto him later tho.

The mediocre meter measured a change of 0.43, in other words, the ending and the last minute changes destroyed the animation. It is boring and mediocre. We want to block it in our memory next to Bing Bong. Usually, a series will rise in the last chapters, but Fuuka is one exception let me correct that, 2017 winter season deception.No matter if you follow the manga or not, you will feel that they took the wrong direction.

For example, imagine Vegeta. In the manga, he is arrogant, self- entitled and ruthless, but now we take him into the animation and change him as the lover of all the living creatures. It is like seeing a dog eating cat food and meowing.You can't explain why they focus several episodes on some characters if they were planning to trash them. The drama is forced. The romance is weird, from nowhere the characters start loving each other. Their actions and decisions lack background because the story isn't well developed.There is a big crater in the story, details that you can't explain or aren't needed for the new thing. Even if they wanted to change the story from the manga, they shouldn't tease the watchers with details from the manga (street lights). There were better solutions than this aberration, and we could have enjoyed it more.But not everything is bad. There are some cameos with Suzuka if you are a follower of that story. The art is fine, and the music is good. I am wondering if the main idea of the adaptation was selling the songs because selling the episodes is going to be a pain.Finally, if you want to spend some fun time, perhaps you should pick other animation, you could feel disappointed after watching this. My score is 5.0, I saw Suzuka, but I wanted to see this animated in a different way. All these decisions killed any opportunity for a second seasonNow let's give this adaptation some awards (for more info read my profile).

In my opinion, the most essential thing of all is a relatable personality. Otherwise, the audience won’t be able to sympathise with the character at all. This is why people are criticising Kirito from Sword Art Online for being too overpowered; while at the same time praising Saitama from One Punch Man even though he’s litteraly one of the most overpowered characters in all of fiction including the bible. What makes us care about him is his altruism and normal life style. He’s depicted as a normal dude who just happens to be a godlike figure, whereas Kirito is depicted...as a godlike figure who just happens to be a normal dude.This is also why the characters in Fuuka never succeeds in making me give two shits about them. From the get go we are presented with a main character whose actions are as logical as a flat Earth painted by Dali. Not only does he decide to hang out with the psycho who just smashed his phone into a million pieces, but he also decides not to mention the fact that the very famous singer said psycho loves is an old childhood friend of his; something he doesn’t tell her until episode four, after they’ve gone to her concert together.This is where we as an audience gets pulled out of the immersion of the show. Because just like a magic trick isn’t as effective if we’re able to see the card hidden in the sleeve, a show loses its credibility if the audience are able to see the hand of the director. In this case it’s painfully obvious that the only reason why the main character acts as he does, is to create drama later on. In other words, the show sacrifices its inner logic in favor of a spicy story.In fact, the whole show is a little bit too convenient. The main character just happens to be a childhood friend of Fuuka’s favorite singer. Their teacher just happens to be a member of Fuuka’s favorite band. The person Yuu tweets with just happens to be sitting in front of him. The list goes on. And when you have so many examples of coincidences stacked on top of each other, it becomes impossible to relate to anything that happens just because it’s so unbelievable.The shallow characters combined with the bad story structure results in a big ol’ mess. The show never seems to figure out what it wants to be, and by the time you reach the end you get a feeling of what was the point? The only real charachter development in the whole show is that Yuu learns how to play the bass on a professional level in the span of what feels like a few weeks, that’s it. In the end, Fuuka expects you to relate to unrelatable characters and believe an unbelievable story.

The show never seems to figure out what it wants to be, and by the time you reach the end you get a feeling of what was the point? The only real charachter development in the whole show is that Yuu learns how to play the bass on a professional level in the span of what feels like a few weeks, that’s it. In the end, Fuuka expects you to relate to unrelatable characters and believe an unbelievable story. And not to mention, it’s pretty &#@% boring.', ""♦Why I think 'Fuuka' deserves a better rating ♦ |||NO SPOILERS|||Not that I'm an otaku but I have been watching a lot of animes. Personally, my favourite are animes about magic (lots of fantasy basicly) so any other must really try hard to get my attention.What drew my attention was the energy of the main character Fuuka, I tend to be alike a little (hehe). So it kind of swept me on board this anime and I continued watching. Whether you believe me or not, I really thought it would end different. You know what I mean I don't have to spoiler. But the fact...that it didn't, maybe I liked that even more. It was more honest this way, no matter how hard the truth can be.I liked the pace of the anime, from time to time you hear them say 'it's been x weeks' so you know time is really passing by fast and you're only seeing the important parts. (Like you know, even in soap series you don't see everything like every toilet visit for instance.) They could have made this a 24 episodes anime but I like it better this way, it showed us what it wanted to show and no unnecessarily information to fill it up.The art work is also great, I just can't stand to watch those old or bad quality animes. (sorry) Art work is really important for me because it brings the emotions out better.Sound was great, I love how we actually heard their songs. (instead of skipping that part because of expenses) But also their practices and everything in between.It bothered me a little how long it took them to realize who was in love with who. But I guess even if that wasn't the problem, it's still not easy. Being in love that is. But besides that, there were also characters who seemed to know exactly what was going on and I wish them the best. ♥☺Overall I really liked this anime ( I didn't cry!... I didn't!!)So I'd definitely recommend it! that it didn't, maybe I liked that even more.

Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not. And in Fuuka's case, I am honestly not sure what to think of it, because its original elements ended up turning an already mediocre manga into an equally mediocre anime... but for totally different reasons.Before I get into this though, I would just like to mention that Fuuka is actually a next generation sequel to an older series called Suzuka. To get straight to the point, no you do *not* need to watch/read it before watching this anime as they are wholly separate stories. All you really need to know is that the protagonist and main heroine of Suzuka are Fuuka's parents, and that they are both national level athletes. That aside Suzuka is a ten times better romance manga than Fuuka has ever been so I would still definitely recommend it if you have the time (never watched its anime though but as far as I know it was a very incomplete adaptation so you are probably better off with the manga).In any case, Fuuka is to a large extent a rather old school and cliché romance drama. We begin with the fairly reserved and introverted protagonist Haruna Yuu who prefers to spend his spare time on Twitter over hanging out with friends, who one day moves to a new town. There he runs into a strange yet energetic girl with blue hair called Akatsuki Fuuka; a girl running around wearing a pair of headphones and listening to an old CD-player instead of using a phone. Some misunderstandings ensue, but the two of them eventually sort things out, and in the process end up befriending each other. And so begins the spark of a potential romance in the making. Fuuka is someone living with an uncertain future. Because of her parents she is largely expected to become a professional athlete as well, but that is not something she wants to become. Instead, she spends a lot of time outside hanging out with Yuu in order to try to find what she really wants to do in life. And eventually, the answer she arrives at with Yuu's help, is music, which alongside romance is the central theme of the story as the two of them set out to start a band together with their friends from school.It all sounds simple enough, but unfortunately, there are some serious problems with Fuuka as an anime. First and foremost, the drama is incredibly forced and unnatural more often than not. Numerous times we have girls just so happening to show up at *just* the right/wrong moment in order to catch Yuu in some interaction with another girl, leading to misunderstanding upon misunderstanding which the story then has to go about an episode or two sorting out only to return to the status quo again. There is even a scene in the first episode where Yuu and Fuuka are supposed to meet up in town and end up missing each other for a ridiculously long time just because they were standing on opposite sides of a statue at their decided meeting location. I mean seriously? Just how stupid is that? Or how about how she just casually breaks his phone in the opening scene of the show just because he (completely unintentionally) caught a glimpse of her panties? I mean people... would not normally do that, not to mention how Yuu actually reacts to the situation as if it somehow *is* normal. The story has a tendency of generating its continuity through quite simply retarded character behavior which in turn results in drama.The second problem is the characters themselves. While Fuuka is an all-round likable girl with her cheerful and constantly energetic personality, she, just like everyone else in the show, has a tendency to sometimes act incredibly abnormal just for sake of drama as mentioned previously. But you also have to ask just why she would fall in love with Yuu to begin with? Sure, he helped her find a new passion in music by starting a band together, but beyond that Yuu is kind of a doormat. He is cautious and anti-social in nature and generally just follows along wherever Fuuka drags him along, and just feels incredibly bland and uninteresting in general. And do not even get me started on the other band members, they are so forgettable and have so little character development that their sole purpose in the show is effectively to be Yuu's and Fuuka's sidekicks by providing instrumental support. The final character of note is Hinashi Koyuki: an old childhood friend of Yuu who has now become a popular idol. She creates what is a rather unnecessary love triangle by frequently trying to get in-between Fuuka and Yuu, which not only causes drama in-between them but also on a larger scale when her idol otaku fans find out about her feelings after some pictures end up being leaked on the internet. And now we are really getting into the epitome of ridiculous character behavior by seeing how aggressively and violently some of her fans react to the news. Granted I am well aware that there are in fact some really crazy idol fans out there in the real world too, but still come on.The third and final major issue with Fuuka is the anime original content. This is fairly difficult to talk about without spoiling anything, but basically everything from the middle of episode eight and onwards is all anime original. Now, the manga is quite infamous for having one of the most wtf plot twists ever a couple of volumes in which completely alters the story for all future, and not in a good way. This also happens to be one of the worst kept secrets in the anime community though so if you have somehow avoided being spoiled on this then... congratulations. As stupid as this development was though, it was at least quite unique, and really it is without a doubt the most memorable part of the entire manga. So when the anime then decided to not even adapt this at all and instead to go off do something different altogether, I was left with some rather mixed feelings. Sure, if the original version is bad to begin with then doing something else in the anime is not a bad idea on paper, but replacing it with something equally mediocre is not really an improvement. The manga's version was at least unorthodox and unexpected even if it was dumb, but the anime's version is bad *and* generic on top of it. I do not know about you, but personally I would rather take the former. Furthermore, the reason the manga's development is bad is not because of the twist itself (that was actually kind of cool I thought), but rather that the author seemingly ran out of steam completely because ever since it happened, there has been absolutely nothing good happening in it, and that is now over 100 chapters ago... which is kind of inexcusable. However, since the anime would not have covered very far beyond the twist with merely 12 episodes anyway, that would not really have been a problem so why not just adapt it faithfully for as long as the timespan allows and then stop? That would have made sense to me. At the very least it should have been better than the manga if so, but now... I am not so sure. Because instead, we are left with a bunch of additional forced drama between Yuu, Fuuka and Koyuki for our anime original ending, with a heavily increased emphasis on the latter compared to the manga. And while I guess we at least got a sort of conclusive ending for anime-only viewers this way, it still felt very underwhelming in the end.According to an interview with the anime staff and the original mangaka uploaded to Animenewsnetwork on March 17th, Seo Kouji said that while he had never regretted taking the manga in the peculiar direction he did, he had always been thinking about the what-if scenario where had decided not to, and thus said that if Fuuka was finally getting an anime adaptation he would like to take the chance to showcase this what-if scenario in the anime instead, and apparently the anime's producer thought the same. I guess that is a simple and understandable reason, but it also feels more like self-satisfaction than trying to come up with the best final product anime-wise to me. Also, if he really felt that way, was there any reason to throw in all these subtle teasers about the twist throughout the anime only to then never adapt it anyway? It literally feels like nothing but an attempt at trolling and baiting those anime viewers who had already read the manga, which would be rather unprofessional if so.If there is anything positive to mention about this anime though, it would definitely be the music. Of course this might be expected to go hand-in-hand with being an actual music anime, but either way the live performances in Fuuka are actually pretty awesome. Especially the first half of episode eight (right before the original content starts) was really enjoyable to listen to, and by far the best scene of the anime. Granted, this naturally depends on your taste in music as well, but at the very least I think the band performances were really well-made when they actually gave it their all (though it would have been nice if there was a greater song repertoire used throughout the anime). And that is one thing which was most certainly a hell of a lot better than in the manga; there are few things more awkward than reading about a supposedly awesome concert when all you are hearing is the deafening sound of complete and utter silence set to still imagery.Overall though, the main problems with Fuuka stem from the manga being mediocre to begin with rather than it being anyone at Diomedea's fault, and while the decision to go anime original is questionable and in my mind probably wrong, I can still somewhat understand it, and relatively speaking it still resulted in a final product which is not necessarily too much worse than its source material (which admittedly does not say very much). The music elements of the show also come across a lot better in anime format due to actual presence of audio this time, so overall I would still say this was an okay-ish adaptation relative to the manga all things considered. Unfortunately, that still does not make it a very good anime in this case. hit-or-miss. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not.

My reaction after finishing its (currently) 9 dreadful episodes is one of repulsion, disgust, and pure anger. This anime does everything wrong and then some, but let's start with the basics.The story is stupid and unfocused. The drama is some of the most forced I've seen in my life. The characters are unnatural and borderline retarded for the sake of petty drama.The music section of the show is no better....Yuu Haruna Twitter Man plays the D Chord and a C comes out, and that's all you need to know about it.The animation is terrible and lazy, plain and simple.I'm opposed to anything with an Ecchi tag, and this anime is the reason why. I bet all the sexually repressed 12-year olds were fucking loving the bathing scenes. Congratulations to them, I hope your hormones were properly activated.FUCK Fukka. I'll probably be unironically writing a fanfiction where Yuu Haruna dies a slow, painful deathEDIT: After the first 9 episodes, Fuuka stops being a forced, unbearable trainwreck and becomes obnoxiously generic instead. This apparently coincides with the point where they deviated from the source work, which is telling. I'm a sucker for romances and good endings though, so the score goes up to a 2. It's almost sad, really. It could've been the perfect example of a godawful show, but I'm glad they at least tried to make it good in the end.

Usually music animes aren’t really a genre that I consider that often however from reading the synopsis of the plot and seeing what it was like it piqued my interest. Although I haven’t read the source material yet after this drama I’ll be interested to see it.Story and settingThe story for Fuuka largely follows the character of Yuu Haruna a teenager that moved to a nearby town to live with is sisters after his father was moved overseas for work. In the town Yuu encounters several interesting people but...the one that stands out is Fuuka who he meets in the worst way possible. After clearing up any misunderstandings that they had Fuuka and Yuu become fast friends and after some rather sudden inspiration decided to form a band consisting of five people that are from the same school though not known to each other. The story alternates between the performances and the struggles of the band and the interpersonal relationships of Yuu, Fuuka and several main and support characters like Koyuki. The anime is largely set in Tokyo although it moves to other places when needed.Like most anime Fuuka’s story consists of a main plot line that is interspersed with several subplot lines that provide greater insight into some characters. Although I haven’t read the manga some of my friends do and I know that some parts of the anime were changed better accommodate characters that didn’t have as much parts in the manga and give them more of a chance. While I did appreciate the fact that the writers gave the character Koyuki who is my favourite female character on here more screen time I feel that if Fuuka had her original fate things maybe would have been better.Overall I quite liked the story as it not only gave the chance for Yuu and Fuuka to create a band and have fun with something that they both enjoy but also meet others that have the same passion. As a music anime, the key thing is not only do they need to have a strong vocalist but they also need to have a great band backing them up. In this it was nice to see each of the members who originally did not gel to eventually discover that they liked it and get serious and practice. Watching it all come together in one of their performances was impressive. The other part of the main plot is the interpersonal relationships which for the most part are focused on Yuu and the girls Fuuka and Koyuki. I felt that the romance part of the show was well done with both girls being pretty strong characters that have great personalities. In the end, I felt that the romance plot line was handled well enough though I feel that Koyuki was the better girl.FuukaFuuka voiced by veteran seiyuu Lynn of High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and the character that the anime/manga is named after. She serves as the main heroine for the story. A positive, upbeat and cheerful girl that’s also rather hyperactive Fuuka acts as the heart of not just the story but also the band. Fuuka is an energetic girl who despite being quick to get angry generally will be the one that says sorry first and is quite friendly. Despite looking like she’s enjoying her high school life Fuuka has feels that she has a hole in her life that makes her life seem empty. This and her love with music was what ultimately caused her to form her own band. The most notable trait of Fuuka is arguably her positive and cheerful nature in that she can stay positive in just about any situation. The frustration that Fuuka feels as part of the emptiness in her life is one of the core reasons for forming the series titular band Fallen moon both to satisfy he love for music both in performing and creating and to enjoy her high school life properly. Fuuka’s personality changes very little over the series but meeting Yuu does alter some of her outlooks in life. Fuuka’s interactions with Yuu is actually quite funny especially when they are still unsure about the feelings that they have for each other. I feel that Fuuka’s seiyuu Lynn actually did a pretty good job voicing her.YuYu Haruna voiced by veteran voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the anime.  A Decent, quiet and good natured teenager that moves to Tokyo to live with his sisters after his parents were moved to other country for work Fuuka acts as the conscience and the glue of the band. A good-natured teenager that seems to have an unusual obsession with Twitter Yu can be best described as a rather normal looking teenager that doesn’t actually stand out that much. This isn’t helped by the fact that Yu is actually pretty quiet by nature which reinforces people’s views. Unlike Fuuka who loves music Yu’s love for it did not materialize until the band was formed. Even then his perception towards music which actually forms a part of the main plot didn’t start to change until much later. However, as Yuu continued to practice and perform with the band Yu grew to both appreciate not just the making of music but also of the fun that you get from playing instruments with others that share your passions. This caused his normal quiet and reserved personality to change and Yu become more positive and happy and allowed him to see that there is more to life than twitter. The gradual change in Yu’s personality I felt was well done and I feel that this change was quite natural as well. I feel that Yu’s voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi did a great job voicing Yu.KoyukiKoyuki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of the irregular at magic high school and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the second main female lead. Kind, caring and understanding Koyuki is a teenager and a popular pop singer that is quite popular in Japan. A childhood friend of Yu’s Koyuki and Yu used to hang out pretty much every day when they were little and Yu’s nickname for her actually comes from when he saw her sing a song and heard how nice her voice was. In the anime, Yu and Koyuki only met again recently as they were separated when they were little due to family circumstances. Being a childhood friend Koyuki actually is the one that understands Yuu the most and she tries to help Yu when needed. Koyuki also has feelings for Yu that slowly become apparent as the series goes on. Though im not sure how Koyuki’s act was handled in the manga I actually liked the romance between Yu and Koyuki as it felt natural and that both had feelings for each other both then and now. As a pop singer that’s also voiced by a veteran seiyuu singer the character Koyuki within the story was given several songs that she sung with my favourite actually being the duet between her and Fuuka. I felt that each of these performances was pretty strong. I also felt that the balance between a pop idols career and her personal life while certainly not as true as it shows was pretty well done. Overall I felt that Saori Hayami did a excellent job portraying Koyuki as a sweet and endearing childhood friend that still loves the main character after all this time.SaraSara voiced by veteran seiyuu Mikako Komatsu of Tales of Zestiria and Hai to gensou no grimgar fame is one of the main characters of the show and is one of the members of Fuuka’s band. Sara is one of the members of the band and one of Fuuka and Yu’s friends. A second-year student that attends the same high school as Yu and the rest of the band Sara can be described as quiet, reserved and shy and not good around people. In this she is pretty similar to Yu right down to the fact that both are twitter users. In the anime, Sara and Yu unknowingly know each other which when realized created a rather funny conversation in which Sara’s personality changed completely. In the beginning, Sara’s personality created a number of problems due to the fact that she preferred to do things her way while her quiet nature made it difficult for others to talk to her. Apart from her brother Sara’s closest relationship is arguably with Yu as to Sara he is the only person that she knows both online and offline and as such is one of the few that she feels comfortable to be around with. I feel that the change in Sara’s personality was quite natural and seeing her lose composure over Yu is pretty funny. I feel that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu did a pretty good job here.MakotoMakoto voiced by veteran voice actor Soma Saito of Divine gate and Rokka no yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of Fuuka’s band. Makoto is first year student like Yuu and Fuuka and is actually one of Fuuka’s old friends. A calm, friendly and good natured person Makoto usually serves as the voice of reason within the band. Makoto shares a passion for music like Fuuka and actually is an accomplished piano player having won many competitions. In the band, he serves as the keyboardist. Makoto is the only character in the series that seems to have a problem that’s causing him to worry that wasn’t sorted out in this series. In this case, it’s his relationship with his family. Despite this Makoto is well liked by many people due to his easy-going nature and he’s always the one that breaks up tense situations. I feel that his voice actor Soma Saito did a good job portraying him.NachiNachi voiced by veteran voice actor Kazuyuki Okitsu of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio and Orange fame is one of the main characters of the series and is part of Fuuka’s band. A high school student and a former member of the school’s track team Nachi can be best described as a friendly, serious and solid person that is also passionate about things that he does. Originally Nachi was part of the school’s track team that was trying hard to recruit Fuuka having seen her run times but this passion of his soon changed to music after realizing how fun it could be. Nachi is perhaps the one character that took the longest to actually get into the band but later become a pretty good drummer and grew to like being in the band. Though Nachi did not want to do music at first and did not have high hopes about being good at it Nachi proved to be a capable drummer for the band having actually owned a drum set for some time. Though unwilling at first Nachi like everyone else in the band grew to love performing and having fun with friends.Hedgehog band membersHedgehog’s is a band that existed prior to Fuuka’s forming of her own and is one of the main casts favourite bands.  Formed of five members like most bands they went in hiatus before the events of the story but served as inspiration for Fuuka enough in that she formed her own band.  Over the series, the cast comes into contact with the former members that advice and assist them in their endeavors. The five are voiced by veteran seiyuu’s Yoko Hikasa of the Devil is a part timer fame, Manami Numakura of unlimited Fafnir fame and veteran voice actors Daisuke Hirakawa and Daisuke Ono and Yuichi Nakamura of Denpa Kyoushi and Fairy tail fame.Arts and animationThe arts and animation of the series I felt was pretty good. Character designs I felt were reasonably good as was the animation that was used.MusicAs a music anime, the music of course is an important part of the anime’s charm and story. In terms of music I liked both the opening song climber’s high which was sung by the hedgehog through the lead singers seiyuu and the second opening theme Yukihanabi that was sung by Koyuki’s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami. The cover songs that were sung by Fuuka’s band as well as Fuuka’s original song I felt was also well done.Voice actingIn terms of voice acting I felt that Fuuka’s and Koyuki’s seiyuu’s Lynn and Saori Hayami both did a great job portraying their characters in the series.Overall conclusionFor a music/drama anime to be successful it needs to have both a strong music element that is able to dazzle the audience with strong songs and music and a good drama story to link the personal relationships of the series characters together in an interesting way. This balance of themes I felt was done reasonably well in this anime as firstly the music element was actually pretty good. This was helped greatly by the amazing singing ability of Fuuka’s seiyuu Lynn which combined with the music by the band members really made their performances a sight to see. The drama element though well designed and executed was not as good. While I did like the fact that the character of Koyuki who actually is my favourite female character on here was given more of a larger role I felt that the romance between Yu and Fuuka felt a bit dragged out. I would have been happy if the anime had followed the manga and let her have the same fate as she did in the manga instead. But in truth that part of the romance felt unnecessarily dragged out. Apart from that the music which was actually quite strong here with regards to both the cover songs and the original songs and the animation were relatively good. Voice acting as noted was also pretty good with Saori Hayami and Lynn doing a fantastic job here as always. the one that stands out is Fuuka who he meets in the worst way possible. After clearing up any misunderstandings that they had Fuuka and Yuu become fast friends and after some rather sudden inspiration decided to form a band consisting of five people that are from the same school though not known to each other. The story alternates between the performances and the struggles of the band and the interpersonal relationships of Yuu, Fuuka and several main and support characters like Koyuki. The anime is largely set in Tokyo although it moves to other places when needed.Like most anime Fuuka’s story consists of a main plot line that is interspersed with several subplot lines that provide greater insight into some characters. Although I haven’t read the manga some of my friends do and I know that some parts of the anime were changed better accommodate characters that didn’t have as much parts in the manga and give them more of a chance. While I did appreciate the fact that the writers gave the character Koyuki who is my favourite female character on here more screen time I feel that if Fuuka had her original fate things maybe would have been better.Overall I quite liked the story as it not only gave the chance for Yuu and Fuuka to create a band and have fun with something that they both enjoy but also meet others that have the same passion. As a music anime, the key thing is not only do they need to have a strong vocalist but they also need to have a great band backing them up. In this it was nice to see each of the members who originally did not gel to eventually discover that they liked it and get serious and practice. Watching it all come together in one of their performances was impressive. The other part of the main plot is the interpersonal relationships which for the most part are focused on Yuu and the girls Fuuka and Koyuki. I felt that the romance part of the show was well done with both girls being pretty strong characters that have great personalities. In the end, I felt that the romance plot line was handled well enough though I feel that Koyuki was the better girl.FuukaFuuka voiced by veteran seiyuu Lynn of High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and the character that the anime/manga is named after. She serves as the main heroine for the story. A positive, upbeat and cheerful girl that’s also rather hyperactive Fuuka acts as the heart of not just the story but also the band. Fuuka is an energetic girl who despite being quick to get angry generally will be the one that says sorry first and is quite friendly. Despite looking like she’s enjoying her high school life Fuuka has feels that she has a hole in her life that makes her life seem empty. This and her love with music was what ultimately caused her to form her own band. The most notable trait of Fuuka is arguably her positive and cheerful nature in that she can stay positive in just about any situation. The frustration that Fuuka feels as part of the emptiness in her life is one of the core reasons for forming the series titular band Fallen moon both to satisfy he love for music both in performing and creating and to enjoy her high school life properly. Fuuka’s personality changes very little over the series but meeting Yuu does alter some of her outlooks in life. Fuuka’s interactions with Yuu is actually quite funny especially when they are still unsure about the feelings that they have for each other. I feel that Fuuka’s seiyuu Lynn actually did a pretty good job voicing her.YuYu Haruna voiced by veteran voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the anime.  A Decent, quiet and good natured teenager that moves to Tokyo to live with his sisters after his parents were moved to other country for work Fuuka acts as the conscience and the glue of the band. A good-natured teenager that seems to have an unusual obsession with Twitter Yu can be best described as a rather normal looking teenager that doesn’t actually stand out that much. This isn’t helped by the fact that Yu is actually pretty quiet by nature which reinforces people’s views. Unlike Fuuka who loves music Yu’s love for it did not materialize until the band was formed. Even then his perception towards music which actually forms a part of the main plot didn’t start to change until much later. However, as Yuu continued to practice and perform with the band Yu grew to both appreciate not just the making of music but also of the fun that you get from playing instruments with others that share your passions. This caused his normal quiet and reserved personality to change and Yu become more positive and happy and allowed him to see that there is more to life than twitter. The gradual change in Yu’s personality I felt was well done and I feel that this change was quite natural as well. I feel that Yu’s voice actor Yusuke Kobayashi did a great job voicing Yu.KoyukiKoyuki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of the irregular at magic high school and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the second main female lead. Kind, caring and understanding Koyuki is a teenager and a popular pop singer that is quite popular in Japan. A childhood friend of Yu’s Koyuki and Yu used to hang out pretty much every day when they were little and Yu’s nickname for her actually comes from when he saw her sing a song and heard how nice her voice was. In the anime, Yu and Koyuki only met again recently as they were separated when they were little due to family circumstances. Being a childhood friend Koyuki actually is the one that understands Yuu the most and she tries to help Yu when needed. Koyuki also has feelings for Yu that slowly become apparent as the series goes on. Though im not sure how Koyuki’s act was handled in the manga I actually liked the romance between Yu and Koyuki as it felt natural and that both had feelings for each other both then and now. As a pop singer that’s also voiced by a veteran seiyuu singer the character Koyuki within the story was given several songs that she sung with my favourite actually being the duet between her and Fuuka.

Overall I felt that Saori Hayami did a excellent job portraying Koyuki as a sweet and endearing childhood friend that still loves the main character after all this time.SaraSara voiced by veteran seiyuu Mikako Komatsu of Tales of Zestiria and Hai to gensou no grimgar fame is one of the main characters of the show and is one of the members of Fuuka’s band. Sara is one of the members of the band and one of Fuuka and Yu’s friends.

Luckily, I didn't watch it all and end up hating it so I'll be one of the few so far to give it a higher score.The story follows Fuuka and how she came to meet Yuu Haruna.  They end gathering a few other students and they form a band together.  There's romantic stuff thrown into the mix and it ends up just being an enjoyable show as you watch the characters get more attached to each other.The art is vibrant and colorful like it...should be for a show based around music.  I really like the character designs and outfits too.  The outfits actually kind of help you tell what the characters main type of role is in the show.The sound was really good.  The slower music scores worked well for the romantic scenes and drama scenes, while the more upbeat lyrics worked well for their concerts/performances, and happy moments.  Both types of sound tied very nicely together.The characters are kind of lacking though.  I don't hate any of them, but not all of them are memorable.  At least, the main characters get development.I enjoyed watching this each week.  It is something different and all the elements came to together to make it a really enjoyable experience. should be for a show based around music.

It is something different and all the elements came to together to make it a really enjoyable experience."", 'There’s a type of show that has been showing up more and more in recent seasons, whether we as critics and reviewers like it or not. These are the shows whose success relies completely on how much the viewer likes a single character, with all of the show’s potential wasted on making this character as interesting and appealing as possible. Unfortunately, the result is, more often than not, a show with a cast of boring cardboard cutouts overshadowed by a single interesting character whose personality is a horrible Frankenstein’s monster of character traits that, despite not meshing, the show’s creators desperately hope will appeal to...many fans.“Fuuka,” Diomedia’s latest production, is one such show.It’s a shame, honestly. Diomedia’s previous work, “Gi(a)rlish Number,” was thoroughly enjoyable due to its wide and well-developed cast of characters. Each character in “Gi(a)rlish Number” exhibited a specific set of character traits that could be identified and explained easily, character traits which managed to bounce off of each other and create legitimately interesting interactions. It came as a surprise, of course, to me when I was told by a friend that “Fuuka” was quite the opposite.CHARACTERS - 2/10As I\'ve said before, the entire show is carried by a single character - Fuuka Akitsuki. As this is an ecchi romance, what ultimately decides Fuuka\'s success as a character is how appealing she is to the viewer. Her character hits on some of the right notes - She\'s very cute, for one, and certainly stands out in a crowd, given her pretty design and unique style of dressing.However, Fuuka only stands out visually. Personality-wise, it\'s very difficult to figure out what kind of person she actually is. One moment she\'s acting defensive and violent, and the next she is acting clingy and romantic. Fuuka seemingly has trouble understanding what other characters are thinking, as well. At one point she catches the protagonist with a childhood friend and immediately jumps to the conclusion that this friend is the protagonist\'s girlfriend. After she runs away, the protagonist tries to talk to her, but she gives him the silent treatment until eventually punching him and saying ""baka"" in a very generic tsundere voice. Now, it\'s only natural to have mood swings, and, for some characters, mood swings can become a very entertaining plot point. But Fuuka\'s mood swings are little more than an annoyance, and are especially jarring due to their stark contrast against the two-dimensionality of the rest of the cast.The main character is a run-of-the-mill, obnoxiously dense high-schooler, someone who can\'t help but get into perverted situations and then not understand what\'s going on. Usually, I can tolerate annoying characters as long as their annoying traits either make sense within the context of the narrative or advance the plot. However, this isn\'t true for our protagonist. When faced with a difficult task such as playing the bass for a rock band, he has the typical shounen-protagonist response of telling himself that he\'ll ""do his best."" I mentioned previously how Fuuka reacts to his being with this childhood friend. Well, he barely attempts to explain to Fuuka what\'s actually going on. The two main characters are so infuriatingly unable to understand what\'s happening that their misunderstandings drive the entire plot. If there\'s a better definition of ""contrivance,"" I\'m not aware that it exists.As for the other characters, they\'re also pretty cookie-cutter. There\'s a gay guy whose entire personality is defined by his homosexuality, a controlling idol who would probably be one of my favorite characters if we actually learned more about her motivation and her reasons for existing other than providing forced tension between Fuuka and our protagonist, and a legion of sisters who always seem to be naked when our protagonist comes home for no purpose other than fanservice. There\'s not much else to say here.VISUALS - 7/10Diomedia has impressed me pretty consistently with their visual style. The characters are drawn with realistic proportions (with the exception of breasts, but it\'s an ecchi show - they\'re supposed to be large and attractive) and pretty eyes, and there is solid animation of hair blowing in the wind and of ocean waves crashing. Diomedia\'s style is characterized by the fact that the lines bordering objects are not black but are instead darker tones of said object\'s color. This gives the art a very vibrant, fun-to-look-at feel. During the opening sequence, the lines are traditional colors, with the shadows darker than usual in a sort of comic-book style. This is also nice, because it not only sets the opening sequence apart from the rest of the anime, but it gives the feeling of an exciting rock concert.SOUND - 7/10Well, it\'s a show about music. Of course the music is going to be good. The opening theme is performed well, and the female vocalist is especially talented. It reminds me of the ending theme from ""Mob Psycho 100,"" which is one of my personal favorites.My one complaint is that, although the song is good, we hear it multiple times in every episode. If something is going to be a shows opening, it\'s reasonable to assume that we\'ll hear it at the start of every episode, at the end of the finale, and perhaps one or two times during exciting scenes near the end of the series. However, whenever the band is playing, they play the OP. Once again, the song is good, but it gets old very quickly when you hear it as often as you do.STORY - 3/10I don\'t mean to sound crude, but the story feels like an eighth-grader\'s goofy sexual fantasy. The contrivances in the plot are absolutely hilarious, creating a perfect storyline for the protagonist that not only gets him into multiple perverted situations with Fuuka but that gets him making out with her not long after they\'ve met. It\'s completely and totally unrealistic to think that the girl who accuses you of taking photos of her panties would ask you out within the day. It\'s equally unrealistic to think that she\'d let you stare at her ass without noticing what was going on only a few short days later.There\'s a subplot about a rock band which is, unfortunately, thoroughly unoriginal. It feels as though the band was simply thrown in for the sake of giving the story more substance, but the idea of joining a high-school band has been done many times, to a much better effect (May I suggest ""K-On!""?). More coincidences are left for the viewer to simply accept - The band is missing a bassist and a vocalist, and it just HAPPENS to be Fuuka and the protagonist\'s favorite band, and these two just HAPPEN to be capable of playing the missing instrument and singing (Speaking of singing, the way that they establish Fuuka\'s talent is also painfully silly - She and the protagonist are walking home and she suddenly opens her mouth and belts out a really loud, really low song that most likely wakes up half of the people in town who are trying to sleep).I have a small amount of knowledge of the manga, so I know where the story is going. Without spoiling anything, I must say that the impending plot twist will certainly distinguish Fuuka from other ecchi romance shows. However, the effectiveness of the plot twist will, of course, depend on how much the viewer likes Fuuka herself. If the viewer doesn\'t feel any emotional attachment to her, the plot twist will likely feel like another contrivance, and will be another unintentionally funny moment. My friend who dropped this show burst out laughing and vowed to watch the rest when I alerted him to this twist.ENJOYMENT - 4/10Overall, I\'m not too impressed by the show. Having not read the manga, I don\'t know what direction the series will take after this nebulous plot twist hits, but I doubt that it will totally save the show. As of right now, I don\'t like Fuuka\'s character, and I can\'t see that changing before the end of the series. Of course, the art is still great and the music is enjoyable. I\'ve always liked to see shows about bands and musicians. And I won\'t lie - I do enjoy the fanservice.However, for a show that I started watching on a whim because a friend said it was ""aggressively average,"" I do think I\'ll keep watching because I\'m interested in what direction it might take in the future. If nothing else, it will provide me with a good laugh.I hope you found this review helpful. many fans.“Fuuka,” Diomedia’s latest production, is one such show.It’s a shame, honestly.

However, the effectiveness of the plot twist will, of course, depend on how much the viewer likes Fuuka herself. If the viewer doesn\'t feel any emotional attachment to her, the plot twist will likely feel like another contrivance, and will be another unintentionally funny moment. My friend who dropped this show burst out laughing and vowed to watch the rest when I alerted him to this twist.ENJOYMENT - 4/10Overall, I\'m not too impressed by the show. Having not read the manga, I don\'t know what direction the series will take after this nebulous plot twist hits, but I doubt that it will totally save the show. As of right now, I don\'t like Fuuka\'s character, and I can\'t see that changing before the end of the series. Of course, the art is still great and the music is enjoyable. I\'ve always liked to see shows about bands and musicians. And I won\'t lie - I do enjoy the fanservice.However, for a show that I started watching on a whim because a friend said it was ""aggressively average,"" I do think I\'ll keep watching because I\'m interested in what direction it might take in the future. If nothing else, it will provide me with a good laugh.I hope you found this review helpful.', 'I believe that anime like Fuuka are a breed apart from the usual slice of life anime that we\'ve been struck with as of late.You guys all know what I\'m talking about; those anime that show great promise initially but then taper off into bitter disappointment or worse boredom.Fuuka manages to break the barrier set by these mediocre anime in several regards.I will be the first to admit that its story is nothing original but neither is it terrible and that\'s exactly what you want in a slice of life. The art style is great to look at and the soundboard of...the series is better than many others I have heard (although I have found slice of lifers to have generally fantastic music).Where this series shines though is in its characters and its progression of the story. Rare is the anime these days where you feel that there is actual progression of the story with each episode. While the main character is nothing too special the heroine possesses a kind of bubbly charm unique to her character which really stands out, particularly as this is a romance anime.What I like the most is that there is a clear progression of the relationship between the two leads and it is neither at a snails pace nor breakneck quick in its development.5 episodes in and I am decently confident that in this anime we might actually be left off with a confirmed relationship rather than the ""friends but not friends"" endings we get with most ""romance"" anime. the series is better than many others I have heard (although I have found slice of lifers to have generally fantastic music).Where this series shines though is in its characters and its progression of the story.

It aint that far from reality.But  the screen writer of this anime just ruin Kouji Seo's master piece! Starting from episode 8 they alter the entire story just to give way to their goddess tama-chan! They could have hired a neutral screen writer than a worshiper. The drama is so obviously forced!I bet this anime will end up not getting any season extension. Good job screen writer! You delayed the anime release for a week just...to ruin everything! Im begging the anime studio not to let that screen writer never to meddle with your future anime's again! to ruin everything! Im begging the anime studio not to let that screen writer never to meddle with your future anime's again!"", ""Fuuka's main character is the epitome of patience, forgiveness, and all around charity. We can observe some of this overflowing generosity in even the very first episode. Now our main protagonist here is a shining example of peace, perhaps comparable to Martin Luther King Junior or Ghandi, but that wouldn't be very humble or modest, now would it? See, I myself am not a very patient or forgiving person, I'll admit. I'll sometimes be hateful and rude to other who may not deserve that hate. After watching Fuuka, I've realized the error of my ways and now strive to become just like the main character....Well what makes this main character so great, you ask?Listen carefully now. In the very first episode we can begin to see the shining purity of the main character. Within just two days, he gets his all important phone broken twice by the same woman. Normally, I would have been infuriated by this woman's actions, bubbling with rage. But does out protagonist falter? No, he calmly just pays up several hundred dollars without protest. But the story of our protagonist's charity does not end here, no no. See, the woman who broke his phone both times did not ever compensate or apologize in the slightest for her actions, but luckily for her, our shining hero is a kind and patient man. Because he was such a gentleman, he took the lady out on a date to her favorite movie! How wonderful and kind!See, we could all learn from this man's example- all of us; no matter who you are, whether it be the president of the United States or a young businessman. If your house has been robbed of tens of thousands of dollars worth of cash and property, don't take the hasty action of calling the police; instead, track down the thief yourself, apologize for not having more valuable items for him/her to take, and calmly offer to instead give your house to him/her as compensation.

After sitting through the panty shots and bad charecter devolopment, I can't seem to find interest in the story. All the perfect moments were ruined by boobs or ass (The end of ep 4 mostly) and they didn't even try to be clever! I couldn't even get through ep. 4 without even rolling my eyes! It's fine if an anime has a bit of ecchi in it, but please, please make it bearable to watch.Another thing that completley ruined this anime was the childhood friend. You knew she'd never win the...love triangle based on the main charecter's stupidity! He can't even realise when a girl is in love with him! Plus, who would fall for a bland, dull guy like that? It's just not realistic!Fuuka is not even a good charecter. We don't seen enough backstory to this charecter to even like her  or not.

But then they screwed up everything and it has finished as it did.The point of that why the rating of this anime is going down more and more is just the fact that Seo is an awesome artist, but terrible story writer. But to the point!You can scroll down to the overall point just to get general info.- StoryThe story itself wasn't terrible from the beginning - somehow it drew the attention of many people, right? And...it wasn't different in my case. I really loved first episodes, they are really good I have to say - the way they introduce the whole plot isn't bad. I have to say those first episodes are really enjoyable - they aren't that rushed as the next are. And that's the point.The story isn't bad itself at all, but the way they show it is. There are many gaps in the story and things which are not explained.  The biggest pain in the ass of this plot is the fact that they changed few things according to manga. But this intervention isn't bad itself - why you may ask? That's pretty easy to explain - some of the manga readers aren't happy with the way how manga goes, same with anime fans. I'm not big Fuuka fan, but that's truly cool to see her alive after all :) This intervention is really good in my opinion, but the way what they did after that is in so bad taste. If you change the story do it till the end, not like this you did...  I mean - if you change the story it's cool, do it - it's your business but do it with the head.Let the new story flow not bury it with the old one. It's really bad taste in my opinion. And the way the story is rushed is even worse. They made like 3 episodes with Koyuki (my fav - but it's subjective so it's not important in rating) and they lost some precious time (1h) to make up the story the way it wouldn't be that rushed. *eghem* -the f***ed up-If the story had been provided with Koyuki or Fuuka path for the whole time it would be a cool plot, well-made story. But it's not...Final result: 3/10- ArtThe art is one of the best sides of this show. I mean it's really good - as colorful as the Samsung system overlay xD But that's good, art and the animation quality stands on really high level what is really cool for people like me who enjoys good views (I don't mean fanservice by this) The characters are well drawn, the facial expression is really well made. I really love zooms on Fuuka or Koyuki - they are really good. You can feel it like they are close to ya, and that's cool. I really enjoyed this part of the show. But it's like a game - if only graphics is good, but story or gameplay sucks you can't rate the game well. Sorry.Final result: 8/10- Music/SoundOf course, this whole anime is about the music so if it had bad one nobody would even give it a try. Maybe not that strict tho xD But you know what I mean. For me, music has carried this anime to the end.*SPOILER*If not music I would be so bored after rejecting Koyuki - I was even thinking about dropping this anime but I had to finish it.*END OF SPOILER*So the music is on the really high level here, Saori Hayami and the others did a really good job here and there <3 That's a big plus for this show. It's still not the top quality but still really high scored stuff. The voice actors are really well selected to their characters. I really like it.Final result: 8/10- CharactersOMG - another pain in the ass. I could rate every single character different way because some of them are truly awesome created, some of them are really bad because of the role they have to play or just because of the personality. The thing which annoys me really badly is the fact that main protagonist is kinda stupid. I mean for real. In my opinion, main characters of this anime are the worst part of it. Except for Koyuki which is kind of main of side characters. I believe that the whole plot would be even better in general if she had been the main character, but that's just guesses. The way the characters act is so forced that it looks like a cheap act. I think that side main characters were the best here, like Makoto or Nachi or Sara. They did a good job here and let the story flow a bit.Final result: 5- EnjoymentAs I said before, first episodes are really good and they let you have fun while you watch them and that's really cool. The art is really nice for our eyes and music is really magnificent in few moments, like ending of the 6th episode - Yukihanabi has just destroyed me <3 I can say that in general only Koyuki scenes could provide me the feelings of watching something good. They weren't too candy like but they let me feel something inside. they had some deeper meaning not like the other shit here. Fan service wasn't needed here tbh but if they already did it, why not. It's not that bad but really... It wasn't needed in some scenes.Final result: 6-OverallThanks to Koyuki-chan that I could make some gifs and to Fuuka that she let me make whole 2 gifs :/ .... Better than nothing xDThis anime isn't for people who knows something about relations and how the world works. If you wanna give this anime a try, do it - 10eps go ahead, no more xD The plot is simple enough that you know the ending after 3rd episode already, I don't like stuff of this kind - I need some stuff like Clannad when you watch the ending and you don't know what the heck is going on and you write to Key support to ask what was that.The changes they did comparing to manga could make this anime way better. It's better than the manga in my opinion (just a bit like 0.1 points but it's better) but it could be even better and better. But it's not. What a pity :cThe whole anime can be compared to a game - which has the wonderful soundtrack which moves your heart, with wonderful realistic like graphics with decent optimization, but the gameplay is so bad and actually the plot is so bad that you don't wanna play it anymore. That's how I feel about this anime.The final score: *dum dum dum* - 6/10I think that's pretty honest rate. I would love to rate it subjectively but I can... xDI can recommend first 8 eps - it's truly quality stuff guys - then drop :)~Kuhiro it wasn't different in my case.

Let me just start by saying I get why people dislike Fuuka:The story is generic, the characters flat with ""quirks"" to give the personality, the ""ecchi"" feels forced and doesnt add to the comedy or develop the story and the drama at times can be a bit far fetched and border the realm of realism.but...Even with all the flaws mentioned I found myself getting lost and invested in the story. The feelings they share, no matter what causes the drama,...feels authentic and genuine. You can relate to the problems and struggles that they share as they are universal issues. Social anxiety, identity crises, the need to belong, acceptance and even obsession, all these are things we have encountered at some point.Last thing I want to mention are the visuals and sound. This is what brings everything together and which makes me forget about the flaws, the atmosphere with every scene feels hand plucked, almost like they didn\'t care about the story but rather what the story/scene should represent.I recommend to anyone who doesn\'t mind or can look past the usual ecchi, slice of life tropes to watch this as it will hook you and keep you waiting for the next episode. feels authentic and genuine.

He’ll be on it at his house, or on the streets. However fate pulls Yuu and a certain girl together named Fuuka and of course, we have the usual Cliche misunderstandings, I’ll spare you...the details and just proceed with saying that Yuu got slapped. That’s how things startedI was a bit hesitant when I read the manga. Because it started like this, it made me not wanting to continue reading. However, I moved on, I kept on reading.So Yuu bumps into Fuuka, someone who is clearly mostly interested in music, and has favourite artists that are similar to Yuu’s taste as well. That being the Hedgehogs and Koyuki Hinashi. The Hedgehogs are a band that hasn't been around for quite some time due to the disappearances of some of the members. Koyuki on the other hand is none other than the childhood friend of Yuu, which later on, Fuuka finds out.So they know that they share similar tastes and as things proceed, Yuu gives Fuuka that little push to make her pursue her dream of becoming an artist, and they went separate ways and pursued their own dreams, hoping to meet each other once more…Except that didn't happen.Once Fuuka got that push, she decided to make a band. A band that'll blow the socks off of the audience. It consists of Fuuka, Yuu, Mikoto, Sara, and Nachi. The 5 members come together and start practicing with their first song (Sara, Nachi, and Mikoto are all in the same school as Yuu, and they so happen to find them and befriend them and such and then yah they form a band)So once they first started practice, they all sounded like 2 salamanders trying to masturbate in front of 5 baby kittens. It was that bad, but that is natural. You won’t get it right the first time, which is why you practice until you get it right.So while all this is happening there’s the situation between Yuu, Koyuki, and Fuuka. In which case the 2 girls clearly show some sort of affection for Yuu.As much as I love some of the girl characters, other characters are bland as heck. I just find them boring with no significant characteristics (I’m looking at you…Yuu) We know Mikoto is gay and is (thankfully) one of the only ones that can stop the drama from happening between Yuu and Fuuka, we know Sara has the hots for Yuu (Which I can say is easily best girl anyway) and we know that Nacho is just…Nachi, the guy who leads the band and drums and stuff.If we take all of these into consideration, you can see an average anime. One that isn't the worst thing you'll see, but it isn't the best thing you'll see either. The drama is quite forced and the usual love triangle is as play, as well as a lot of plot conveniences.Although there is a love triangle, it’s kind of clear who the winner is. (Hint: It’s in the title ;) )Now only bashing this anime is not my style. Are there good points? Certainly.If you’ve read the manga, I’m sure you've got a feel of the art style. In the anime you can see that it is clearly different. I do like the art style in the anime and I do love the colours and how it is used effectively. It has a good, kinda consistent flow.Another good points would be the fan service. I mean if Ecchi is a genre in this anime, then I’m expecting some fan service. Boy did they deliver.At least this anime can showcase some of the hottest bodies out there, so I’m thankful for that.And probably my most favourite good point, the music. I love the music, the meaning behind the lyrics and the rhythm that supports them is truly beautiful with the instruments and the vocals just resonated strongly with my happy feelings. When reading, I was eagerly pondering on what the songs would sound like, and damn do they sound awesome.As great as Climbers High is, my absolute favourite song is “A Town Where the Stars Fall.” To the lyrics and the rhythm, to the instruments and the chorus, it truly is a beautiful song.But sometimes, hearing Climbers High repetitively might be a tad annoying. Just a bit, at least for me.I do wish there were more songs but I was satisfied enough that they made a full version of Climbers high and the Town song. It was good enough for me to at least enjoy that.But hey the songs at the last episode was pretty cool.Although the art style and music are exceptionally amazing,the cliche plot and bland characters easily overtake those nice points.Oh well…It is what it is. the details and just proceed with saying that Yuu got slapped.

C'mon what's with that boobfall!?Love Triangle-Now we all love these and many romantic anime have these, but the setup was done    terribly.Disclaimer: I have nothing against people of other sexual orientations.However it seems that Mikasa's (yes the gay guy in this anime) purpose in this anime was to make gay jokes and console Fuuka because as we all know only gay guys can see how other characters are feeling.Hello? The plot? I know I love a good fantasy anime where I know nothing there is possible but what!? These kids are just starting a band?

"", '(SPOILER-FREE) To start off, I enjoy the manga very much even after all the bs the author was able to pull out of himself. I was FILLED with expectations for the anime, I was ready to hear different songs that they would sing and how much they would grow over the season. BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENED INSTEAD WE GET TO HEAR THE OP OF THIS ANIME OVER AND OVER AGAIN LIKE IT\'S SOME MASTERPIECE THAT THE STUDIO HAS SPENT SO LONG ON. There are so many flaws in this anime and a little halfway through the season THEY CHANGE THE STORY. WHAT?!?!...but lets break this down.Story: 3/10Now for the first 6 or 7 episodes it was fine. Followed the manga plot line with some details left out here and there but that is to be expected. The story continues to move along swimmingly and then soon when watching a bit further into the season you start to notice certain things that play out differently or don\'t ever recall it happening in the manga. I sometimes would reread the manga looking for the part where it happened but could never find it. I gave it a chance and said to myself that\'s fine there must be a good reason for adding or removing something like that. Then those changes start to get large and larger and you can\'t help but wonder what\'s happening and you start to get nervous and wonder if they would make changes to big things such as the characters. THEN THEY ACTUALLY DO IT CHANGING THE ENTIRE STORE AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF EPISODES AND THE MAIN CHARACTER SUCH AS FUUKA AND YUU\'S PERSONALITY START TO CHANGE FROM HOW IT IS IN THE MANGA. BUT THE THING THAT TRIGGERED ME THE MOST WAS THE LATEST EPISODE WHERE THE MANGA HAS MADE A DRASTIC TURNING POINT FOR THE ENTIRE BAND WAS REWRITTEN AND NOW THE STORY HAS JUST TURNED INTO A CLICHED ROM COM. IT\'S OBVIOUS THAT THIS ANIME WON\'T BE GETTING A 2ND SEASON SO THEY DECIDED TO COMPLETELY SINK THE SHIP IN AN ALL OR NOTHING MOVE ON THE BASIS THAT SOMEONE WILL LIKE THIS ORIGINAL STORY.Art: 6/10Not much to say about the art. It is really just okay nothing great nothing bad but I have to say that the characters don\'t really live up to how they are presented in the manga. Would have to say Yuu\'s art make him seem rather scrawny then he actually is.Sound: 5/10You would think a anime about music and a band would have a wide variety of songs or even at least just small tad bits of different songs. NO NONE OF THAT IS IN THIS ANIME AT ALL. THE BAND SINGS AND ONLY LISTENS TO THE OP OF THIS ANIME ""CLIMBERS HIGH"" OVER AND OVER. It\'s not a bad op when you listen to it the first few times but it gets so boring and uninteresting as if this is the only song that exist in that universe. It makes all the important scenes where the band does play seem like it is just any other day. Incredibly disappointing.Character: 5/10While the majority of characters remain true to how they are portrayed in the manga eventually that would change. With the anime\'s original story line that appears OVER HALF WAY INTO THE SEASON characters now feel like they all just hit a midlife crisis and cause unnecessary problems as a device to move the story to its finale. This anime starts to make the smallest changes in how the character acts over the first few episodes and then HIT YOU WITH A FLIPPING TRUCK LATER ON ( :^) ). NO... NO MORE OF THIS CRAPEnjoyment: 3/10It\'s fine if you have nothing better to watch. I have dropped this completely.Overall: 3/10So many expectations for this anime and was the anime I was looking forward to in the winter but it ended up being the biggest disappointment that put me on a emotional roller coaster more then the manga did. It\'s so clear that the studio/production company behind this was so incredibly lazy and didn\'t even bother to try to make something respectable. They thought replaying the OP over and over again would force us to love it but it just makes us dread hearing it.

the distinct blue hair, and also from the writer trying to tie in some activity with the drama and romance. in suzuka\'s it was about track&running and in fuuka\'s it is about music and being in a band. anyway the story starts of as a standard boy meets girl, boy becomes infatuated with the girl, and both of them come to like each other.later on Fuuka not knowing what to do with her future decides to pursue a...career in music due to her love of music and motivation from her friends who also join the band as well. through a series of conveniences they meet famous musicians esspically from a band they really like and get some help from them in order to be a better band, and that\'s about it.the story itself is filled with a lot of cliches from dumb misunderstandings, love triangles, and drama for the sake of drama. the pacing also also very poor either being too slow or to fast at the wrong moments, examples are when the band breaks up and mostly regroup in the span of 1-2 episodes or how yuu leaned to play the bass in one day. the anime did a well enough job adapting the manga since the manga wasn\'t that good in the first place. i also applaud the studio from deviating from the manga for two reason, one being that i much rather prefer a lackluster ending rather than a disappointing one that forces you to read the manga or wait for the S2 that will probably never happen, and second is the disappointment of some people who watched it and didn\'t get their beloved truck-kun . other than that it\'s badthe characters are pretty much on par with mostly any average anime in a school setting, and can best written about in one sentence . even though the anime is named fuuka the main character of the show is yuu who is reclusive and spends more time on social media than with people. fuuka is the love interest and is eccentric and  a bit of a megalomaniac. koyuki is yuu\'s childhood friend who has a crush on him. then the rest of the band are one-note which include makoto the gay pianist, kazuya the drummer just cuz, and sara the reclusive bassist. everyone else isn\'t worth mentioning. there\'s is some development when it comes to the love triangle character but all in all feels flimsy. i would have given them points for focusing outside of school and for the characters having more ambitions than a higher grade, but it is mostly for just fuuka, and they cut the school part out making it feel irrelevant.strange for an anime that has music as one it\'s selling points is that it\'s pretty lacking. the soundtrack is not worth noting and forgettable. the songs that the band perform just feels like i\'m listening the the songs OP multiple times (which is a decent song) although they do end up changing to different songs near the end of the show, but they never give of this impact they are trying to present. the voice acting is fine for the most part and they can sing pretty well.it\'s mostly standard from what to expect from modern anime. the character designs look decent enough, the contemporary setting backdrop looks decent enough. the animation is okay for what it is since not a lot of action really happens in the anime.overall- it was good production values though are pretty standard for modern anime, but the story and character are very flimsy.4/10\ufeff career in music due to her love of music and motivation

After catching up with the manga, this show feels pretty rushed so far, but it's not actually bad. Here are my thoughtsStory 7The story of Fuuka is about a highschooler named Yuu Haruna that has moved into town and during a fateful day he met Fuuka, a blue haired beauty. That's it for a basic synopsis. The story of this anime isn't actually bad but more like i said rushed, they should've given more time to develop the story and make it more interesting, so far while it is pretty cliched and generic i still kind of like the story...and it keeps me invested for now.Art 3The art in this anime i think is pretty fucking garbage. The movement of the characters are pretty clunky and the background are nothing special to look at, pretty disappointing since Diomedea can do pretty good animation.Sound 8The soundtrack i think is the highlight of the anime, the opening and ending are great and the OST is pretty good to listen to as wellCharacters 6Other than Yuu and Fuuka everyone is pretty much a throw away character,except for Yuu's childhood friend she's pretty decent. The others though pretty badEnjoyment 8Even with all that i still enjoy watching the show as it is, it's a pretty good drama with a mix of music and comedy in itOverall 7It's not a bad show, it's pretty decent but i can't find myself binge watching this show again in the near future. But if you want a decent drama this should be good to fill your time and it keeps me invested for now.Art 3The art in this anime i think is pretty fucking garbage.

It felt rushed in some parts and slow in others, the characters were dull and could have been fleshed out so much more. But of course, why waste air time on character development when you can add in another panty shot or another scene of the main character\'s sisters in their underwear? I\'m still not sure if I actually enjoyed the song ""Climber\'s High,"" or if I just heard it enough times throughout the duration of this anime that I started to think I enjoyed it just...so I could sit through it again. All in all, a pretty mediocre anime that made me feel as if I\'d wasted my time. so I could sit through it again.

I\'ll list them out here while avoiding spoilers as much as possible.1: No attention to detail. The biggest example here is the songs playd by the band, which don\'t sound at all like they are being played live OR by a group of amateurs.2: Awful pacing. Everything is just so very slow, with a lot of lingering unanimated shots. The whole story could be better conveyed with 12 10-minute episodes. I\'d be willing to bet it would be a more enjoyable experience.3: A lot of unnecessary scenes, like the truck scene from episode 10. I\'m pretty sure they...could have found a better way to do what that scene needed to do, so that it didn\'t have to feel so jarring.4: Stupid, unfunny jokes based around a certain character\'s sexuality.There is one thing the series tried to do, and managed to pull it off, even if it was not as good as one might wish:There was some character development, enough for there to be a feeling that the story was evolving and going somewhere. The stakes for each character were well-defined, but the show felt the need to shove scene upon scene on the viewer\'s face to get them across, which led to many a boring scene. The show could really benefit from more subtlelty.WARNING: to anyone who hates clichés, this anime is certainly not for you.

And they made a promise when they were kids that they would get married.I love how the sisters in this series are always naked, in their words it’s okay because they are family. The gay boy that is too attractive to like girls....And a predictable boring love triangle, where the mc has all the power to choose one, but never does it.I was maybe thinking of watching the series, however in episode 2 it is so easy to tell what the rest of the series is going to consist of.Making it clear also, I am not musical anime fan. One of the most boring genre ever.  Fmc just has one of the best voices in the whole universe and the mc supports her and then there is drama about how they think they no longer love each other BLAH BKAH BLAH.Fuuka gets a 3 And a predictable boring love triangle, where the mc has all the power to choose one, but never does it.I was maybe thinking of watching the series, however in episode 2 it is so easy to tell what the rest of the series is going to consist of.Making it clear also, I am not musical anime fan.

Nope, it itsn't, but it's indeed a great anime.During the last few hours I have watched the entire anime and I must say that my feelings got quite divided by the end of it. Fuuka's first half got me completely amazed. I'm personally someone who really enjoys music and that has sold me entirely during the first few episodes. The anime had a good character development during these first episodes with Yuu's and Fuuka's story, but it turned out to disappoint me quite a bit in it's last...half with rushed decisions, baddly developed/introduced new characters, and some random time-skips that were not as smooth as I think they should be for this kind of show.

The rest of it was actually forgettableSound - 9Well, it's an anime about music.

Just because the anime has a different ending than the manga doesn't make it bad, I thought it worked well. The music was awesome and the characters were really enjoyable. So what if you think its predictable, shouldn't all that matter is if you enjoyed it or not? I was never bored once while watching and thoroughly enjoyed the anime...as a whole. I cant even think of any super huge flaws about it, everything was wrapped up nicely. I would only say not to watch it if you aren't into music anime but other than that its a great one time watch.If you're thinking about watching, give it a shot. Don't let others influence you giving it a chance because its nothing like what these people are making it out to be. I actually want a continuation to the story but because of all the negative feedback i'm seeing sadly I don't think i'll get anything.

Im usually picky about my music anime because the brilliance that is Beck Mongolian chop squad spoiled me but I just could not find a episode of Fukka that I didnt enjoy, all the characters interacted with each other well and the growth of both Fuuka and Yu was very well done.If you love music animes I highly recommend it the music alone will be enough to catch your attention but...you will stay for the story and the characters. you will stay for the story and the characters.', ""I read the first 40 odd chapters of the Manga and was never really hooked and disliked the plot twist so I gave up. I do think the Anime did the right thing in Episode 10 with the same plot twist. If they were going to keep to the manga they should have had the plot twist around the end of episode 3. This would perhaps have benefited the anime by tightening it up which it very much needs. But I also don't mind the anime story arc, what I do dislike is the characterizations of Yuu and Fuuka and flat pacing. Fuuka early on...was a much more interesting and dynamic person. I also don't see her as the sort who would make the choice she did at the end of episode 10. Yuu strikes me as too bland a character to generate so much romantic tension amongst the female mcs. In fact this particular love triangle is really detrimental to the story and just not needed. Its slowing it down and detracting from what could have been a pretty good anime about music, the music industry and the creative and personality tensions of a band perhaps on the cusp of fame.Although the story isn't terribly realistic to begin with (and I find the characters often act in unrealistic ways) it could have been more successful with a different focus than poorly paced melodrama. It's not a bad anime, just a mediocre one. I do like the music. was a much more interesting and dynamic person.

This isn't the best anime you will likely ever see, but it's good.I don't know why I even go on this website everybody is so petty in their reviews. A rating of 1? Really?With giving away as little as possible it's about a boy that stumbles upon a girl that knocks...him over when running and thinks he's trying to snap a shot of her panties. After this there is only 1 more panty shot so far in the entire anime. That's 2 panty shots in 4 episodes and we get complaints. From what I've seen it may get dramatic from here so we'll see if I'm wrong later on, but the first 3 episodes are the bomb so I would at least watch those and give the show a chance. him over when running and thinks he's trying to snap a shot of her panties.

However, it is not necessary to watch Suzuka in order to understand Fuuka, as the plot is completely unrelated and the only real link between the two is that Fuuka is Suzuka's daughter.Fuuka tells the story of Yuu Haruna, a guy who seemingly does nothing but post about his day on Twitter meeting the titular character: a crazy, strange girl who cares about nothing more than music. The two put aside their inital differences to form a band, following in the footsteps of a...band they idolize. Of course, there's also a love triangle between the two and Yuu's childhood friend: an idol named Koyuki. The show attempts to juggle both plots simultaneously, but it gets pretty clumsy at times and certain things seem to come out of nowhere. Additionally, it really fails to bring much originality to the premise; this is hardly the first anime to deal with the creation of a band or include a love triangle, so there won't be a whole lot of surprises to anyone watching. The only ones who may be surprised are manga readers, as certain events are changed significantly to give this an anime original ending.There's nothing special about Fuuka's art and animation. It works fairly well most of the time, but character design is a bit unoriginal. I don't have much to say about this aspect of the show, just that it's one of the anime's stronger points.As an anime about music, one would hope that Fuuka does a good job when it comes to sound. It definitely succeeds, with some very solid and catchy songs performed by the band, including the excellent OP Climber's High! However, said OP gets played a bit too much, considering it's the only song the band practices and plays initially, which gets a little annoying. The character voices are fairly decent, and although I don't really care for Fuuka's speaking voice, her excellent singing more than makes up for it. I'd say that sound is definitely the strongest point of Fuuka, but honestly that's not too difficult an achievement.Fuuka has pretty weak, and in some cases, utterly unlikeable characters. When there's a love triangle, and a girl who's not even involved in it is a preferable option to the two who are, there's something wrong with your characters. Obviously, this is just my opinion, but Fuuka comes off as incredibly annoying for a majority of the anime, and Koyuki honestly seems utterly irrelevant, her only purpose seems to be to create conflict between band members and in general. The rest of the characters aren't much better, but even the tolerable ones suffer from a lack of development. It honestly seems like Yuu, Fuuka, and Koyuki are the only ones who get any meaningful character development, and that's a shame considering how bland I find them.The only time I really cared about what was happening and looked forward to the next episode was when I read manga spoilers. Before reading the spoilers and after it became clear they were going anime original, it was really a chore to watch this week after week. The band storyline is admittedly somewhat decent, but the romances are weak and this is one of the worst love triangles I can recall, making for quite a painful watch. It's not even worth watching if you're an ecchi fan, since there's barely anything of note. Fuuka gets a couple panty shots, there's a bath scene or two, and there's one scene where Yuu's three sisters are inexplicably all in their underwear. It seems like a pathetic attempt to pander to viewers, but it really doesn't do anything more than that.Fuuka is an exercise in medocrity, and is a good example of how to write an uninteresting romance. I won't deny that there are aspects of it that people can and will enjoy, but personally, I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone unless they desperately want to watch music related anime. Even then, there's a good half dozen I'd recommend first. This isn't the worst thing I've seen, but it's certainly no masterpiece. band they idolize.

AND ANIME WILL GET ANOTHER FUUKA THAT HAS THE SAME LOOKS AND SAME NAME.AND THATS HOW IT SHOULD BE."", ""Before reading this review, please know that I have not read the manga and have no interest in reading it. I've seen some reviews bashing the anime because it did not follow the manga step by step. Maybe I'd agree with them if I knew the original story but honestly I do not care. This is a review on the anime, not a review on how it compares to the manga.Story: 5Fuuka tells the story of a timid high school student, Yuu Haruna who is absolutely obsessed with Twitter, constantly tweeting his thoughts and activities. One day while out, fate plays its role when...Yuu bumps into our main female of the story, Fuuka Akitsuki. What begins as two school mates stuck in a bundle of misunderstandings quickly turns into a band of talented friends who decide to chase dreams of stardom.Unfortunately the music aspect of this show seems overshadowed by drama that only high school students would have so instead of witnessing the rise of rock stars, I saw mere speckles of light walking on rocks. There is an emphasis of romance highlighted throughout the show but I found it frustrating and typical.Art: 6As for the art style, little amazes me but nothing disappoints because I had no expectations. The most eye catching moments were when the band performed which is always nice to see in an anime about music. Settings do very little as I sometimes forgot whether the group were in a garage or cafe. All in all, pretty average.Sound: 6It does take a while to witness the true sounds (meaning the band performing) in the show. As I listened to the songs you first encounter, I thought everything was okay. Fuuka's singing does throw me off because of how different she sounds but it's pretty common when you are trying to produce a noise that sounds pleasant so I got over it. When I got far enough into the story, I did replay some performances as I thought they were catchy. All in all, the music I did hear was the type I could vibe with; even though I always skipped passed the opening and ending for the show.Character: 5Eh. I don't hate any of the members of the band but I gotta say that the two MC's, Fuuka and Haruna are my least favorite. I found it very sad because they did it to themselves. Instead of just focusing on what really mattered, these two gave me such headaches as they ignored problems and kept their emotions bottled up. If you told me they weren't in high school I wouldn't believe you. As for the rest of the band members and famous pop stars that you see, I had no problem with their characters. If it wasn't for them, I would've lost interest long ago.Enjoyment: 5I'm trying to convince myself that I liked the show but I can't help but be relieved about finishing this mess. It actually started off okay and I was genuinely interested in it too but that spark of interest quickly died as with each week came a new episode. I probably would like the manga more but I still have no cares for it, even after the show's conclusion.Overall: 5I do know that if this show focused more on the music side of things and less on the high school love drama, I would've enjoyed it a bit more. The story, art, and sound was all okay but none of it was enough to really feed my appetite for entertainment. I thought this was going to be a great show so that's probably why I kept at it.

Of Course the Art and the Music, personally I think It\'s not that Bad, I like Climbers High Fair wind, probably because It\'s my genre, since I like Rock, and I like the designs as well, especially Koyuki Sarah and Kazuya.3. Though I still personally think they suck, I sort of like the personality of the band members but that\'s just about it.BUT NOW LET\'S MOVE INTO THE NEGATIVES...Dum dum dum...1. THE ENTIRE STORY LINE SUCKS AND DRAMA WAS F****N FORCED I\'ll explain whyEpsiodes1-4: Formation of the Band5-9: Koyuki\'s past and relationship with Yuu10-12: Fuuk\'s feelings, leaving the band then going back again.The Sad Part is most of the episodes revolves around Koyuki, and her feelings for yuu was explained well, heck I even liked Yuu when he started going out with her, then i thought ""Hey this Anime route is not so bad"" but noout of nowhere Fuuka relaizes her love and leaves the band, then episode 11 (sorry I can\'t take it) yuu realizes he loves fuuka then brakes up with koyuki in less than 10 F*****N MINUTES, the the second hald talks about the SO CALLED STUGGLES OF THE BAND which i Think is not touching enough, then of course the final epsidoe where everyone is happy blah blah blah and of course yuu and fuuka lived happily ever afterThe point is I don\'t mind cliches, but If you\'re planning to end up with fuuka then HELL THEY SHOULD JUST FOCUS MOST OF THE EPSIODES ON HER RELATIONSHIP WITH YUU DAMN IT, what\'s the point of all those build up with Koyuki if in less than 10 minutes it\'ll be thrown away like an old PS2 also the suffering of the band is forced.you see series like Beck Love Live and Sound Euphonium, you can see the growth of the band or group from their humble beginings and stuggles, while here all you see is a bit of flashback of waht the bandmates did and before the episdoe ends they went back together...LIKE MAGIC2. The Fuuka in the manga is diffrent she\'s a lovable character there, unlike here in the anime.3. The Side characters (bandmates) pretty much suck, they got likable perosnalities but that\'s just it, let me mention.First Mikasa, what separeated him from teh two is that he knew fuuka for a long time and he\'s also gay, but the point is if he knows fuuka, are they really that close??????I can\'t remember a time when he went to fuuka\'s place and worse he can\'t even tell if Fuuka\'s sad or something,Then We got Kazuya whom I like I mean going tusdere mood on his grandma is pretty cute and for Sara to have a nice body..but that\'s it4. Truck-kun has Failed.5. I\'m annoyed at teh fact that WHAT FUUKA WANTS FUUKA GETS..I mean just think..she wants a band she gets it, she likes yuu and Yuu falls for him, and she does acutally nothing on it, while Koyuki has only 1 goal and that is for yuu to love her, and for her to work her ass of day and night for her to build up the courage to confess to him and getting dumped in less than 10 minutes....that\'s gotta hurt.6. Yuu came from an interesting male lead to a generic mc, that so called developemnt that he has, yeah a lot of MC does that too(excpet for Ichika I guess)overall I gave this a 5 since despite being predictable, I like the music the art and Koyuki..hope you won\'t get offended this is just perosnal thoughts. this to the manga because of the DIFFERENT STORY LINEPOSITIVES1.

It\'s ""Well we have a slot to fill so let\'s take this manga and fit it into 12 episodes by taking out 90% of the actual plot and replacing it with cliches, standard love triangle, and completely reroute romances and plot so we can end it neatly on ep 12 with no expectation of a second season""...Art: 7/10 Pretty standard art work,...nothing to complain about on the animation side of things though I\'m not particularly picky about those sorts of things.Sound: 8/10 Those songs I\'ve been reading about but never actually got to know any words FINALLY comes to actual audio form!

Because the plot was thrown out the window and replaced so to were the characters, well, character.

The animation and music is extremely well done, and the overall atmosphere is very lighthearted and carefree, but the plot is ridiculously cliche and the characters couldn't be more flat. There is also tons of unnecessary fanservice that does not contribute anything to the anime, but if that's your thing then you might enjoy it.PROS:+ Colorful and vibrant animation+ Tremendous musical score+ Overall very lighthearted and relaxing to watchCONS:- Very, VERY cliche plot- Characters either have too little or too much personality...- Fanservice is unnecessary and forcedOVERALL: 7/10 - Fanservice is unnecessary and forcedOVERALL: 7/10"", 'Fuuka started as what one might call an interesting band anime but the music is what keeps it from being cliche and cringey anime with melodrama at the top.The story well there are alot of different things to say about the story and not much good. it throws a mash of cliche from the mcs bumping into another and pantie shots. There are just too much of it as the anime goes on and tries to tell its story. It had a potential but trying to entice the watcher by revealing skin in almost every episode isnt the way atleast for me who hoped...a story based on music. It has it all everything form the childhood friend to love triangles. Althoguh it does have its own originality it doesnt have as much as i had hoped. So the story is the worst of the entire anime which is kinda funny considering that is supposed to be what an anime consist of so why in all gods names do i give it a 6 which rates as a fine anime which is borderline good.Well the music is what makes me want to continue to watch this and makes me wait for the next song in the next episode. This anime makes good music in a band anime that some anime struggles with which is refreshing. Great vocals /beats and plays makes me want to watch it. Problem is that the story overshadows too much of it and makes people remember the crappy story and not the great music that actually is in it. Not only thinking about the  lyrics but the music played from the instruments themselves. For real how many anime actually gives the bass some love ? Very few thats who.Well the 2 main characters are pretty generic i feel. The great and open music girl and the shy and blushy boy with his half naked sisters. Not much to write home about. The cold yet interesting guitarist , the prob homosexual keyboardist and the fun and energetic drummer are alot more interesting as characters than the mains which speaks alot of the anime itself.I enjoyed it to a 7 because its rare to find so much great music in one anime  and very rare at that. The melodramatic cliche story made me at times cringe but music got me through it as much else in life does for people.Overall its a fine anime solely based on the anime and a couple of things from the story but in the end music is all this anime will ever be for me. So eventhough i enjoyed it to a 7 almost all cause the music it doesnt deserve more than to be rated as a fine or 6 in my opinion a story based on music. It has it all everything form the childhood friend to love triangles. Althoguh it does have its own originality it doesnt have as much as i had hoped.

It's not bad, but it's not good either.The characters are meh, only Fuuka has (a little) development, and Sara-senpai was actually the only character I liked, the others are just average romance-story characters. And they tried to add some dramatic backstory, which failed miserably.I'm not sure if the focus is the music or the romance, but I didn't like how both are passed, it's rushed and with very little development (if any).Though, I didn't hate the anime, don't think it deserves a score lower than 5 (which is average), and I only gave it a 6 because I actually...enjoyed the songs (but I was REALLY annoyed by the fact that they play the OP song OVER AND OVER AGAIN) and the art is not bad.I didn't hate Fuuka, in fact I enjoyed some parts of the anime, but it's just an average romance with a very rushed story and little to no character development.But seriously, the songs are good. enjoyed the songs (but I was REALLY annoyed by the fact that they play the OP song OVER AND OVER AGAIN) and the art is not bad.I didn't hate Fuuka, in fact I enjoyed some parts of the anime, but it's just an average romance with a very rushed story and little to no character development.But seriously, the songs are good."", ""So Fuuka, a good old music based rom com that is kind of pretty, sounds kind of nice, that has some fun characters etc etc. Long story short it's a fine and a somewhat simplistic but ultimately quite enjoyable show. (spoiler: read manga instead)When I watched the first two episodes I noticed that I really enjoyed the look and feel of the show, basic romcom with somewhat fun characters, with a touch of music and no focus on fanservice which is right up my alley. Since I'm more of a bingewatcher and only a couple of episodes were out I checked out the manga out...of curiosity. I got hooked and like most people was quite taken by the big tonal shift. Some people disliked it, I personally loved what it did to the story.Then after binging the manga I came back the next week to follow up with the show. Of course I already knew what would happen but still wanted to follow suit. But some things became apparent, the songs sounded good but the concerts really lacked in intensity (visually). The story progressed but the pacing felt a tad too slow, nd by being slower some clichés became a bit more apparent than in the manga since I could just brush over it.But I still enjoyed it casually as expected until 3 quarter of the way through the show when something weird started to happen. It started to deviate from the story of the manga, love triangle seemed to have different outcome, critical tonal shift didn't happen, etc etc. Some people got annoyed, but I got excited. An alternative story seemed intersting as long as it was as good as the original.But then came the major flaw, right before the end they took everything back  it seemed to have been a big curveball and the series ends right before where the tonal shift would've happened. So it seems that they justed added  some material to stretch the story out so they wouldn't have to deal with the tonal shift in the first season. (even though I don't expect to ever see a season 2) That was honestly a big dissapointment, and makes the studio look like a bunch of cowards imo.Either way would have been fine but they didn't commit, in the end I liked the show a lot initially, it introduced me to a manga that I love now but ended up by dissapointing me at the end. But overall it's still a good watch I just strongly recommend the manga over its adaptation. of curiosity. I got hooked and like most people was quite taken by the big tonal shift.

Not forgetting the incest references, of course, showing several naked scenes than necessary, so keep up your family distance on this one. A show that's been accused of having the wrong protagonist, and honestly, childhood friends have had enough of this, and Fuuka doesn't go easy a bit. But that doesn't exclude people from claiming it to be one of their favorites, going as far as paring it with the fantastic...“Clannad”, that's where I draw a thick line folks, and I'm about to clear the reason about that in this review.- Story (5/10):Akitsuki Fuuka (wow how original of the show's title), a clumsy go-lucky highschool girl (the daughter of Akitsuki Yamato and Asahina Suzuka, the protagonists of the indirect prequel of this show, “Suzuka”) is at a very relatable stage of her life, that one hard-to-knock-off-wall that goes about having students decide what they are going to do next. In the other side, you have your typical silent unsocial male protagonist, Haruna Yuu, that has an extreme obsession about sharing every bit of detail about his life on Twitter. The two happen to meet each other, and right from the first episode already manage to get as close as one can call a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And with that, the flaws of the show start to mercilessly attack every sense of logic remaining. I still can't grasp how could an individual (Yuu, the protagonist) join a band with no talent or prior knowledge to music, only being there because some random girl he met told him to. The show at first gives a really focused view on Yuu and Fuuka, I've seen this strategy before, making the viewers ship the heck out of them until we get mercilessly stabbed at the heart by the introduction of this childhood friend that apparently has always had a crush on Yuu. Meet Hinashi Koyuki, both a member of this little love triangle and overall a very famous idol that the other side of the triangle (Fuuka) is a big fan of. “That is some seriously interesting setup”, said old naive me that had more expectations on this show than it actually delivered upon. Right after she's introduced she goes through causing misfortune between the two only for her to get hurt by the end of the story and the two obvious pair get back along again. Now try to picture that turn of events, but in the most terrible way you can, that's what Fuuka, and extremely below average show in terms of love stories is. And that's excluding the other side characters, like this one girl, Iwami Sara, a girl that showed hostile behavior towards the protagonist at first to only make a complete 180° split in personality for no apparent reason going as far as threatening their modest love triangle to becoming a square. I feel that the show could have been better if they focused more about the actual band's growth and them realizing their dreams, but of course, with them having the right qualifications.- Art (8.0/10):Most definitely the only good thing this show did right, yeah, give me more of them crispy looking animations, those oddly-ordered lines make for such a relaxing view for my eyes. And honestly, without this, the show would have never stand on its feet.The color palette was so diverse and colorful, taking a non-realistic art style that really suited this show for being the genre it is. One of the many things I appreciate about Fuuka (rare of me to say) was the sense of fashion, the characters looked as if they were staging for some world-class clothing magazine, all looked very tidy and elegant, and I'm backing this up for you, hips out there. One thing that really left a bad taste on my memory was that adults, kids, and teenagers, all looked similar with no signs of aging gaps, I'm talking about parents looking as young if not younger than their kids, it was ridiculous.- Sound (7.5/10):Being a show heavily centered on music, that is if we don't count the childish drama. Those were some really good songs, to be honest, I didn't give the opening theme song credits at first, but it grew on me as far as making me want to clap for them when they decided to feature it as one of their hits on some episodes. The voice acting was decent but could have been better if not for the painfully cringy dialogue they put the actors through. And then again, there is the classic Engrish, one of the strongest, in fact. I really have to emphasize more on how good the music was or else I'm not going to get this unlucky feeling off that I'm getting right now.- Character (6/10):“Next please”, that would have been my quote of the day if I was in charge of recruiting actors for a live action and replicas of the show's characters happened to be involved. There was no single memorable character that brought something new with it. You had your friendship above all types of people, and there was also the selfish bastard that goes about ruining everything the show built upon for 10 episodes. 10!!!!! are you kidding me?Shipping was really intense at first, but then, it was like, why even bother, just let this end quickly I don't wanna get rid of my dropped-shows-virginity yet. I can give the protagonist credit at least for curing his addiction to Twitter, but that was it. And to this day, I don't think I'll even know how could someone with no talent in a medium perform that well in it, and in such a short time, it really goes as far as contradicting the philosophical meaning of a “Talent”.- Enjoyment (7/10):It's very odd to have animals like pigs that eat practically anything that they can swallow, but what's even more mindblowing is how could one enjoy something they criticise this bad. I'm not going to lie on myself, I did have a bit of guilty pleasure watching Fuuka, not because of some deep plot points, not because of the revolutionary characters, but rather how decent it served as a time killer. At least it didn't put me to sleep at night or made me count how many times I yawned every 3 minutes. I had my fair share of rooting, shipping and cheering, but towards the end, it dropped massively.- Overall (6.7/10):Fuuka is a type of show I'm going to be very careful about calling it a good show out loud, there is no way in hell I'll recommend this as a solid romance experience for how bratty and unfunny the drama turned out to be. As for me, seeing that many shows already makes me realize how low in scale this appears next to greater franchises, but for you out there who are planning to have this as one of their first takes on the romance genre, please don't, it would end up affecting your tastes in a bad way. “Clannad”, that's where I draw a thick line folks, and I'm about to clear the reason about that in this review.- Story (5/10):Akitsuki Fuuka (wow how original of the show's title), a clumsy go-lucky highschool girl (the daughter of Akitsuki Yamato and Asahina Suzuka, the protagonists of the indirect prequel of this show, “Suzuka”) is at a very relatable stage of her life, that one hard-to-knock-off-wall that goes about having students decide what they are going to do next.

I've seen awful series before, but have had an awesome soundtrack (Here's looking at you naruto).Simply put, Fuuka and her friend are not enough to carry a damn show.Sorry for the cussing, but...this series deserve a blunt and scathing review.

The art was a little off with a fair amount of still shots and such but the biggest let down was the story.

Honestly, I felt like no one had the right to be in love with anyone else in this show because they never really knew one another.

Forced drama, good for a laugh (at the show's expense) but not much else.  But I have to say that I enjoyed this show.  The OP hooked me immediately, and I liked the story (despite some out of character moments and excessive, forced fanservice) enough that I picked up the manga and have read it all.  Over 100 chapters completed in maybe two days.  I liked what I saw there even more, and my greatest fear was that they would cop out on the...big turning point--the place the manga kicked off.  Distinguished itself.  I thought that the worst it would do was throw filler at us, delay the critical moment.Until episode 9.  Damn it.I suspected we might have a problem in episode 8.  No, before that actually.  The moment Akitsuki was approached.  Those who have watched the series will understand my meaning.  But I still hoped that it wouldn't diverge, and this series would become what the manga was--the themes of loss, recovery and music.With episode 8, the cop-out began.  When the date didn't go as expected...If only it were just a cop-out, I might've been okay with it.  A game-changer at the tail end of a series that probably won't get a continuation leaves a lot of people disappointed.  But they took it a lot farther than that.Events diverged from the manga completely, and in episode 9...for me at least, it destroyed the momentum, the promise, the premise I was looking forward to seeing play out on the screen.  I can't say much without spoiling the manga, anime or both--but the way they handled this ruined the emotional impact.  Cheapened the whole story.  The storyboarder and directors were too afraid to stick with what was written, and Fuuka has suffered from it.  Before this episode, I would've given this series an 8 or 9, for the sheer enjoyment it offered.  I still love the music, but I'm no longer sure I will be able to finish watching the series.I know I sound melodramatic, but I am a writer myself.  I know how it feels to make a drastic move with plot or characters--especially one that pisses off the fanbase.  But of all the ways they could have changed it, they picked the one way that left the story feeling empty, and I'm having a hard time forgiving it.  I suspect my opinion will be unpopular; it often is.  But sometimes, as readers, writers and watchers, we need the push.  The shock value.  Make good on the threat, and change everything.  Sometimes failing to follow through is the worst thing you can do.I wish I could be more specific, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers--and this one is a doozy.  I don't think a cop-out has annoyed me this much in quite a while; I wish they'd stuck with inserting filler episodes, or fleshing out the relationships.

The progression might be a fast and sometimes you might have to slowly swallow what is going on with the series. I can't recommend nor recommend this one for the sake of story.Story:The progression is fast, and if looked on another side (if a positive way) focuses on the struggle of the main characters to form something (40% from the start), conflict (40%-90%), and then resolution (90%-100%). My problem with this series though is that it does not satisfy the viewers with good resolution. Even though, if the story...has progressed in a different direction, I would have given this series a much higher score (as I would always tend to score a series at its resolution).Art:The art is great, clean and simple. As a person will lean on the quality of art in a series, I definitely recommend this one. No flashy things but a simple, clean and fluid work, and that is what I love about this series.Sound:Not much to say about this but it definitely harmonizes with the story lines and progress of the series.Character:I'll focus only on the male main character. The character shows poor conviction, maddening, and slow decisions. If you hate people that is very indecisive, cannot be satisfied with something and lacks the courage to end, even though it might not be ideal, here it is... But for the sake of the story...

The first episode made me cringe quite...a few times and wonder if I should drop it. But the thing is, if you are able to ignore these details, they become exponentially less prominent as the show goes.Id say that the two things that work best for this anime is the fabulous animation/character design and a plot-driving character development. This anime isnt very deep, its about a bunch of kids starting a band. The thing that is interesting to see is how the values that drive them as musicians and the personal growth the main characters go through to finally satisfy the romantic tension in the anime. Regarding the romance itself, as youd expect there would be some cliche immature moments.. but sometimes, I was surprised to see they were not as bland as they are in some other animes. sometimes the romance is even mature id say..If youre a romance anime fan with the patience to excuse a few cliches for decent character/plot development , well, I enjoyed this anime so Id recommend. a few times and wonder if I should drop it.

This anime destroyed the typical cliches by turning them...on their head! it approached the scenes with an air of maturity not found in any other romance i have ever seen. i don't like this genre but i loved this series. its slightly lack luster but its over all an exceptional story. this story had me gripped at every scene with anxiety expecting the worst and being happily surprised. on their head! it approached the scenes with an air of maturity not found in any other romance i have ever seen. i don't like this genre but i loved this series. its slightly lack luster but its over all an exceptional story. this story had me gripped at every scene with anxiety expecting the worst and being happily surprised."", ""The worst anime I've ever watched, seriously.

Also, the characters were well-played, to be teenagers. That message is so important to bring in your daily life, even if it can cost you sometimes.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryThe main complaint I have with the story is that it felt oddly fast paced. And how some of drama was quite unnecessarily self-destructive.But aside that I did quite enjoy the story. The touch of a bit awkward characters was nice, there was fair amount of drama and feels and as well characters did grow in a sense and as well got their ""changes of life paths"" . So overall, story did feel good, but it did not feel too impressive. I\'ll be honest that I did...binge watch, yet still lost focus now and then.I seriously don\'t know what else to say. That is the general gist of what I felt about the story aspect. Rest is basically for viewer itself to experience and feel, if it ends up being up their alley.✦Art & SoundArt&Animation was simple and fitting enough. But what I want to mention here, is fanservice. Usually fanservice is for hotness, lewdness or comedic reason. But this Anime fanservice felt for some reason very beautiful and natural. I cannot explain exactly, but I can tell rather than the usual service for some eye candy or blood rush or humor ...it seriously felt refined and simply just normal and calming. So that to that.Music, I did quite enjoy. 2 of their songs were kinda meh, rest were really enjoyable. On top of that OST was also quite nice.✦CharacterI honestly don\'t want to write too long, as I have to say quite a few things regarding some characters, but I\'ll skip that and keep it short as possible.First of all MC is awkward, shy and timid which I really liked, mostly because saw lot of myself in him. But of course, since it\'s a romance anime, he has bunch of characters who are in love with him. So yeah, damn lucky fellow. Nevertheless, how love interest and simple experiences gave him a push and positive changes was a nice thing to see.Not fond of Fuuka herself. But overall she was a good character. With a little bit confusion drama.Koyuki is a very adorable and sweet character, but feel really bad for her. I cannot explain why, as it would be bunch of spoilers.Iwami was probably my favorite character. She is an absolute beauty with such an adorable personality. Utterly my type of character.There were bunch of other worthwhile characters, but as said. I have something to say to pretty much whole cast, which I want to avoid to do. But that also means, that I did quite enjoy characters, thus why have so many thoughts on them.✦Enjoyment & OverallGood music, nice drama, good romance, interesting characters made it overall really good Anime, but at the same time I felt the pacing was too fast, which made some of the drama and development just simply odd.

Fuuka could actually be thought of as a sequel to Suzuka, in that the titular character Fuuka is the daughter of the titular character Suzuka, but beyond giving more significance to a certain shrine that’s brought up a couple times the connection between the two is only what essentially amount to cameos, of which there are also a few from...other Seo works. Thus plot wise that it’s taking place in the same universe as Suzuka and Kimi no Iru Machi isn’t that important. That it’s very close in themes to those is far more important. Just as with his two most recent previous works, Fuuka is a manga heavily centered around exaggerated youthful melodrama featuring somewhat of a harem subtext, just this time with everything centered around music. If you didn’t like his previous works, there is no way you’ll like this. If you did like his previous works, then the answer is a bit more complicated.The start to the anime is pretty weak. The protagonist, Yuu, is to put it frankly pretty cringe worthy. He’s a pushover most of the time when he’s actually supposed to stand firm, but despite that sometimes he comes to random conclusions and acts on them resulting in him interfering with others on completely false premises. The main heroine, Fuuka, also gives a terrible first impression and isn’t likable at all in that she’s overtly hot headed and annoying and not in a good way. Her gimmick of being a high school girl that doesn’t have a cell phone is also really strange for 2017 and clearly only there for the sake of having another avenue for drama. The two of them also really don’t seem to have good chemistry at all. After it gets over the hump of introducing those two, things get a lot better. The rest of the cast is much more solid. The secondary heroine Koyuki is much more likable, seems to have much clearer and easy to empathize with motivations, and has pretty good chemistry. The rest of the main cast is pretty underdeveloped, but they seem pretty likable with interesting backgrounds as well, though I really wish we got to see more of them. Sara especially I would really have loved to see more of as she fits the mold of characters that Seo seems to handle well. The various side characters, especially those in the band HEDGEHOGS, seem to be setting up a pretty solid character web to create a plot off of. Thus, while the absolute beginning is kind of weak, the rest of the first phase leading up to them having a band is pretty solid.After that it gets into what Seo is known best for, ridiculous melodrama. This melodrama is fueled by teenagers making major mistakes because they’re teenagers running entirely on their emotions who don’t entirely even understand said emotions. I understand that it may be grating for some and the lows when this is happening can be quite painful. This is especially true because unlike his previous works, the mistakes made here are on a much larger scale and involve far more people. Still the purpose of lows is to build up to highs. The highs don’t feel like they completely justify how low things get, but they’re enough to make things overall feel solid. There’s some whiplash from things moving around so quickly, but overall I found the development in character arcs and relationship arcs pretty satisfying and I was really interested in where things were going, even if I still wasn’t all that fond of the protagonist or main heroine yet.And that’s when things went terribly wrong. I only learned of it afterwards and I’ve avoided trying to find out the specifics since I haven’t read the manga, but the anime’s ending is different from the manga. And I suspect incredibly different. The last two episodes are downright terrible. Firstly, they’re both forced and inconsistent simultaneously. They basically force character development, wherein it seems like they’re trying to show that even if something bad has happened, that doesn’t reverse the character growth that has occurred, and the characters will be able to move on in a positive manner. So the first problem with that is that none of this development feels earned and seems like a pretty big jump from the direction the character arcs that were going. In certain cases it even feels how their character arcs were progressing. The bigger issue, is that immediately after that it reverses almost everything, which makes it all feels completely pointless. Similarly, plot developments are incredibly forced and similarly reversed. Really, despite everything that happens, only one thing really changes in the end, which I suppose was an important thing, but to be honest it changes in a way that I felt really wasn’t deserved and that frankly I just didn’t like so I consider that a further demerit. Secondly, the pacing is all over the place, wherein while there were issues in the rest of the season, here it’s downright bizarre. It feels like it rushes through a lot of character background and such that should have been delivered much more slowly and in a much more fleshed out manner. It also rushes certain incredibly important events that it probably should have spent more time on, while dragging out other less important events for no real reason. As a result, it’s just not pleasant to watch. Lastly, the epilogue is rushed and wraps up everything without properly giving any context so it really doesn’t feel like it wrapped up anything, and thus the final impression that anime gives is immense dissatisfaction.In terms of art and animation, it’s mostly pretty solid though I feel it didn’t match Seo’s art style as well as previous anime adaptations. As a result I don’t think character designs came across that well. It also felt like the art direction was somewhat inconsistent so at times it flowed weird. The soundtrack in terms of instrumentals wasn’t that memorable. However, the vocal tracks were pretty great, which is incredibly important considering that this is a music centered anime. There were also more than I expected considering that this is only a single cour anime. The visuals on the OP and ED were also solid enough, though I feel that the OP’s visuals were building up to something that simply didn’t happen in the anime, though it may happen in the manga. other Seo works. Thus plot wise that it’s taking place in the same universe as Suzuka and Kimi no Iru Machi isn’t that important. That it’s very close in themes to those is far more important.

In certain cases it even feels how their character arcs were progressing. The bigger issue, is that immediately after that it reverses almost everything, which makes it all feels completely pointless. Similarly, plot developments are incredibly forced and similarly reversed. Really, despite everything that happens, only one thing really changes in the end, which I suppose was an important thing, but to be honest it changes in a way that I felt really wasn’t deserved and that frankly I just didn’t like so I consider that a further demerit. Secondly, the pacing is all over the place, wherein while there were issues in the rest of the season, here it’s downright bizarre. It feels like it rushes through a lot of character background and such that should have been delivered much more slowly and in a much more fleshed out manner. It also rushes certain incredibly important events that it probably should have spent more time on, while dragging out other less important events for no real reason. As a result, it’s just not pleasant to watch. Lastly, the epilogue is rushed and wraps up everything without properly giving any context so it really doesn’t feel like it wrapped up anything, and thus the final impression that anime gives is immense dissatisfaction.In terms of art and animation, it’s mostly pretty solid though I feel it didn’t match Seo’s art style as well as previous anime adaptations. As a result I don’t think character designs came across that well. It also felt like the art direction was somewhat inconsistent so at times it flowed weird. The soundtrack in terms of instrumentals wasn’t that memorable. However, the vocal tracks were pretty great, which is incredibly important considering that this is a music centered anime. There were also more than I expected considering that this is only a single cour anime. The visuals on the OP and ED were also solid enough, though I feel that the OP’s visuals were building up to something that simply didn’t happen in the anime, though it may happen in the manga.', ""If you arrived here after watching Suzuka or Kimi no Iru Machi, you'll find a similar universe but it's not really a sequel.  While there are some appearances from those runs, there's no impact on the story as to whether you know who they are or not.

It didn\'t seem to explain what it wanted to show me or for what purpose. Was it a sports anime? Was it a rom-dram anime? Was it a flipping music down-to-crap show?

Usually I don\'t mind these small things in these typical rom-dram shows but damn.After the 12th episode, the rating for this entire show, lost 2 points. It was a decent 6 like it\'s previous show. It would have been interesting if we saw Yamato and Suzuki. But its one of those, how we should say, ""Snoopy"" vibes. I literally cringed from the confession. Made me scream out, ""Oh god. Cliché moment.""Where we can\'t see the parents, the parents are ""out to sea"" or they died, they just mention the parents but never were on the scene. It would have been a better rating till then.If you are into these wacky clichés or you are just simply bored, then be my guest.I wouldn\'t even call this an ecchi anime, considering it\'s half nudity and pantyshots.

Such a magnificent anime with those glorious boobs and beautiful panty shots and you guys still aren't satisfied?

I laughed, I teared up, the music was great.The twitter thing in the tag barely plays a role in the show, so its a bit misleading.  Don't let that throw you off if you are thinking about watching it.  It's a pretty straighforward slice of life romance, love triangle, music anime.I just dislike having to make choices, which is why I prefer harem anime.This deserves more credit than it gets,  so I bumped my score.  It's not the...greatest of romances or music anime, but its a solid entry and should probably closer to a mid-7 on MAL in my opinion. greatest of romances or music anime, but its a solid entry and should probably closer to a mid-7 on MAL in my opinion."", ""I watched the Anime after reading the Manga, which I still had some issues with but very much liked. I felt like the anime adaptation took too many liberties with changing the story and it ended up making no sense whatsoever. The pacing was also way off compared with the manga. That said, I can understand why they chose to go that route given that they only had 12 episodes to work with and even those 12 episodes look like they were made with a pretty low budget.Had they been given a 24/25 episode production and with the budget to actually have decent animation...and some good songs, I think they could have made a more faithful adaptation following the proper storyline of the manga.The animation was sub-standard at best and they re-used Climber's High so many times.So now for the good parts:- Given that it's a music story, there's a lot you have to imagine just reading the manga, and even though the songs didn't blow me away, it did give me a fair bit of enjoyment to listen to songs that resonated with the story. If anything, it made me feel more connected to the manga.- There's a decent amount of fan service (if that's your thing) so this is a subjective plus or minus depending on your taste- If you're a sucker for happy endings, at least you get that here. Even if it makes no sense and the story was all over the place, at least you'll get a small sense of satisfaction at the end of the anime.Conclusion:If you've read the manga, I don't think the anime is worth your time. Although I would recommend watching some clips on youtube of the songs.If you haven't read the manga, don't watch the anime. It's just a waste of time.A properly executed adaptation from the original source material had a potential to be good, but this was just crap churned in a hurry and on a low budget. and some good songs, I think they could have made a more faithful adaptation following the proper storyline of the manga.The animation was sub-standard at best and they re-used Climber's High so many times.So now for the good parts:- Given that it's a music story, there's a lot you have to imagine just reading the manga, and even though the songs didn't blow me away, it did give me a fair bit of enjoyment to listen to songs that resonated with the story.

This show seemed to have suffered from a lack of a sufficient budget, as it had animation issues. Despite animation issues, unnecessary fan-service, and occasionally questionable dialogue I enjoyed the story and characters in the show enough to keep watching through to the end. I gave it a 6 due to previously said issues, but I enjoyed Fuuka and would still recommend watching it if it...seems up your alley! ^___^ seems up your alley! ^___^', ""I only began watching this because it was a continuum of Suzuka but was I surprised.The series was engaging from start to finish and had a great cast of characters with their own unique traits.The drama within the series was very interesting and kept me watching till the end. I do feel that in some scenes the romance was a little rushed but it wasn't noticeable enough to ruin the series.The music was where this series shined. Every song in this series was absolutely beautiful and performed excellently which is what most music themed animes lack. Every time a song started I was pumped and...excited. This series is what music animes should strive to be giving a good mix of music and story, enough so it makes sense. excited.

The story is fair having been done multiple times before and containing many clichés. That being said I found the main love interests to be interesting and entertaining however due to the show only receiving 12 episodes a lot was crammed into 24 minute episodes resulting in far less story and character development that could have been done for all the characters had they had 26 episodes like original series Suzuka had received. The art in this anime is up to par with pretty much all 1080p anime today.   Where I enjoyed the...most out of this show outside of Fuuka was the music. Watching the show made me want to discover the name of the songs and purchase them.

Wall of text ahead.The anime and the manga follow a completely different trail at some point… is it bad\xa0?Yes and no… let me explain. When you see some anime, you simply get completely frustrated about the ending, because it ends in such an akward way you would have to read the manga to fully enjoy the next step… (something along the lines of Btoom…) But it does follow the manga… leaving you with that weird taste after completing the anime...So at this point, you either have to do yourself a favor and start to think a bit differently...or pass your way…I will, due to that, instore a\xa0rule… one single rule :Rule #1 - Simply pass your way and save yourself precious lifetime IF...Do it differently\xa0: take the anime as a separate material, and completely disconnect it from the manga… It’s really an adaptation. The manga is NOT the script of the anime...Still not sold to admit an anime and a manga could have a different story ending while the start or base material is the same\xa0? Then simply go read the manga… and read rule #1[Simply pass your way and save yourself precious lifetime IF… Still not sold to admit an anime and a manga could have a different story ending while the start or base material is the same] got the idea of how to make it work right\xa0?Now, about the standard bashing\xa0: let’s look at the tags this anime has…Drama, Ecchi, Music, Romance, School… I’ll simply forget about the shounen, as it’s not that important for the story itself.So first off… yes Ecchi… what would be ecchi without it’s dose of fan service\xa0and pantyshots ? So again, either you are into ecchi style or not, and if shots of panties and other usual ecchi scenes bother you to this extend, use rule #1. Now let’s make it clear, it’s not integrated to the anime… it’s clearely the same into the manga…Romance and Drama… well sorry to say, but romance and drama stories have been filling our world for thousands of years… and funnily enough they ALL follow the same standards and paterns… so yes, put those 2 together and at some point you will have already seen all stories and developpements, it just all depend of how many have you seen or not… very hard to re-invent the wheel isn’t it\xa0? So yes, this story use the everyday standards about drama and romance… it has been a receipe that worked for as long as humanity has written tales and stories. Oh and do yourself a favor… understand the difference between the meanings of drama and dramatic… drama does not necessarly need to be dramatic… Drama is a genre, while dramatic is a situation...So finally, the saying is, «\xa0if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it...\xa0»… and it’s true for each genre out there… so either you are ready to admit this fact and you want to see a romance/drama anime, or you are already fed up to have witnessed so many of those and then apply rule #1Music and School… there, funnily enough I find that this anime is a bit different than the ones usually using those 2 tags together. Let’s be clear it will not make the story any better or worse… just a different flavor… They will not only use the school environement to fullfill their dreams. Just a bit of fresh air…Now that we are done with the tags, and just for that you should know if you give it a chance or not, we can dip into what many discuss the less… the story.Story\xa0: 8Wait what\xa0??? why so high\xa0? Well there are so many things that goes either unnoticed, completely disregarded or completely overlooked into this anime that I personally think it’s a shame to see how many can’t even see it…First off, this is a sequel to Suzuka… and due to that, many still do not bother to watch it and simply completely misunderstand the very first ecchi scene and why it’s there…Fuuka’s parents… their sport background… and a bit of DNA is into Fuuka… so this scene in which she simply jump over the hurdle… and the animation is quite clear, it’s really a perfect movement of a a 110 metres hurdles… and she does it simply.. because it’s somewhat fun to her… it’s not just there because it has to be there to prepare the ecchi scene, it’s the ecchi scene that is there because of that element… what fun would there be if the scene simply had Fuuka jumping over that, and having everyone looking at her pursuing her way\xa0without any stumble ???Then the twitter thing, well for once, refreshing to have the full name and not a freaking generic name that everybody will simply say or think over the anime name anyway… I think there again many overlook the message that the mangaka drop there… maybe it’s time to think a bit\xa0??? I’m an old moron… and I simply utterly disrespect any FaceBook and Twitter things… Just for that matter I can simply fall in love with Fuuka… but still I really like that the Mangaka simply use it as a tool to question the good and bad of those modern communication tools and what they can instigate…The extended use of cellphones... I’m born and grown in a timeframe where we used to give ourselves a meeting point and hour, and simply stick to it and not having to use a phone to find ourselves while still in such a proximity from each other that if you witness real world today’s actions, you simply facepalm to see how many peeps find themselves phoning or texting each other to find out they could really make eye contact… would they have risen their eyes out of that dumb phone screen… I have been grown in a world where you would look at things through your eyes, not through a diminishing rectangle that simply display in a shitty small screen what your eyes could see at a way wider range… and finally that’s probably what goes completely disregarded the most in this story… because many are bound to live like Yuu’s vision of today’s world… Fuuka sees the world way differently many does those days.So sorry, yes story fulfill something way deeper than many want to really admit.About the music writing part… Many seems to completely misunderstand how sometimes music works… some great songs were composed in a very short amount of time… Maybe not in a night, but some in a few days and some in a span of a few weeks at the most,  sometimes in a studio while in a pause during an recording of an album, and a song that was unexistant at the start of the work simply makes it through the final album, some composed on a coach or on the patio during a hot summer night or next to a fire place on a cold winter evening… Some of the great songs did not really take that long to be composed… I’ll not do your homeworks here, but let’s just simply drop some titles… Smoke on the water, You really got me, My generation… Oh wait what ??? I know right… they are old songs…What usually takes time is the arrangements and the studio work… and again, there the anime is too short to show that difference, while we witness it on the manga… so yes a basic song like Fuuka does in a night… plausible… because music very often follow exactly that path that many dislike the most about this story… standards and very well known patterns… and the songs that usually have the biggest impact on standards music listeners are not the complex ones...Besides that, yes of course many situations are generic situations, some more unreal than others and it’s not a masterpiece plot, at least for what we are given into the anime… There are so many things that we are just witnessing the embryonic state in the anime and that will make sense or be usefull only later into the manga’s story… so yes there are some frustrating things…Art\xa0: 8Well I really like the chara design, I find them really putting into life what we have into the manga, but honnestly, for an anime that still revolve around music, those are by far not the best animations out there for that matter. Other than that, it’s the standard we are used to see those days. Nothing great, but good enough.Sound\xa0:7Well there it hurts a bit… for an anime that revolves around music and that is inspired from a manga.. clearely while not beeing bad, the songs will never really make any of my playlists… they are simply way too generic. For that one, Fuuka in my eyes completely miss the opportunity to be better… There you will not find those great cute things K-On does, nor what White Album creates… you will not have the emotions you find into Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso nor Hibike Euphonium…Characters\xa0: 9Well there it’s hit or miss… Either you fall in love with energetic, optimistic tornado that Fuuka is, or you don’t… and it’s clerely where this anime makes it or not for you… I just like what she represent, her way of thinking, how she lives somewhat appart from today’s world…Now, the probably most problematic one… Yuu… If you simply dislike the passive male heroes, you will simply hate him… to the point you will not really enjoy that anime probably… so if you find yourself needing a strong male hero… apply rule #1.He’s not that bad, it’s just the anime part… he really doesn’t shine until way later in the maga… if he does ever shine by the way… I’m used to that, I can live with it, I usually like anime for the female heroes anyway, and I usually truely dislike the usual male hero stereotype that can carry it all without crying… But he somewhat reminds me of a Jim Morrisson so unsure of himself on the beginnings and that finally is remembered as a great charismatic face of music...The other protagonists, again, yes, really some standards and cliche ones… but again, they just get better in the manga… and really not that much into the anime…Still Fuuka gets so high into my heart, that I can’t go lower for that note.Enjoyement\xa0: 10Yes I really enjoyed watching it. I found it refreshing and it left me with a good taste at the end… enough so I got to read the manga.. and that’s clearely the point of this anime… make so you get into the manga if you want to really find out what was the difference between the 2’s… and it reached that goal… at least for meOverall\xa0: 8Yes, because what I really like finally, IS the difference between the manga and the anime…The manga could survive and achieve it’s goal with the story it has… as it is… all dramatic that it is… And the messages it carries can stand it… and be enjoyable…However, the anime could simply not survive and fulfill it’s goal should it had sticked to the manga plotlines… the anime would really be a salty one, a bitter one, leaving you completely empty if it had the storyline the manga has and kept it in a one season stand as it will probably be the case…So the anime achieve something different… Beeing a pleasant one on it’s own…A watchable anime, not great, but not as bad as many want to make it be…So will you get hit by a tornado called Fuuka\xa0? Or not\xa0?If yes, will you take it a step further and face the harsh story of the manga\xa0?Thanks for reading, and sorry for misspelling, english is not my mother tongue or pass your way…I will, due to that, instore a\xa0rule… one single rule :Rule #1 - Simply pass your way and save yourself precious lifetime IF...Do it differently\xa0: take the anime as a separate material, and completely disconnect it from the manga… It’s really an adaptation.

I found it refreshing and it left me with a good taste at the end… enough so I got to read the manga.. and that’s clearely the point of this anime… make so you get into the manga if you want to really find out what was the difference between the 2’s… and it reached that goal… at least for meOverall\xa0: 8Yes, because what I really like finally, IS the difference between the manga and the anime…The manga could survive and achieve it’s goal with the story it has… as it is… all dramatic that it is… And the messages it carries can stand it… and be enjoyable…However, the anime could simply not survive and fulfill it’s goal should it had sticked to the manga plotlines… the anime would really be a salty one, a bitter one, leaving you completely empty if it had the storyline the manga has and kept it in a one season stand as it will probably be the case…So the anime achieve something different… Beeing a pleasant one on it’s own…A watchable anime, not great, but not as bad as many want to make it be…So will you get hit by a tornado called Fuuka\xa0? Or not\xa0?If yes, will you take it a step further and face the harsh story of the manga\xa0?Thanks for reading, and sorry for misspelling, english is not my mother tongue', 'I recently got more familiar with the music genre in anime and there are usually three paths the series follow: 1. It becomes one of the best in the medium excelling in other issues and themes the show deals with (e.g. Nana), 2. It is not great but it is decent and there seems to be some effort from the production team to make it work although they fall flat in some areas (e.g. Fukumenkei Noise) and 3. Cringe-worthy, despicable and irritating cash-grabs that have no merit at all and everything modest about the show is completely tossed out of the window. Unfortunately, Fuuka is...an advocate of the last category. It is exactly on par in terriblness with BanG Dream. Only difference is that BanG Dream is just loli-shit and nothing more. I mean Fuuka tried so hard to be something else it made even the most try-hard of shows look modest, in comparison.Let\'s keep this rant short and sweet and make myself clear for the reasons why SAO, Guilty Crown and Kabaneri are much more modest in comparison than this monstrosity. First, the characters are unreal. They are exactly like walking Sims with no personality traits and their aspirations are as hollow as their heads. Fuuka is annoying as hell. She is needy, selfish and she gets what she wants in the end without any hardship to redeem herself. She is like Umaru-chan but worse, since she is portrayed as a realistic ""human being"". And Haruna is just the typical beta male that changes character when the melodrama demands it. Koyuki is a self-centered cunt who is way too thirsty for Haruna. The rest are not important. Their goals in life, their character development, their importance to the plot are non-existent. The characterization and development of characters is done only when the plot demands it and none is at least likeable or sympathetic. Not even one character is like Captain Boomerang from Suicide Squad who was the only villain who did not make me question the purpose of my life and cringe the hell out of me.Well, at least the story is fair right? Hell, no! It is a cheap dramafest wirtten by people incompetent at daily life issues like love, friendship, etc. I never thought it would be good because I knew that the show could not be anything more than average when it aired and I hoped that the show would keep me entertained with its music and art.Hah! What a joke! It even failed at doing right the one thing that anime are good for: pretty colors, good direction and music. The animation was basic as fuck. It had some nice touches here and there but it was so damn generic. It was rather inconsistent towards the end and I found the blue border lines of the characters very distracting and derpy.And the music...the songs are decent but once you finish this show you will be sick of the OP song and you will have forgotten everything. And the ED is ok but forgettable nonetheless.I still cannot understand which brilliant mastermind thought Fuuk-ya was a great idea. It is a perfect example of how to not do an anime series or a series in general.

I kind of like this anime until ep 4 came out.Story 3/10Well. There is a young and energetic girl. She keeps jumping around and claims to make a great band. Okay. That sounds a lot of fun.Here comes a big turning point when Fuuka gets some compliment on her talent, which is such a good motivation. But guess what? ""A band only needs one person to make it great. The very talented one."" NO, THANK YOU. Drums, guitars, and keyboards are NOT TRASH.Basically, this anime messes...up the most beautiful meaning of music (that other animes have built up). As a person who appreciates music and all efforts of practicing of musicians, I HATE the story for denying such precious thing.Art 8/10I am a quite picky person on art. So 8 is pretty good for me.Sound 8/10Well. They have good opening and songs.Character 2/10No depth in characters. They act in one consistent way and never change it. Some reactions are just too much, aka over exaggerated. So they became nonsense and annoyingFuuka, who keeps talking about making a band, believes in her talents too much that she ignores basic skills of music, which pisses me off (once again).And people are not born to know how to play music. They have to learn. But all the characters act like they already know how this gonna work if they practice as a band.Enjoyment 4/10I got pissed off by the story and the characters and the story. But the music heals my poor little heart.Overal 4/10Well. I can\'t stand this show any longer. I still love the music though.I hope anyone who watches this show and wants to pick up an instrument or sing please appreciates the hard work of musicians. up the most beautiful meaning of music (that other animes have built up).

A normal antisocial boy meets a cheerful girl and they do something 'amazing' together and fall in love. Granted. However I don't feel this anime deserves so much hate and here is why. (Try bearing with me on this one)The music that it was based around was very good, it was full (enough) of meaning and it was quite catchy.The characters are not bad within themselves. Their design was good, they had a part to do in their roles and it fit the anime.The anime had a direction...and it went towards it, many anime just did things for the sake of it without actually having a reason for it.Having said all this, this anime does have it's flaws. For me it can be summed up in one thing. The anime tries too hard to become popular, so it had a lot of great ideas that it hinted at but didn't fully execute. Some of the examples are:The HEDGEHOG band's reunion. Ok so the famous band that everyone in the anime idolized got back together ... and then nothing happened. They never interacted with each other, they never showed any significance in the anime.The 'couples toy tag' thing that started the relationship didn't actually do anything throughout the anime. If they just sent the tag with the letter or something I would be happy with why they included the damn thing.The pianist. This is the only thing I truly disliked about the anime. He is a good character, had a backstory, has a unique identification through the fact he was gay, but nothing else. They didn't do anything with the smarts he had, nothing with the family problems and backstory he has. Nothing. I feel they wanted to keep him for a spin off or ova story line or something. Wasted potential.So that is my opinion and I truly don't believe this is a bad anime by any account.(By the way, I personally rated this anime as an 8 only because it has a rating of 6.9 that i don't believe it deserves. I think it deserves a 7ish that's why I rated 8) and it went towards it, many anime just did things for the sake of it without actually having a reason for it.Having said all this, this anime does have it's flaws.

The animation didn't really stand out to me and the art was not that special either. The sound had kind of a raw feel to it as if it was taken straight from a sound clip website. I didn't enjoy this anime as I could predict what was going to happen next, and the plot was kind of mediocre and cringy to say the least. The romance was kind of forced, as if they desperately needed a harem genre to the story. Overall, I give this a...5 in terms of all of these points. 5 in terms of all of these points."", 'Overall, I liked the anime, though the entire thing feels rushed.The visuals are great, the sound track is compelling, and the Japanese voice actors did a great job. Unfortunately, the English voice actors don\'t feel right for the characters that they are supposed to be playing.Plot points come too quickly, and not enough character development. It seems slightly unnatural and spontaneous. The producers should\'ve opted for a 26 episode format like the prequel ""Suzuka""If they had it would feel more like a completed product rather than an attempt.Characters are believable, yet how quickly they decide things or change their mind on topics...leaves an unnatural feeling, like there was a jump-cut between scenes. leaves an unnatural feeling, like there was a jump-cut between scenes.', ""Fuuka is a very relaxing and soothing anime with a story that'll keep pulling you emotionally, with music, drama, school and romance as it's genre it managed to combine teenage romance and drama with music.

The girl being spontaneous, self-centered and caring formed a band by forcing the members even if some of them doesn't know...much about the instrument they'll be playing. Well it's just like a simple slice of life, school, and musical anime at first glance but add romance, love triangles, drama, jealously to the picture and it becomes an anime filled with emotional scenes that might even burst you to tears.The art work of fuuka is clearly beautiful, brightly coloured and entertaining, I'm serious the art work is an (8.5/10).

much better and after finishing it, it has made me look forward to other music anime\'s in the future.The story begins when Yuu Haruna is randomly walking through town looking at Twitter when suddenly a random girl called Fuuka bumped into him and suddenly these two along with other people would begin a musical career.Even though there were some elements from Suzuka that were reused like the love triangle between Haruna, Fuuka and Koyuki, but the difference is that these reused elements were done better far better...in fact and I really enjoyed the band when they got together, worked together on creating the music and it was just really fun watching these characters grow until Fuuka decided to make a decision that almost cost the anime the score I gave it, but luckily it was fixed in the end which narrowly saved it which for anyone who has read the manga you will probably be disappointed because some things are changed for the 12 episode length.The characters were far better than the characters that were in Suzuka, Fuuka unlike her mother was a very energetic, passionate, determined and incredibly adorable character she stole the show for me, Haruna was actually decent for a male MC though there were a few points where he did some mistakes a lot like Yamato, then there is the other band members Mikasa a homosexual (which is actually refreshing) keyboardist, Sara the Guitarist who could\'ve been another Tsundere, but ended up being almost as adorable as Fuuka and Kazuya the drummer who really liked to whine a lot these characters were done well and had great chemistry, then theres Koyuki who to me is the weakest character of the show, she felt like a new version of Honoka but wasn\'t done as well which is why I couldn\'t support the Haruna and Koyuki relationship, but most of the characters were done well.The Romance was actually fun there were a good number of moments between Fuuka and Haruna that you wanted to say ""awww"" at like some of the moments during the beach episodes and when they were creating the band they just really clicked for me and then Koyuki came in and in some ways ruined it her relationship with Haruna didn\'t feel right it felt forced so I was glad when they broke up and it focused back on Fuuka and Haruna.Then there\'s the music aspect it was good, but they reused the same track a good number of times and didn\'t use new ones until the final episodes so that kinda annoyed me this would\'ve been worse if I didn\'t like the soundtrack, but luckily it didn\'t so it didn\'t bother me that much.So if you\'re someone who recently came from Suzuka then this will definitely be worth watching or if you\'re looking for a good Romance/Music anime then you\'ve also come to the right place, but if you had read the manga for this anime then I\'d be alert since there are some things that have been changed, honestly to me though I thought it was actually pretty good in fact and I really enjoyed the band when they got together, worked

reviews this anime has received, I was a bit deterred from watching it. Now that I have finished the show, I am glad I watched it as it did provide me with 10/10 enjoyment. The story of this anime isn\'t the best and some events do look forced and needed to be developed and worked on better.  However, If you are just a casual viewer, the flaws to the story could be easily ignored. That being said, many events are difficult to be explained and are mostly lead up to from different coincidences.If you are able to ignore...then flaws to the story, you will for sure love this anime. This anime includes a love triangle between 2 females and one male, best part is that the male main not only shares romantic experiences with both of them, he chooses one of them at the end. There are a lot of drama included and also a little bit of mystery with the band ""HEDGEHOG"" which sadly never really gets answered (one of the flaws to the story).Ofcourse, this is also a music anime. I would rate the music 10/10, but that is just from someone who isn\'t very familiar with what good anime music sounds like. To me, it sounded pretty good. No high pitched vocalized sound, good rhythms and decent lyrics.Overall, I would recommend this anime if you are just a casual anime viewer. However, if you are someone who likes to criticize the animes you watch, then you will surely find some issues with the story. Regardless to that, I enjoyed watching this very much and would definitely watch the second season of this if there were (not gonna happen ever but you can atleast hang on to a little hope) then flaws to the story, you will for sure love this anime.

Since this has music as one of its genres I was still unsure, but hey YOLO. Anyway I got the general of the show before it started.Story: It started off with two of the most cliché scenarios that could happen, running into senpai and accidently looking at a girl in the wrong area of her body, really? The originality is lacking, but I kept going. After that we are going into the house of our Male lead, Yuu. Nothing really happens aside from him dealing with...family. When he gets to school the next day he has to deal with the same stuff with senpai (Fukka). It’s as if the writers got in a loop. After that tsundere moment again Fukka gets a heart change the next day because Yuu just happened to tickets to a concert to her favorite singer. Honestly the mood swings in the show are so weird. So later on the idea of making band came in and I was just like nope. The romance in the how was the end factor. There is a love triangle and it was so obvious how it would end.Characters:Yuu: He is shy and quiet guy who loves twitter and does not have many friends. I like him for he actually does his best through the show to be a better him.Fukka: The reason I stopped watching. She came off as a jerk and then as weird mood swings a times. She is selfish and the plot caters to her like crazy. It is abad thing when the name of the show is what ruins it.Koyuki: She is the childhood friend of Yuu and I was rooting for her and Yuu, but Fukka said no to that. She is very werid when Yuu mentions Fukk a and does not try to listen to Yuu after he tries to defend himself. But still I like her better than Fukka.Everyone Else: The others are pretty likable and don’t hinder the story or the quality of it. family.

There is a love triangle and it was so obvious how it would end.Characters:Yuu: He is shy and quiet guy who loves twitter and does not have many friends. I like him for he actually does his best through the show to be a better him.Fukka: The reason I stopped watching. She came off as a jerk and then as weird mood swings a times. She is selfish and the plot caters to her like crazy. It is abad thing when the name of the show is what ruins it.Koyuki: She is the childhood friend of Yuu and I was rooting for her and Yuu, but Fukka said no to that. She is very werid when Yuu mentions Fukk a and does not try to listen to Yuu after he tries to defend himself. But still I like her better than Fukka.Everyone Else: The others are pretty likable and don’t hinder the story or the quality of it.', 'Fuuka... I\'ve read the manga first, because I knew how society viewed this anime, and once I finished reading the manga (which I reviewed as well), I immediately jumped to watch the adaptation, expecting disappointment, and to be honest, I expected a lot worse.StoryThe first I\'d say half of the anime pretty much follows the manga, which was fairly pleasant. I was starting to enjoy it, looking forward how they might adapt some future scenes. However, the studio probably knew beforehand this wouldn\'t get any more seasons, so they had to make a full story in just 12 episodes, so I can see why...they had to change a lot of things to make the anime feel complete. But I\'d say, this approach wasn\'t as good as they might have thought. I\'m really trying here to be unbiased here, because I really loved the manga, but I guess I can\'t really help myself in some ways. There is a really major plot twist in manga which sets up to story for the whole series, and pushes its characters to grow, but in the anime, this plot twist is completely thrown out of the window and replaced with a forced cliche romance drama without any foreshadowing. It\'s a red flag in all entertainment medium to make characters act differently than their personality directs without any explanation or character development, just for the plot, and that\'s exactly what this anime did. It made up a character, presented its personality, and then just made the character act like a completely different character, and if you\'d have read the manga, you\'d be utterly disgusted how much they have butchered this character, just for the sake of plot development.I\'m glad they cut out some of those stupid ""falling face first into boobs"" scenes, even though not all of them.I really liked the ending. If I wouldn\'t read the manga, I\'d feel completely satisfied, and I think having a nicely wrapped up story at the end is a crucial element for a good ending. Even though we didn\'t get to see all the hardships the band had to go through, it\'s nice to see how they ended up.ArtPleasant to look at. It\'s not anything remarkable, but I\'d say it worked out well. The concert scenes don\'t have a lot of choreography in them, but for example the drums are animated nicely.SoundI was really looking forward to hearing those songs I never had a chance to hear in the manga, for a few exceptions, there weren\'t even any lyrics, so I was wondering if they\'ll somehow match my imagination, and they actually did. Songs were really drum and guitar heavy, giving you the sense of hype, which is so important in the manga. However, it felt a bit weird to hear Fuuka\'s really high pitch voice when she talks and then suddenly change into a grown up woman who has a deeper voice than some males out there. And then there is the background music. I don\'t know if I would be happier if there was none, but most of it were just generic melodies you hear in most of your rom-com series, which was a bit disappointing considering it\'s a music anime. It didn\'t really pull me out of the experience, but I guess I just had my expectations way to high. Also, I couldn\'t keep up the count of how many times mostly Haruna said ""huh?"". That\'s what I call a shitty dialog script.CharactersBecause they chose to change the main plot twist which forced the characters grow, there isn\'t much character development. Haruna does get over his phone addiction and makes friends, but he\'s still that wimpy crybaby he was at the start. Mikasa is still kinda cool, but we didn\'t get to see some of my favorite scenes with him, because of the story line change. Nachi is Chad, just like in the manga, so I have no complaints there. He actually seemed like he was most passionate about the band, so that was a nice addition. Sara went through the most character development I\'d say. From being rude, to talkative and kind, and from loving Haruna, to not giving a single fuck about his love life, which was a bit confusing to see actually.OverallIt\'s really hard to be unbiased here. I don\'t know if I\'d enjoy this show without reading the manga first, but I\'d say the adaptation could have been way worse. It\'s a shame they didn\'t have the budget to make an adaptation of the whole story, but hey, that\'s the anime industry for ya. I hate to say it to you only anime watchers, but read the fricking manga man...*SPOILER SECTION*Even though I hate the change of the main plot twist, it was nice to see an alternative universe in which Fuuka stays alive and gets to live a happy life she deserves with her precious band and Haruna. If I wasn\'t thrown off by all the bullshit that happened, it would maybe even make me cry to see her so happy. they had to change a lot of things to make the anime feel complete.

Personal growth in between the characters and the way the cliches were portrayed including the love triangle was entertaining, to be honest I cried (don't know why)...it was a very touching ending.

It's the kind of anime where it is just so cliche and to be expected. Though I cried reading the manga, I was glad to see the anime had a different outcome. Manga was just fucking sad.Story------Honestly the story is just complete cliche that anyone could write this kind of story, but this is the kind of anime where you want to see something cliche and to be expected (I mean, that's what I thought of when I wanted to watch it). The drama is just so normal and...the romance is what not like every other anime. I don't really like to criticize things because even though the story wasn't too good, the writer had at least tried to make us enjoy his work. So the story is pretty damn cliche that is all I have to say and you should watch it if you want to see some cliche anime where you can predict what's gonna happen. In my opinion, this story is way better than Suzuka.7/10Art------Art style is fine in my opinion. I've always liked anime girls that have a more of a 'tomboy' kind of personality (like short hair and not shy and stuff but is still a girl inside). There is not much to explain here, since the props drawn are like every other anime out there. Unique art styles would be like Honobono log etc.8/10Sound------The opening is great, I mean, the anime is kinda about music so what can I say? The voice acting is fair, not shabby. And I really don't know what else I am gonna say here.8/10------Character------I don't know, I haven't seen this anime in a while, but I think the male MC's personality could've been better, I mean, it relates to the story so what can I say? I'm kinda unsatisfied with most of their personalities.4/10Overall------I can't really give this anime under 5/10 since I never felt hate towards the plots or anything just unsatisfaction. It is different to the kind of satisfaction to when there is a cliffhanger, I have this unsatisfaction where the anime could have been better. i mean, I feel like I should rate it 3/10 and below when the anime just has a very shitty plot and I go around talking to myself saying things like 'what the fuck? that was just fucking stupid'.

Koyuki talked to her manager about resigning and everything went fine (I don\'t have any knowledge about this one haha), eventually Koyuki became a part of the band, and then Kuyoki and Fuuka had a conversation alone about Fuuka\'s feelings about Yuu but Fuuka cleared things out that she has moved on, things went well.As time went by and they became skillful (I know the anime is not quite accurate, I\'m a bass player and all I can say is ""everyone will never be a pro in a short time unless they are talented""), A  music producer Akira Mogami from Flying Cat Inc. recruited their band.That\'s all, everyone is happyAs the ending part where they are adults, Koyuki and Yuu ended up having a child while Fuuka ended up with somebody else.Hope you appreciate this.I\'m writing this so that I don\'t feel devastated sign that she should forget about her feelings for Yuu and accept the fact that Yuu is already in a relationship with Koyuki and continue performing on the band.

Also manages to put all the complete story in those 12 episodes, with no open or confusing ending or something like that.ART: 7The Art it\'s not bad the scene in episode one with Fuuka in the roof it\'s very good, and in the rest of the anime there level of animation is good too, it\'s not breathtaking, but does not have any major flaw.

It sounds awesome, it sounds very good, I can\'t give it less then a 8, some songs gave me chills, all the instruments where accurately represented and both singer\'s voices where not bad at all. I can\'t give them more since even that some of the songs where good, none of them made me stand up and dance or wanted to download it, but listening them in the moment they are putted in (the perfect moment) it\'s something that I really enjoyed.CHARACTER: 7Each character is presented in their own way, they have their own motto, and their own taste, Fuuka does not stop of being the energetic person that she is even when she struggles with herself, the other characters have their own backstory that is simple to comprehend, even tho they are presendted at the exact right timming they are needed, witch makes it look a little bit forced, that\'s the reason that I can\'t give the characters more then a 7. There are also ""coincidences"" that are too damn perfect to give the characters more then a 7. Not to spoil, but each time any main character needs a ""push"" something happens exactly when needed (I know that\'s very, very common in animes to have a reson to put that ""character development"" somewhere, but this time they where so perfecty timed, it made look less ""real"")Also, I saw lots of people complaining about how they made some unreasonable decisions, but I think that\'s the thing, they are high school students, they are trying to find they way out, even if it reasonably may look like the craziest and dumbest idea, they give it a try (and since Fuuka is so energic, it does not look that much forced the way they develop, witch is ironic because there is a momment when they all agree that Fuuka forced all of them to make it into the group).ENJOYMENT: 9I did watch it for the first time long time ago, and suddenty remembered it, so I decided to re-watch it, and I did not regret it, sure the show it\'s not perfect, but I had a great time just enjoying some Twitter addict get hit so hard it could have breaked his neck, for looking at panties when he shouldn\'t.Jokes aside, it felt good to watch, and I personally enjoyed it a lot. The protagonist had his moment to shine, the childhod friend had her chance of seeing if she was or was not ""the one"" and the girl that couldn\'t understand her emotions did find a way to put them in words.(Witch it\'s cliché, ""everything ends fine"", but what else do you want. I wouldn\'t want to see every drama end like Plastic Memories, Air or even Assassination Classroom, some times I enjoy a drama with a happy ending)OVERALL: 8It\'s a very good show to just watch and relax, enjoy and have a nice time. It\'s not the best music anime, not even close (Given and Nana are far way better) but it finds a way to give you a great time, a series really worth to watch.So overall it\'s a great show that everyone can enjoy! just ended rewatching it, as I see it, the Story gets a 3 at best.

I wouldn\'t want to see every drama end like Plastic Memories, Air or even Assassination Classroom, some times I enjoy a drama with a happy ending)OVERALL: 8It\'s a very good show to just watch and relax, enjoy and have a nice time. It\'s not the best music anime, not even close (Given and Nana are far way better) but it finds a way to give you a great time, a series really worth to watch.So overall it\'s a great show that everyone can enjoy!', ""I see there is mixed opinions, so I wanted to write my first review so I can tell you all the positives, and the negatives about Fuuka. If you are looking for great characters in this anime, I'd suggest to look for another anime. The characters are pretty generic, dense MC, hot guy character, hot headed character, you know the drill. Akitsuka Fuuka, you might like her, or you could her annoying. Me, however, she isn't all that bad. I think she is one of the only characters that keeps me interested in the show. She is required in the show so the show can...be decent, and bring out the best out of the characters. My least favorite is Sara. It's because she gets a little bit of scenes, she had potiental at first when she met Yuu, but later on, turned into a very bland character. If you are looking for Art, I'd say it's a decent pick. It's not outstanding, but it can very look pretty. It's the usual slice of life imagery, the school, the city, etc. But it's done in a great way. If you are looking for an anime with good music, this is it. It's easily the best part of the anime. Catchy songs that will make your head bop. Especially if you are a rock fan. It is definitely replayable. If you are looking for an anime with a great story... well... it's not too bad. I've just seen romance animes that could do this better... like White Album 2. Although it is too sad for me, haha. If you want a better ending than White Album 2, then this is the anime for you. Well I'll the summarize the story of Fuuka without spoiling it, a romance anime that has a love triangle, one is a popular singer and an inspiring singer with her own band. A lot of drama throughout the story, and if you don't like drama, this is ain't it for you, but it isn't emotional personally, so if you hate crying, I believe you should be fine. Not much I can say about the story overall, I think it's ok or decent. Overall, the sound of the anime is the selling point of the anime, and if you love musical anime, you should watch it for that. Overall, a 7.9. I know, very specific, but I feel like that's the perfect score for this anime. be decent, and bring out the best out of the characters. My least favorite is Sara.

WA2 left me empty and i hated everything about the ending, and how the relationships worked. Fuuka did a better job with the whole ""I love him so much but dont have the courage to tell him face to face"" thing. There were tons of misunderstandings the whole time, and they get resolved quick (12 episodes is a bit tight) but its not like it was *horribly done* yaknow? It was a relatively average plot regardless, dont get me wrong, but it was also a good kind of...average too. Cliche but not so Cliche that it felt boring. Evewry episode is just FILLED with plot points. Like easily 3 at minimum, and thats not even including any drama or resolutions.Would i watch this again? Yaknow, it being so short, yea i probably would. not any time soon as theres still more i want to watch, but Im more likely to rewatch this than WA2. Im sorry i keep referencing that, but its the best example i have.**SPOILER but also not spoiler**We got the fabled beach episode on episode 3 and it was FILLED with with drama and plot.

I get the impression a lot of the hate on this anime is something to do with the aforementioned manga and changes that were made in the anime.With that said let me get a couple of things off my chest. Introversion isn't something that you 'fix'. As a proud introvert the idea that this kid needed to by an energetic extrovert was kinda insulting. The second is learning to play an instrument involves more than just luck. It takes years and years of work. This element of Fuuka is just dumb and frustrating.Fuuka is...a romantic comedy anime with a blindingly obvious story, no surprises and a dull protagonist. Childhood friend? Tick. Energetic girl comes into his life through an accident? Tick. Sisters who (while at least they don't fancy Yuu) mostly wear no clothes? Tick.OK so contrary to what I've said so far I didn't actually hate Fuuka, I enjoyed it. There are two main factors for this:Firstly the music. It's right up my street and I now listen to Climber's High regularly. I also enjoyed how passionate about music Fuuka and the supporting cast was, even if Yuu didn't ever seem to really care about being in the band specifically, it's what drags the plot along, and it does it well.Secondly the supporting cast. Let's make one thing clear, despite also being a shy introvert I really didn't like Yuu, I found him to be either callous, distant or just weak. However, everyone around him and Fuuka are real characters with real personalities and stories of their own. The banter between Kazuya and Makato is particularly good at times. This is excluding Koyuki, who at least in the anime is written as a hopeless, lovesick schoolgirl with absolutely no other character traits. Honestly I felt sorry for the character.Fuuka is worth a shot if you don't have the energy for complex storylines and just want light entertainment with no thought process.Side note: I've googled the Manga's plot and really get the hate if you loved the manga. To be honest I think this anime would have been better if they'd attached an original IP to it. a romantic comedy anime with a blindingly obvious story, no surprises and a dull protagonist.

At first, the worst he can be is someone with absolutely no personality. It seems he was created for the very reason as a blank canvas for viewers to project themselves on. At worst, he is just purely unlikeable. The show wastes your time by building a relationship of the main character with someone else, only for the main character to dump basically perfect girlfriend in every way, for someone so is just(if not more) unlikeable than he is. I highly recommend you don't watch this anime if your a fan of romance....The only saving grace is the music is pretty good. But if you're fans of a good story, don't watch this. Entertainment is subjective, but awful writing is not. The only saving grace is the music is pretty good. But if you're fans of a good story, don't watch this.

While School Days is kinda dreadful until the ending saves it, this one started just okay only to go straight downhill..Put logic asides(mc suddenly be able to play bass on short notice while before this he cant even play an instruments is already a joke) , its how story plays out that pissed me off the most.. A slight difference between manga and anime is acceptable, but a totally different ending makes this anime loses its essence..As for the character, Fuuka.. What a sloppy character development.. Sure she just about to know love...but come on, did you really need to kill an ENTIRE band that YOU FORCEFULLY CREATE just because of your male mc is dating your favorite idol.. How about at least try to win his affections 1st before deciding ""Alright I am out f ya all"", or prove it otherwise..

I was an anime only guy before that. Anyway, I love the manga of the series, so I decided to watch the anime after I've read some stuff of the manga, and oh God, what a bad decision. The anime is fun and all until it gets to the end of it. I will not say what happend, but it dramatically changed where the story headed, to a point that is impossible to even go back to what...the original go for. But what droves me crazy, is that the end trully made Fuuka a totally different character and it trully infuriates me, especially because I love her as a character. One thing that I also dislike, is that exist a huge song by The Hedgehogs, that is The Town Were The Stars Fell, that is like, the greatest song in all time, BUT, we Never hear They play the song at any point in the anime, they even chose another song of The Hedgehogs to play in the openning. So yeah, go read the manga and listen to the Fuuka album, is waaaaaay more worthy! the original go for.

The beginning of the anime seemed kind of hopeful but as it went on I realized that the pace is way too fast and I've never seen an anime that genuinely made me hate it as much as this. The fan service, all the unrequited love, what seemed to be the main girl being practically cut from the spotlight. I beg you to not watch this show its a waste of your time as much as it was mine. I really liked Fuukas character but with the fanservice and fast paced story it...ruined her. ruined her."", 'It starts off with the hardest cliché ever. The ""Meet cute"" then a love triangle. But then it starts to kind of not become cliché. Then fan service but that\'s a given with anime most time but it was during the boring parts to keep the watcher enticed. Then when it starts to escalate. One girl clearly had more personality than the other as well which kind of was upsetting and forced for us to like more.So you\'ll honestly need to watch the whole thing to be honest to fully enjoy it. I didn\'t really get bored of it just waited to see where...it goes. Should\'ve stuck with what happened in the manga i felt like that would\'ve really pushed the show higher up and way interesting.

I believe the prequel to this has aired, but I didn\'t watch it prior to this because I didn\'t know about it.Story: This series, Fuuka, introduces us to Yuu, who is most seemingly an ordinary high school student.  Due to his parent\'s job transfer, he had to recently change schools.  He spends much of his time on Twitter and is pretty attached to his cell phone.  On the way to his new school, a girl named Fuuka runs into him and accuses him of taking an upskirt photo of her....When Yuu finally gets to school, it turns out that she\'s in his class.  Though they eventually patch things up, Fuuka mentions to Yuu that she would like to be a professional singer someday - she uses her CD Walkman frequently and doesn\'t even own a cell phone.Much of the story up until the point in which Yuu and Fuuka form a band - which isn\'t really a spoiler - is a bit of a mess.  There\'s plenty of moments that they decide to mix in a lot of silly or fan-servicey moments and it all comes out as feeling really unnecessary.  The beginning half felt really forgettable and it takes until the back half to enjoy the story.  Another problem with the first half is that it builds upon a lot of coincidental moments, making things fall into our cast of characters\' lap way too easily.  The road to get there just feels forced and I didn\'t love it.However, once we get to the back half, the anime became a lot more enjoyable of a watch.  Everything from the settings, the characters and the story as whole, lined up a lot nicer - not to just make the series okay, but actually enjoyable!  I just wish the road to get there wasn\'t so messy.  (6/10)Characters: For being so short, this anime does boast a fairly large cast - as minor as a bunch of these characters are.  Fuuka is our main star of the show.  She is a character that seemingly jumps to conclusions a little too hastily, and as the audience, we kind of see how the results of that.  However, it\'s very clear that she has a kind heart.  I don\'t recall it ever being fully explained, but she never owns a cell phone.  This seems slightly strange because this anime clearly is in an age where it\'s common for everyone to have one.  She\'s a huge music nut, especially with a local artist, Koyuki.  Our main male character, Yuu comes off as really clumsy in the beginning half of the anime, and suddenly changes to a lot more of a likable character in the back half - which is part of the reason the story gets to be at a more tolerable level.  Yuu seems to be the best at interacting with people, even if it seems awkward to us.  Outside of the aforementioned front half, he\'s mostly a likable character.  The only problem is that the pairing of him and Fuuka feels forced at times.  He\'s also apparently a quick learner because of his dedication to learn to play a bass in pretty quick fashion.Koyuki is a really popular musical artist, as well as the childhood friend of Yuu.  I really enjoyed her character as she always seemed like the most level headed of the bunch.  She seems to forget her own fame at times, but she does her best to ""have a life"" outside of her professional status.  Her interactions with Yuu were really nice, in part because the anime didn\'t try and get silly (for the lack of a better word) with her.  I have many feelings about how they go about her character in the back half, but most of them are spoiler related.Sara, Makoto and Kazuya have differing ambitions about their future, but end of joining Fuuka\'s band by different means.  The latter two are definitely more interesting and Makoto was the most level headed of the bunch.  They do hint at a few more backstory elements on him more so than the others and I somewhat wish they explored them more.  As a band, they meshed together quite nicely.  Sara\'s a bit of a weird one to figure out because they kind of make her the music nerd that Fuuka is, but perhaps that\'s what\'s nice about including her in the band.As a whole, the cast is strong... if you take out some of the unnecessary fluff in the beginning half (notice a trend yet?).  Many of the characters introduced in the second half are fine additions, but the way the anime goes about introducing everyone feels too convenient.  So, while the story writing seems lazy, the characters themselves are good!  (8/10)Art: Fuuka is a fine looking anime that doesn\'t seek push to much visually.  The obvious thing to point out is that there\'s a lot of fan-service moments that feel horribly unnecessary, and this anime would have been much more enjoyable without it.  Something I do wish I saw more often during band shots that showed more character movement so, while we enjoy the music we listen to, more shots of the band enjoying what they\'re doing would have added to the visuals.  It\'s minor, yes, but as someone who spent much of his high school in the school band, enjoyment of the music is one of many reasons people play.  (7/10)Sound: You have to give credit where credit is due, Fuuka sounded amazing.  The OP, ED and band songs were amazing and it meshed well with this anime.  I loved it all.  At times, I did have to turn my brain off because of my disinterest in the music-anime genre as a whole, but once we got going, it all was amazing.  Something of note is that I unknowingly watched this in its first English runthrough.  I later went back to watch a bunch of things in its ""uncut"" version and they actually made English versions of all the songs, sung by Fuuka\'s English VO, Jill Harris.  This also goes for Koyuki\'s tunes, sung by her VO, Jeannie Tirado.  The problem here is that neither of them are professional singers and it\'s not a great listen.  The OP, Climber\'s High, isn\'t ""awful"" in English, but unfortunately, the original tracks are just better.  That being said, when they aren\'t singing, both Jill Harris (Fuuka) and Jeannie Tirado (Koyuki) were solid.  Aaron Dismuke (Yuu), for all the awkwardness the character brings, did a really good job here too.  I really have no gripes about the VO cast as a whole.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: When you get down to it, Fuuka\'s an enjoyable watch, assuming you can get past the first half.  The characters are mostly on the strong side, even if the story writing is a bit painful at times.  However, the music makes up for it.  I feel like this anime gets hit harder than most because of the beginning half (and the unnecessary fan service associated with it), but ignore it and you\'ll be fine.

(7/10)', ""I usually dont leave reviews, but I feel like something just has to be said about the absolute trainwreck that is the Fuuka anime.Disclaimer: There will be spoilers for both the manga and the animeThe characters in Fuuka are bland and boring offering the story very little. The main character Yuu is addicted to Twitter making him shy and antisocial. That is, of course, until he meets female lead Fuuka; an energetic girl who would rather live in the moment than be absorbed in something as meaningless as Twitter (I'm sure a 5-year-old can see where this is going). Fuuka feels as though her...life is missing something and upon Yuu's advice decides to take up music. She goes from a girl with no musical experience to a genius singer seemingly overnight and forms a highschool band.My main problem with the story isn't it's cookie-cutter characters, it's the anime original ending.  The manga made this out to be something of a tragedy with Fuuka getting killed before her first big concert.

Essentially its about childhood friend that leaves to go prove her worth and love  to the person she loves . But all that effort is literally is for nothing because random nobody girl steal his heart without much effort. I really hate anime that do this kinda cliche . Effort should always be rewarded. It was obviously  based on the title this about those story that childhood friend Nevers wins. It such cliche writing trope in Japanese stories. It's annoying because theirs hardly ever childhood love stories where they win against.It wouldve been more surprising to...have protagonist realize all the effort she put into showing her love to him. have protagonist realize all the effort she put into showing her love to him."", ""I started off really enjoying the series.

I just feel like it could have been handled better emotionally and that is what is annoying mostly to...me.

Although plagued with the issues that face a short this show proved to be really enjoyable.Story 6:Because it\'s a short it\'s really hard for the story to really develop and due to the nature of the show with each episode as a stand alone it didn\'t seem to have much going for it.Art 8:Although nothing special the art was cute and managed to stay out of the ""generic"" feel.  This let the show rest on it\'s characters which is where it really shines.Character 8:Again with...the issue of shorts characters did not have a lot of time to develop but thats not to say that they didn\'t.  The characters were all unique and I enjoyed the concept of each being attached to a different kind of animal.  They all were interesting and fun.Sound 8:The sound wasn\'t stand out fantastic however the ending\'s melody and lyrics were cute and catchy and fit the show well.   I found myself listening to it a number of times and enjoying the wordplay and humor as well as the upbeat melody.Enjoyment 10:Enjoyment is something that is really subjective and I\'m going to be biased here because I LOVE YURI.  The light yuri in this was outstanding and although I was spoiled by last seasons Sakura Trick I still found it really cute and appreciative.  I really enjoyed each episode with each one actually making me laugh.  The best way to put it is they were just fun.Overall 9:This may be because I rate high but I really enjoyed this show.  It\'s unfortunate that shorts tend to get lower ratings because they don\'t have time to expand on their plot but I had a blast watching each episode of this.  I really wish that it would come back for a full cour with full length episodes.   I\'d recommend it to anyone who enjoys light yuri or slice of life. the issue of shorts characters did not have a lot of time to develop but thats not to say that they didn\'t.

Perhaps production costs to make 23 to 25 minute episodes for simplistic yon koma series like Yuyushiki just don't seem to make sense to the directors. Think about it--You can literally sum up this whole series in ONE episode if it were 24 minutes.

In 2014 Seven, a studio I've never reviewed works of before, put out an anime adaptation. Made up of three minute episodes. Which, to be fair, is long enough for the jokes you find in a four panel manga. So, let's see if they use their format well. I'll be including the special in this review since the series is so short.Story:We open with a quick introduction to our main characters. Inugami Yachiyo has a lot of canine-like traits, as her name suggests, but she loves cats. Nekoyama Suzu...is the opposite. In keeping with her name, she has a lot of feline-like traits but she loves dogs. The two meet through a mutual friend and pretty much become instantly moist for one another. They go on to meet some other girls with animalistic traits and corresponding names and get into all kinds of shenanigans.The biggest issue with the series is that some of Yachiyo's plans to get closer to Suzu are really uncool. Like when they go on that hot spring trip and Yachiyo keeps trying to grope her among other things. The other notable example is the catnip episode. In all fairness, she doesn't actually cross the line at any point but she comes close enough to make it a bit uncomfortable.On the positive side of the spectrum, the humour does generally work well and the short episodes are handily utilised. The flirtations among the girls are quite charming. So, it is a pretty thoroughly enjoyable series. And it's very much a situation where you can't expect much more from it, given that it runs for around forty minutes total.Characters:The characters are pretty simple comedic school girls. However, the series does a good job of giving its characters a mesh of animalistic traits and more human ones. Save for Aki, who's the more ordinary girl. Her job is to roll her eyes and be snarky about her friends and their shenanigans. And the characters, though simplistic, do have strong comedic interactions with plenty of potential for more. This series could be twenty six half hour episodes and have plenty to do with the cast.Art:The character designs are nicely done and their movements are well animated. There are also some nice backgrounds and object art. And that's pretty much to be expected since these are three minute episodes and you'd know Seven just didn't give a shit if they couldn't be bothered to put together good art for it.Sound:Our main girls are voiced by Uesaka Sumire & Touyama Nao, both of whom are very good. We also get some strong performances from Ootsubo Yuka, Horino Sayaka, Yamazaki Erii and others. The music is quite nice as well.Ho-yay:There's a lot. Pretty much every girl, except Aki, has a blatant lesbian love interest. Suzu has Yachiyo. Mikine has Yukiji. Sora has Hibari. And it doesn't end that simply either. There's a lot of flirtation just among the characters in general. I'd suggest polyamory, but there's clearly some jealousy issues present that would make that untenable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san. Ultimately, it holds up really damn well. For forty minutes, you aren't going to find a much better comedy and I really enjoyed that. If you want a quick comedy split into segments with heavy yuri elements, this is for you. I'll give it an 8/10. Next week, Made in Abyss. is the opposite. In keeping with her name, she has a lot of feline-like traits but she loves dogs.

That\'s it. That\'s literally the plot. There wasn\'t anything noteworthy about the plot in every episode, considering they fall under generic settings for a slice-of-life series, like ""a day at the pool"", ""a day at the summer festival"", etcetera.Art: 6/10The art was decent, but I didn\'t like it so much. I can\'t put my finger on it, but...something int he art just didn\'t feel comfortable for me and it didn\'t really leave a good memory for me. One good thing though was that I saw the body proportions done well and not exaggerated.Sound: 6/10The sound for the series was alright, although nothing memorable. I found the voice acting to be fairly nice and cute for my tastes.Characters: 5/10I give my rating like this because I found the characters fairly bland and they kinda acted like the animal they represented. Inugami acts like a dog since she\'s outgoing and friendly (despite loving cats), while Nekoyama acts like a cat since she\'s shy and introverted (despite loving dogs). There\'s Nezu, who is like a mouse in the sense that she eats a lot of cheese and is nocturnal. Ushiwaka is like a cow, being very docile and has large breasts. Sarutobi is the class president who tends to displays traits of monkeys, even though she tries to hide it. Hibari is Sora\'s childhood friend, who is often absent due to her poor health. Finally, there is Tamaki, Nekoyama\'s older sister who dates several women and suffers constant hangovers. Note from all the characters I\'ve just written that there is NOT A SINGLE MALE CHARACTER in this.Enjoyment: 6/10I can\'t say that I liked or disliked this series, but rather I had an indifference towards it. Some of the scenes made me feel nothing or slightly cringe at it, whether it be a yuri scene or just a silly scene. The puns were a bit cringy as well and many of the jokes weren\'t so funny to me.Overall: 6/10This was really the first yuri series I\'ve ever seen, and I think it was a bit ""over praised"" for what it really delivers.

It has the lack luster comedy with all the misunderstandings , the annoying screechy characters, the highschool setting etc. If the episodes were 23 minutes instead of 3, I don't even think that would help it...at all because there will just be more boring stuff going in the show. Nothing about this was all that memorable. I guess i'm giving it a 3/10 just because it ended quickly. at all because there will just be more boring stuff going in the show.

For instance the short girl with blue hair and pigtails (I honestly forgot her name), I didn\'t realize that she was portraying characteristics of a mouse. Then again it is kind of obvious but this could be because I was personally slow at realizing it. But the one that I could not really figure out was the girl with green hair (again, forgot her name). Was she supposed to be a ghost or like a slow animal or something? I have no idea. But the fact that each character was representative of some type of animal is interesting. And I have to say that they were portrayed pretty alright.EnjoymentWhile watching this anime, there were moments when I did enjoy myself a bit but at the same time I was just thinking, ""what in the world am I watching?"" Mainly because I was watching this late at night on YouTube. (Yes I watched this on YouTube but does that mean I watch all my anime on Youtube....

There are also times when the show makes innuendos so for those people who like that kind of thing, you can try this.Art: 6The art is fair.

Not much plot even able to fit into that. I mean there relationship progressed a small amount from strangers to idk each others crushes?? I don\'t even think they got together... Art was fairly simple, nothing stood out. Character designs for the most part were pretty basic, they were adorable though. Personalities were nice, Nekoyama when she was drunk was sadistic and very horny. Which I personally enjoyed, a lot. I don\'t have much to say about this show. You can watch...it in less than a hour, and it\'s something I watched to kill some time. It was enjoyable for what it was. I feel like it could\'ve been way better if there relationship developed more, maybe if they started dating, actually kissed, didn\'t just hold hands, stuff like that! It was more comedy based then a actually Yuri Romance, but I mean we still got some good ""romantic"" moments. Overall, 6/10. Wouldn\'t really watch again, but  I don\'t necessarily regret watching it. :) it in less than a hour, and it\'s something I watched to kill some time. It was enjoyable for what it was.

I was VERY disappointed by it.The story was just kind of bad. It went nowhere with its characters and would mention potential plot points left and right like the biology club and karaoke with the entire group but just didn't deliver. Short form animes can deliver on stories (ex Please Tell Me! Galko-chan which has good development about breaking down walls and stereotypes) but Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san ended abruptly because nothing happened with he characters. There was just no closure.

Some of the voice acting annoyed me but that was because of the character tropes. I gave the sound a 5The characters weren't bad, they just weren't fleshed out well. The two mains were nice. I really liked dog girl and cat girl was okay. The pigtail loli girl was annoying af.

The episodes were boring and it felt like they dragged on forever despite being 3 minutes long. I felt pure exhilaration as soon as the final episode ended.

I didn't expect it to be good. I didn't expect it to be bad. Because of this, I can say that I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this show.Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san is a series of anime shorts that are focused on the two titular characters, Yachiyo Inugami and Suzu Nekoyama. There isn't really much in the way of a story, rather each episode of the show is self contained, with very limited continuity between them. The main focus of the show are the interactions between Inugami and Nekoyama. Inugami, despite having a...dog-like sirname, loves cats while Nekoyama, while having a cat-like surname, is fond of dogs. When the two meet, their dispositions match the animal of their sirnames, leading to Inugami and Nekoyama to become attracted to one another. There isn't really much in the way of romance here, as there really isn't' enough time to develop it. As such, the show uses yuri to a more comedic effect. Fan service also isn't amiss in this show, and if that's your thing then hey, even more reason to like this show.As the show doesn't really have any continuity, nor is long enough to have a fleshed out story, it relies on its comedy and fan service to entice people into watching it. For me, I found the show to be funny, with its fan service complementing the overall absurd nature of the show. The show also lacks any tension or drama, so this is the perfect show to cleanse your palette or wash the salt away from a show you just watched.The art style matches the overall nature of the show: Cutesy. The music of the show is also fairly good, but ultimately forgettable. Another disappointing aspect is its short length. I'm not really a fan of anime shorts, however its understandable as its adaptation was from a 4 panel manga that has only been released in 3 volumes.Collectively, all of the parts of this show culminate to make an enjoyable, fun experience that will allow you to kill an hour or so. While disappointing in its length and story, it makes up for it in its comedy and interactions between the characters.

Kizuna Ichigeki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10016/Kizuna_Ichigeki,"[""Due to the lack of free time which is supposed to be allotted for my daily serving of anime, I resorted to watching short anime films and such. Of course, I was hoping to find something as magnificent yet light as Tsumiki no Ie. Then I stumbled upon the 4 short anime shows that comprised the 2010 Young Animators' Training Project. As the name of the said endeavor implies, its an on-the-job-training project funded by the Japanese Animation Creators Association to train fresh aspiring animators. Although I found it not as touching, unique and outstanding as Tsumiki no Ie, this anime collection was still worth...the watch as each story brought me back to those shows and stories I used to love when I was still a child.First of the four I watched from this great compilation is Kizuna Ichigeki. Its a short episode in the life of Kizuna Todoroki, a young and spunky twelve year-old little girl. Being in a family of martial artists, she exhibits her fighting prowess in a martial arts tournament. Eventually she won, became champion and took off with the 100 million yen prize. Unfortunately, she had no idea she broke one of the competition's rules being under the age of thirteen and her last sore loser of an opponent took advantage of this and broadcasted that anyone who defeats Kizuna becomes the real champion and gets the 100 million. Upon hearing this crowds of martial artists gathered over at the Todoroki's to challenge Kizuna.Now how is she going to defeat all of them? And how are they going to give back the 100 mil when its already been spent in a snap, paying Kizuna's grandfather's gambling debts? (And how and where the heck did ol' gramps pile up that much debt?!)STORY: 7Although this single episode anime's plot and its development is paced quite well, a bit of lighthearted scenes and great elements of comedy (even parodies) are evident, there are quite a few details that bug me for having been given little attention. Kizuna's family and their history for example, and how Kizuna became that strong in a short span of time despite his gramps saying she just learned from imitating him and his son's training. (maybe she's like Son Goku or something). Thus, these elements, give me some feeling like its a special or single episode taken from a series. Well, on a positive note, I think it can pass for a good shounen series given the chance it gets serialized as an anime.ART/ANIMATION: 8At a glance, Kizuna Ichigeki seems drawn in a rush, haphazard style, given the unfinished and unrefined lines and the very simple character designs, bright and vibrant colors though make up for it, giving it the perfect feel of a comedy anime/cartoon for young viewers. Also the fight scenes which are very well executed with dynamic camera angles and well-animated movement of characters is another huge plus for this show.MUSIC: 9One of the best parts of Kizuna Ichigeki has to be the music. The OP music, with its shaolin-kung-fu-esque motif, is very fitting of a martial arts themed show. The background music gives the right feel on each scene especially on one fight scene in particular, which I really enjoyed, is played with catchy funky music which really catches the excitement and intensity of the scene. The ED theme is perfectly light and matches the background Todoroki family montage where it plays along to.ENJOYMENT: 9I totally enjoyed the fight scenes, the animation and its ensuing comedy, Ol' gramps funny character and parodies, and Jingoro, their pet cat was really a surprise.

It’s all incredibly silly, with the old man randomly referencing K-ON in the middle of it, and a lot of fun due to the visual variety in the martial arts battles. It goes for a sketchy-line look, which works well with the tone they’re going for. That said, it is rather shallow.

Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9750/Itsuka_Tenma_no_Kuro_Usagi,"[""Open endings, don't you just hate them? It's okay when a sequel is made but nothing of the sort is even planned. This is something Zexecs keeps doing, examples of this are Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu, Chrome Shelled Regios and of course this series, Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi. However this series lacks a lot of things that the two other series listed above have.  It doesn't leave you wanting for more like the other two.The story is a mess. For a series that is only twelve episodes long, it jumps from place to place a lot. Although the events do have some...sort of connections to each other, they seem to come out of nowhere. Even though there are a lot of things happen, the plot hardly goes anywhere.  Almost everything that happens is not interesting or memorable. The ending does set itself up for a sequel but here’s the problem, when has Zexecs ever created a sequel to anything? The answer to that question is never, and it’s not just this anime produced by Zexecs that has an ending like this. They have produced a number of anime that don’t have a conclusive ending.  However despite having a lot of negatives, the series does have some positives to it. The plot does have some uniqueness to it and it is not as predictable as one may think.  The creativeness was there and if the series had been executed better who knows, the plot may have been interesting.Any series that can develop characters well in 12 or 13 episodes deserves applause because that isn’t a lot of time to really give any character any deep development. Like many other series of that length, it falls short in the character department.  The main male protagonist isn’t very bright, he just dives head first into any given situation without thinking anything out. He is nearly immortal but nearly dies on numerous occasions because of his own recklessness but without his reckless nature nothing interesting would happen so it’s understandable to why they made the character this way. He also doesn’t develop much through-out the series, he remains almost unchanged from the beginning to the end of the series. At least he isn’t oblivious or spineless. He does realize the love triangle that he is in even though it is blatantly obvious. The female characters don’t develop much either and they can also get pretty annoying with how clingy they are. They have no depth to their character. The side characters aren’t that much better either, none of the characters really stand out and aren’t memorable at all but since the series was only 12 episodes long, we can’t really expect much.The art is colorful is say the least. Every character has a different hair color and some have more than one hair color but it looks like they got lazy with the character designs, they look very basic, nothing popping out and two of them even look the same. The animation is pretty average, not bad but not outstanding either, it looks like something you would expect from any other anime.The sound is pretty average too.  Nothing special, the opening is fast which gets you pumped and the ending is very sweet. Both are catchy but nothing special.The genre of the anime gives the creators a lot of flexibility and because of that, there is a certain degree of expectation. It can be entertaining but at the end of the day the series just falls flat on its face.Overall the series is very unique but it is lacking in many areas and negatives really overshadow the positives. sort of connections to each other, they seem to come out of nowhere. Even though there are a lot of things happen, the plot hardly goes anywhere.  Almost everything that happens is not interesting or memorable. The ending does set itself up for a sequel but here’s the problem, when has Zexecs ever created a sequel to anything? The answer to that question is never, and it’s not just this anime produced by Zexecs that has an ending like this. They have produced a number of anime that don’t have a conclusive ending.  However despite having a lot of negatives, the series does have some positives to it. The plot does have some uniqueness to it and it is not as predictable as one may think.  The creativeness was there and if the series had been executed better who knows, the plot may have been interesting.Any series that can develop characters well in 12 or 13 episodes deserves applause because that isn’t a lot of time to really give any character any deep development. Like many other series of that length, it falls short in the character department.  The main male protagonist isn’t very bright, he just dives head first into any given situation without thinking anything out. He is nearly immortal but nearly dies on numerous occasions because of his own recklessness but without his reckless nature nothing interesting would happen so it’s understandable to why they made the character this way. He also doesn’t develop much through-out the series, he remains almost unchanged from the beginning to the end of the series. At least he isn’t oblivious or spineless. He does realize the love triangle that he is in even though it is blatantly obvious. The female characters don’t develop much either and they can also get pretty annoying with how clingy they are. They have no depth to their character. The side characters aren’t that much better either, none of the characters really stand out and aren’t memorable at all but since the series was only 12 episodes long, we can’t really expect much.The art is colorful is say the least.

It\'s like you plan to watch Lord of the Ring for the first time and when you do it it is :*first hour* ""Frodon ,you have to destroy the ring.Go to the Mount Doom and throw it into that damn...lava so we can screw Soron !""*Later* ""Hey Frodon ! Wanna go to the pool?"" ""F-Frodon-chan...I..I lo..Lov"" ""Waaah ! Frodon-san ,it\'s so nice that we\'re all at the beach for the summer break !""Disturbing right?...Well ,that\'s more or less the same thing with Kuro Usagi.During the first episodes it is plot after plot after plot after plot ! Everything go ultra supra fast ! Like ""This guy is an enemy ! But finally he\'s good ! Now he\'ll help us against this guy ! And now this guy is not really the worst one ! But we have to take care of that one !...Well finally we\'ve deal with that one so let\'s take care of...Oh already deal with it ,okay...But Aaaah ! Take care of the PROPHECY !!!"" And after that...""Oooh pool party ,yay ! Loli-chan ,wait for meeee ! Aaaah the beach is so nice ,let\'s go swim all together !""...Wait what?!Okay okay I\'ll stop it here and I\'ll try to make it more clear.What I try to say is that this anime is made on the wrong side.Normally on those kind of animes things go that way :1 - The hero is an idiot ,he\'s useless ,but he want to grow stronger for protecting his nakama.Childhood friend love him.The new girl love him too.He want to protect both of them and prepare for a hard training.2 - Plot incoming ! As our hero start to train for becoming stronger ,we have the plot who slowly start to appear.Mysterious enemies slowly show their face and are conspire against the hero because they want something from one of the girl ,but you don\'t know what or why.3 - Fanservice time ! Of course ,the plot is in preparation and our hero is in training ,what do we need for making everyone wait and more or less enjoy this waiting? Fan service ! Boobs ,bikini or nude scene where every characters get together at the same place at the same time with no fucking good reason just so we can have a lot of funny ,ecchi scene.4 - The hero became stronger ,but it\'s not enough and as he try to protect the so wanted girl ,he fail miserably and the girl is finally taken by the bad guys.So the hero ask X mysterious person for a special training so he can be even more stronger ,but that training contain risk but our hero don\'t give a fuck about risk so he do it because he want to save the girl !5 - The hero became even more stronger ,beat the bad guys ,save the girl ,which is about to confess or really confess her love to him.The other girl is jealous and do the same.The hero can\'t choose between both ,both get angry ,everyone laugh ,the end.That\'s how everythings go normally is those kind of anime.But in this one it\'s the opposite.We start directly with a plot ,and a new one ,and a new one ,and a new one again.First you ear about a dangerous ""demon"" or so who was linked to Himea.So you think that this one is the bad guy.But at the same time Himea is hunted by a bad guy ,Hinata ,getting out of nowhere like a wild Garen get out of the bushes and start raping everyone wih some creepy god-like magics ,so you think that this one is the main bad guy and that the ""demon"" you heard about earlier will be the main menace later.And...No.Hinata is the bad guy for one episode ,after he disappear and sometimes make some cameo here and there (Seriously I though it was Stan Lee sometimes.).Two episodes later ,the ""demon"" appear.Yea ,so soon.But you learn that it\'s not a demon but something different linked to Himea.But don\'t care too much about it because it disappear one episode later and a new plot come in !...Which is over one episode later again.And now you ear about something called Tenma which clearly when the ass of Himea ,lie he really REALLY want it that badly !..But after a little conversation he doesn\'t care anymore about Himea ,he just care about a Prophecy (Oh god how many time did I heard that word in that anime which never gave any information about it !).And finally ,as you begin to heard about the prophecy more often ,Hinata make a new cameo for saying ""Hi ,I know much more about the prophecy than you lol !"" than disappear.And now ,they tell you that the prophecy is coming...Everything is ready for that...Everyone is here just as keikaku...And now?...Fanservice time ! O.O No really ,it\'s totally that.Half of the anime it\'s ""plotting time"" and the other half it\'s ""fan service #WeDon\'tCareAboutTheStory #Yolo time"".So ,my examination :Story (5) : A lot of mysteries ,a lot of plots ,a lot of questions and...Nothing.The story started greatly and is rushed like hell ,at a point that it\'s hard to clearly understand everything because it goes just too fast for that.And finally nothing is answered ,the prophecy is coming but apparently nobody care ,the hero go for some training at the end but we don\'t know why.Everyone wanted Himea but now nobody care about her and we don\'t know why.So yea ,the story is rushed and confused and it\'s sad because it had a big potential ,but wasted.Art (8) : Artwork is great I have to admit it ,the characters are high quality and a special attention was made for the hairs because all girls have multicolor hairs.Special mention for Himea hair who apparently are full of fireflies...That\'s the only explanation I have about all those white moving spot she have everywhere in her hair !Sound (6) : Not bad ,not awesome ,it\'s fair.Characters (7) : A Useless MC ,a childhood friend ,an immortal vampire witch with fireflies in her hair ,a dark-emo ""I-Hate-Everyone"" black haired guy ,a loli with a kind of catgirl style (*-*).That\'s the casting.But I have to say that when I say ""Useless MC"" I really mean it for this one.On most shonen the MC is useless at the beginning and at the end he\'s Chuck Norris.But nah ,here he start useless and finish useless ,even as he train he continue to be useless and to be saved by Himea or Emo-boy and his loli.But anyway ,useless MC put aside ,the group is a funny one and go well together so I can\'t really say that the casting is bad.Conclusion :...Well...Dear author...The next time...Avoid the plot.Just do a Harem-style anime full of fanservice if it\'s what you wanted to do.And if not then start and FINISH your story.But don\'t do both when you plan to only do 12 episodes ,because you can\'t do both in 12 episodes !...Aaaah.Well...I think that this anime is not really bad ,but it\'s clearly not an awesome one.Watch it and make your own opinion ,I\'m sure some peoples will hate it ,some will love it ,and some like me will be neutral.PS : Damn ,I sure have talked a lot ,sorry for that and...Waw...You really have read me to this point?...Really?...You sure have time to loose :3 lava so we can screw Soron !""*Later* ""Hey Frodon !

I ended up watching the first episode as soon as I found it, despite some of the slightly low-rated reviews I read about it. Now, the thing that stood out the most about this series wasn\'t the story, the characters, or even the fight scenes. No, it was how fricking colorful this anime was. Seriously, despite the amount of anime I\'ve seen in the past, I have never seen such colorful hair on characters, like, ever. Without further ado, let\'s get...this review started, shall we?To start off, let\'s get into the story. Upon first glance, this anime is supposedly about a vampire and a human, who met each other years ago. She fell in love with him, and granted him a power which allowed him to have 7 lives every 15 minutes.  It sounded interesting, but then stuff happened and the main girl got kidnapped and trapped in another dimension for years and years, while the human boy\'s memory was erased. Later on, once he enters High School, he somehow gains his memory back after being hit by a semi truck and healing his scattered limbs. He remembers the vampire girl, and he finds her once again. Then more stuff happens, and the story just gets more confusing as it goes on. To be honest, I still don\'t know what the main plot of this was supposed to be. All I know is that it felt kind of similar to pretty much every romance/echii/action anime out there. To sum it up, the story will not completely hook you onto the show.As I said before, the thing that caught my eye when first watching this was all of the colors. People\'s hair were multicolored, the sky was a completely abnormal color (never seen a sky turn bright purple and pink before), it was like I walked into a double rainbow and it suddenly started raining skittles everywhere. It was very strange, but it was decent quality. Most animes these days usually have pretty good art styles, so I was content.Not much to say about the voice acting. They played their roles well, and that\'s pretty much it. Sound effects were good, I liked the Opening and Ending songs. That\'s about it for anything sound related...I think out of all the characters in the show, the one that got on my nerves the most was Haruka. For those of you who have seen this, you will either be all like, ""Oh yeah, I totally agree with you"" or, ""What?! What about Mirai! She was way more annoying!"". To be honest, I liked Mirai a lot. She had loli written all over her, and I liked her energy and enthusiasm. But the thing I didn\'t like about Haruka was the fact that she couldn\'t let something go, even if it killed her. Obviously the 2 main protagonists are into eachother, but since she\'s into the main guy, she tries to steal him from Himea every chance she gets, and it got annoying. What\'s worse is that her entire class supported her. Other then that, I liked the main protagonist, Taito, he was pretty cool when he wanted to be. Gekkou was kind of a jerk at times, but he brought some pretty good comedy in the last episode, plus he knows how to handle weapons pretty well. Himea was probably my second favorite character out of the entire cast. With her love and compassion towards Taito, you can\'t help but root for her whenever you can.Now, the main question, did I enjoy watching this? The answer: meh... to be honest, the only reason I continued watching this was because I wanted to just get it finished so I could move on to more anime. I can\'t not finish an anime once I\'m halfway through it, so overall, it was so-so. I wouldn\'t recommend this to everyone. I know everyone has mixed opinions about it and that we all can\'t agree on everything, but if you were to put this on your list, this might be kind of a last option once you get all the other important anime out of your way. this review started, shall we?To start off, let\'s get into the story.

Though the main goal, or ""quest"" of the main character is uncertain as of yet, it is apparent that the story will unfold and blossom as the series goes on.Story:As said before, the story looks a bit mysterious and yet intriguing at the same time, since the series is only on it\'s second episode, it\'s hard to say where the direction is headed, however, I will say this, the story if very suspenseful and makes the viewer want to watch another episode to see what will happen next. The story...is relatively simple, but is executed in a way that is easy to understand by illustrating details from the past, and how they affect the present situation. Hopefully the story will blossom into a wonderful flower of entertainment.Characters:The characters seem relatively simple on the surface, but behind the friendly and welcoming exterior of the characters, is a mysterious past that can only be found out by continuing to watch the anime. I have high hopes for how the characters will be unraveled, and hope to learn what secrets they keep.Art:The art for this series is pretty good, I\'m not one for hair colors that are out of the ordinary like pink or sky blue, but for some reason, it tends to work in this series. The characters are well drawn, and the detailing on certain aspects of this anime are really well drawn, the art draws me in and intrigued me quite a bit.Overall, this anime is still in it\'s early stages, but i have a feeling that it will have a satisfying storyline as it progresses. It has a lot of the things i could ask for in an anime, dynamic characters with a mysterious past, well drawn detailing, a nice setting, the action of using magical spells for combat, and a storyline waiting to be unraveled by the viewer. I can\'t wait to see how this will unfold, and i recommend that you check out this anime, it certainly is  interesting for 2 episodes so far. is relatively simple, but is executed in a way that is easy to understand by illustrating details from the past, and how they affect the present situation.

The first 8 chapters, which I could find at the time, were very intriguing for me and when I heard that this will be an anime, I was very excited. I wasn\'t disappointed.Story:As far as the story goes, I think it is as well as it could be put with a 12 episode anime. The idea in itself is very interesting and for all you vampire/zombie fans out there, this is a pretty good choice. However, I think the highlight of this series was not the story but...rather the art.Art:The art was one of the higest quality I\'ve ever seen. The only reason I\'d give it a 9/10 is because I didn\'t like how the tips of characters with long hair had different color, which I think was an original touch but did not appeal to my taste. Other than that, the art was fantastic. The color, the effect, etc. it all was appealing to me.Sound:The sound was pretty good as well. The opening and ending, wasn\'t the best but wasn\'t the worst as well. That aside, the background music fit each scene though they were using almost the same track for most of the time.Character:The character is surprisingly cliched yet a bit different. We have our normal main character who is popular to his girls, and has a bit of perversion. Then we have the main heroine, who is actually not what most heroines would be. She is cutesy around the main character (the guy she likes) and is cold towards others, which I think was a nice touch. Next we have our usual childhood friend of the main character, who serves the purpose of jealousy as well as some role at the end. We also have the sub main character, who is arrogant and calls himself a ""genius"" and is of course, popular to all girls in his school. Then we have his partner, a loli, who happens to get quite a lot of panty shots from the very first episodes and does all the normal childish stuff.Overall:Overall I definitely think this anime is worth a try, mainly if you want a romance anime rather than an action-focused anime. The art is great, the story is fine, and it\'s all good! rather the art.Art:The art was one of the higest quality I\'ve ever seen.

The art is great, the story is fine, and it\'s all good!', ""The first two episode can get you hooked but then later on you might realized that this is just like almost any other story. Guy meets supernatural girl.. his life takes  a drastic change. Although in this story he has already met her  in the past except that his memory got alter and later remember.The story is decent, not to bad, but also not to good. Well considering it is a 12 episode anime, they did a fair job of introducing the story and the characters. Where in episode 12 everyone already can get the sense of the producing trying to embed...the intention of there being a second episode since nothing is really solve. I guess it get the viewers to look forward to the work.The artwork is pretty amazing. I like the way each and every character is displayed consider the personalities and attitude where could be referred to or closely related to other character is other anime.(at least it reminded me of them) What I don't like to much is how the white spot moving around in Saitohimea's hair, they may represent stars and letting people subconsciously know that she isn't human and all but at points it gets distracting. One distinctive feature about the art is the tips of each character's hair is a different color or a darker shading.Sounding wise is pretty decent, the opening and ending are not the best to suit the anime but not to the point where it doesn't fit at all. Also they used almost the same track for the whole thing.The characters are pretty much stock character where you have the general stupid main protagonist who later thinks for himself and wow the audience, then the self-loathing, genius friend with his loli girl. The main heroine who is rather very affectionate to the male protagonist which i find difference but rather enjoyable to watch and of course the jealous childhood friend who later takes on the rather evil side of the story but finds light in the darkness.Overall it a pretty good anime. The artwork is once again great. Story can get your irritated at time but this is an introduction to the anime, the main stuff comes in season 2 if there is one. And if your a fan of zombie, vampire and supernatural genres then this is a suggestion for you.I'll end it off with a question: It still makes me wonder what does a rabbit has to do with this story, although they mentioned it in the last episode, and a displayed a hidden rabbit a few time. i don't get it.Ciao for now~ the intention of there being a second episode since nothing is really solve. I guess it get the viewers to look forward to the work.The artwork is pretty amazing. I like the way each and every character is displayed consider the personalities and attitude where could be referred to or closely related to other character is other anime.(at least it reminded me of them) What I don't like to much is how the white spot moving around in Saitohimea's hair, they may represent stars and letting people subconsciously know that she isn't human and all but at points it gets distracting. One distinctive feature about the art is the tips of each character's hair is a different color or a darker shading.Sounding wise is pretty decent, the opening and ending are not the best to suit the anime but not to the point where it doesn't fit at all. Also they used almost the same track for the whole thing.The characters are pretty much stock character where you have the general stupid main protagonist who later thinks for himself and wow the audience, then the self-loathing, genius friend with his loli girl.

I can't honestly say this series is all that great, its not terrible but its not good either. The characters are alright, the story is non existent, I mean what the f**k is going on? The sounds and art are kinda overdone and you can see its pretty much the same as other shounen type shows. Nothing special about...the special effects, you'd have to download episodes to even remotely consider it eye candy, you stream it and its utter crap.The reality is its generic and nothing good can be seen, nothing in my board made it past a 6.I feel it needed more, but I felt no need to continue on and thus dropped it off my list.If you're into the genre of the undead give this a watch, you might like it more than me. the special effects, you'd have to download episodes to even remotely consider it eye candy, you stream it and its utter crap.The reality is its generic and nothing good can be seen, nothing in my board made it past a 6.I feel it needed more, but I felt no need to continue on and thus dropped it off my list.If you're into the genre of the undead give this a watch, you might like it more than me."", ""So far, the story has yet to unfold; this is the most interesting element and luckily, the most importiant.I personally am interested and will stick this series out for the above reason, dispite many cliche factors being quite off-putting, such as...The characters:- Nice, carefree male who shows great potential from the start, dispite being new on the scene; a clear 'saviour'- A leading female turning moe, even though that didn't seem her personality type at the start- An obnoxiously dopey, 'cute' (depending on your taste), follower type girl- A moody, arrogant bishounen people will lable 'cool'- Plenty of enthesis on the girls being adorable...The Action:- Buckets of blood for the sake of it as the leading male can't die*- Males get the 'epic' eventful fights so far whilst females get flashy light shows and cute magic girl transformations- Unhinged, ultra powerful, creative looking villian appears- Main females stand vaccant watching who stood watching the males 'epic fight', yet jumps in when a female becomes 'her man's' next opponent (cliche)Such above elements turn off anime veteran's like me (some of us), as we've seen it all before.Still, because the story is moving at a steady rate, it's fine so far, definatley not as bad as other 'powerful teen hero' anime's out there.

I chose this anime for my first review simply because I can\'t find any anime right now that I have a clearer view on. I\'m no gonna hate on this things, but I\'m not gonna lie for it. When it comes down to it I have only two words for Itsuka Tenma ""What? and Why?""Story 3/10This is my biggest problem with Itsuka Tenma and what set me off. I came into this anime with high hopes, not so high that mediocrity would destroy my views but some expectations and I really tried to...like it but...yeah.The story is rushed and has little to no depth at all. The main character is thrown into a world of magic and demons...how is this going on? He acquires magic power from a vampire...ok seems alright, his school is connected to a demon world that was not explained whatsoever...hmph and now its happy, happy relationship time while all of this is going down...LOGIC!, he and his classmate fight demons with magic he obtained from a book and a sword from...who knows where?and enemies that they fight because, well because their just there and I could go on with the rest but well you get what i\'m saying.Some people say its about them building their relationship and overcoming odds. Well if was about that I\'m pretty sure they would put some logical frosting on this plot cake they call a relationship build, but no you put shounen strawberries and ecchi chocolate and you get this disaster.Art 7/10The art was pretty standard. I like the effect they put on Himea\'s hair but aside from that it was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.Sound 6/10The sound was basic, everything fit in to the background and the mood but nothing really stood out.Characters 4/10The characters were nothing special, none of them had any personality that stood out or we haven\'t seen before.Taito - the common shounen male main character ""I have to become stronger to protect blah blah blah"" you know the drift.Himea - the love sick puppy who needs her main character to save her even though he\'s hopeless.Gekkou - the douche who thinks he\'s better than everyone and he really ups the douche factor to 10.Mirai - the ecchi bait, who\'s just their to be stupid and act cuteThe other characters aren\'t really worth mentioning because they just aren\'t.Enjoyment 4/10Honestly I tried to look past the bland characters and lack of story, but the human mind can only take so much. Some people might enjoy it if they can look past its weak points, but I couldn\'t so I just quit it was slightly enjoyable but not enough make you want to come back.Overall 4/10The lack of story, generic characters and normal everything else makes Itsuka Tenma a ball of wasted potential.

It has bits of romance/drama/school-life mixed in with an intriguing supernatural storyline. I really thought I had hit a diamond-in-the-rough under appreciated anime.But, if you're like me, when episode 11 hits you start to feel like they just quit. The last 2 episodes were not very cohesive with the first 10, and for me it was blatantly distracting so that I couldn't take them seriously.This anime is worth a watch, and it's pretty original in its own ways (seriously, it was pretty unique). However,...I can see how it's score is justified after completing the last episode.If you have nothing else to watch, this could very well entertain you though. The last episode is set up like a bridge between a 1st and 2nd season, and if they ever actually made a 2nd season I would probably watch it.Hope this helps a little.*Update* Wow, I didn't realize how many trolls were on MAL. Hopefully they are watching the series a little before marking this Not Helpful entirely..

Everything here is merely my opinion so you may not agree with it. ENJOY!Brief Review: A quick summary for those that don\'t wish to spend too much time reading other people\'s opinions.Story 2/10: A shallow series of events that force our protagonists onwards. Uninteresting at best...Art 9/10: I loved the art. Not much to say here. Good art is good.Sound 7/10: The OP and ED were meh-decent. The seiyuu did a nice job for all but one character... Saito Himea sounds very ...Character 2/10:...Absolutely HORRIBLE. There is barely any character development for 10 episodes. You are expected to simply accept the character relationships as they come.Enjoyment 5/10: I watched all 12 episodes in one sitting. I had nothing better to do. It kept me entertained for a couple of hours. I could have done other things to waste my time.Overall 5/10: I\'d recommend you watch this if you have time to waste. You may find shaving a puppy to be more worth your time.Not-So-Brief Review: Just like the above with more words. Seriously... a lot more words... SOME SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN\'T WATCHED EPISODE 1 :3Imagine that you are on your way home after watching Shrek 8. When you arrive, a relative asks you what it was about. You proceed to tell him what it was about. ""This happened, that happened, he said, she said, the end"". That is what this anime is like.Lets take a quick look at ""Le genre tag,"" shall we.First we have comedy, check. Lots of second-hand jokes that will make you smile if its your first time. A chunk of slapstick here and there and bam.Next we have ecchi, check.Shounen, check.Vampire & supernatural, check & check.Finally, Romance... half-check. I am not sure about this... The female lead loves the male lead. How do we know? Cause we are told on episode 1. Chickita 1 loves muchacho 1. We must accept it. Some serious romance dude... It\'s like an illness you never knew you had. Doctor says ""You are ill,"" you reply with ""Ok!"" You are not given the chance to ask what this illness is, where you may have gotten it, how long it might have been there...IT. JUST. IS.""But Stoooorm!! Stop exaggerating!"" Oook! We aren\'t just told the two leads are in love, we are also given a 1 minute slideshow of about 18 scenes of two children and two short 3 minute scenes. OH! and all of that was in the distant past that our protagonist had forgotten but suddenly remembers! WHOA! They totally deserve to be together. It\'s the next romeo and juliet i tell ya!But enough about that... lets take a look at the characters.Lets start with the fact that the two females in-love with our male protagonist both have a multiple personality disorder. One of them loses it... She can also cook and will apparently make a good wife in the future. Oh she\'s a normal human that is pretty much loved by all EXCEPT by the male protagonist that she loves. Lets call her ForeverAloneGirl.The other female is the vampire. She\'s lived for 20,000 years. Has multiple personality disorder that endangers THE WHOLE WORLD. Acts like a sticky glop of mucus that cant stop saying ""I LUV U.""Oh, she also threatens to kill anyone who hurts the male protagonist. She is the one who injects our main hero with fancy juice that makes him fancy and she does it for a selfish reason... OH, and im just guessing here... but i think she\'s supposed to be all moe moe... She can\'t cook or do anything a normal wife is expected to do in the anime world... but atleast she can kill stuff! Lets call her Trololololol.Now we have the male lead. Our muchacho of le hour. Our head huncho. He\'s our village cliche. Guy wants to protect everyone, no problem with that. Guy starts out weak and tries to get stronger, no problem with that. Guy remembers he loves some small girl from 9 years ago and that she\'s waiting for him so he runs back to her and is all lovey dovey with her cause we are told that this is how it must go so that the makeshift story can somehow work, BIG PROBLEM THERE. Lets call him... troll bait.Now we look at our other male protagonist who does not deserve any attention at all... He is our badass, strong, jerk off that thinks he\'s everything but when it really counts he\'s just some weak little egotistical wannabe. Lets call him... Alice.Finally, we have our loli. Obnoxious little loli. Victim of 3/4th the animes ecchi. Honestly, i think she\'s just there for her underwear... OH! she can zap stuff while shouting ""Biri Biri"" which gets on my nerve... i have a reason for disliking it... nuff said. Lets call her shaved pears.There is a constant stream of random people popping up and getting in the way for almost no reason. Characters F, G, H, I, J & K are just tossed into the mix because we need to focus on someone to cover up the fact that there is no story.Now then... how do these characters develop? well, for 83.33% of the anime they don\'t develop. They remain as they are. Then things change and they become stronger/less annoying/interesting/whatever, but the anime ends before we can even begin to appreciate these changes.TO THE ART!!!The art was lovely. Characters were nicely drawn. Their movements were fairly smooth and didn\'t seem choppy. Backgrounds where detailed. The colors where vibrant. The lighting often complimented the atmosphere and the mood. I would have gladly given this a perfect score if more effort was put into the effects. The same effects are used over and over and over.Then we has Le Sound. As i stated previously... the Seiyuu did a good job with all but one character and i don\'t really think it\'s the Seiyuu\'s fault. This is another potential perfect score if it wasnt for that meddling vampire girl... The opening and ending were nice and they seemed to fit nicely with the anime and the art. But that annoying vampire girl... GAH! i feel bad for the seiyuu, she has tainted her Curriculum vitae.To end this big wall of text... This anime would be something i suggest you add to the very bottom of your to-watch list. It should be the anime you watch when you have absolutely NOTHING better to watch. When you have absolutely NOTHING better to do. Possibly if you are feeling suicidal, watch this for encouragement (not for staying alive though).Final score 5/10I hope you found my review useful or at the very least enjoyed it. Absolutely HORRIBLE. There is barely any character development for 10 episodes.

I honestly tried giving this anime a chance, as I am a fan of shoujou romance with fantasy aspects, which this anime claims to be.Story 2/10:As the show first opens, we are shown the main protagonist, Taito. He has immortality due to his childhood friend-who-is-also-a-vampire. That\'s pretty much the basis of it and doesn\'t go much further than that. The show has no whole plot. There I said it. Throughout the entire...show I honestly had no idea of: what the heck was going on, who the enemy was, or if the main characters were actually going to get together officially or not. The show tries to pick up many different genres like romance, fantasy, action, harem, supernatural, and high school and it is poorly executed. It started off strong with the idea of giving this boy powers that were not as common (only have seven lives until perma-death), and the fact that a vampire girl with some strange pink-blue gradient hair was giving it to him (I feel that the fact that she was a vampire was long forgotten by the second episode). There\'s no main plot, but rather small mini stories throughout, that don\'t make a coherent story.Art 7/10:The art in Itsuka Tenma is probably the only decent redeeming quality of the show. It\'s very atmospheric and can clearly portray the supernatural and mystical settings. It uses bold colors for common items, like changing the night sky and moon to bright pinks and purples, or even making the trees red and black. The female characters all had a unique gradient hair style which I found rather appealing. The male character designs are rather common, with features like extremely spiky hair and school uniforms.Sound 5/10:Not much to really say here. The voice actors are fine as is the music. Nothing really irked me overall.Character 1/10:Welcome to where the show really falls flat. I don\'t really want to go into much detail, because if I do that I\'ll end up talking about it forever. There is not much more to the characters that can be described in a sentence, ""He wants to be strong to protect the girl he loves."", ""She\'s lonely, but she has him and he will help her."", ""He hates his brother and wants to defeat him."", and ""She likes soda and to have fun"". Any other character is there purely to fill up the roster. The romance scenes are no more than the protagonists saying each other\'s names over and over and over again.Overall 3/10 show I honestly had no idea of: what the heck was going on, who the enemy was, or if the main characters were actually going to get together officially or not.

This is my first review, so I will try my best to constrain my spoiling. I will be writing about the anime Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi (A Dark Rabbit has Seven Lives), an I think it is very well done except for a few minor tweaks. First of all, I really liked the romance in it, so if you're like me and love drama, I highly recommend it. If not, there is still a lot of action. All characters have backstories, but this is a good and bad thing. Some characters have backstories that may be confusing or unimportant. But overall, the...anime has a little of each genre, and I recommend it to all you otakus! My next review will probably be on Dragon Crisis, so if you are interested in watching it, stay tuned! anime has a little of each genre, and I recommend it to all you otakus! My next review will probably be on Dragon Crisis, so if you are interested in watching it, stay tuned!"", 'i liked the series, a  light hearted comedy with super natural  characters i really felt for Mirai , she just wants to be alone with the guy she loves. and if i m honest i cant wait for a sequel as i hated the cliffhanger i saw them go somewhere then :O ed at the thank you for watching to be continued. >. ', 'I\'m a big fan of shows that stick to their guns. Shows that clearly know what they are and what they want to be. That tells me that the writers had a theme or plan in mind and put care into their work to make that plan happen. If the characters, theme, mood, setting and music all compliment each other, as far as I\'m concerned not much else really matters.Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi seems to struggle with the above. It\'s difficult to make out what this anime wants to be. ""Comedy"" is the first genre listed, but the anime\'s attempts at comedy are out...of place in the darkish setting. As far as romance, there\'s a lot of it, but it\'s kind of monotonous. Scenes and characters seem to pop up out of nowhere with little explanation. There isn\'t much consistency throughout the series, other than everything being really pretty. ""Shiny darkness"" probably best describes it.There\'s not much of any character development at all, despite the definite potential. Most of the relationships were formed before the series starts. Characters just seem to appear and there\'s very little background to them. This makes it difficult to feel any attachment to the characters.The comedy is awkward and sometimes feels thrown in. I didn\'t really feel comfortable laughing at anything. There\'s an entire episode that comes out of nowhere that\'s dedicated to the comedic aspect of the show, when the episodes around it show no indication of comedy. This and a few other episodes seem to break the continuity of the show.As for the romance aspect, it\'s pretty cut and dried. As the story has little character development, the romantic development never gets very far either. The main characters are ""madly in love"" to start the series. Not much changes with that. It finishes on the same gear it starts on.The story is pretty intriguing, even if it\'s been done before. There are a few plot twists that might not be predictable.I did feel like the music and art compliment each other pretty well. There is a certain ""shiny darkness"" to the art that sets the mood. The music mostly consists of string orchestra that captures this shiny darkness.Overall, Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi has a decent story but doesn\'t have much coherence. The aesthetics on their own are nice to look at, but they\'re wasted on characters that don\'t match the depth of the art. And the most important factor: Was it enjoyable? I felt like watching it was a chore, and that\'s never a good thing. of place in the darkish setting. As far as romance, there\'s a lot of it, but it\'s kind of monotonous.

As the story has little character development, the romantic development never gets very far either. The main characters are ""madly in love"" to start the series. Not much changes with that. It finishes on the same gear it starts on.The story is pretty intriguing, even if it\'s been done before. There are a few plot twists that might not be predictable.I did feel like the music and art compliment each other pretty well. There is a certain ""shiny darkness"" to the art that sets the mood. The music mostly consists of string orchestra that captures this shiny darkness.Overall, Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi has a decent story but doesn\'t have much coherence. The aesthetics on their own are nice to look at, but they\'re wasted on characters that don\'t match the depth of the art. And the most important factor: Was it enjoyable? I felt like watching it was a chore, and that\'s never a good thing.', ""This anime was probably the best anime I have ever watched, and I've watched more animated series and movies than any one that i know.  I can't help get myself lost in this series.  So much that I intended to leave my homework on the side lines even as a high level college student.  Personally anyone who considers otherwide is very odd indeed.  Or maybe the story line is far too complicated for them.  It was a great watch and I enjoyed the music even more.  I was highly upset at the spot in which it ended, I figured...with the climax raging and Liliath Ramiel finally being revealed they would reproduce  a second season.  I believe where it stopped is the only heart break.  Great love triangle story with a lot of respect and a lot of comedy.  I still cannot understand why people find the naked body such a perverted thing.  Better yet, since they arent really human why do you care if there drawn figures are exposed.  I'm sure no one is getting that much pleasure from a fwew clips, when really they are linked to the personality of the characters and become attached.  Some people will never appreciate the hard work that goes into a series liekt his.  With the plot winding and twisting every time you feel yuo understand the story, the only thing you can cling to is the love between Taito and Hiema, and it makes you pick sides throughout the story.  Interestingly enough the sides you pick seem to follow the way you want the story line to go.  Great for student in Highschool or beginning college-level students. Well done. with the climax raging and Liliath Ramiel finally being revealed they would reproduce  a second season.  I believe where it stopped is the only heart break.

Also a guy who wanted to become strong so that he can protect this girl. Their love is very beautiful unlike the ""love"" I see nowadays with the kids of this generation. Overall, not bad of an anime, it did ended without any news about a next season. But, if you really want a new season, stop complaining and support the makers, I\'m sick of people complaining about not having a new season when all...they do is watch the anime for free, not buying anything to support and just sit there complaining. they do is watch the anime for free, not buying anything to support and just sit there complaining.', 'so, that\'s my first review, i had to write one about this anime just because i feel a bit cheated.Story:Started well , but after few eps, the anime turned into two main lines1. ""i want more power ..bla bla bla""2. ""Saito"".... ""Himea""...Up, the all anime is about those two lines above. sooo if you are searching for an anime with good story...DON\'T WATCH THIS ONE!Art:The anime itself was drawn pretty good, but for me the colors were too ""Vivid"", and i don\'t know what the director has with the ""Purple"" color...i guess so kind of fetish....Sound:It\'s a harem, R+ - Mild Nudity, yet the music and background sounds gave me the feeling i\'m watching a PG-8 anime (-_-)Character:Only because there is a nice variety, but zero character development.Enjoyment + Overall:Sooo why i feeling cheated?

It may seem weird at first, I never saw one like this before... I liked it... Moreover, I can\'t understand why Itsuka Tenma got such bad overall ratings... It was one of those animes that kept me really hooked on each episode... Now I\'m anxious for a possible second season, knowing that it is still ongoing!It\'s all about Taito and Himea, basically... Both met each other a long time ago and Taito was the one that ended Himea\'s loneliness and suffering. A contract is made, followed by...the promise of eternal love, suddenly broken after those two got torn apart... An organization named ""Church"" was responsible for sealing the powerful vampire/witch and erase everything Taito knew about her. But a single memory from his past was enough to break the spell that kept Himea imprisoned and, once together again after so long, things would never be the same again...Protect a potencial menace to Earth, stop a terrible profecy and, still, share his love between two childhood friends... That\'s what Taito\'s life became after reuniting with Himea. Focus is separated on both battles and the romance itself, as fights against Church\'s and Magic Military Forces\' occur, at the same time that the relationship between Taito and Himea is shown. Pretty good share of comedy and also basic fanservice included, fun is assured on this one!Overall art is impressive! Cool hairstyles for male protagonists and a gorgeous color gradient style on main female characters\' hairs. Himea\'s one also had those nice light reflection effects, beautiful... There are a few different ED themes, however the best was the main one, great song!Himea had lost her faith on humankind, since many wanted her incredible powers, and a powerful spell was already prepared to destroy Earth completely. Taito\'s affection prevented that from happening and also made her believe there are good people out there... This world is full of disgusting humans...

They try to glue it together with generic ""lol so funny"" or ""oh so srs for reelz"" characters. It just falls flat. You got your opener 2 part episode that seems o be going somewhere, then its over and we are handed another 2 parter where the lead female (himea) needs...to confront the imaginary friends she made in her time confined in that cube thing from the previous 2 parter. the rest just goes down hill fast from an already luke warm start.... so I just gave it the wash and at the end a 1 was all it deserved. Unlikely to get a sequel.All suspense is taken from our male leads (taito.... or taito taito taito ad nauseam from our wimpering female lead) ability to regenerate 5-6 times every 15 minutes..... I cannot even rightly recall because it is so inconsequential.... because he just dies like 5 times in 10 seconds then ~contrivance~ he makes it to the next regen interval. Rinse repeat.Our main female (himea or HIMEEEAGHHH as you will soon dread the male lead yelling her name SHUT UP kay thanks), is apparently super powerful or god damned pathetically weak and useless depending on how you look at it. She apparently has almost no power left, but is ""supposedly"" still super capable, but is always the damsel or sitting in the corner doing squat.The rest are a slapdash mess of: ""comedy"" (if you want to label what she does comedy) nekomimi type who flashes her panties in every scene, a ""im serious and powerful oh wait i just got a pole up my ass"" jerk male character, a ""childhood friend"" (every school romance needs one?) who is there for one thing and that\'s it, spoiling it would spoil one of the later arcs and the entire use of the character, tomboy with candy in mouth female.... and others that are jut as useless and inconsequential.the art is fine, all the female characters have a sort of two tone hair scheme going on, one color up top, another near the tips... and himea has this glowey orb stuff that is never questioned ""because anime"".... I actually do not like this style of character design... maybe im too old. You know the bobble head females (big head but mall everything else) but sensibly proportioned males? Anyways it is passable and fluid at most times.sound is fine, again there is nothing to really take home here.this is the first anime in a while that i felt was a total waste of my time (that i finished) to confront the imaginary friends she made in her time confined in that cube thing from the previous 2 parter. the rest just goes down hill fast from an already luke warm start.... so I just gave it the wash and at the end a 1 was all it deserved.

This show suffers from one of the worst thing a show can suffer from. That is loss of potential.I'm hesitant to use the word worst. But this is definitely one of the weirdest structured shows. In the very first episode we are getting all these emotional scenes that just don't work. Because we don't know these characters at all so it's hard to feel sympathy them. I felt bad for the female who was stuck in a torture type of jail secluded from any interaction with anyone else waiting...9 years for her only friend to come save her. Tell episode 5 we get stuff you would expect after tons of build up and already set world. But then we get episode 6 and then we get something i would expect from early on episodes. Not to long later we get more serious crap happening. With a not so great ending.The characters are very iffy. The main male lead is a very bland and very cliche Japanese school boy in anime. But it's worse cause this dude is an idiot and if not even nice to his childhood friend who has a crush on him. He is constantly being dumb and making things more hard. The main female lead is actually interesting. She is a vampire that is meant to be such a strong person that she is feared by just about anyone besides maybe the gods in the world. Yet she rarely ever uses her power and always ends up looking like the typical school girl in need of help. It honestly got to the point i was very frustrated. The only reason she likes the main male lead is because she was lonely as a kid and he was the only one to do notice her. That's it not because of his personality or anything just because she had no one else to be loved by. That is one of the saddest things i'v seen in a anime and it's not intentional at all. As soon as she is free of the prison she clings to him for fear of being alone again.Animation is in all honesty really beautiful. Same goes along with character designs. They were nailed really well. Especially when i look at the gods of the world. Those designs feel original and creepy enough for how they should be.There are a couple things i would like to write but i'll stop here so this doesn't turn into a big review.But there is one thing i would like to mention. The OVA for this is worth mentioning. Sense most people tend to treat the OVA as a 13th episode i'm gonna give a review here. But that is honestly a funny OVA. I was not expecting it and i wish the rest of the show was like that. It is up there with my favorite OVA's. 9 years for her only friend to come save her.

This anime wasn\'t the best I\'ve ever seen and I\'ve seen plenty of animes to know that. I stumbled across this one on some site and thought, ""hey. looks like good art so why not?"" I loved the personalities of the characters, I loved the art, and the music was fair. I really thought this anime had potential, but it didn\'t go where I was expecting it to go. It could have been a much longer anime with so much more developed plot and neat ideas, but it was so deeply condensed that the timeline of the anime was all over and you really...had no clue what happened in between and why what was going on... was going on. It was really confusing, but at the same time, you wanted to see where it was headed. It started off well, but ended badly.

Honestly, not much happened considering how many events transpired. What I find astonishing is that they setup tons of plot points that they let drop throughout the series and then chose to make the last episode a trashy ""bathhouse"" episode that literally did nothing to wrap up the plot whatsoever. Please enjoy this fan-service so we get renewed because our terrible plot certainly isn\'t going to do it.The characters range from likable and determined to annoying and frustrating. One thing I really liked is MC is basically a weakling with a...huge heart. He keeps trying to fight enemies and get stuff done but then gets wrecked and barely survives. One thing I really HATED was that they took what was a bit of a tragic love story and then turned it into a trashy harem thing in the last episode. This approach was done 100x better in Shakugan no Shana. EVERYTHING was done 100x better in that anime. In fact, instead of watching this just go (re)watch Shakugan no Shana, it is a far better anime that has a similar vibe.The story could likely go somewhere awesome but they dropped so many plot points it would take a lot of work and they clearly aren\'t getting renewed. I didn\'t think it was awful but I can\'t really recommend watching it.Story 4 / Art 8 / Sound 6 / Character 7 / Enjoyment 5 / Overall 5 huge heart.

I just wish that Taito could've been more resolute in his love of Saitohimea. Like, bruh, you love her. Kiss her more often. Why be afraid of that?Story:I feel that the story was definitely growing, and had some great potential. I loved the few hidden hints of Taito having some sort of dark rabbit in him and I really wish there could've been a second season. I just hate that Saitohimea had to be...the one to kiss Taito several times. Like bruh, that's not how it works. The guy should be kissing her equally or more. I dont know... But I loved how the gaps in the story were filled.Final thoughts:This show was a little etchy... showing teenage girls in the swimsuits and it kept zooming in on their panties >.< little weird, but otherwise a pretty good show. I would kinda recommend it if you don't mind the slight dirty stuff. Otherwise, it was nice! the one to kiss Taito several times. Like bruh, that's not how it works.

Turns out this anime is here to educate us how even rabbits have this trait. But you know what? You don’t need to waste 7 hours of your life (much less 7 lives) on a show that was made to be a throw away from the get go. From the retarded premise, to the generic plot, the stereotypical characters, the tired ecchi jokes, and the idiotic battles before everything ends openly without even bothering to explain half of what the devil is going on in here, this anime was almost made to be hated.Here you are...watching the first episode and within the first 5 minutes you already lose track of how many porn fetishes they have crammed in this thing in an attempt to lure the average horny viewer out there. We get vampires and catgirls who need kissing and flash their underwear, people losing their head without dying, romantic premises, and lots of high school kids doing all sorts of stupid things in a poor attempt to make us laugh. Just how much does someone need to switch off his brain in order to be able to watch this show without facepalming?The premise is basically the same as that of a recent other anime called “Kore wa Zombie Desuka”, and both of which are equally braindead shows full of nonsense. The protagonist is killed and is turned to an immortal zombie by some vampire chick, and afterwards does a lot of silly adventures with other supernatural people and bimbo chicks. The lure of the show is obviously sex and violence and unfortunately it fails in both as it lacks both in the longrun. There is a lot of gruesome violence in it but since the hero is immortal there is no way he can lose and the whole thing plays out just for fun. For the same reason there is no excitement since HE CAN’T LOSE and constantly gets sudden power ups just because he is the protagonist. Not even the fan service is that much since most of it is underwear and nude thrown all over the place, most of the time in an unnecessary in-story manner. Meta-series of course, it is there just to keep the average 12 year old virgin mesmerized with 2D softporn so he won’t care about anything else.And speaking of anything else, there literally is very little besides fan service and goofy jokes.- The story is barely going anywhere and to the most part is just aimless goofing around hapless boys and sexualized girls doing overused ecchi comedy stuff. When it attempts to have a plot, it plays out as simplistic as possible before ending in the middle of nowhere at the finale. So basically you get just a poor excuse of a story and then random nonsense.- The directing is a mess. You just get people talking while unfit BGM playing, plus lots of scenes have no proper transition.- The characters are all stereotypes which hardly manage to evolve past their initial image and are simply too dumb to make you care about them. They are all very simplistically drawn to the point you define them just by haircolor and boob size. It’s like they all popped out of a generic fantasy porn game and thus you are unable to sympathize with whatever issues they may have.- The artwork is basic and the animation suffers severely, making everything to look static and jerky. Extremely poor production for the year it came out.- There are lots of visual effects during action scenes but most are made through cheap filters. Combined with the jerky motions and lack of actual strategy all battles feel lazy and unexciting.- The soundtrack is completely generic pop stuff you will forget right away and voice acting can’t shine because of the lack of context in the dialogues.In all, you can easily find far better anime with vampires, superpowers, ecchi, and whatever the heck this show tried to throw in, in a more than a lazy way to excite your interest. In fact, here are a few suggestions: 3X3, Fate/Stay Night, Busou Renkin, Shingetsutan Tsukihime, Shakugan no Shana, Bleach, Birdy the Mighty. None of these is masterpiece level but they are definitely more enjoyable.Bottom line: It is a completely throw away show with nothing to offer to any viewer with minimal demands. watching the first episode and within the first 5 minutes you already lose track of how many porn fetishes they have crammed in this thing in an attempt to lure the average horny viewer out there.

The protagonist is killed and turns into an immortal zombie by some vampire chick, followed by silly adventures with other supernatural people and bimbo chicks. The lure of the show is sex and violence, but fails at both. There is a lot of gruesome violence but since the hero is immortal there is no way he can lose and the whole thing plays out just for kicks. For the same reason there is no excitement since HE CAN’T LOSE and constantly gets sudden power ups just because he is the protagonist.

When it attempts to have a plot, it plays out as simplistic as possible before ending in the middle of nowhere at the finale. So basically you get just a poor excuse of a story and then random nonsense.- The directing is a mess. You just get people talking while unfit BGM is playing, plus lots of scenes have no proper transition.- The characters are all stereotypes which hardly manage to evolve past their initial image and are simply too dumb to make you care about them. They are all very simplistically drawn to the point you define them just by haircolor and boob size. It’s like they all popped out of a generic fantasy porn game and thus you are unable to sympathize with whatever issues they may have.- The artwork is basic and the animation suffers severely, making everything to look static and jerky. Extremely poor production for the year it came out.- There are lots of visual effects during action scenes but most are made through cheap filters. Combined with the jerky motions and lack of actual strategy all battles feel lazy and unexciting.- The soundtrack is completely generic pop stuff you will forget right away and voice acting can’t shine because of the retarded dialogues.In all, you can easily find far better anime with vampires, superpowers, ecchi, and whatever the heck this show tried to throw in, in a more than lazy way to excite you. are watching the first episode and within the first 5 minutes you already lose track of how many porn fetishes they have crammed in this thing in an attempt to lure the average horny viewer out there.

Mahou Shoujo Lalabel,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3878/Mahou_Shoujo_Lalabel,"[""Mahou Shoujo Lalabel had the building blocks for a good story about a girl discovering her humanity, but failed because of mishandling its initial setup, being overly repetitive in its episodic stories, and having no character development besides for Lalabel, and even hers was rather marginal.Story: In terms of overarching narrative the show is trying to tell the story of how Lalabel becomes/realizes she is just a normal girl. However, there is never anything Lalabel does in terms of personality or actions that makes the viewer think she is any different from a normal girl. While she might not know Japanese customs and doesn't think...of herself as human she still acts like a normal young girl from the get go. Because of this, the development Lalabel makes towards becoming nicer/better a person feels pointless because it doesn't match the level of 'realizing she's human' since any differences outside of magic are trivial. Furthermore, this development of becoming a better person often gets conflated with using magic less or not at all without sufficient reason that would explain why she can't just be more focused or careful with magic. Finally, I think the ending should definitely have been foreshadowed and that doing so would have actually helped to drive Lalabel's growth in a more realistic way that would have mitigated some of my complaints.On an episodic level, most of the episodes revolved around Biscus doing some trivial scams to get money to buy ramen (which he never seems to have problem buying even before his scams). The second most common story type was Lalabel using her magic for convenience and messing something up which she then needs to fix. The first got boring very quickly because I didn't find most of the scams to be very creative or funny and although the second provided some growth for Lalabel, sometimes (for me at least) the messaged veered to 'don't use magic because it's not your real ability' instead of 'use magic well' without enough justification, because to me it seems that since the ONLY significant difference Lalabel has ever shown between herself and humans is magic, it is actually her ability. This sometimes made the message seem a little forced instead of naturally developed.Characters: Beginning with the characters around Lalabel, I thought the core cast of two diverse friends and wise but imperfect grandparents provided a well rounded group for Lalabel's growth and these characters are what I meant when I said the show had the building blocks for a better story. Lalabel herself was interesting enough (although not sufficiently established as different than humans), and it is satisfying to see her become a nicer person over time. The rest of the characters never really change, with some even remaining rude after Lalabel helps them multiple times or others not changing when it seems something happens that would elicit change. I don't necessarily think there has to be character growth in an episodic series, but when the episode setups are so weak it is more frustrating. Briefly touching on the villains, Biscus as a main villain was boring and I didn't find his humorous moments funny outside of his incorrect speaking style and his partner was only interesting when he was transformed into an animal or working against Biscus. In episodic series I think it is very hard for just one villain to suffice for multiple episodes let alone ~50 unless they are particularly interesting or well written.Art: I thought the animation was solid and most of the main character designs were decent. However for some of the background or minor characters the faces looked a little too similar. I also thought the designs for the magic items and art for when magic was being used were pretty uninteresting.Sound: I personally didn't care for the opening, but thought the ending was catchy. In terms of OST my main complaint is that the music for sad parts was not varied enough meaning that for only minor inconveniences or misfortune there would sometimes be heavy dramatic music that didn't match what was happening.Enjoyment: My enjoyment for most of the early and middle parts of the series was rather low because of the very repetitive story beats and meager character development, although the core cast of characters interactions were still solid. Some of the later episodes were much more enjoyable, mostly when different story types were experimented with, such as putting Biscus into the role of a good guy, or pitting him against his assistant. Episode 45 with a girl from America in particular stood out above the rest for being hilarious and less repetitive. This show would have been more fun if it had put more effort into diversifying its episode arcs, had more widespread character development for more of the cast, and tightened the main narrative arc by making Lalabel seem more different than just a normal girl, by changing her actions at the beginning of the show and trying to drop more hints of the ending.Overall I wouldn't recommend this show unless you are an avid mahou shoujo fan and are interested in some earlier stories that do not involve transformations or an Earthling gaining magical powers. of herself as human she still acts like a normal young girl from the get go.

Mahoutsukai Sally,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3356/Mahoutsukai_Sally,"[""45 hours, 109 episodes, non stop. What a great journey it was!That's pretty tough piece to review, not only bacause of it's age, but as well it's the very first mahou shoujo anime out there. Mother to the whole genre. And it's full of it's flaws and downs.Story:6The story is very generic, from the beginning till the very end. Everything's about Sally, the witch girl out of space that end up on earth with people of the same age and mentality as her. After some time she decides to stay and pretend that she's human and make some friends with the other girls. Then...she began to discover all the good and bad parts of living as well that magic and fun are not the mmost important things. It's a kid story and mainly for kids up to age of 8 maybe 10. The storybuild and writing, however, is over the average even with today's standards and overall deserves some praising.Art:8Well, for 53 years old anime the art is pretty decent. The moves are smooth, background old-stylish with very static animations but looking amazing. The locations like castle, some of the outside world parks and nature is just amazing. First 18 episodes, however, are in black and white only, at least on version I watched, from ep.19 there's beautifully hand-colored world full of magic, beautiful character designs and most important - the quality is outstanding and during whole show there's not much animation flaws that I can talk about. Been enjoying it very, very much, what is a big suprise, as often I doscovered that art became THE most important thing in anime for me.Sound:5It's after all 53 years old anime. But starting from beginning, the opening song is amazing, I can actually sing it now from memory and it's just lovely and sweet as the whole prosuction. The voice acting is decent but quality of sound is the weakest part of the anime. Sometimes was pretty hard to understand dialogues and what was really common - the music was much too loud. Like a lot. But that's common as well in old productions and I'm already used to it, so after few wpisodes I just stopped caring about that and enjoyed production.Character:9That's on the other hand the strongest part of the anime, the character development is more than decent, reliable and writing of each of them is just  oldy stylish, what's mean - aythors put a lot of effort to create characters that we can identify with, especially for the kids.The main character will be amongst the lovliest characters I ever seen on the screen, sweet, smart and very funny girs, that teaches through the humour as well as gives some smart and quite useful advices. Similar thing will be going to her on-screen friends and as perfect follow-ups for the Sally and basically are responsible for this sweet climate of the whole production.Enjoyment:9Hell yeah, what a journey it was. Even I can't believe it yet how much fun and joy I had, the 25+ guy I need to add. Been laughing much more that average, smile was constantly visible all over my face and, actually, I got used to the characters and the story and by the end of the show I was quite sad it's going to an end. Great episode planning, that even if half of those were basically the same it doesn't kill the magic of it and I haven't feel bored for even a second of the screening. Of course, it's generic, but in the best meaning of this word. And bloody hell, it's kids story about the witch that learns the world is not only to show up but it's based on love, frienship and enjoyment. The hella of the anime for small children, isn't it?Overall:8Been fighting myself about the rating for a while but finally ended up with the higher one. The most important thing about this choice was, obviously, it's age and knowing few productions from the time it was exceptionally great and back in the days probably would deserve the max score. Of course, it's failing the test of time after all and only the biggest maniacs will even consider spending their time with this title, but nothing will change the thing - this world will completely take you and will remind u how was the childhood nice and innocent. That's the biggest compilment I can give to anime like that.And bloody hell, it's the mother of the whole mahou shoujo genre, the first one on screen, now I can even see how much impact it had on some of my favourite mahou shoujo animes that I didn't see before or even been thinking that it was something new for the title. But not anymore.Obviously it's the thing that started it all and only for that it deserves to be remembered and praised. Especially it's available online to watch.Having less than 600 people that rated it it's just a disgrace for mal environment. Come on guys, go for it, it's the piece of real history, soon no one will remember it and mediocre articles like'First Anime Series of Every Genre (Well, 10 of Them Anyway)' will be only reminding of those titles.What an amazing journey was that, really. Nothing to regret, even I'm tired as hell after watching it all at once. she began to discover all the good and bad parts of living as well that magic and fun are not the mmost important things.

Nothing to regret, even I'm tired as hell after watching it all at once."", ""First of all Mahoutsukai Sally was the first anime directed to the Shoujo demographic. And when it comes to shoujo demographic in the 60s the manga scene there was already some kind of identity to the shoujo character design. You can see reminiscence of that design in the designs of the characters of this series.The story of the series is simple at its core Sally coming to earth to live with the humans, however I don't think the series is necessarily about the overarching story. The story is moreso used as a vehicle to create the premise that enables setting up the characters. I'd...say the important part of the story is the premise in which we learn that Sally doesn't have knowledge about the human world and comes to human world to start living in there.The series however shines when it comes to the episodic slice of life stories based on around Sally learning about herself and the human world and what it means to be able to or to not use magic in human world. Which I think is explored in interesting ways throughout the series.Art of the series gives off this cute and endearing vibe reminiscent of the 60s shoujo manga. I'd describe the overall visual aesthetic of the series as charming.Voice acting in the series is pretty much the best voice acting that I've heard in any series. Especially when it comes to the main character Sally. Her voice gives off this cheeky yet endearing vibe that gives incredible amount of life into her character. Other voice actors don't fall far behind as the whole main cast gives off a really strong presence with their voices.About the characters I'd say that this series has probably the best dynamic between characters that I've seen in any series. The dialogue and interaction between characters is joy to watch and listen with the lively voice acting coupled with visually endearing animation. It is a type of series where the characters grow on you the more you watch. More of the cast like Poron are introduced later on the series other than that the cast stays pretty much the same.I'd say that the inclusion of Poron in the latter half of the series definitely enhanced the character dynamics of the series to a new level. As the Sally and Kabu duo dynamic didn't provide as much as it does as a trio with Poron.Other important characters, Sally's 2 friends Sumire and Yoshiko with the triplet little brothers provide important perspective as major characters from earth. They are not aware of the magic that Sally has which I'd say adds another layer to the dynamic between the characters.Overall I found the series, especially the interaction between the characters and the handling of the concept of magic very enjoyable on the series. I'd go as far that I say that the series has the best interpretation and starting point when it comes to exploring magic that I've seen when it comes to anime. When you combine that with the likable, charming and endearing overall vibe of the characters themselves and the design, you get something special. say the important part of the story is the premise in which we learn that Sally doesn't have knowledge about the human world and comes to human world to start living in there.The series however shines when it comes to the episodic slice of life stories based on around Sally learning about herself and the human world and what it means to be able to or to not use magic in human world.

Great voice acting (amongst the best I've ever listened to) and in particular the one provided for the main character who 100% sounds like a living sassy girl, good main score, awesome chara design by one of the future key animators of the masterpiece Kanashimi No Belladonna, animation that has stood the time better than godawful CGI provided from nowadays Toei, fun factor elevated to over 9000 thanks to really funny side characters,...the only real annoyance that prevented this series from getting a 10/10 from me was the use of the removal of magic powers from the main characters as a tool to humanize and make them relatable to the main audience, not because I have problems with the aim but because I have problems with the way it was achieved. I get it, it was the land of unsubtetly known as the 60's, it was the first magical girl show ever so they had no idea how to do things properly and they improvised...even considering the time and the background of the series, after the tenth time you use this plot device in a series about the misadventures of a little witch that is shown using magical powers in the OP it gets monotonous, especially considering it's used in conjuction not just with Sally but with people like her granddad, THE FRIGGIN' KING OF HELL AND SUPREME WIZARD, who loses his powers and then immediately gets them back because reasens. Me thinks Toei did better in the humanizing/relatability factor in the following Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon, by using small touches and believable relationships and with a full-on differentiation between the side of the senshis as normal students living their life together and superheroines fighting crime (an activity curiosly Sally carried on at the start of her career, in the first B/W episodes). With this little grievance out of the way, the show is awesome, and if you're into magical girl shows in general you HAVE TO WATCH THIS, not matter what your favourite one is. Everybody took something from this, from SM to Princess Tutu passing through Utena and Ojamajo Doremi, so you definitely have to watch this. Trust me, it will be a really fun ride. the only real annoyance that prevented this series from getting a 10/10 from me was the use of the removal of magic powers from the main characters as a tool to humanize and make them relatable to the main audience, not because I have problems with the aim but because I have problems with the way it was achieved.

Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41812/Megami-ryou_no_Ryoubo-kun,"[""In case it wasn’t clear from the promotional material, Megami-ryou is a transparent appeal to lovers of ecchi harem fanservice. There is no attempt at constructing a continual narrative nor to create riveting characters who act in genuine ways. This is literally designed for the viewer to watch with their pants off as six girls all desire to hump one boy. If that sounds like something you’d be into, this show is golden. If not, you shouldn’t be watching.For those that fall into the intended audience - you’ll be pleased to know that this is not the type of ecchi that will manifest censorship beams...across the bare bosoms and bottoms of the harem, only to later remove them in a BD release. The nudity was totally uncensored upon airing on ATX channels, as far as Japan’s decency laws will allow for, and delivers the goods within the first few minutes of episode one. You will see accidental groping of tits, accidental slipping into the missionary position in the bathroom, intentional stripping in front of the MC in order to attract his attention, and an endless amount of other scenarios that high level degens should be familiar with.Megami-ryou also succeeds in having an aesthetically attractive and diverse best girl cast. You have the adorably naive, caring Athena who acts like an onee chan to the main character. She has nice tits. The shy goth cosplayer Frey who loves to use the MC as a fashion model. She has nice tits. The dorky bespeckled researcher Mineru...she has nice tits. There’s a loli, because why not. There’s a cute mysterious kuudere grill in Serene - ofc with pale blue hair, and a fiery tomboy with crimson red hair with tsun tendencies. Basically all the popular fantasy girl templates are present in the show - truly someone for everyone of the proud degens who watch the program.The young main character - and I mean young, he's twelve, may be a turn off for many who prefer their harem leads to be peers to the girls that pursue their balls. Afterall most people who watch this program will be double the age of Koushi. But this does tap into a fetish that many degens have of seeing young, submissive leads receiving a crash course to puberty by the aggressive and fully developed beauties that surround them. Is it morally wrong for a twelve year old to be in such an environment? Yeah. But that's part of the appeal, I think, as being told something is forbidden can make it more tantalizing.The immediate comparisons for this show are Asa Made Jugyou and, more recently, Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-sa. Both revolved around a timid young boy surrounded by gorgeous girls who all find him adorable and crave his attention. Neither of these harems truly “went” anywhere insofar as intimacy or a conclusive ending, because that’s never the point of these shows, only to endlessly tease and explore the possibilities of what could occur in this fantasy scenario.This however does raise a fair complaint concerning the cyclical, sexually non-committal ecchi of this nature though - wouldn’t this premise be better executed as a hentai? If you were in this situation as the MC, would you be able to resist the open invitations to have sexuale relations with with these girls as the MC never does? This is a common “problem” with full immersion into the ecchi genre as the decision making of the MCs is consistently unbelievable, minus a few rare cases. This problem in and of itself is why I’d have to dock the score a bit, despite being a success in ways that an ecchi is intended to be.What you see is what you get here. This is very much so a derivative of past successes and isn’t reinventing the wheel in any shape or form. But because there is so rarely these days ecchi anime that are willing to be fully nude romps that showcases the female anatomy in ways the viewer wishes they could irl, this shines as a perverted wish fulfillment tool that harkens back to days where these types of shows were much more plentiful. For that reason it should be particularly celebrated as a recent success of the ecchi genre that has been starving for a bit for more bolder works. across the bare bosoms and bottoms of the harem, only to later remove them in a BD release. The nudity was totally uncensored upon airing on ATX channels, as far as Japan’s decency laws will allow for, and delivers the goods within the first few minutes of episode one. You will see accidental groping of tits, accidental slipping into the missionary position in the bathroom, intentional stripping in front of the MC in order to attract his attention, and an endless amount of other scenarios that high level degens should be familiar with.Megami-ryou also succeeds in having an aesthetically attractive and diverse best girl cast. You have the adorably naive, caring Athena who acts like an onee chan to the main character. She has nice tits. The shy goth cosplayer Frey who loves to use the MC as a fashion model. She has nice tits. The dorky bespeckled researcher Mineru...she has nice tits. There’s a loli, because why not. There’s a cute mysterious kuudere grill in Serene - ofc with pale blue hair, and a fiery tomboy with crimson red hair with tsun tendencies.

I added a couple updates.Well, here we have this season's how-the-hell-is-this-not-labeled-as-hentai.Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun (Mother of the Goddess' Dormitory) is another one of those anime where I have absolutely no idea whether I should rate it a 1 or 10. From the very first frame, this anime blatantly shreds any form of correctness, decency or morality. An innocent middle school kid, devastated by the sudden loss of a family and a place to call home, is thrown into a hellhole of raunchy, horny barbarians.I have...not read the source of this anime, but I can only assume the author did not put any more than 10 seconds of thought into the plot of the story. However I'll give it the benefit of the doubt as we're only 1 episode in (Update: This point still stands). The art and sound are fine but not remarkable. The art clearly resembles every other blatant hentai and does well at it. The voice actors actually do a pretty good job at representing the character and context they're in, and by that I mean they resemble horny barbarians very well.The characters are a reincarnation of every stereotypical character in harem/romcom, but as I mentioned earlier I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because one episode isn't enough to show any development (which I doubt will happen but whatever) (Update: There have been some minor developments in the relationships between Koushi and the others as well as Atena's situation with men. It is however rather bland and tropey and my hopes aren't too high. This still pretty much applies).If there's something that this anime does well, it's staying true to what it is. It doesn't try to hide it's blatant deplorability and goes all out in the shitshow that it is. For that reason I actually gained some respect towards the show. Therefore, my opinion is that this anime is fantastic because of it's ability to not give a single shit and present itself as a disgusting, despicable sexualization of a middle-school kid with no remorse.Thus:Story - 5 (Mediocre)Art - 7 (Good)Sound - 7 (Good)Character - 6 (Fair)Enjoyment - 10 (Outstanding)Overall - 10 (Masterpiece)I will keep updating this review if anything changes, but I strongly doubt anything will.Also, yes, this is my first review on MAL.

What about it?"", 'TRIGGER WARNING: PEDOPHILIA, GROOMING, SEXUAL ASSAULTWataten and Uzumaid walked so this anime could run.Mother of the Goddess’ Dormitory is softcore child porn similar to Boku no Pico. Except instead of a man molesting a child, multiple women molest a child. In terms of pedo-bait anime, this is probably the most shameless one so far—plenty of nudity, sexual innuendos galore, and even sex.After his father abandoned him, a suspicious woman offers a 12-year-old boy named Koushi a place to stay. Upon entering his new home, three residents of the all-female college dormitory greet him in the nude: jiggly jugs, nipples, and all in uncensored grandeur. One...contrived sexual encounter after another, and now Koushi is their “dorm mother."" He\'s tasked with laundry, cooking, and cleaning. As he interacts with the women daily, they overtly flirt with him and vie for his attention, even though he is obviously a minor and they are adults.There are five child predators, I mean lovely women, who live in the dorm. Each lady has a distinct personality that will be recognizable to fans of the harem genre. The woman who found Koushi, Minera, is a mad scientist. She works in her underwear with no bra because that’s very practical attire for working with toxic chemicals. The goth girl, Fley, forcibly dresses Koushi in sexual cosplay outfits at any chance she gets. This embarrassment quickly turns to sexual assault because she misunderstands his politeness as flirting. The silver-haired girl follows the quiet and submissive archetype (Similar to Koneko and Kanade Tachibana). She also sexually assaults Koushi. Kiriya, the red-haired girl, was raised with brothers and often gets nervous when Koushi treats her like a woman rather than a tomboy. As time passes, the writers give her more screentime—their relationship becomes increasingly more sexual.The most prominent female character is Atena, often framed as a fragile shrinking violet rather than a predator. She is afraid of men because, for some reason, she was never around boys until going to college. If she comes close to men or 12-year-old boys, she gets uncontrollable nosebleeds. After Koushi accidentally gropes her a dozen or so times, she becomes more tolerant of boys. The primary joke is that she is uncomfortable around him, but they keep sexually assaulting one another coincidentally. Koushi expresses no romantic interest in Atena, but she develops feelings for him. Those feelings manifest as an incest fetish when she learns she enjoys him calling her “older sister”.Lastly, there is a sixth girl, Sueta, who is about Koushi’s age. She frequently visits (and abuses) him at the dorm. I can summarize her personality as ‘violent tsundere’. She hits him whenever he gets flustered as a natural response to a precarious sexual situation. As much as I hate the molester girls, I resent Sueta’s inclusion in the show because they use her for pedophilic fan service. I’m not interested in “it’s just a cartoon” debates. You are welcome to your opinion. Mine is that it’s creepy to sexualize kid characters.The only thing that could be qualified as character development is how the girls progressively sexually harass Koushi in more creative ways. All I see are tiresome archetypes and stupid contrivances for fanservice moments. Occasionally there is drama, but it is immediately interrupted by groping, panties, cleavage, or nipples, so you can never really take it seriously. In my opinion, this anime is deplorable bottom-of-the-barrel scrapings. “Haha look at these hot girls sexually harassing a child” isn’t a funny joke. It’s just someone’s fetish. Why not make hentai rather than a full-length TV show? No one is getting fooled.There are a few bizarre situations where it departs from generic harem cliches and takes a sharp turn into fever dream territory. A few highlights include: A chemically induced lesbian orgy, a 12-year-old girl gets diddled by a fish, girl falls on Koushi’s dick through the ceiling. Yes, it has the same premise as the softcore hentai classic “What She Fell on Was the Tip of My Dick, Joshi Ochi!” There’s also a homage to the famous hentai “My Brother’s Slipped Inside Me in The Bathtub” in one early episode. Seeing how absurd Goddess’ Dormitory would become is the main reason I kept watching it.Based on the ecchi x harem genre, it succeeds in the breast department. The titties are bountiful and uncensored. It would get an 8/10 if you removed everything except for the 20 seconds of titties in each episode.Art-wise, it is clear that time, talent, and budget went into this production. Thanks to the lack of animation, the character art generally looks consistent. I noticed they forgot to add sound effects, like footsteps, which seems like an amateur oversight at random points. At least the opening and ending are catchy tunes. All of the voice acting is phoned in, to put it nicely. The performances made me miss the days of over-the-top acting in High School DxD. After a streak of dumpster fires, Asread probably adapted this to get a quick check from their investors. Hopefully, it is just one minor disaster that everyone involved forgets. All I want is for Asread to go back to making hilariously bad anime like Big Order and Arifureta.I would recommend you avoid Goddess’ Dormitory like the scourge it is. contrived sexual encounter after another, and now Koushi is their “dorm mother.""

He is left behind by his family for some reason and one event leads...to another and he ends up being like a kind of nanny for a girls dormitory where pretty much all the girls are very unique in their own way. This eventually leads to multiple misunderstandings and very intricate situations which don't always turn out well for our mc.Some of the problems I have with this series is that of morals or just loop holes that the series left that I don't particularly understand1)The fact that mc 12 and he gets into odd situations with people over the age of 18 doesn't sit right with me2) I'm still very confused as to why his family left him behind, maybe there was something I missed or I wasn't paying much attention at the time but it boggles my mind that a 12 year old was left homeless3) In like episode 2/3 one of the girls is hella strong and destroys part of the house and it is magically restored by one of the other girls. I feel like this part should of been elaborated a bit further as it left me very confused and it was never mentioned againStory 4:nothing too crazy and it has quite a few loopholesCharacters 4:nobody really stands out and none of them have an interesting complex character not that its needed for this type of animeSound 8:honestly opening and ending were really good and I bopped to them quite a bitEnjoyment 4:Honestly the series had it's moments but it doesn't really appeal to me but I can see why one would like this seriesOver 4/10 to another and he ends up being like a kind of nanny for a girls dormitory where pretty much all the girls are very unique in their own way.

If the idea works once, it should work multiple times, just a few changes here and there (so long as it isn\'t too ambitious), give it a title of its own and you\'re good to go.Mother of the Goddess\' Dormitory falls into this situation. It\'s easy to hate, but you gotta remember that people will love these anime endlessly,...and in the perspective of such, sure, it isn\'t the best harem in the world, but it is still pretty good.The story is episodic in which follows the lives of the protagonist, Koushi, in his newly found home after he found himself in the wrong anime (Fire Force). Most of the episodes are/contain what you are probably already expecting, y\'know, your beach episodes, school festival, guy falls over and touches tits for the 17th time, all that junk. I suppose in itself it isn\'t the most creative thing on Earth, but the anime does a good job at allowing the viewer to be invested in the marriage of its own gimmicks added to it, like that crazy scientist, cosplay girl, kuudere outta this world, and that ninja girl. It made for some pretty funny moments I didn\'t think were going to come in honesty. One more thing I will go on about with the characters is how they also had some underlying story to their name, it doesn\'t see the light of day often, but when it does it is a nice touch to add onto for them. In some sense, it probably heightens enjoyment when you see your favourite character become more detailed, don\'t hope for too much though.The audiovisuals are pretty dry, it\'s basically every box standard 2015-ish time anime. Literally nothing more to disclose on that superficial matter. However, I will point out how the animation sometimes benefits this anime, particularly of its kind. When it is slapstick as it is, things get surreal to the point of it making the anime funnier than it already is, what you may find ""lazy animation"" can actually be looked at as part of the comedic atmosphere this anime has for itself, though, I\'d imagine this is true for a lot of other anime, not that I remember.At the end of the day, I enjoyed this anime a lot more than I thought was plausible. I found myself laughing at the antics and tomfoolery way more than I should have. The anime also has some self-awareness to it which makes it funnier to view. I mean, it is just boobs at the end of the day, kinda makes sense that it will do anything to get there, especially how they are explicitly shown. and in the perspective of such, sure, it isn\'t the best harem in the world, but it is still pretty good.The story is episodic in which follows the lives of the protagonist, Koushi, in his newly found home after he found himself in the wrong anime (Fire Force).

I haven’t watched DxD or Redo just yet because I am scared that my parents will catch me watching lewd anime shit but I’ve thought, what if I watch it secretly? And that’s what I did.You can think of Goddess Dormitory as a...SoL anime as well since it basically revolves around the life of a 12 year old shota who’s also somehow the mother of the dorm. Well at least he gets paid... right...?Well yeah he gets paid with horny ass girls of the dorm swinging their boobas around and getting smooshed by their asses.The OP of this anime is the best I’ve heard this season. It just gets me dancing for whatever reason. I love it.If you’re horny as hell like me, well you’d definitely enjoy this “anime” because there’s BOOBA and let’s be honest here, who doesn’t love booba? Apart from those, I also think this is hilarious and we also have Taiga 2.0 I guess?Yeah.

Even though the plot is completely ridiculous and plain, it's funny and enjoyable enough.Story: little to none at all, it feels more like a bunch of random things thrown together without any reason. 3/10Art: 8/10, it's good and it suits well the type of anime it's meant for.Sound: 9/10, both the OP and ED were actually good.Character: you've got the shy little boy surrounded magically by girls and...girls only (and boobs), the crazy chemist that walks around naked, the shy pretty girl that has a men phobia, the cosplayer goth girl, the strong girl that likes to get physical, the cat-like white-haired girl that is a bunny princess or something (?) and the tsundere that doesn't know how to express her feelings. And (almost) all of them have big boobs, obviously. 2/10Enjoyment: 7/10 and overall: 6/10.If you like shota and seeing boobs 10 times per episode, this might be the perfect match for you.

I'm not overly familiar with eechi genre but this show almost has every eechi trope that I'm aware of.But what's particularly strange is how the show attempts to present this material in a somewhat satirical manner, I feel like...the creator of this series deliberately added an age gap between for comedic purposes, let's just say it didn't work everything is so poorly timed, it's hard to haha funny laugh out loud while simultaneously feeling extremely uncomfortable.The comedy is basically just:1. Main character and *insert female from show here* are conveniently misplaced.2. Main character gets close to that characters boobs and feels uncomfortable.3.

I get that there are a lot of people who don't like this kind of stuff, hence the rather low score, but in my opinion this anime was really refreshing. We haven't really seen this kind of stuff since the era of To Love Ru and Highschool DxD 10 years ago. Amidst the current wave of clone isekais with excessively long titles, this is exactly what I wanted to unwind and take my mind off things. The characters didn't strictly adhere to the harem tropes of yore, and the male mc isn't painfully dense. Although the story didn't really get anywhere...over the course of 10 episodes, I don't think it was all that necessary given the target audience and the intended purpose of entertainment through fun fanservice. While I don't think we should bring back the ecchi harem romcom fad, having one pop up in 2021 was certainly a breath of fresh air, and I really enjoyed it. over the course of 10 episodes, I don't think it was all that necessary given the target audience and the intended purpose of entertainment through fun fanservice.

Especially the opening which is really a head banger and the lyrics match the tone of the series itself.Characters: ( 8 )I like the character design because even they can be compared with other anime as look alikes especially Serene with Koneko from High School DxD and Atena with Lala Deviluke from To Love Ru, and many others. The creators made sure that these characters are unforgettable because of their exaggerated eccentric personalities except for Koushi of course, all harem MCs are like that.

Ecchi situation (probably with tits) happens, rinse and repeat. As long as you're fine with ecchi and shota content, you'll enjoy it. That being said, I think this show has a little bit more going for it that pushes it past generic ecchi fare and into an actually enjoyable show.On a base level the characters are as...you expect from this kind of show, each of them has a singular main trait that gets used as a vehicle for the majority of the ecchi situations they get involved in with our main character Koushi. Frey, for example is an avid cosplayer and often dresses up herself or other characters (including Koushi himself) in slutty costumes which inevitably leads to ecchi moments. And for a lot of the show, she is very straightforward in using almost every opportunity she can to tease Koushi. But there are occasional moments where she takes a step back from the ecchi and shows that there's actually something more to her character.Throughout the show via living at the dorm Koushi, who never had a proper family before, learns how it feels to truly have one for the first time, but over time these thoughts shift into more romantic ones. These conflicting feelings leave him at a crossroads, between these feelings and wanting to continue with this status quo now he's finally found a place he belongs. So, in the end, he decides to bottle up these feelings inside him.Frey notices this and uses her usual vehicle for ecchi, cosplay, for a completely different reason. She gets Koushi to cosplay with her and utilising the aspect of freedom it gives allowing people to act as the characters and not as themselves to force Koushi to confront his feelings in a surprisingly well directed scene given what's expected from this kind of show.Honestly, this scene is probably one of my favorites of the entire season and it's moments like this that, as mentioned before, in my opinion gives the show something extra over the usual ecchi show. Not every character gets development like this however, but for the ones that do, while nothing revolutionary, it's generally well done enough where it makes them feel like actual characters as opposed to just being there to create those ecchi moments and makes you want to root for them in their pursuit of romance with Koushi.The combination of each character's quirk, the general mayhem in the dorm, and these bits of actual characterisation create an enjoyable cast of characters. Such that you can understand why Koushi feels that he's found somewhere he belongs. And also leads to some enjoyable comedy getting at least a couple of chuckles each episode.Production wise this show is nothing special, but does what it needs to, the character designs are hot enough for the ecchi scenes to work and the other visual elements are acceptable enough to where they don't distract from the show.For the most part this show follows the ecchi script, but it occasionally stepping slightly outside the bounds makes it feel that it has something more than most ecchi shows. Leading to a show with a fun atmosphere, entertaining characters, and a pretty enjoyable experience overall (with added tits).Score: 7.5/10 you expect from this kind of show, each of them has a singular main trait that gets used as a vehicle for the majority of the ecchi situations they get involved in with our main character Koushi.

Sure if you go expecting deep characters and plot twists you\'re not going to get it but in terms of ecchi anime this is one of the best! I\'ve never had so much fun since watching To Love RU Darkness. If you are an ecchi fan then everything you need from an ecchi show is right here!The girls in this show are epic! Each of them are crafted based on a certain character archetype but manage to feel refreshing and new. Their boobs are great too, so there\'s that.The show opens with PLOT...itself so what more can you ask? I really wish this gets noticed a lot. itself so what more can you ask? I really wish this gets noticed a lot.', 'If you’re looking through the reviews of this series for reasons to not watch it, then honestly, I think you’re probably better off just not watching it. On the other hand, if you’re open to giving this series a shot, then I’m here to try and persuade you that it’s going to be worth your time. Because while this series appears to simply be your regular ecchi anime filled with overwhelming fan service, I personally think that there’s much more about it to love.Right after reading the synopsis, you should already get the feeling that this series is a bit different from the...usual tropes (unless, of course, you’re comparing it to something like Sunohara-sou). Firstly, none of the main characters are high school students. Instead, they are middle schoolers and college/university students, and in this case the middle schooler is the only dude so we’re pretty much closer to the safe end with regards to age-related discourse… but that’s a matter for another day. Anyway, due to certain circumstances, the kid moves into an all-female dormitory and starts his new life with some lovely company. Unlike a lot of other harem series, in Megami-ryou, not all the girls immediately or eventually fall in love with the main dude. It has a simple story filled with fun and wacky moments, and tinges of romance added in here and there. While they may have uniquely unorthodox traits, in general the girls’ characters are really natural, down-to-earth and befitting of college/university students, which makes them relatable to a certain extent. Pacing of each episode was good and overall the composition of the series was well planned out, making it easy to enjoy and understand.Needless to say, this series has a great amount of fan service, which is arguably the main focus and main attraction in the first place. Now, when it comes to the ecchi genre, people sometimes make complaints about those mysterious beams of light which appear within the anime, a phenomenon otherwise known as censorship. Naturally, this series does feature censorship as well. However, it also features not one, not two, but three different versions with three different levels of censorship – censored, uncensored, and “see-through” versions. While doing so doesn’t exactly make the series family-friendly, I feel that it shows just how much thought and effort the production staff have put into making this series potentially enjoyable for viewers. On that note, I was pretty satisfied with the fan service provided and felt it wasn’t too over-the-top, it complemented the comedic moments well and was rarely used unnecessarily.Majority of the seiyuus for the characters are new or relatively less experienced, but that did not affect my enjoyment of the series. In fact, it was rather refreshing to hear newer voices which I’m not accustomed to hearing from the tons of other series I have watched. In addition, this series also featured a separate “2.5D” cast, who cosplay as the characters and also sing the opening and ending themes. This is another commendable decision made by the staff and another special element for fans of the series to enjoy.In conclusion, if you love ecchi and fan service and want a series which won’t exactly take up too much of your time, this 10-episode series will most definitely be worth the watch. If you were on the fence, I hope that you can give it a try. Megami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun will be a series which you can simply switch off your brain and enjoy, with treats for the eyes, heart-warming moments and a whole lot of fun. usual tropes (unless, of course, you’re comparing it to something like Sunohara-sou).

So another ecchi themed anime has ended and to be honest , this is something that a guy with high libido would enjoy and we look forward for another season, who know as to what another ecchi theme anime would be coming up.....so without further adieu, here are my raating for this 10 episode anime.Story-Mediocre 5: Ok so the plot here involves a 12 year old boy who has experience something tragic in his life given that he has a not good Otosan who\'s knee deep in debt and the apartment which was the only sanctuary left for our MC got...burned down and thus our MC finds himself homeless living day by day eating only scraps that can be found in thrash bin, till one day lol and behold just as he about to die on the pavement he sees a piece of haven in a form of purple panties which is worn by a hot hustling genius woman who brought him in their place of sanctuary and yes it\'s the Goddess Dormitory, in which it was in disarray and someone is needed to manage the disarray and yes it was our MC to the rescue, but not after encountering some hostilities from one of its members who has a problem with men.....So how does this story plot stack up.....well, it doesn\'t since the plot was obviously taken from another anime ""Happy Lesson"" which involves older harem members to younger male character and just like the usual, they tweak it a little, give them Japanese knack for plagiarizing.Art-Good 7: For a while there have been 2 version of this anime, there\'s the censored and the uncensored now give the knack of guys with big libido, well, it won\'t be a surprise, given that this has ecchi in it, this series be it manga or anime simply relies a lot on the fanservices to sell.Sound-Good 7: That for the opening theme and the character\'s voices that don\'t need to mask as if they\'re Joshikausei\'s except one girl who is a Chugakasei, her voice clearly doesn\'t match that as a middle schooler, the guy having a female voice I might understand but the girl in middle school to sound like a 20 something was just ill fitted.Character-Mediocre: Ok so lets what we have, for starters let\'s not for get that this series was closely related to ""Happy Lesson"" let\'s go over each of them:Koshi Nagumo- In a version of Sususmu Arisaka who\'s a young guy whose parents where no where to be found, a typical nice guy and as usual a typical harem guy with a sotacon harem. TBH, given that he\'s 12 years old means that he is still a kid, while Sususmu Arisaka from ""Happy Lesson"" was already in his mid teens....the only thing that was different of the 2 one gets to grope his sotacon harem, though always accidentally that is, while the other never gets to touch any of his sotacom harem.Wachi, Mineru - Basically she has all the geniuses of Kisaragi ""Ki-chan"" Ninomai from ""Happy Lesson"" but characteristicwise, she is alternate version of the latter, cu\'z while Ki-chan was more like a kuudere, Mineru was more like a combination of an teasing deredere, with a combination of bakadere due to the fact that she\'s also called ""Walking Toxic Gas Emitter."" but most of all she\'s one genius who has a high interest in science to which she isn\'t the nerdist type rather she a type where she\'s a go getter with a hot body, Ki-chan from Happy Lesson was simply boring, and doesn\'t do enough to attract a guy.Frey- If she and Uzuki Shitenno from ""happy Lesson were to meet, these two will definitely get along very well, since bother were cosplayers and have the same amount of air headness give that the two were a bit of a bakadere who live in a world of fantasy......the only thing that these two would disagree on, is how Uzuki would envy Frey\'s bodacious body.Serene Hozumi- The closes she match for her is  Sanzenin, Yayoi, given that both have that mysterious aura that exist to both of them....however Serene was the most mysterious than Yayoi, give that the original creator  Hino, Ikumi often gives a lot of mixed signal about her character except ,that just like the rest of the tenants of Goddess dormitory she too is also a tease.Senshou, Kiriya- Characterwise she closely matches Gokajou, Satsuki from ""Happy Lesson"" give that bother have that bokuko attribute, the only difference was Kiriya was more on the mellow side while Satsuki was more on the aggressive side..... but, both don\'t compete that much for the MC\'s affection.Saotome, Atena- Ok, just like Ichimonji, Mutsuki both really do care for the MC, but when it comes to how they do it, Mutsuki does it like a mom , while Athen does it like an Oneechan.Kouroya, Sutea - Basically she\'s a tsundere, while in Happy Lesson,  Fumitsuki Nanakorobi was more like a deredere , a tough as nails deredere, both were feared by the MC and wouldn\'t dare go against them.In conclusion, the characters here were just the usual from ""Happy Lesson"" in fact you could say that this 10 episode anime is ksut a risque version of ""Happy Lesson.""Enjoyment-Poor 3: Let\'s face it this was just all about the fanservices, and frankly this can pass as a qusihentai if doing the female character would have been added.Overall Good 7: Given that this was only 10 episode long , I got give it to studio ""asread"" for the practical choice. Just limiting it to 10 episode meant, that the studio doesn\'t have any plans to further gets us audience to be too tired of it.IMAO, I ain\'t too keen for this anime to have a season two, since original creator, Hino, Ikumi, wasn\'t much of a story teller and was just too dependent on making something  raunchy, in fact this original works of his will have to compete hard in making it to the top ecchi genre. burned down and thus our MC finds himself homeless living day by day eating only scraps that can be found in thrash bin, till one day lol and behold just as he about to die on the pavement he sees a piece of haven in a form of purple panties which is worn by a hot hustling genius woman who brought him in their place of sanctuary and yes it\'s the Goddess Dormitory, in which it was in disarray and someone is needed to manage the disarray and yes it was our MC to the rescue, but not after encountering some hostilities from one of its members who has a problem with men.....So how does this story plot stack up.....well, it doesn\'t since the plot was obviously taken from another anime ""Happy Lesson"" which involves older harem members to younger male character and just like the usual, they tweak it a little, give them Japanese knack for plagiarizing.Art-Good 7: For a while there have been 2 version of this anime, there\'s the censored and the uncensored now give the knack of guys with big libido, well, it won\'t be a surprise, given that this has ecchi in it, this series be it manga or anime simply relies a lot on the fanservices to sell.Sound-Good 7: That for the opening theme and the character\'s voices that don\'t need to mask as if they\'re Joshikausei\'s except one girl who is a Chugakasei, her voice clearly doesn\'t match that as a middle schooler, the guy having a female voice I might understand but the girl in middle school to sound like a 20 something was just ill fitted.Character-Mediocre: Ok so lets what we have, for starters let\'s not for get that this series was closely related to ""Happy Lesson"" let\'s go over each of them:Koshi Nagumo- In a version of Sususmu Arisaka who\'s a young guy whose parents where no where to be found, a typical nice guy and as usual a typical harem guy with a sotacon harem.

About 70% of this anime is a fanservice scene, but I don't feel that it's excessive at all. Maybe part of the reason is that I'm a horny teenager, but still I feel this anime give us the perfect balance of fanservice and slice of life. Really though , I can't watch this anime with my family around.Enough about the lewd, this one really hits different. I have enjoyed a few new romcom animes, but this one doesn't really give that much romantic element at all. This anime doesn't really give you a sweet or...cute or adorable moments between people who has a crush on each other at all, except for when Sutea-chan appears. I feel like the story focuses more on the development of the characters and how they slowly accept Koushi into the family, and in the past 10 eps we can clearly see some character development from Koushi and Athena and maybe some from Kiriya as well.And that's the thing, I feel like they did a really good job in conveying the character development of each character. Maybe it's because the problem they have in the first place somewhat revolves around family issues, so by giving us excessive service scenes we got used to it and it finally becomes something like a daily occurances with a family member in the same house (I'm not saying I my older sister's nake body everyday). That might be why I see so much change in the interaction between Koushi and the other characters in the anime.The art is very nice and the VA did a very good job as well. Enjoyed it every episode.Ps. I don't even understand half of what I wrote so I promise I'll do better next time. cute or adorable moments between people who has a crush on each other at all, except for when Sutea-chan appears.

Its 10 episodes of random events that happen in the group and apart from the main characters backstory in the first 3 episodes there is no coherent plot to be found here. Its just ecchi greatness and that\'s all6/10art: The artwork is beautiful for this show, imagine dr stone level of fluid animation but a tiny, tiny...bit worse.

(its no different here) Though its not really a bad thing, all of the girls have a lot of screen time and they are genuinely really nice characters to watch interact with each other, wink wink. The main character is like every other haram anime protagonist but a shota... I shan\'t say more.8/10enjoyment: Very enjoyable haram plot with a metric crap-ton of fan service and a opining that is so beautiful you wouldn\'t dare skip it. Funny plot and likeable cast.

It will have some choice scenarios people might not like and that's to be expected, but it really should not be a surprise for anyone after reading the synopsis or just the first episode in where this show goes towards.Surprisingly this show is not censored even on legal sites such as HIDIVE since it was originally licensed for a premium TV channel and they have no rules to do so. This is blatantly shown within the first few seconds of the beginning of the show.The premise itself is quite well done going into touching how the...MC now has no family, no home, and is potentially dying of starvation right on the sidewalk. It then jumps into more of comedic and ecchi scenes paving the path of what you should expect majority of the show to be.The Ecchi in this show is easily 10/10, Romance is not the greatest so probably 3/10, and Comedy at least for me was good enough to be a 7/10. Comedy is of course subjective, it really depends if you find ecchi situations funny.Surprisingly, I found the show to have a decent plot it was rather wholesome and cute considering the tragic beginnings. And at many points the pacing of the episodes was done really well it did not feel things were left out or rushed they just ended quite peacefully.Characters are of course enjoyable and cute to watch along with their certain scenes. Except maybe the childhood friend which is hardcore tsundere, but does create some funny moments.The OP is pretty good and catchy.Overall, this show likely falls under a certain niche for some even beyond it being an ecchi. If the premise doesn't bother you or you don't try applying real life principles to an fictional anime. Then there's a high chance you will like the show and enjoy it for both its ecchiness and humor with many great lighthearted and wholesome fun moments.

An anime with little to no plot, great animated panty shots and oppais. TL;DR is at the end.However, even tho I am not too sensitive to this topic unlike some others, I really did not find the shota thing too appealing. Like, he\'s obviously underage. And normalizing such occurrences (in the anime) is sort of... idk.. it just bothered me.But, I got what I wanted. Some scenes are actually hilarious, others are just overused.

By her own admission, she likes to do these experiments in as little clothing as possible. How she hasn\'t melted her skin off through some horrific accident involving acid, I\'ll never know.Next is Frey (who looks suspiciously like Cynthia, from Pokemon), the blonde gothic beauty with a penchant for cosplay. She enjoys dressing up Koushi in the outfits she makes, often humiliating him in the process. Like Mineru, she often takes any excuse she can find to get naked, or at least partially so.Kiriya Senshou is our resident tomboy. Growing up as the only daughter of a dojo, alongside several brothers, Kiriya is usually more comfortable being treated as ""one of the guys"", and gets embarassed whenever someone treats her like a girl (this WOULD potentially be a cute trait, except again, NUDITY AND PEDOPHILIA.)Serene Hozumi is the deadpan borderline-emotionless girl who has no problems with getting undressed in front of people (but what else is new in this series? Everyone seems to have this particular...quirk.) Something of a techno-nerd, Serene is very messy, and loves the moon.Atena Saotome is about the only girl I can actually stand in this series. She is the only one (apart from Koushi himself) who protests to the rampant pedophilia and molestation going on in the dorm. It turns out that she hates males, and getting too close to them results in torrential nosebleeds. Koushi becomes the one exception, and activated her Little Brother complex when he starts calling her his sister.Sutea Kouroya is the token violent tsundere bitch, who constantly abuses Kouchi, despite actually caring for him very much. She is his childhood friend, and possible(?) love interest. Unfortunately, we have to put up with seeing far too much of her UNDERAGE, TWELVE-YEAR-OLD panties to be remotely comfortable with her being onscreen.I seriously don\'t understand why they didn\'t just set this anime in a nudist colony. At least then the girls would have a REASON to constantly be partially to fully naked at any given moment.Given how often the girls mash their genitals in Koushi\'s face, it probably would have worked better as a hentai.Finally, WHY THE EVER-LOVING FUCK IS ALL OF THIS HAPPENING TO A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD?!?!?! PEDOPHILIA AND/OR MOLESTATION IS. NOT. OKAY!May this anime burn in the fiery pits of Hell. Seriously, the ONLY good thing I can say about it is that the art is pretty.

Trying to be the good boy, I would have liked it to be more realistic or I know if a boy has the opportunity that the protagonist has, he does not do what he does. I do not know if you understand me but much more sexual results. The animation is very good, the tits show that they put a budget on it. Remarkable, the designed character is fine. I do not recommend it,...go to see a good hentai, you will enjoy it more.En español:Anime con trama de hentai, me esperaba mas escenas subidas de tono la verdad decepcionado con este anime. No me gusto para nada la personalidad del personaje principal muy normal. Tratando de ser el chico bueno, me hubiera gustado que sea mas realista o se si un chico tiene la oportunidad que tiene el protagonista no hace lo que hace. No se si me entienden pero mucho mas resultados sexuales. La animación esta muy bien las tetas se nota que le pusieron presupuesto. Notable, el diseñado personaje esta bien. No lo recomiendo vayan a ver un buen hentai lo van a disfrutar mas. go to see a good hentai, you will enjoy it more.En español:Anime con trama de hentai, me esperaba mas escenas subidas de tono la verdad decepcionado con este anime.

I saw the poster and the premise, and it reminded me, a lot, of Miss caretaker of Sunohara-sou, which is an anime that aired in 2018.  I expected trash, and I got exactly what I wanted...maybe with a little bit more.  I mean, not much more.  But ya know, a little bit.  I guess.  Maybe? I'm not gonna live, I loved this show.  I loved every trashy, horny second of it.  I loved it so much that I gave it an 8 on MAL, which is one point above Miss caretaker of Sunohara-sou.  It's one of the most purely enjoyable anime of 2021 so far.Now, before we get into this, yes, it is trash.  It was created for the sole purpose of watching with your pants off and...something in your hand.  Let's not try and kid ourselves here.  However, I do have to say, that's shockingly not the only reason to enjoy it.  Mother of the Goddess' Dormitory is 50& horny, and 50%...surprisngly heartwarming and wholesome.  Yes, really.  I'm not kidding.I love these characters.  All five of the college girls in the dorm, the protagonist, Koushi, and Koushi's childhood friend and kinda, sorta love interest, the resident Tsundere, Sutea, are all unique from each other.  My favorite is Atena, as I think she's the best looking, but also she has the most enjoyable personality, and actually has a little bit of depth, which the others really don't.  Due to some past experiences witih men when she was younger, she is terrified of men; so terrified, that blood bursts from her nose and faints whenever she gets to close to a man.And at first, Koushi was included.  So much that when the other girls announce that Koushi was goin to live with them, she was prepared to leave the house and go out on her own.  However, then Koushi goes and tells her to head back to the dorm and he'll leave instead, as he didn't want to push her out of the home that she lived in first.  Later that night, Koushi is sleeping on a bench, freezing, and Atena finds him and takes him back to the dorm, telling him that it's okay if he stays there, and she won't leave either.After that, throughout the series, we get to see her get closer to Koushi, despite him being a man.  By the end of the series she still has a long ways to go when it comes to her complicated relationship with men, but she had a genuine character arc, which is something I didn't expect in this damn series.I also love Koushi.  He's such a selfless, sweet boy.  Even though his house burned down and he ended up on the street, he doesn't tell Sutea, his childhood friend, because he doesn't want to burden her, even though she says later that she would have been willing to help him out.  And when Atena is about to leave the dorm because of him, he decides to leave instead.  Despite everything that's happened to him, he kept an optimistic outlook, and cares for others.  I don't know how realistic this is, but it's definitely inspiring, and it makes him very likeable, if a bit naive.  But he's 12, so it's acceptable.My least favorite character is probably Sueta.  I don't hate her, but she ended up being a pretty standard Tsundere.  I do like that there are times when we get to hear her inner thoughts, regretting not being able to tell Koushi how she feels about him; with most Tsunderes it takes a long time for us to actually get anything like this.  And some of her antics did make me laugh, but not many.  The cheapest moment regarding her has got to be when the two of them have one of those standard trip and falls and he winds up on top of her, and her clothes are partially removed.  At first, she started to move his hand closer to her breast, and I thought this would end up being a very unique Tsundere moment...but then she just kicked him away like usual, and i was let down.The other characters are somewhere in the middle, I don't love them or hate them, but all of them are very sexy, and have a lot of funny scenes, which is obviously the most important aspect of this anime anyways, so mission accomplished.  Like I said before, I was shocked by how many wholesome and heartwarming moments are int his anime, almost every episode has at least one of them.  The last episode in particular was the mos touching to me.  It shows that Koushi has basically became family to these girls, like a little brother, and they'll always look out for him.However, let's not kid ourselves, the primary purpose of this show is the fanservice.  And it delivers.  Definitely watch the uncensored version.  There's three versions, censored, semi-censored, and uncensored, and the uncensored version is obviously the way to go.  I mean, why watch an ecchi anime in any state other than uncensored?Final Score - 8/10 Honestly, I don't know what I expected.

Oh lord, where to start.This show is insanely problematic for a number of reasons, mainly the fact that a 12-year-old boy gets molested by older girls/women, and later a 12-year-old girl is also sexualized heavily for NO reason whatsoever.There's nothing really remarkable about this show. Nothing stands out except for the problematic things.The only other thing I can say, is that some of the girls had somewhat decent character writing and development? The episode where Frey cosplays with Koushi was actually really good, and the overall arc Atena goes through is also really good, although the execution of the latter is...just... bad.It says a lot that Kiriya is the least problematic character, mainly because she doesn't end up in those sexualized scenarios as much as the other girls.So yeah... problematic show that sometimes tries to have good things sprinkled in, without anything else that really stands out. just... bad.It says a lot that Kiriya is the least problematic character, mainly because she doesn't end up in those sexualized scenarios as much as the other girls.So yeah... problematic show that sometimes tries to have good things sprinkled in, without anything else that really stands out."", ""I really enjoyed this anime normally I don't really care for ecchi animes but this anime I felt was quite different it was a nice change of pace for once and it was really fun I definitely recommend you check this out some people will and some people won't like this anime.

No hard judging here.It\'s a simple story shota based, with lot of big breasts and not very smart girls, who will fall in love just for saying ""you are cute"".If you want to enjoy simple ecchi  story, with no hard brain in scenario - it\'s for you.Story full of predictable moves. But graphics are on good level. Even the storytelling is okay.

Even in the uncensored, it just feels worse especially when your parents are around you.Artstyle is the same thing as other animes. They are on-par.Sound is ok. I like the opening and the ending. Very creative and and music appealing. The background sounds feel uncomfortable and unpleasant, making it feel like you’re being...seduced at all. I wanna get the fuck out and not hear those background sounds.Character is so meh. Koushi is probably the only good, normal and mature character despite his age of 12. I don’t know what to say for Atena, because its a mixed of uncomfortability and unsettling action seen there. Same replies with Frey when I talked about Atena. Mineru is another character that is ok i suppose, but later on just makes it too uncomfortable as episode progresses. Kiriya just confuses me. A tomboy? Boy or girl? Literally a girl, but seeing her having more confession than Atena just feels like she’s also the main character. Serene is a fair character, but does not have a lot of screentime, literally just a semi-chunnibyou moon spirit, and I can agree on Koushi when Serene is confusing. Idk what to say for Sutea as Well, literally a mix of Atena and Kiriya but adds tsundere personality. And Btw, add an origin of each character besides Koushi, so we have a grasp on why they ended up in the dormitory before Koushi’s house is burnt. Why did i include Atena even if she has one in the episode? Her story isn’t enough, we don’t know why did she have that condition.Enjoyment, if you like Fanservice ecchi, fine, this is the one, but don’t prove yourself that sex is cool, because its not cool. Deal with it. And even if the anime is really bland, it still performs better than Kanojo mo Kanojo.Overall, not a big fan of ecchi. Just my first time.

There was some romantic hands between one of the girls and MC but that was also ignored !

enjoyable as fuck but first the negativesMegami-ryou no Ryoubo-kun is the most ecchi ecchi I have ever seen lmfao.every single trope u can think of is here and it is cringy as fuck.Im talking about the loli,the milf figure,the main girl that is not ""interested"" in men but is actually in love in the...main lead and the cringy airheaded girl  but that doesnt mean it isnt enjoyable,cringy?yes enjoyable?yes to that too.STORY:6/10I dont wanna dive deep into the story cause it\'s literally just a kid who lost his home,got adopted to this booba galore apartment and is now their sex toy.This kid then understands friendship yada yada u know what I mean.Then he falls in love with the main girl and that\'s that so I dont wanna talk too much about it.so 6/10 for story igART:4/10The art is

know what the sound criteria here in MAL is for but if its for the moaning then that\'s a 6/10Character:5/10I really enjoy the cast we are given here especially Kiriya,I find her really cute and not boring at all compared to the other characters here.Atena is cool I dont really mind her except the most overused trope in the world the ""I get a nosebleed when I am close to the opposite sex"" trope.Sutea is annoying for me but that\'s what Tsundere\'s are for so who cares.Serene is another cringy one cause it\'s the usual airhead but she\'s okay cause she\'s cute.Frey and Mineru are

and  the series is pretty good eye candy and pretty fun to watch.The characters aren't anything special but I like there designs and there...traits combined with there minor specs of character growth

you expect from a shitshow sorta anime that has tits flying all over the place every minute.Overall I'm having a fun time with this anime and of course I would be lieing if I said it was a 10/10 not

(2021)If Koushi stuck with going for Sutea a girl his age the show could have perhaps been more wholesome. Whilst the premise is kind the girls will eventually leave after university and then what? Koushi has more school left than they do.The main issue with the show isn't that Koushi has a crush on older girls it is the girls are just being plain creepy. Let us switch the show around and have an adolescent girl in a dormitory where older guys randomly kiss, hug and get naked in goofy situations because that would be a whole new show and one...with the police going after people situation. It is always funny how if it is a certain way round that it is 'okay. Don't get me wrong from a guys perspective the show is a dream living situation to an extent.The art style is not bad but honestly, it screams out to me that it is very much a Hentai style. I actually wouldn't be shocked if the animators worked on that sort of thing too. I would say it is generally good.The OP is actually a very catchy tune and would definitely fit a hentai series. The ED is standard and generally, everything else is textbook.The characters ultimately, regardless of the nice side of their stories don't matter since it is older for younger with the childhood friend ignored. The girls are all so inexperienced that they would be the most common targets for most Hentai.

The show tries hard to be wholesome but in the end, is very much a nearly Hentai show that is a bit creepy. It is a shame since Serene is great being a white-haired waifu but we know no more about her from start to finish really. Also, the maid outfits were spot on.5/10. A bit creepy. with the police going after people situation. It is always funny how if it is a certain way round that it is 'okay. Don't get me wrong from a guys perspective the show is a dream living situation to an extent.The art style is not bad but honestly, it screams out to me that it is very much a Hentai style. I actually wouldn't be shocked if the animators worked on that sort of thing too. I would say it is generally good.The OP is actually a very catchy tune and would definitely fit a hentai series. The ED is standard and generally, everything else is textbook.The characters ultimately, regardless of the nice side of their stories don't matter since it is older for younger with the childhood friend ignored. The girls are all so inexperienced that they would be the most common targets for most Hentai.

The only real twist on that in this is that the protagonist, Koushi, is a middle schooler. The circumstances for why he’s doing so is explained but doesn’t really matter. All that matters is that a mature for his age middle school boy is serving as the caretaker for a dorm full of especially eccentric college girls. And while I do say that he’s mature for...his age, it’s not to an absurd degree. He is very much still a middle schooler and thus the anime overall has pretty heavy shota/onee energy.The occupants of the dorm are pretty interesting in how much variety there is to how absurd they are. There’s a spectrum that goes from somewhat realistic to straight up supernatural, which I wasn’t really expecting. The most normal one is probably Atena. She’s just a regular caring girl with the exception that she can’t handle interacting with men at all. Over the course of the anime she seems to improve somewhat, though I wouldn’t really call it a character arc. Next on the normal ranking would be Frey, who is pretty much just an extreme cosplay freak that forces people into cosplay. After that would be Kiriya, a tomboy martial artist that breaks things when flustered and gets flustered really easily by shoujo manga and situations resembling those common in shoujo manga. Then Mineru, an energetic mad scientist that comes up with all sorts of elixirs that do all sorts of things, though they mainly seem to be variants of aphrodisiacs. Also, her room seems to have a giant lab that makes absolutely no sense space wise. Then there’s the stoic Serene, who I legit think may be an alien from the moon. The anime is somewhat nebulous about whether she’s just pretending to be one or actually is, but I’m very much leaning towards her actually being one. Wrapping back around in the strangeness scale, there’s Sutea, Koushi’s childhood friend who often comes to visit. She’s a tsundere with an extreme aversion to heat to the point she can’t stand touching other people.There’s enough here for all sorts of amusing and ecchi hijinks. The vast majority are centered around one or more of the girls interacting with Koushi, but there’s also some of the girls interacting with each other. There’s really not all that much of substance. There’s some relationship development between Koushi and each of Atena, Kiriya, and Sutea, but nothing too extreme. A bit of light drama at times but it glosses over it and long term it doesn’t really seem to be committing to much. Still, it knows what it wants to be and does a good job at that, but just the comedy and fanservice and are enough to make it pretty fun to watch. The ending is the type that tries to be a bit more serious, and does about as good of a job as you’d expect. It’s a satisfying enough way to end, though that comes from not really expecting too much.The art and animation are pretty good. The character designs were also really good considering the setting. The OP I thought was pretty good in terms of the song and visuals. The ED was just okay in both regards. The soundtrack wasn’t particularly remarkable. his age, it’s not to an absurd degree.

The soundtrack wasn’t particularly remarkable.', 'If you don\'t like ecchi harem, then don\'t watch it.Its ecchi comedy harem anime with a shota MC (12 y/o, lol). Its pretty generic overall, but excels in its over the top comedy, ""awkward"" characters and entertaining character dynamics.There is plenty of ecchi, most college-aged females appears to be absolutely ravenous predators (Heh, get it?), and the harem in particular are constantly embarrassing and/or sexually harassing MC by either walking around naked or absolutely drowning him in tits and ass.I always thought that the typical harem anime protagonist had the social awareness and maturity of a 12 y/o. But after watching Koushi in action,...I\'m now convinced that it´s even worse than that. Whereas the typical retarded beta harem protagonist ends up in envious situations, Koushi often ends up in pitiful situations. Turns out that seeing a 12 y/o trying his best at being a good boy is a lot less cringeworthy than seeing a 18 y/o guy doing it (or whatever the age of a typical harem protagonist is). All Koushi wants to do is to not live on the street and go to school, but in order to do so, he have to play ""dorm mother"" and endure being a plaything for his ""harem"".The ecchi is pretty direct and is over the top to a laughable degree. The trademark ecchi ""Accidents"" occasionally derail into entire lewd trainwrecks. The characters start out pretty simple, each can be summarized in 1-2 sentences. They get a bit more depth, but its mainly the ""pseudo big sister"" Atena and the violent tsundere childhood friend Sutea that experience any real character progression, but then again, what did you expect from a harem anime? One of the major plotlines are Atena and MC Koushis weird pseudo big sister-little brother relationship, and the ""tension"" between them (Typical Japan and its non-bloodrelated-sibling-relationships, am a right?)The girls main appeal (apart from tits and asses) is how awkward and extreme they are. Despite each of them being dysfunctional in their own way, they fit rather well together.The overall character dynamic is entertaining. There is always some stuff happening and the dorm girls (Mainly Atena) are constantly trying to ""Protect"" him from the other members whims, claiming him for their own. The tsundere peer Sutea, acts as the outsider/wildcard.Its visuals are about 7.5/10, nothing spectacular and mostly enjoyable to look at. The Music is fine. The voicework is quite good.It´s overall a pretty normal comedy harem anime. Apart from the indecent exposure, sexual harassment of minors, child labor and physically abuse from the tsundere friend. I\'m not quite sure why child labor is allowed, or why MC haven\'t been placed in an orphanage. But I am willing to handwave it as Japan having ""Strong Work Ethics"" and no child protective services whatsoever.Oh, and since the other reviews mention it too, I gotta give a heads up that there is some lewd moments with the loli childhood friend. But if your get to those parts, then you have already watched A LOT of ecchi moments with the 12 y/o shota and adult women, so it would be super hypocritical to get mad over the loli having a tense moment with a peer. Just saying.Overall rating: 6/10, worth a watch if you don\'t mind the tags, and want something easily digestible, but still a bit different entertainment.

At this point just make a hentai series. If it isn't quite obvious by the other reviews, the protagnist is way hella young to be surrounded by all these tits. Some might argue his age is 12 but i doubt that is even true. Bro has a body of a 9 year old and barely fits his clothes at times. Even so him being less than the age of 16 doesn't run away from the fact he is groomed by a bunch of hot big tittied women. It isn't fair. The first scene of the anime was just straight up...a pair of tits. Uncensored view of melons with fucking nipples. Absolutely beautiful. Nontheless the story was absolutely dogshit. Barely interesting to get me going. It is a hentai plot without the hentai, who the fuck wants to watch that? An ecchi anime should be done only for the comedic sense or to put spice to a horror gruesome scene to make it more realistic. The jokes were just terrible I barely connected with the comedy. It's just a 12 year old kid tripping and falling onto some tits maybe some pussy as well. That's it, that's the joke lmao. I literally forced myself to watch 3 episodes of this shit just to make a review here. I may seem salty but probably because all 18 years of my life I ain't got as much tits as this. It might just be my jealousy.It's okay, not interesting nor funny at all. watch it once one piece is fucking over. oh wait that is fucking NEVER a pair of tits.

This has all the hallmarks of a solid 7 star series, but instead I give it only a 3. So why is it that this title deserves to be brought down so far? Well...- Story & ThemeThe story revolves around... Actually, let's put a pin in this and do the other categories first this time.- Characters & WritingThis is one of those titles where the characters feel more unique than just stuck in their tropes. Also, most of them get a dose of character development which I always enjoy. They can...get a bit over-the-top with their traits and you're never lured into thinking that this is a realistic anime in any way. The writing is cliché but functional for what it is.- Style & PresentationThe style is good and looks nice most of the time, although I must say that the animation makes it look like a slide show a lot of the time. Clearly the focus was put on making this look good with as little work as possible. The intro theme is perhaps above average, but not by much and the outro is forgettable.- Story & ThemeSo... The story revolves around a twelve year old boy who ends up in a girls dormitory where he is put in a number of harem situations that are clearly not suitable for a child of that age. What makes this worse is that the girls are actively seeking these situations. Had the age of the protagonist been raised to 18 this would have been an unusually watchable slice of life ecchi harem anime, but now it only comes off as predatory. It's the kind of anime I imagine the voice actors leave off their resumé and only do because they need to pay the rent.- ConclusionYeah, don't bother with this. I dropped it by the fifth episode and feel no need to watch further. Judging from the other reviews it doesn't seem to get better so just stay away from this and find something with a grown up protagonist if you're looking for ecchi. get a bit over-the-top with their traits and you're never lured into thinking that this is a realistic anime in any way.

A 12 year old boy getting repeatedly molested."" than I guess this is the anime for you, but for everyone else... There\'s not a whole lot of reason to watch it over any other bargin bin harem anime because the plot is just so interminably boring, basic and played out. There is the occasionally good joke or scenario, I chuckled a couple of times during the time Koushi had to dress up as a girl, but by in large most of the humor falls flat...because you can see the punchlines coming in like an industrial truck in an isekai.But like... C\'mon, no one is watching this for the plot, they\'re watching for the PLOT! And how does it fare on that front? Well... Perhaps, I\'m a bit old fashioned, but I generally think that your waifus having interesting and thought out personalities adds to the sexiness of a character because otherwise, I\'d just watch a hentai. And the girls are simply not that interesting. From just an art perspective, you can certainly do worse, it\'s well animated, and appealing even if the designs are basic and find the hyper saturated colors of the main cast to be incredibly garish and unappealing, but understand that many would disagree with that assessment.If you do find the art appealing enough to watch for the fan service alone, I must warn that you have to have a very high tolerance for lolicon. I was generally able to ignore the shotacon stuff as the main character is never that sexualized, but a fellow middleschooler is added to the harem cast and like... It\'s pretty bad. At first, I was glad we were getting someone of a similar age to the main character, thinking that it would pivot to the other women supporting a fun puppy dog relationship between the two. But like... Sutea is probably given the most sexually explicit material in the cast actually, and it can be skin crawling to sit through at times.Final verdict, just watch porn out of 10. because you can see the punchlines coming in like an industrial truck in an isekai.But like...
