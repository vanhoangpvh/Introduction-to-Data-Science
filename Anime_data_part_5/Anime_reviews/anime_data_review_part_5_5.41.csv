Android Ana Maico 2010,https://myanimelist.net/anime/810/Android_Ana_Maico_2010,"[""Android Ana Maico 2010 is another of those odd little shows that I seem to have a talent for finding. The anime is based on the Maico 2010 manga series by Toshimitsu Shimizu (who also wrote the original manga for 801 T.T.S. Airbats and Red Prowling Devil), which ran in Young King Ours magazine from 1997 to 1998. The anime was aired on WOWOWs Anime Complex omnibus block alongside The Adventures of the Mini Godesses and Neoranga from April to Septemeber 1998.The story is very simple. Japanese radio is on the decline, so the various stations are trying to think of new and exciting methods...to get people to tune in. Enter Maico, Japan's newest radio DJ - with a big difference. Maico is unlike other DJs as she is a state-of-the-art android, and her first appearance in the anime makes this fact very clear.As Maico is a very new android though, she has had very little contact with humans. Because of this she doesn't understand concepts like love and hate, friendship, rivalry, etc. Her work as a DJ has the dual purpose of boosting ratings and hopefully bringing her one step closer to being human. Also, because she's very new, she has no knowledge of how a radio show is produced.The story follows an episodic format for the most part, something which works well with this type of show. Many of the episodes are fairly lighthearted, and it's only the last few episodes that stray from this format, being more serious in tone, and following on from each other.The art for Android Ana Maico 2010 is very derivative of it's manga predecessor, and rather dated at that. The character designs definitely show their age in comparison with some of the more &quot;realistic&quot; designs we see today. Animation is also fairly mediocre, and is sometimes jerky and uneven. Also, because almost all of the show takes place in a radio studio, the animators never really got a chance to show what they could do.Sound is another area where the series shows it's age. Unlike the animation though, the fact that the series is about a radio show actually helps with the sound, especially as the various effects and noises used in the radio broadcast need to be inckuded in the anime.There's not much to say about characters. The only real character worth mentioning is Maico, as the rest of the cast were no more than a collection of glorified side characters. However, the cast as a whole were enjoyable enough, especially with their various antics and shenanigans.As I said at the start, Maico is a bit of an odd show, but it's not a bad one. It does fall short in comparison to the manga, as a lot of the more serious elements were purposely removed (Maico originally being built as a sex doll for example, never gets mentioned in the anime). It's a quirky little series that may or may not appeal to people, but your enjoyment of the show will probably depend on how seriously you take it. to get people to tune in.

Except for a few episodes at the end, the show is also all one-shots and it is enjoyable at that.Art: The entire show save for one episode all take place in one setting and besides the main cast there are few extra characters, so with this you figure there would be a lot of detail. You would be wrong the animation and art style are plain.Sound:...The opening and ending themes are okay with the first opening just being sounds and the ending being normal romantic ending song. The voice acting is done well you fell the seiyuu get to know their characters and grow with them. Finally, the background music is pleasant much like the show.Characters: The characters are the focus of the show and how they interact with Maico who is herself a normal robot trying to understand humanity and in that, they succeed. A few characters get are annoying at the beginning but as you get to know them, they grow on you.Enjoyment: This was a fun show, I enjoyed watching Maico try to learn and the end was very out there yet worked.Overall: This series takes place in two years from the time of writing this(2008) and we are yet to have androids so this show is fun but bad in art, enjoyable yet plain. A solid 7/10. The opening and ending themes are okay with the first opening just being sounds and the ending being normal romantic ending song.

There were already a few that recommended it, so I forgot about it. However, I've been thinking about Maico a lot since then. It truly is the hiddenest of gems of 90s TV anime.The episodic nature of the series allows it to have small plot-lines that are quickly forgotten, but there are many continuity details that provide style and character to the story. Also, the stars of the show are definitely the characters, some more than others, and they have stereotypes that you hardly ever see in other animes....They are extremely flawed too: angry, lazy, greedy, violent, bullies, anti-social, indifferent, talent-less, egoistic, unhealthy; just very toxic personalities. Maico, on the other hand, is the sweetest and most innocent character ever. The show is very funny too! The format will remind many about the The Office. During the last episodes, some of them take a serious, emotional and sad tone (Evangelion-inspired maybe?)Art is late 90s but it clearly isn't top quality; it has a sort of amateur doujin feeling to it, which I kind of like as it is representative of its era. Additionally, most of the backgrounds are CG designed, that will definitely remind you of many PS1 games. It's a pretty unique detail. Overall, the popularity and production quality of the real-life show is ironically similar to the radio show that they work at.I usually don't write about the music in animes, but both the OP and ED feel surprisingly nostalgic for some reason.I'm not a huge fan of TV anime; I prefer OVAs by far, but Maico and the cast managed to be entertaining enough for 24 episodes. Only one or two felt somewhat boring, but that happens in every show ever.

Akai Ito,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8713/Akai_Ito,"['According to Eastern legend, destined lovers are bound by a red string of fate -- ""Akai Ito"" in Japanese. In this animated short, director Kazuhiko Okushita cleverly uses a single red string to illustrate the life of a man and the woman to whom his string leads him.MAL\'s rubric, split into categories like ""Story"" and ""Character,"" is useless for an animation like this.  It\'s four minutes long, with no named characters, no voice acting, and exactly one color:  red.  Two, if you count the white background.  This minimalism is the anime\'s greatest strength, for it allows no distractions from the message:...that life is beautiful.  Unpredictably, painfully, miraculously beautiful.Flawless in its simplicity and a genuine pleasure to watch, Okushita\'s ""Akai Ito"" is a work of art I cannot recommend highly enough to anyone with a human soul. that life is beautiful.  Unpredictably, painfully, miraculously beautiful.Flawless in its simplicity and a genuine pleasure to watch, Okushita\'s ""Akai Ito"" is a work of art I cannot recommend highly enough to anyone with a human soul.', 'As other people say, this isn\'t some random string used for the animation. The red string was picked specifically because, based on Eastern culture, a red string is tied around the two people that are destined to meet. It originated from Chinese culture where it is said that Yuè Xià Lǎorén, the lunar god of marriages, ties a string of destiny around two people that are considered soulmates. Akai Ito should be praised for bringing attention to a cultural belief that I think is incredibly fascinating and romantic.Though, however strong Akai Ito is in that respect, this anime was bound to have its inevitable pitfalls....See, this anime paints you a picture with only a white backdrop and a single red string. Which can be quite impressive when you see the sheer detail put into this project, but with this amount of detail, you\'ll find that some images don\'t exactly sync in your mind. I had to re-watch a couple of times because my eyes were not telling me what was on screen. This was no fault to Akai Ito, given the inherent design of the project itself, but it was a bit confusing when I first watched.It also shows a story that has no characters, but only silhouettes that give the animation an almost lacking personality. I\'ll always think back to this as, ""The anime with the red string,"" but I couldn\'t give much more of a description for it, given that there really isn\'t anything else to grab onto character-wise. In other words, you\'ll come for the art and not the story that\'s given to you through the anime itself.All-in-all, it was fair. Like I said, without any characters or tangible story, Akai Ito can be easily forgotten. However, this is something that comes naturally to the anime given that there\'s only so much you can do with a single string. In that respect, it\'s very impressive. In any other department, it\'s something to be watched once, enjoyed, then left for someone else. See, this anime paints you a picture with only a white backdrop and a single red string.

This film places a creative spin on that proverb, using a single red thread to animate a love story.In just four minutes Akai Ito manages to work through the romantic ups and downs of a couple. There is a confession, dating, separation and finally a resolution. There are no words or color variety, just an unbreakable string with a life of its own telling the story of the people it connects together.This is minimalism art at its finest telling...a full story with few resources, and it deserves to be viewed by more people for it's beautiful simplicity. a full story with few resources, and it deserves to be viewed by more people for it's beautiful simplicity.""]"
Altered Carbon: Resleeved,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40613/Altered_Carbon__Resleeved,"['In a word: Meh.The story is bland, boring and predictable. And the characters are not better. Also, as a reader of the novels and fan of the franchise: That´s NOT Takeshi Kovacs.Envoys are not just combat specialists, they are infiltrators with an uncanny sense sense for body language. They´re supposed to be amazing character readers that smell treason a mile away and can understand the motivations and desires of every person in the room after just 5mins of conversation. And then use that info to manipulate everyone around them. And here there are SO MANY things go over the MC´s head that is not even...funny. Makes no sense at all.Honestly, this anime would have worked better if it was just a story taking place in Altered Carbon universe but using different characters and not Kovacs.Also, there´s a metric ton of fridge logic and plot holes that make zero sense the moment you stop to think about them. Like (no spoilers): Where does the bad guy get his army of cyborg ninjas from? Why is stack backup, which is a staple of the Altered Carbon universe, not even mentioned? Surely if the big bad guy has an army at his disposal he can afford stack backup. Also, tattoo technology that is only known by a single person on the whole planet?The art is decent though I do not understand why so many people are praising it. It´s good CGI but nothing spectacular. It reminds me of the art style of the Telltale games for some reason. funny.

It is a pretty well made cyberpunk anime with tons and tons of action sequences (all of which are well made), a lot of blood, just a little bit of nudity in the beginning (that too of background characters), and a good pick for a nice time-pass.Right from the beginning you can see some clear influence of Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell\'s environment. Now I know the cyberpunk as a genre has some predefined setting for a world, but not necessarily all of...them has to follow the same visuals. For example, the Deus Ex game franchise is one of the best known entries in the cyberpunk world, and its visuals have very little common element with the well known Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell franchises. For some reason, whenever we see a new cyberpunk story, the world seems to be eerily familiar with the later two. The upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 game also has that issue. Now this is not a bad thing, but it would\'ve been better if different cyberpunk stories have unique world setting of their own.Ok, back to the point. Without mentioning the name of this anime, one look at the world portrayed in it and you might think it is from Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell. Even the music played during some parts sounds a lot like Kenji Kawai\'s soundtracks for GitS. If it works for you, it\'s good. If not, then it won\'t be a problem since its not exactly a strong suit of this anime.The characters can be divided into two types: mains who rarely get hurt, and fill-up side characters who are there to die. No it\'s not a spoiler, I\'m not saying everyone of the main characters survives till the end. It\'s just that you probably even forget the faces of the side characters once they are dead. As for the main ones, there is not much character development to be found here. Actually now that I think about it, no character gets a development except for one (or if you really look into it, two may be).The story is not its strong point either. There are a few twists which made the story to be ""ok"". However, the strong part of this anime is its amazing animation and some freaking good action sequences. This is CGI done right. With breathtaking visuals and good direction of actions scenes (which takes a big part of the anime, but not enough to make it irritating), this anime is a treat for the eye.Take this as just a time-pass anime with enjoyable elements, and not much brain-works needed while watching it.

Resleeved was an awesome little addition to the series.The story is interesting, mixing the detective plot of the first half of the first season with a yakuza power struggle. Then they decide to throw an interesting twist in there that capitalizes on the world it is set in.Visually, this is a magnificent feat. CG-anime animation that actually looks good throughout the whole thing and manages to flow like real movement? How did they pull that off? Netflix has been doing a lot of that style lately, and they really hit...their stride with Resleeved. It looks great.That fluid 3D animation tells right into some really well-choreographed fights that feel ripped straight out of Sega's Yakuza videogame series. The fights are intense and hit heavy, but still show off skilled and intricate fighting.Overall, Altered Carbon: Resleeved is a successful venture for the series into a new medium that expertly uses that move to create something worth adding to the universe. their stride with Resleeved.

This is not the best jumping on point as I learned when I watched it. So bearing that in mind my review may be biased as I have no see the show. But in any case let’s begin.Story: The story is generic at best about to undercover badass people protecting a mafia tattoo girl from being assassinated. The way the events play out are very predictable and has nothing to engage you into the story, at points they even brush by important scenes for the characters involved making it dull and irritating to watch....If you want a stereotypical undercover yakuza story with a sci-fi twist then you can watch this and forget it the next day.Characters: The characters bored me and even irritated me. The two adult leads are dull as anything. The only thing interesting about them is their relationship but it’s barely covered though it might be in the show. I know they are probably from the show because when ever they said their name their was a pause like the audience is meant to gasp in excitement. Then the girl was just a brat who constantly got on my nerves with her constant yells especially in the dub. The villain isn’t that interesting very clutches moustache twirling villain.Animation and Sound: Now this is where this movie excels. Although its 3D it fits very well with what they wanted to give us. Cool action scenes. The action was just awesome with how they handled the 3D and the camera during action scenes. Due to the fact the antagonists are ninja the action was unique with each of the fights presented. However I found the music to be very generic with none of it making me hyped for the action nor for the events that took place.Overall:5This is just generic with the story, characters and music. The only thing that can be seen as great or ‘unique’ are the fight scenes. So if you want to watch a generic sci-fi movie then you can watch this for the cool action.

There\'s one caveat to take into consideration before I start the review proper; this is my first piece of media from the Altered Carbon franchise so if I get anything wrong, am missing information or I misrepresent something, know full well it\'s because I\'m completely ignorant about the franchise. But I do know about anime, so I\'ll be reviewing it standalone (I\'ve also read that you don\'t need any prior knowledge to get into it so I guess this approach works anyway).Being a...cyberpunk anime Altered Carbon: Resleeved comes with a lot of the visual and narrative short-hand of a typical cyberpunk work; neon lights filled with sexed up ads, dingy and rainy streets filled with graffiti and trash, the extreme advantages of the rich over the poor because of the hyper-capitalistic society and so on. What sets this one apart from others is its premise. Though bodies can be enhanced with technology, they mostly remain flesh and blood. These bodies are called ""skins"". But due to technological innovations, one\'s mind can be digitized and put into a ""stack"", meaning that as long as the mind survives, you can effectively become immortal if you have the means to do so. This is honestly quite the interesting premise that goes under explored I feel, although this is probably something the main franchise has explored at length. The story chooses to instead focus on is a Yakuza succession story, with a cyberpunk twist. The story follows a Yakuza from a rival clan, Takeshi, tasked to find and protect a tattoo artist Holly alongside Gena, a policewoman who also has business with her. I don\'t have too much to say about the story since it\'s pretty straight forward. It isn\'t really boring though since there\'s enough intrigue to keep you engaged. I don\'t have much to say about the main characters either since Takeshi comes off as a ""Bad ass punch man who smokes a lot"", the villain as ""Ambitious scheming successor"" and on and on. I don\'t like to reduce characters this way since there\'s more going on with them which might be followed up on in any future entry, but for now, they serve their role.The real meat of this ONA is the artwork, and its atmosphere. The visuals are fully done in 3D in a cel shaded style; typical for anime. Techniques to limit the frame count haven\'t been used so everything animates quite smoothly. The character designs also work quite well in 3D since facial features are a bit more pronounced allowing for more natural feeling mouth and face movements, all the while allowing for more diverse faces in general. Like I mentioned before, the movie is cel shaded, but an interesting lighting technique is used allowing for shadows to have a softer and more layered look, while keeping the distinctive blocks of shadow that this style is known for. Textures have also been implemented well to give the character designs that extra pop, all resulting in a slick and sexy package. A strange choice to me would be the more realistically rendered effects such as blood and smoke since blood splatter becomes a texture on the characters and environments, but that\'s a nit pick. What was a little disappointing was the background work, but it\'s not because it was bad. They were actually done really well, having a more sterile and cleanly lit look to them. The disappointment comes because the first 30 or so minutes are spent in this beautiful and colorful cyberpunk city that feels so lived in it\'s immersive. The rest of the movie is set in a Yakuza styled hotel which is, while beautiful, is  quite boring compared to the previous setting. That seems to be more a story issue though. I don\'t have too much to say about the fight scenes, they kick ass!In the end, Altered Carbon: Resleeved is a little by the numbers in terms of story and characters, but you\'ll care enough about them to watch all the way through. This movie is more about the art on display, and I can say that it succeeds overwhelmingly. Though its strong overall, it\'s kinda weakened because for the most part, we\'ve been there and done that. There are some genuinely interesting ideas that could have been explored because of the premise, but the movie leaves you to speculate on your own. If you absolutely love Altered Carbon as a franchise, you\'ll probably be watching this one anyway, but if you\'re on the fence, I\'ll nudge you on and say that the art impressed me as an outsider. To outsiders like me, check it out if you have time. To the 3DCG fan, it\'s a definite must watch. A side note: I\'m not sure if this is it\'s own thing or going to be a longer series since a there\'s a sequel hook at the end. But as far as first impressions go, its a good one. cyberpunk anime Altered Carbon: Resleeved comes with a lot of the visual and narrative short-hand of a typical cyberpunk work; neon lights filled with sexed up ads, dingy and rainy streets filled with graffiti and trash, the extreme advantages of the rich over the poor because of the hyper-capitalistic society and so on.

This is honestly quite the interesting premise that goes under explored I feel, although this is probably something the main franchise has explored at length. The story chooses to instead focus on is a Yakuza succession story, with a cyberpunk twist. The story follows a Yakuza from a rival clan, Takeshi, tasked to find and protect a tattoo artist Holly alongside Gena, a policewoman who also has business with her. I don\'t have too much to say about the story since it\'s pretty straight forward. It isn\'t really boring though since there\'s enough intrigue to keep you engaged. I don\'t have much to say about the main characters either since Takeshi comes off as a ""Bad ass punch man who smokes a lot"", the villain as ""Ambitious scheming successor"" and on and on. I don\'t like to reduce characters this way since there\'s more going on with them which might be followed up on in any future entry, but for now, they serve their role.The real meat of this ONA is the artwork, and its atmosphere. The visuals are fully done in 3D in a cel shaded style; typical for anime. Techniques to limit the frame count haven\'t been used so everything animates quite smoothly. The character designs also work quite well in 3D since facial features are a bit more pronounced allowing for more natural feeling mouth and face movements, all the while allowing for more diverse faces in general. Like I mentioned before, the movie is cel shaded, but an interesting lighting technique is used allowing for shadows to have a softer and more layered look, while keeping the distinctive blocks of shadow that this style is known for. Textures have also been implemented well to give the character designs that extra pop, all resulting in a slick and sexy package. A strange choice to me would be the more realistically rendered effects such as blood and smoke since blood splatter becomes a texture on the characters and environments, but that\'s a nit pick. What was a little disappointing was the background work, but it\'s not because it was bad. They were actually done really well, having a more sterile and cleanly lit look to them. The disappointment comes because the first 30 or so minutes are spent in this beautiful and colorful cyberpunk city that feels so lived in it\'s immersive. The rest of the movie is set in a Yakuza styled hotel which is, while beautiful, is  quite boring compared to the previous setting. That seems to be more a story issue though. I don\'t have too much to say about the fight scenes, they kick ass!In the end, Altered Carbon: Resleeved is a little by the numbers in terms of story and characters, but you\'ll care enough about them to watch all the way through. This movie is more about the art on display, and I can say that it succeeds overwhelmingly. Though its strong overall, it\'s kinda weakened because for the most part, we\'ve been there and done that. There are some genuinely interesting ideas that could have been explored because of the premise, but the movie leaves you to speculate on your own. If you absolutely love Altered Carbon as a franchise, you\'ll probably be watching this one anyway, but if you\'re on the fence, I\'ll nudge you on and say that the art impressed me as an outsider. To outsiders like me, check it out if you have time. To the 3DCG fan, it\'s a definite must watch. A side note: I\'m not sure if this is it\'s own thing or going to be a longer series since a there\'s a sequel hook at the end. But as far as first impressions go, its a good one.', 'One of the highest points of the movie is that you don\'t have to know the series to understand what\'s going on. The few points that are taken from there are explained shortly, so you can enjoy a nice movie with nice characters. (Obviously you can enjoy it more if you know all the background building the universe.)In the other hand, the movie finds it\'s ruin in being only that. Not an exceptional storytelling, character building or animation, finding it\'s way in a very predictable ""recipe"" sort of events.If I had to give my review in only a few words, reflecting my overall feeling while...watching it, I\'d go with ""Altered Carbon: A Telltale Games Series"". watching it, I\'d go with ""Altered Carbon: A Telltale Games Series"".', '""meh"" Forgettable at bestThe art is honestly not bad, but the story is incredibly bland and boring.

It is CGI but we are not talking about the quality you get with shows like High Score Girl where it has been done well and thought out. Altered Carbon here has absolutely dreadful CGI. The characters...when they standstill are great to look at and have the detail. When they move they are, however, clunky and all over the place. The combat looks dreadful because of this also. Some of them walk funny whilst others can barely function. The detail itself is good but that is about all you can say. It has a style reminiscent of a certain game series on a planet Pandora.

It's really the only reason that I'm writing this review.This was super meh. There's very little characterization, relying heavily on the TV show to even understand who Takeshi Kovacs is. What is Harlan's World? dunno. Why is he in trouble there? dunno. Why did he come there? Well, to get the Yakuza off his back. Why? dunno.The art design is good, to be honest. The CG facial expressions are lackluster. But it felt 100% like a world that Takeshi Kovacs would be in so as far as environment goes it's good.I saw the plot coming early...but that's not terrible.

Arata Kangatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16518/Arata_Kangatari,"[""The concept of two people switching places in each others worlds is interesting, particularly when nobody recognizes the person as being a different person. Problem is you really can't sympathize with the main characters when the conflict that shows up between the characters in the series is completely unrealistic and not grounded in how people would react in reality. In fact, it seems horribly forced just so the series could have some kind of conflict to it.For example, the main antagonist was bullied when he was in middle school and he's just getting back to living a normal life only to find himself bullied by...another person. While it is true that people do bully because they are jealous of other people, Kadowaki's animosity towards Arata doesn't seem any bit grounded in reality, particularly since the two used to be friends back in middle school. I say this because he got angry at something so trivial. Even though his father is the way he is, it honestly doesn't justify his personality problems as well as his persecution complex.Another example is the conflict between Kannagi and Akachi. It's an argument that could have been resolved through simple conversation to find out what the actual situation entailed. Perhaps that is one of the major things that is lacking in this series, the inability of the characters to actually communicate with each other. One or two is understandable, but this is the majority of the cast that lack in the communication department. Which is why all of the conflict ends up being forced.Because the conflict is forced, what amounts to an interesting idea ends up being bogged down. The story line is also bogged down with this need to have characters submit to another character. The whole concept is bothersome even with how Kannagi eventually puts it to Arata. It almost feels as if it is down playing war and trying to stuff it into a bag where the victor ends up being able to win without killing. Which in turn is completely unrealistic.On top of this Arata... the one from a modern world... is horribly annoying with his poor pity me attitude. I know that he was abused, but while we see the bullying occurring, the justification for the bullying ends up being non-existent as there seems to be no realistic reason to justify Kadowaki going after Arata. Which means that the bullying is thrown in there to make Arata come across as a character needing to grow and not because the creator thought out the plot device enough.As for my enjoyment...

I am happy that this part of the show was totally along the manga storyline, which I find quite enjoyable. There are few bad parts of the series, but nothing extravagantly bad, I believe.STORY: Story is pretty much cliche, which I find to be one of the ""bad parts"". It is a typical shounen ""I wanna save the world"" storyline, so nothing new. Some powers do seem refreshing and there is some character growth (I believe especially when it comes to Kannagi),...but overall the idea is pretty much already used up in countless of similar shows which air every season. I do like the setting and the intersection of two worlds (even though this is deja vu also), so I can\'t say that I am a total hater of the storyline. It is not refreshing or innovative, but it is not boring either.ART & SOUND: I gave high marks for both of these themes. Arata Kangatari has a typical bishounen art, I believe, so it isn\'t hard on the eyes. Body proportions, scenery, weapon and fight scenes are pretty much well done and manga is drawn nicely. It is not really Pikaso\'s artwork, but I don\'t find any great faults when it comes to art style. Sound is pretty good as well, imho. I really loved the opening scene (which is rare, I tend to skip them a lot).CHARACTER: If I had to choose, I would say that characters are my favorite parts of this series. There are some really dull characters, but majority of them is quite enjoyable and easy to relate to (hence the mark 9, not 10). The dull characters are the main pair, Arata and Kadowaki. Arata does grow as the series progress and when he peels out of his whiny skin, he becomes interesting as well. Kadowaki, on the other hand, hasn\'t witnessed so much character growth so far. I have to bring to light Kannagi, Kugura and Yataka though, as they are really interesting in my opinion. Especially Kugura, whose story is seen in manga, because he depicts real problems that everyday human can relate to, insecurities and complexes. Another very interesting part when it comes to characters is Kannagi-Yataka relationship, as it is comedic and encouraging in the same time.ENJOYMENT: When it comes to enjoyment, I gave it 8/10. The mark is pretty high, mostly because Arata Kangatari can get your adrenaline high in some moments and it is quite enjoyable. On the other hand, there is nothing new, therefore it didn\'t receive 9 or 10. Storyline can become repetitive and main ideas fall into the cliche category, which can become nerve wrecking sometimes. But as the series progress, you can really get to like characters and forgive most of the storyline faults for both storylines (Earth and Amawakuni). but overall the idea is pretty much already used up in countless of similar shows which air every season.

The idea of switching roles with a different character, in a different world gives a refreshing perspective on the characters and you can feel their reactions and experiences because of this. However, the story progression is sometimes slow and the fight scenes are kinda dull. But that aside, its not a bad storyline.Art:Fair (about a 6)the art style is kinda generic, like what you might expect in most...anime, but it isnt bad. The character animations are sometimes stagnant and you get the ""moving mouth"" talk scenes, but that isnt too often. The main reason i give it this score for the art is because you can tell the animation is lacking in an"" intense"" fight scene. But you will find that the backgrounds are done nicely and that helps quite a bit.Sound:Fair ( about a 6)the sound of the main characters are fine, and actually rather suits them though sometimes there can be a lot of screaming which you may or may not find annoying. The supporting characters, well some of them didnt sound too pretty. The OST is not too bad, it has a badass ending theme for the first part, the second half....still good, but not as appealing, since these are both OLDCODEX  songs, you will find yourself subconsciously singing them in your head, i know i did. Other than that, the other music played in the backgrounds were rather forgettable, not really bad, you just are just apathetic to it.Characters:Very Good (about an 8)the characters is probably the strong point of this series. not necessarily because each character is done quite amazingly or that they are extremely dynamic, but their relations to other characters is wonderful. Some people try to say that Arata is a wuss or that these characters are annoying, but i disagree. Arata\'s character is done very well. I mean, i dont think you will be all macho and brave if you just suddenly dropped into a strange, foreign world. Of course you will be scared and freaking out, i know i would, and especially all the hell they put him through. But because of this, you can really see his psychological state and it was enjoying to watch him make decisions and take decisive action. The only character i kinda have issues with is Kadowaki and thats mainly because he really REALLY has some serious issues (you will understand it if you watche, or had watched the show), but maybe, a second season could clear that up. The remaining characters are done quite nicely, and you just have to find Kotoha adorable and sweet. However, like i mentioned earlier, the Bonds or relations between characters is this anime\'s best appeal. I can say that the background stories for each character and how it is carried out in the show is top-notch. You can understand why characters cling onto other characters and you understand each character\'s motives (despite how absurd) very clearly. Heck, i would watch the show just for that.Enjoyment:Very Good (about an 8)this is a rather enjoyable series to watch. most of the reasons have been stated, but i shall reiterate. To see how the characters react in this foreign world is great to see, especially since its done, rather realistically. Next, as a result, watching each character go through different psychological states adds flare to this show and makes the story progression feasible. Lastly, mentioned before, the interactions and background stories for characters is great and likely, most anyone would enjoy it.Overall:Good (about a 7)overall this isnt a bad anime, but dont take my opinions for granted, just watch. its not the most amazing anime i have seen,but its one thats likely to give you some entertainment and a few laughs here and there. The thing about this series, is when you watch it, dont try to be too critical or harsh, just go with the flow and enjoy.The storyline, characters, andeverything else, taken together as a whole, makes this a rather fun series to watch. though i will say...it can get kinda slow here and there and sometimes the characters do get you pissy, but thats not the whole show.Thank you for reading this review and i hoped it helped out. anime, but it isnt bad.

It's one of my favorite mangas, and I was excited to see an anime was going out. It was disappointing.Sure, in the anime Arata is still a guy who wants to win without killing, but he isn't that much of a wimp.Besides, in the anime the relations between the characters are worked out way better, for example between Akachi and Kannagi.The main thing that bothered me is that they completely cut out my favorite character who was in fact part of the main cast; a crossdressing female. The reason she is crossdressing is because she is from the hime clan but doesn't...have healing powers. This will eventually end up in a much larger plot involving the real world. In the manga there actually happens more in the real world too, making everything a lot more interesting. Will this still happen in the second season? Possibly.

The fantasy elements don't feel completely contrived, and the characters are above average on the believability scale.  The main character is never the whiny little baby that some people will portray him as (though he does have some issues), and he does grow and change as a person throughout the show.To those who found Kadowaki's hatred unbearable, I can only say this:  I found it very true to life.  Hatred seldom follows a logic others would understand (a concept that Jigoku Shoujo explores both thoroughly and believably).  Someone may hate you for the...smallest of slights, for being kind to them, or even for no reason at all.

I could look at the characters as friends, I could understand their decisions, and I could enjoy the story that was presented. I won\'t say it wasn\'t kind of childishly optimistic at times (for example, how easy some Shos submitted to him), but I didn\'t mind it.> Storyline & Setting 9/10Okay, a lot of people seemed to have trouble with this anime because they found Kadowaki\'s reason for hating Arata dumb. However, I\'d like to say that...to me it seems that the reason wasn\'t only that Arata let him win in a race. He was venting out his anger on Arata. (Kadowaki\'s family background, his competitive nature, never being cared about, etc.)It\'s indeed kind of funny that they brought their drama to an other dimension, but I guess it made it interesting that way.The story advanced maybe a bit too fast, some things weren\'t focused on enough (like fantasy world Arata), but you can\'t blame them, they only had 12 episodes to work with (and a pretty tight budget).I could accept everybody\'s reasoning. Some people might disagree with me on this, but if you don\'t like something, then you don\'t. Personally, I find it awesome.I also really like the whole trust and believe concept. It was a really good idea, and I think they made it all work out really well.The only reason I give it 9 and not 10, is because, apparently, it failed to convey its meaning to the general public. I don\'t know how, because I could totally get with the flow...>Soundtracks & Seiyuus 10/10The. Best. Ever.The soundtrack was composed by Ko Otani, and I was literally shaking sometimes, it was THAT good.The voice actors also did a terrific job. I could have imagined someone else for Kadowaki, but it was okay. Arata\'s voice actor also helped the anime a lot.The opening and ending themes were all wonderful, I listen to them a lot. I think they match the genre of the anime pretty well. Maybe a bit too generic for some people, but I found them perfectly fitting and epic. ( Ah, and in the final episode, where the second ED just floated in ;u; )>Graphics & Art 6~10+/10Hmmm... on one hand, the graphics were out of this world beautiful. The colors, the whole world that it was set in, the outfits, the character designs, everything was mesmerizing. I really, really loved those. The Sousei no Hinowa scene... I can\'t even describe it was so breathtakingly gorgeous. 10+/10On the other hand, ... uuugghhhhh... I was so, so, so sorry to see this anime go from absolutely acceptable and colorful to ""holy hell how can their nose be that big"" and ""how many frames is that, 1 frame / 3 seconds or what?""But that was really the budget\'s fault, I believe. 6/10>Characters 9/10This seems to be the biggest point to nitpick on when it comes to haters. They say Arata needs to grow a pair, Kadowaki needs to chill his tits, etc. etc. I think these guys are realistic, a lot more realistic than your average shounen heroes  I liked how in the final episode Arata didn\'t just say he didn\'t hate Kadowaki, or anything. Indeed it could help a lot if the two talked it out - or so I thought, until the final episode. You simply >can\'t< negotiate with Kadowaki. He is way too obsessed with smashing Arata already.The one and only thing that I could nitpick about, is that I couldn\'t find a favorite character. None of them stood out much to me, I liked the whole thing in general a lot more than I liked each character individually. (Though this also kinda means that there wasn\'t any character that I didn\'t like. This could perhaps be the reason why so many people say that the show didn\'t keep them interested...?)Overall I give the show a 9. In my heart it will always be 10+/10 absolute favorite, but I will also take into account that it had its ... hmm, ""interesting"" parts and that the graphics went full retard after the first few episodes (unfortunately) to me it seems that the reason wasn\'t only that Arata let him win in a race. He was venting out his anger on Arata. (Kadowaki\'s family background, his competitive nature, never being cared about, etc.)It\'s indeed kind of funny that they brought their drama to an other dimension, but I guess it made it interesting that way.The story advanced maybe a bit too fast, some things weren\'t focused on enough (like fantasy world Arata), but you can\'t blame them, they only had 12 episodes to work with (and a pretty tight budget).I could accept everybody\'s reasoning. Some people might disagree with me on this, but if you don\'t like something, then you don\'t. Personally, I find it awesome.I also really like the whole trust and believe concept. It was a really good idea, and I think they made it all work out really well.The only reason I give it 9 and not 10, is because, apparently, it failed to convey its meaning to the general public. I don\'t know how, because I could totally get with the flow...>Soundtracks & Seiyuus 10/10The. Best. Ever.The soundtrack was composed by Ko Otani, and I was literally shaking sometimes, it was THAT good.The voice actors also did a terrific job. I could have imagined someone else for Kadowaki, but it was okay. Arata\'s voice actor also helped the anime a lot.The opening and ending themes were all wonderful, I listen to them a lot. I think they match the genre of the anime pretty well. Maybe a bit too generic for some people, but I found them perfectly fitting and epic. ( Ah, and in the final episode, where the second ED just floated in ;u; )>Graphics & Art 6~10+/10Hmmm... on one hand, the graphics were out of this world beautiful. The colors, the whole world that it was set in, the outfits, the character designs, everything was mesmerizing. I really, really loved those. The Sousei no Hinowa scene... I can\'t even describe it was so breathtakingly gorgeous. 10+/10On the other hand, ... uuugghhhhh...

Basically making the main character's life pretty miserable and to the point where he wants to disappear. Which in a sense . . he does, just he gets transported to another world or dimension, whichever you prefer to call it.Arata our main character gets transported into another world and replaces another guy named Arata. Yet they see him as the Arata from their world, they don't...see him as a high school boy who isn't tan and has black hair. Which he keeps it a secret from Kotoha since she was fascinated with Arata and has no idea he's someone else. Which soon later they start developing a little traveling group which consists of : our main character, a young girl who can heal, a bandit kid, and a cast out of the 12 cool group of warriors.To give my opinion quite bluntly and honestly: this anime was a disappointment in my eyes. Take note I haven't read the manga yet, so I am uncertain if they even go into more details about anything. Though when I say this anime is a ' disappointment ' I am merely just disappointed at the potential that it held yet it felt like it was wasted entirely. You have a sword that is supposed to be the ' greatest ' and our main character holds that sword, but all it does is produce a simple barrier and not do really . . anything. That was a big disappointment, until the end of the anime where it actually does something different, yet it still didn't really improve much in the end except do some pretty looking rainbow moves.All swords though that have special abilities were really unique in their own ways, which I really liked and enjoyed. Seeing how it'd be total bore if they were basically all the same and looked the same etc etc. Yet, they didn't really explain all too much about anything for the swords, if they even have a purpose, they didn't even give much information about the princess and what her purpose was. Or why they even did what they did to her in the beginning as well. It just made you sit there and think all the time ' And the purpose of this was . . ? '.The story though was still good and pretty decent. It just seemed like a couple of times there was a couple of parts that were pretty unnecessary to have in there. Other than that, the story was completely fine. All stories have faults so there's nothing much you can do about that. The characters have some pretty good character development going on for them all as well especially our main character of course. His enemy though, well there's just not much going on for him. His enemy is just his old friend who hates his guts just because of a silly reason. To the point where he's fully willing to kill him, which brings another question, why is this guy so crazy about this and to the point where he wants to take up a sword and kill him ? The enemy's drive to fight Arata just seemed . . . like a completely weak reason to have any sort of hate toward him, bully him, or want to kill him. There wasn't really any drive at all it just seemed completely empty. It seemed like they were completely wasting the potential of a good enemy character, where they just give him a silly completely wasteful reason to come after him.All in all, the story was good, it was perfect, but it was still good. The characters were also very good and I enjoyed each and one of them. All the enemies had a different outlook to them and it was very enjoyable. Enjoyment ? There wasn't really much enjoyment for myself as it seemed like most of the time it took all of my effort just to get through one episode. Things didn't really get interesting or good until the end which also just . . kind of ended in disappointment with what happened. I can only pray the manga goes deeper into the things that feel like it's missing and need to be explained. So overall I gave this anime a 6, it was a pretty good fair decent anime.Would I recommend it ? Maybe. It would just depend if this anime is the sort of thing you're looking for and you wouldn't mind the issues that it had. I wouldn't say don't watch it though, as it does have some pretty good points to it such as the characters and development that it held. So if you're up to it, go ahead and watch the anime.

AT any rate, I enjoyed this anime series a lot and I am so glad I found it because new anime these days are getting very...weak...and weird.

One world is modern Japan, the other one is common magic-based fantasy universe.Let’s say most of this anime revolves around the concept of TRUST, FRIENDSHIP and BETRAYAL. How can you trust someone? What does it mean? After being betrayed again and again by the ones you trusted most, would you be able to have...faith in someone again? These are the questions you will continuously hear in this anime.Despite having a quite original and very promising double-Isekaï structure, making people expecting the plot to take place equally in the two worlds with two MC, the show is mainly centered in what happens in the magic-based fantasy world, with only very few stuff actually taking place in the “real world”, and that is too bad because this anime could have been so much better…I have read a few other reviews, and I understand that this is precisely what many reviewers, having read the manga, give it grief for ; some elements taking place in the “real world” have been set apart to prioritize what was supposed to be the main plot.12 episodes for this anime is too short, it could have deserved a 24 episodes season. (Well probably a second season was originally planned, but they unfortunately did not proceed with it.)%%%%%%%%OK and now you ask: “cmon you have rated it 8/10 but so far you only have regrets/criticism for this anime, so is it really worth-watching?” DEFINITELY YES, this anime has very few members rating it, and most of them are probably manga readers disappointed by the adaptation, resulting in global 6.5 rating which is not really fair in my opinion.Art is good, so is animation. Fight scenes are quite rewarding and the rhythm is fine. The character development is fair for the MC and his “rivals” Kannagi and Kadowaki. Overall, this is good anime, far better than most 2018/19’s Isekaï and definitely deserves above 7 global rating. I would personally rate it 7.5, so it will be 8 to increase the global. faith in someone again?

Performing exorcism all day and night? Not really ... performing perverted, ecchi stuff all day and night? O yeah!Amaenaide yo! is an anime that can easily get faithful Buddhists ticked and non believers wonder ""what the heck"" is Buddhism. While this is only half of the story (you need to watch Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! to get the complete picture to the story), it does serve its purpose quite well as a building block to the sequel.Story:The show is very episodic by...nature, thus one can watch all the episodes in whichever order one pleases (except for episode 1 and 12) and will still be able to follow the story. Nearly all episodes contain some sort of ecchiness (rated R) though they can hardly be compared to Kanokon. In terms of plot, the story is rather simple and easy to comprehend throughout the series. In fact the story is so simple that if the ecchiness can be taken out of the anime, the show is actually more suitable for children than young adults. (Ecchi Power Rangers, anyone?)Art:When I first started watching this show, the characters looked very awkward to me due to their unusual round faces and marble-like eyes (especially Chitose the main female lead). The animation quality is very consistent throughout the series and the transition from scene to scene is also very smooth.Sound:The OP and ED are nothing very spectacular, however that is not to say they will make your ears bleed. There are a few notable CV:The main female lead, Chitose, is voiced by Mai Nakahara who is known for Nagisa in Clannad, Mai in Mai HiME and Mai Otome.Ikkou the main male lead, is voiced by Chihiro Suzuki who is known for Kouta in Elfen Lied, Luke in Tales of the Abyss.Character:It worried me at first (since all the girls seemed to play quite a major role in the story) that in 12 short episodes, the female characters will not have enough time to fully develop themselves as a unique character. But much to my surprise, all the females have pretty much equal screen time and most of them matured overtime as the series progresses. On the other hand, Ikkou (despite being the main focus in every episode) did not really change much from the beginning to the end.Enjoyment + Final Thought:While not the most ecchi anime you\'ll ever come across, Amaenaide yo! will not disappoint you if you are looking for perverted anime. Personally I watch it because I have been exposed to Buddhism ever since a young age and I was curious to see what it might lead me to. The anime certainly pissed off my Buddist-self, but at the same time it was entertaining with its light comedy.*It should be noted that the anime does include a lot of Buddhism terminology, so I recommend getting some definition out of the way first while watch it (else it\'ll be extremely confusing)* nature, thus one can watch all the episodes in whichever order one pleases (except for episode 1 and 12) and will still be able to follow the story.

', ""Story6/10Amaenaideyo is your run of the mill harem anime, with one catch...The harem consists of 6 (7 in Amaenaideyo Katsu) nuns/monks and one very perverted guy. Don't go into any harem anime expecting a groundbreaking story, cause you will almost never find that. But considering the anime does a decent job of developing the main characters it makes it better than most, though it only seems to spend a smaller time on the other characters. Normally this would hinder an anime but for the most part they all are not that far off from one anime stereotype or another.Overall, the story could be better,...but it would be hindering the reasons to watch the anime, which is for laughs and some fan-service. For this reason, I was a bit more lenient on the score.Characters7/10The main character is Ikko, and he is a priest living with 6 nuns. They usually end up running into some sort of disembodied spirit that has failed to ascend for various reasons. But that never usually works. There always seems to be one problem-child in the mix. The Ikko has to exorcise them. The problem is, that Ikko is useless until he sees enough skin, and then he enters a trance and turns into some sort of supermonk.Art8/10The art style is good, though some of the characters look very generic, though we are talking about nuns here. I wouldn't expect radical character designs given the story and setting. There are no gravity defying hairstyles here. Just short, medium and long. The colors are very vibrant and cheery which helps sustain it's charm. And the character shapes, while not completely realistic, also are not very cartoony. In terms of art, think &quot;Tenchi Muyo&quot;!It seems to fit the comedy/ecchi theme quite well and the breasts are not blown WAY WAY out of proportion like some ecchi anime. Overall, I think the art is another thing that gives the anime it's charm.Sound7/10There are two series of Amaenaideyo; one is &quot;Amaenaideyo&quot; and the other is 'Amaenaideyo Katsu&quot;. Since I cannot choose to review one, i'll just mash em together. Overall, the backround music, voices and sound effects stay the same, but the opening and closing themes are a bit different. In &quot;Amaenaideyo&quot;, the opening was catchy but the closing theme was a bit weak and forgettable. In &quot; --- Katsu&quot;, both the opening and closing were weak. In fact I would say, that they were the worst part of this series. Good thing the rest of the sound is good, and although more cartoony than most, it fits the comedy motif. What the voice actors do well though, is even though the voices are similar, they make the characters distinct personalities reflect in their voices. By midway through the anime, I knew who was speaking based almost solely on HOW sentences were spoken rather than by pitch. Unfortunatly, I find alot of anime to lack in this department and just have very different sounding voices. The only one they seemed to pull this with was Sakura, and even though her personality fit, they did not need to take it that far.Overall the sound is good, the only downfall being some of the themes.(Note: This review was done watching the Japanese subbed version.)Enjoyment8/10There is a good amount of fanservice, a bit more than something like &quot;Love Hina&quot;. As an Ecchi show it succeeds due to the amount of fanservice, but it seems to do so without distracting you from the actual story. Although the story is weak, it is told well and looks far worse on paper than the fashion it is implemented in.I found it way more enjoyable as a comedy than most anime, and it felt like it flowed well through the story while covering all the bases a good ecchi/comedy should.So if you are looking for an anime to just make you laugh, and love seeing girls put the beatdown on pervs, you'll probably like this. It's nothing to completely rave about, but I certainly would lump it in the some of the better anime I have seen. but it would be hindering the reasons to watch the anime, which is for laughs and some fan-service.

However, things don't go as expected, and he's often faced with lots of pervertness and ecchiness. The girls have outstanding abilities and Ikkou seems not to have any. However! When he's faced with ecchiness, his other self appears. The latter is extremely powerful, and can vanquish any evil spirit easily. A nice, lively and funny story, but NSFW and family in general.-[Animation:]-Nothing great to be said here. Many shots are taken from below, so...expect lots of panty shots. Let me rephrase.. Expect LOTS AND LOTS of ecchiness, panties and breast shots! This series is full of ecchiness! In fact, it's BASED on ecchiness in a way. Often, you get the impression that the view has been crammed with characters, with a hope to show as much ecchiness as possible in a given screen. If you appreciate ecchi, you will like Amaenaideyo. Note that the main female character, Chitose - The red-haired girl, does not look too much anime-like. Maybe it's a diffenent way of animation. It's not bad, just different.-[Sound:]-I usually do not pay lots of attention to sound and actors. So my review of the sound may not be very complete. There is little music apart the OP and EC. The quality of the voices were appreciable. I personally think the characters` voices suit them and were kinda... cute. Nothing more here, sorry. I'm not a sound specialist it seems.-[Story:]-The story revolves around a group of nuns and a single male living in a Buddhist Temple, it seems. (So, start picturing Love Hina`s harem.) The poor male chap will always stumble in ecchi situation and get lots of beating. However, it seems he is invincible, just like Keitaro. The characters are kinda well-developed, both their stories and bodies (I was satisfied here!). I personally think that the stories are stand-alone and almost independent of each other except at the end. The plot-line does not make much sense, or we can say it's almost inexistant.. But it`s a nice story nevertheless. Expect some budding romance. There is a sequel to Amaenaideyo. It`s Amaenaideyo Katsu.. It`s a good sequel. Apparently, there is even more after Katsu. Go watch Amaenaideyo! if you are looking for some liveliness and fun situations, and perhaps some excitement, if you see what I mean.P.s. When the main male character gets stimulated (e.g. by watching exposed breasts), he develops immense powers! It`s that kind of story. If you love ecchiness and comedy animes, this one is for you. Trust me on that. :P-[Character:]-Each character has his/her ups and downs. When you watch the anime, you will love each one of them. They are all well developed and their stories make some sense. Each has his/her own powers. Their individual stories are well-developed and there are little plot holes. You will get to see each of them undressed lots of time during the series. Every one of them, whatever their age. Expect ecchiness and perhaps some lolikon. As I said, the male character is special and often, the females will have to undress to make him unleash his powers. :D Yea, you read right! They have to UNDRESS to allow him to release his powers! :P Now you see where the ecchiness comes from.-[Value, Enjoyment:]-I have had some serious (and belly-hurting) laughs during the series and I can say I enjoyed myself. The series has a rewatch value. You will have fun going through each episode. The series is well-balanced with perhaps an over-dose of ecchiness. Apart from that, it`s a nice anime worth a watch. It's a light anime that doesn't require grey-matter usage to enjoy. Just sit back and enjoy.-[Conclusion:]-There is not much thinking to be done to understand this anime. You just have to watch it, look out for the ecchiness, laugh and enjoy the story. The sequel is also nice. If you like this one, you will definitely like the sequel: Amaenaideyo Katsu. I watched it. Wasn't deceived. If you like the genre, go for it. Else, checking it out might not do much harm.. (Except if caught by parents, boss, boy/girlfriend or other person.. perhaps..).Thanks for reading! :P expect lots of panty shots. Let me rephrase.. Expect LOTS AND LOTS of ecchiness, panties and breast shots! This series is full of ecchiness! In fact, it's BASED on ecchiness in a way. Often, you get the impression that the view has been crammed with characters, with a hope to show as much ecchiness as possible in a given screen. If you appreciate ecchi, you will like Amaenaideyo. Note that the main female character, Chitose - The red-haired girl, does not look too much anime-like. Maybe it's a diffenent way of animation. It's not bad, just different.-[Sound:]-I usually do not pay lots of attention to sound and actors. So my review of the sound may not be very complete. There is little music apart the OP and EC. The quality of the voices were appreciable. I personally think the characters` voices suit them and were kinda... cute. Nothing more here, sorry. I'm not a sound specialist it seems.-[Story:]-The story revolves around a group of nuns and a single male living in a Buddhist Temple, it seems. (So, start picturing Love Hina`s harem.) The poor male chap will always stumble in ecchi situation and get lots of beating. However, it seems he is invincible, just like Keitaro. The characters are kinda well-developed, both their stories and bodies (I was satisfied here!). I personally think that the stories are stand-alone and almost independent of each other except at the end. The plot-line does not make much sense, or we can say it's almost inexistant.. But it`s a nice story nevertheless. Expect some budding romance. There is a sequel to Amaenaideyo. It`s Amaenaideyo Katsu.. It`s a good sequel. Apparently, there is even more after Katsu. Go watch Amaenaideyo! if you are looking for some liveliness and fun situations, and perhaps some excitement, if you see what I mean.P.s.

My Buddha\' could be best described as an anime that sets out to deliver ecchi/harem type entertainment... and fails at it. In a nutshell, it\'s an ecchi anime with minimal ecchi, lots of plot holes, incoherent script and awful character development.The story and the setting might look appealing to ecchi watchers, a young monk in a buddhist temple filled with hot nuns? It\'ll be interesting right? Well it would be but not in this anime. \'Ah! My Buddha\' succeeds in screwing up this kind of a setting with tedious, sleep inducing subplots and fillers. In fact this whole anime feels...like you\'re watching a filler that just doesn\'t seem to fit into anything. The story goes absolutely nowhere and half-way through this nauseating 12 episode series, you feel like you\'re going to vomit your brains out.For starters, the ""ecchi"" here is sporadic and absolutely pathetic. Aparently the makers thought that seeing a half-covered thigh for 2 seconds classes as ecchi. Laughable. Moreover there\'s no finesse here, the ecchi is used in the most inappropriate moments and in the most innappropriate ways. Spirits of dead people groping teenage girls... seriously? Is that what we\'ve lowered ourselfes to?Second thing, the male protagonist - Ikkou Satonaka. He serves no actual legitimate purpose in this anime other than being everyone\'s buttmonkey. Punched in the nuts, kneed in the face and tasked with a buttload of chores. This kind of humour is only good if it\'s used in moderation, in this anime however it\'s the ONLY type of humour and it\'s grossly overused to the point where you just wish the male protagonist would stand up and leave the funny farm and all the slavers around him to their own fuckery.Last but not least, all the rest of the characters and their development. The rest of the main cast, which is comprised of girls, is there to look fakely serious and remind the male protagonist that he\'s a ""worthless piece of scum"" who needs to control himself. 5 minutes later they grope each other in front of him and he gets brutally mutilated because apparently it\'s his fault. Uhm, excuse me? I don\'t know about you but I\'m not a fan of sadism. This kind of a thing just doesn\'t appeal to me. As for character development, there is none. The characters have been \'programmed\' to do the same thing every episode. Hurt Ikkou and get off on his misery. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat...Despite the plot and the characters being dreadfuly bad, there are two things preventing this anime from being a flat out disaster. That\'s art and sound. The art is good and precise, granted, there are a few oddities here and there from time to time but the overall quality is impressive.Sound is perhaps the only truly remarkable component of this anime. Suprisingly, the opening is very catchy and well made giving you the impression that you\'re about to watch something enjoyable. Too bad the anime itself couldn\'t live up to that expectation. The rest of the soundtrack is also good and voice acting, despite the horrendous plot, authentic.That however doesn\'t change the fact that a majority of people will not enjoy this anime and it\'s current rating accurately describes what you should expect. Boredom and irritation. The setting certainly had a potential but the makers (I\'m looking at you DEEN) couldn\'t and didn\'t excecute that idea in the right way. Quite the contrary, they executed it in the worst way imaginable.You won\'t be missing out on anything if you decide to avoid this anime. like you\'re watching a filler that just doesn\'t seem to fit into anything.

My experience started in the late 2000s with anime like Sora no Otoshimono and later To Love Ru seasons that morphed my obsession with this genre. I never fully experienced all ecchi before the 2010s except for a handful that many consider classics. This eventually led me to come across Amaneide yo randomly, or Ah My Buddha. After it was finished, I can safely say that this is...not one that many would consider a classic.Am I saying this because it’s absolute trash, or does nobody remember it? A little bit in the former and the latter. Almost nobody I know who follows the genre even talks about this in the plethora of ecchi during the 2000s. There is a broad consensus that the decade was mostly terrible for the genre. It wasn’t until the tail end of the decade that things started to move forward in making a stand-out ecchi anime during the 2010s. With an ecchi like Amaenaide yo, it perfectly represents all of the bad ones during the 2000s. Is it outright garbage? I would not go so far as to say that there are far worse ones, but I can certainly say that this was just outright stale, formulaic, and boring in every sense of these words.As a setup, it does have one that is interesting on paper. You have a Buddhist monk training with a harem of nuns that each represents “the bosatsu of the six lower realms of the traditional Buddhist cosmology.” That sounds unique in an anime of this caliber. The problem is that they do not take advantage of the possibilities of this story setup down the road. It is just an excuse to have the main character look at their lewd bodies to gain his exorcism powers to defeat the supernatural entities inside of the girls. Usually, that would be fine as this is an ecchi anime, after all. But the issue is that the ecchi is incredibly tame and not all that exciting.How can the ecchi be tame and unexciting? Well, for one, the art design is so dated and unremarkable. The girls look painfully generic, and the animation is incredibly slow and not very flashy. There are a few points where it does work, but overall, it makes you realize, “Yep, this is obviously from 2005.” The design of the demons isn’t anything special either — just overall, not an exciting anime to look at aesthetically.What drags down the charm of the ecchi mishaps is that the female characters have little to no personality whatsoever. As I write this, I can’t even remember the names of any of them. Not just that, but also what archetypes they fit into your typical harem anime, what their likes and dislikes are, or how they contribute to the main story. The only one that I could point out was the main heroine, but that’s only because she was the one that suffered through most of the main character’s lewd shenanigans and acts as the main love interest. Other than her, I could not tell you the purpose of the rest except for the main character exorcising their demons in one episode. Even for supporting casts, you have to give them something else that makes them feel special to make them stand out, or I’m not going to care what happens to them or what they are doing.Nothing about the plot itself is even bearing a critique. To sum it all up in one word is dull. It feels like your typical episodic anime that all connects in some fashion but feels like your monster of the week anime that is already saturated enough as it is or was. By the time I watched episode seven, I had been up even trying to care about what was happening. It did not help that the characters were all completely wooden, both in personality and writing.I know this review may be a bit random because why would anybody have the urge to write anything this forgotten in the anime stratosphere? For some reason, I wanted to showcase an ecchi that was part of a by-gone era when harem anime was so saturated and mostly crap. This was when Love Hina and Tenchi Muyo became a hit, and many mangaka and anime studios were trying to create their hack versions of these two shows. Amaneide yo is far from a terrible example of this, but it is undoubtedly one that will most likely not be looked back on fondly; that is, if you can find someone who remembers its existence.Grade: C- not one that many would consider a classic.Am I saying this because it’s absolute trash, or does nobody remember it?

This is the idea of harem to a T. Ikkou is pretty much the worthless monk who is actually really perverted. Of course, he ends up in a nun training place. Somehow, that idea becomes the same story as in Love Hina.The girls are all really hard on poor Ikkou, although I can see why. He’s a complete pervert and yet, in the beginning, he doesn’t really look like he is. As the story keeps going, the more perverted he becomes and so some of this seems a...bit forced (Although with women like what are around him, it’s hard not to see why). Chitose and Ikkou have a really big love hate relationship (just like Naru and Kentaro) and all the others have a strange out of control roommates. Chitose is also like an airhead so she is a mix of Naru and Mutsumi from Love Hina.The story pretty much turns into a ghost by week sort of story line with each show being resolved by some sort of exorcism. Luckily, it’s not always with Ikkou seeing a naked woman and turning super monk on us but we are not saved from the breasts and panty shots at all. Sadly, the only way we get any info about the powers the girls have is in the 11th episode so don’t look for any real information about them until then.By the way, what the fuck is the little creature with Hinata? She seems to be able to talk to it but we can never understand what he is actually saying.The artwork is actually pretty. Sadly, there is a lot of fan service meaning panty and breast shots abound. Characters are all pretty much the normal Harem style girls, the Lolita, the sporty, the big breasted, the girl next door stuff. There are times when I just wonder where they get some items out of thin air. Characters also change places sometimes especially at the table. The faces have a symptom I call large forehead symptom. It’s when there is way to much of the forehead and very little area for the nose and mouth.The voices sound alright, though some of the girls’ voices sound a bit odd. Sometimes, they just sound a little too high pitched. A lot of the script is forced badly and is pretty badly done too. Characters seem to talk out of no where or when other characters should be talking. Sometimes there are really stupid puns to that I really think make the whole thing just bad in some parts. Music is pretty generic, nothing really special. All in all, the soundtrack is just low grade to average. bit forced (Although with women like what are around him, it’s hard not to see why).

My Goddess, but I was wrong.This is a show about a perverted boy who lives in a temple full of girls training to become nuns. Unfortunately for him, none of them are interested in a romance with him. But soon the nuns-in-training find out that -if Ikkou sees a naked girl (with a good figure) he gets super powers.And that is as deep as the story gets in this first season. Because everything else is pretty much a random aspect of what a monk and nun must do in their training, with...lots of ecchiness and occasional comedy.I found that most of the situations that the characters are put in are kind of stupid and borderline childish. The characters almost always repeat what another character says, but just in question form as if the characters are in continuous shock. The violence is also constant, so if you want to see someone be tortured all day with occasional view of big boobs, then this is a good series for that mood.The dialogue is annoying at times, the music is unremarkable and the characters have little to no depth. I was wanting a romance anime, not a waste of time. There is hardly any comedy... at least none that I personally found to be funny, but for you, it may be different.There is little to no story advancement or character development until season two. Because of that, the first season gets a mediocre grade.~~Subs Used~~Exiled-Destiny lots of ecchiness and occasional comedy.I found that most of the situations that the characters are put in are kind of stupid and borderline childish.

It’s as if there is an Echidna out there (the mother of all monsters one, not that rodent) which gives birth to these shows with very similar traits, no matter who the father is. I am willing to place some harems above some others. Ah My Goddess and Love Hina were amongst the first, still pure and untainted by the ridiculousness of all those which plagiarized them later on, with far less quality and badly thought out settings. Well, hello,...check out the name and the character attributes and then tell me it ain’t Ah My Goddess with a Love Hina lead. Watching them and their successors clearly shows how much the genre degenerated from romantic comedy with erotic innuendoes to pure fapping material without a shred of humor or taste.Yes, I used the “T” word, indirectly calling all those who like such disgraces idiots. Well, excuse me for making a point here which goes beyond their egocentric selves and shows a sub market of wasted potential that diminishes the anime industry instead of flourishing it. But more on that later. Let’s first nerdraeg at the different sections of this dreadful thing which some did the mistake of making and others followed on by buying.The story. Oh Sweet Mother of Jesus, the thing which this genre never cared about. Most comedies are the same as well but harems seem to not even bother TRYING to have anything other than a premise. In this case, the excuse for the endless fappingness is eastern monks. The setting is the same like in most others of this kind, a fail of a male specimen is surrounded by various super hot chicks, who have a really hard time staying dressed, covering their privates, or bumping on his crotch as if it is an ultra powerful electromagnet. Yeah, that sounds familiar; if it didn’t it wouldn’t be called soft porn disguised as comedy, aka harem. It’s as if all these shows need to do is have this premise and a random set of clothes to set themselves apart from the other, practically identical, shows. Which is double as lame, since down to it these shows use clothes not to define personalities but only to define fetishes. Maids, sisters, nuns, in this case priestesses. Plus, they finally aim to remove said clothes to provide even more cocktease, leaving the viewer staring at breast sizes and not people with a personality.Anyways, the excuse here is that dork being sent to get close with Buddha while being accompanied by chicks who help him trigger his hidden potential. How? By making him horny! WTF? A priest getting better at holy magic by being tainted by lustfulness? Does that mean a psychotic killer who performs a mass (not the murder type) at some church will be ten times as crazy? What bullshit is this?Crappy premises aside, the actual story is as per usual almost entirely fillers. The first episode is there to tell you the basics and the final episode of each season to provide a supposed closure, only for it to be as open and useless as the premise itself. The rest of the episodes are nothing but excuses for the girls to expose themselves. So if I am to give the story a score, that would be 3 episodes out of a full season, basically 1/7th of the total duration. There you go, a generous score of 2.Then we move to the cast. Oh God Almighty, the section which is as looked upon as the story. The lead is the usual fail for life arsewhole who is incapable of even looking at a girl without having a nosebleed or not be beaten to a pulp by some neurotic bitch every 5 minutes. It was funny the first 100 times I saw it in Love Hina, but now it is nothing else besides lame. Seriously, are we supposed to identify with this ding-dong, who is good at nothing? Or to NOT identify but rather self-insert because of how bland he is? What kind of people would like such an archetype?None. Nobody likes beta cucks. They can make them seem to be chick magnets because they have a good heart despite being wastes of space and still nobody will like them. Because they are never the main focus, they are the eyes of the viewer. The naked bodies of the girls are the highlight and the protagonists are losers just to prevent the story from becoming hardcore porn. WELL WHY NOT? How much frustration can a man stand before his weenie falls off from the constant blue-balling? This isn’t healthy for Pete’s sake. It’s just about drooling all over 2D girls without ever getting any boon.Anyways, at least we have personalities to notice here besides boobs and underwear. Each girl has her own unique psychology, goals in life, reasons to aspire being like her… YEAH RIGHT! HAREM GIRLS WITH DEPTH; NICE ONE HAHAHA! They are solely defined by their breast size and the color of their underwear. Their clothes are not there to give them personality; they are there as a fetish for the fans of this dreadfulness to like. If they ever change clothes, they don’t become different people but rather a DIFFERENT FETISH! Being undressed is just the default state.So these characters (which in this excuse of a story are some generic eastern monks in some generic temple) are nothing you wouldn’t expect. They don’t really develop and you have no reason to remember something about them, besides perhaps the boners you got out of them. I give them the score they deserve. A nice fat bottomed ace.But you know what? As lame as these shows are, they can still have good animation and a brilliant soundtrack. Nothing holds them back from doing that. Love Hina and Ah My Goddess had wonderful artwork and superb music scores, and they are harems as well. Remember the magic world of the gods and their divine music? Naru’s singing at the concert? So why not have something similar in this show? BECAUSE THE PRODUCERS DIDN’T CARE! If it weren’t for the constant worm view of the camera angle just so we can see pantsu without a reason, there would be nothing to look at. And you can watch this anime in mute for all I care; the dialogues are retarded and there isn’t much of a plot to distract you from the main theme of this show; which is fapping excuses.This turd has no message, no artistry, nothing out of the norm. It doesn’t even try to be different, it is a clone of the set-in-stone formula. Doesn’t worth it! Keep away! Try something else, preferably not harem. check out the name and the character attributes and then tell me it ain’t Ah My Goddess with a Love Hina lead.

Well, excuse me for making a point here which goes beyond their egocentric selves and shows a sub market of wasted potential that diminishes the anime industry instead of flourishing it. But more on that later. Let’s first nerdraeg at the different sections of this dreadful thing which some did the mistake of making and others followed on by buying.The story. Oh Sweet Mother of Jesus, the thing which this genre never cared about. Most comedies are the same as well but harems seem to not even bother TRYING to have anything other than a premise. In this case, the excuse for the endless fappingness is eastern monks. The setting is the same like in most others of this kind, a fail of a male specimen is surrounded by various super hot chicks, who have a really hard time staying dressed, covering their privates, or bumping on his crotch as if it is an ultra powerful electromagnet. Yeah, that sounds familiar; if it didn’t it wouldn’t be called soft porn disguised as comedy, aka harem. It’s as if all these shows need to do is have this premise and a random set of clothes to set themselves apart from the other, practically identical, shows. Which is double as lame, since down to it these shows use clothes not to define personalities but only to define fetishes. Maids, sisters, nuns, in this case priestesses. Plus, they finally aim to remove said clothes to provide even more cocktease, leaving the viewer staring at breast sizes and not people with a personality.Anyways, the excuse here is that dork being sent to get close with Buddha while being accompanied by chicks who help him trigger his hidden potential. How? By making him horny! WTF? A priest getting better at holy magic by being tainted by lustfulness? Does that mean a psychotic killer who performs a mass (not the murder type) at some church will be ten times as crazy? What bullshit is this?Crappy premises aside, the actual story is as per usual almost entirely fillers. The first episode is there to tell you the basics and the final episode of each season to provide a supposed closure, only for it to be as open and useless as the premise itself. The rest of the episodes are nothing but excuses for the girls to expose themselves. So if I am to give the story a score, that would be 3 episodes out of a full season, basically 1/7th of the total duration. There you go, a generous score of 2.Then we move to the cast. Oh God Almighty, the section which is as looked upon as the story. The lead is the usual fail for life arsewhole who is incapable of even looking at a girl without having a nosebleed or not be beaten to a pulp by some neurotic bitch every 5 minutes. It was funny the first 100 times I saw it in Love Hina, but now it is nothing else besides lame. Seriously, are we supposed to identify with this ding-dong, who is good at nothing? Or to NOT identify but rather self-insert because of how bland he is? What kind of people would like such an archetype?None. Nobody likes beta cucks. They can make them seem to be chick magnets because they have a good heart despite being wastes of space and still nobody will like them. Because they are never the main focus, they are the eyes of the viewer. The naked bodies of the girls are the highlight and the protagonists are losers just to prevent the story from becoming hardcore porn. WELL WHY NOT? How much frustration can a man stand before his weenie falls off from the constant blue-balling? This isn’t healthy for Pete’s sake. It’s just about drooling all over 2D girls without ever getting any boon.Anyways, at least we have personalities to notice here besides boobs and underwear. Each girl has her own unique psychology, goals in life, reasons to aspire being like her… YEAH RIGHT! HAREM GIRLS WITH DEPTH; NICE ONE HAHAHA! They are solely defined by their breast size and the color of their underwear. Their clothes are not there to give them personality; they are there as a fetish for the fans of this dreadfulness to like. If they ever change clothes, they don’t become different people but rather a DIFFERENT FETISH! Being undressed is just the default state.So these characters (which in this excuse of a story are some generic eastern monks in some generic temple) are nothing you wouldn’t expect. They don’t really develop and you have no reason to remember something about them, besides perhaps the boners you got out of them. I give them the score they deserve. A nice fat bottomed ace.But you know what? As lame as these shows are, they can still have good animation and a brilliant soundtrack. Nothing holds them back from doing that. Love Hina and Ah My Goddess had wonderful artwork and superb music scores, and they are harems as well. Remember the magic world of the gods and their divine music? Naru’s singing at the concert? So why not have something similar in this show? BECAUSE THE PRODUCERS DIDN’T CARE! If it weren’t for the constant worm view of the camera angle just so we can see pantsu without a reason, there would be nothing to look at. And you can watch this anime in mute for all I care; the dialogues are retarded and there isn’t much of a plot to distract you from the main theme of this show; which is fapping excuses.This turd has no message, no artistry, nothing out of the norm. It doesn’t even try to be different, it is a clone of the set-in-stone formula. Doesn’t worth it! Keep away! Try something else, preferably not harem.']"
Bakuretsu Hunters OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/808/Bakuretsu_Hunters_OVA,"[""This is more or less just a follow up to the TV series. You get to know a little bit more about the main characters' pasts, and we're treated to the group's &quot;vacation time&quot;. Something you might want to check out if you're a fan of the original series, since it probably won't make much sense to you if you haven't seen that first or read the manga. "", ""Ok… wow… This really changed up since the first version. The OVA is extremely sexual and has a lot of adult themes, even more then the TV version. Now that is not fully surprising seeing as an OVA is basically straight to video release. The show is really full of more fan service, more odd sexual jokes, and just a lot more crazy. I liked the TV version because they actually did take things somewhat seriously but in this one, nothing is safe.The character’s personalities are a lot shallower in this one then the TV, making me wonder just where they were getting the...personalities from. It’s like I am watching two different series. The characters from the TV version are a different person then the ones that are here and it’s not that because of personal growth, its just they are shallow. In the TV, I actually was fine with Carrot being a pervert because he had a good heart. In this one though, he seems a little less with a good heart and more of a pervert. They also added two small perverts into the mix and Gateau’s sister who I really didn't like at all. His sister was just their to pose with her brother to serve for the guys that liked macho girls I think while the two perverts ended up chasing around every girl along with Carrot. When they did have a cute and sweet story, it was to little to late for me as I was pretty much all done with the OVA.They do sort of bring more of the mysterious nature into the show but never actually explain it beyond being mysterious.The animation is really interesting, mostly jagged and more closely resembling that of the manga. That said, it also has a lot more naked boobs, skimpy outfits, and Gateau taking his clothing off to try and show how macho he is. I still am not sure how that makes him macho but whatever. So when I say Skimpy outfits, I’m talking about Chocolate’s suspenders over her nipples thing. How those suspenders stay there must be glue or something because they do not move even with her breasts jumping all over the place.  There are a lot of things like that besides Chocolate but it shows off with her more and its not really sexy at all, just annoying. The colors are even darker then the TV version, almost like a black layer was over everything.The opening is actually pretty good, surprisingly a soft song to the show for how crazy the show is. It’s a big change compared to the TV version which is a bit more popish. Where the TV pumped you up, the OVA seems to settle you down in the beginning. The dubbing though is really strange. They changed some of the voices and I am so not so into the dubbing of Gateau. He sounds more like a punk with a nazel problem in this one instead of a macho guy. Some of the other characters also got a slight voice change but I couldn’t figure out if it was just the voice actors doing a different type to the characters or if it really was new voice actors. I think it’s a lot more ‘gimmickie’ in the voices as though they were forcing more of the comedy. I seriously didn't like the voice of Gateou’s sister’s voice.I really didn’t like the OVA much. With all the laughter I did get from it, it just also had a lot of problems with the character personalities and the design choices. I read the first Manga volume so I understand partly what they were bringing in but I think they should have stayed with the TV version. personalities from.

I basically said it was bland, generic fare with great acting and music, weak characters and an over-abundance of fan-service. Well, I\'ve come a long way since that review and that series had an OVA. So, we\'re looking at that today.Story:Each of the three episodes deals with something different. In the first, our protagonists find themselves at a hot spring where Carrot is determined to have a night visit with anyone except Tira or Chocolate. Meanwhile, a young boy we\'ve never seen before...but the characters know named Potee is also looking for a visit and Chocolate plans to sneak into Carrot\'s room.The second deals with them hunting a sorcerer who\'s turned a town into zombies so he can have a really shit rom-com about a zombie protagonist. That\'s right, he wants to make Kore wa Zombie desu ka. That evil bastard. Actually, he just wants the necronomicon to increase his powers. Which is why Big Momma is sending her hunters out to stop him.The final episode deals with the group going back to their home town to visit a magic tree during a festival. Naturally, Carrot wants to use the romantic legend surrounding the tree to hit on any girl who isn\'t Tira or Chocolate.The first major problem with this is the focus on comedy. In the series proper there was more of a balance between the generic plot and the comedic scenes, which made them somewhat tolerable, but in this the comedy is pervasive and shite. It\'s mostly based around Carrot being a crazy pervert who gets whipped by Tira and Chocolate as comeuppance. There are also ""jokes"" about Gateau and his sister, Eclair, doing macho poses in their undergarments. Because showing off your muscles is a proud Mocha family tradition going back generations. They may or may not be related to the Armstrongs. There\'s also the predatory bisexual guy in the second episode who hits on everyone in the group. Why does bad media never have a bisexual character who just acts like a normal person? They\'re always over-sexed. Then again, this is Bakuretsu Hunters where that can describe a whole slew of characters.There\'s also the love triangle to talk about. There\'s this stupid thing in the franchise where both Tira and Chocolate have things for Carrot, in spite of him having no redeeming qualities, and he chases after every girl he meets except the two of them. That continues in the OVA and it\'s still dumb. We also meet Daughter\'s boyfriend and the series treats them as this overly mushy, romantic pairing while also having her say literally the least romantic thing possible to him. ""Let\'s make a child."" Just, yuck. You\'d be less gross telling your significant other ""I have severe constipation from that cheese pizza"" or just reciting the lyrics to Ninja Sex Party\'s\xa0Romance Novel.About the best I can say is that it can be cathartic to see Carrot suffer. It falls short most of the time, but there are a few cases where it works.Characters:It\'s pretty similar to the main series. Carrot is trash. Gateau, Marron, Chocolate & Tira are boring. The OVA also adds Potee & Jii. They\'re awful, like a child and old man Carrot. We also see Carrot\'s dad, who is pretty much just like him in the minute and a half we have with him. They also add the predatory bisexual, Millefeuille, Potee\'s mum, Salad & Gateau\'s sister, Eclair. None of which are interesting in the slightest.Art:The biggest issue is still the fan-service and it\'s even worse in the OVA. Tira and Chocolate don\'t just strip into glorified swimwear in this. Tira goes into bondage gear while Chocolate goes into tiny string straps that only cover her nipples and even then it\'s barely. Surely, the most protective outfits to wear when you\'re going into battle. There\'s also a lot of nudity in the hot springs episode. Aside from that,the backgrounds are fine and the action sequences are functional enough.Sound:The acting is really strong. Xebec got a lot of people who were way too good for this script including Hayashibara Megumi, Madono Mitsuaki, & Mizutani Yuuko. The music is, by far, the best part of the OVA. The theme tunes for this are legitimately really good. Kawai Kenji deserves credit for the composition. Hayashibara Megumi & Mizutani Yuuko deserve a lot of credit for the performances.Ho-yay:There\'s a bit. Unfortunately, it\'s all gay jokes. In the night encounters episode, Chocolate accidentally glomps Salad in the dark and Salad seems okay with the situation. There are also some gay jokes about Potee and Jii. Of course, there\'s also Millefeuille hitting on Carrot and saying he\'s also interested in both Marron & Gateau. Which Gateau seems completely okay with.Areas of Improvement:Zany humour based off of strong comedic interactions. I think it could work if the characters had strong comedic quirks instead of being largely boring.Characters who are properly dressed for the weather. Because the fan-servicey outfits are just crass.Build up your characters. Characters need to have one of two things to work. Depth, or strong comedic quirks that play well off of each other. This franchise has neither. Given that the main series proper was a bit more story driven with attempts at comedic elements throughout, I\'d be inclined to say it needs characters with depth who also have quirks that tie into their personalities.Final Thoughts:This OVA is pretty bad. It takes everything wrong with the main series and leans heavily into it while ignoring the story elements that had any promise to them. So, I\'m giving it a 3/10. but the characters know named Potee is also looking for a visit and Chocolate plans to sneak into Carrot\'s room.The second deals with them hunting a sorcerer who\'s turned a town into zombies so he can have a really shit rom-com about a zombie protagonist.

Ayaka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53428/Ayaka,"['This show is... well... okay. I have to admit that I was interested in how all of the story plays out in the end since dropping any kind of plot that is not a complete garbage makes me anxious (and I can\'t call this anime a garbage, it\'s at least not bad).But in the same time I found myself skipping through the latest episodes just to get the glimpse of what\'s happening without paying attention to details. A trait of a good story is that you want to immerse yourself into it and read or watch without interruptions it for the sake of getting...all those different emotions. It\'s much easier to be interested just in the plot than to be interested in a story as a whole. If you\'d prefer to choose reading a short synopsis with all the events over actually reading or watching the story then it\'s probably not worth it.And with this anime I feel like it fails to captivate the viewer enough. It has an interesting premise and an interesting setting, the powers used by the characters are very harmonious with the setting and fit very well. But aside from that I found it a bit hard to be interested in any of the characters since all of them are basically bland. Even those who have either tragic backstories or unshakable dedication to something seem to follow the typical cliche archetypes of characters with such traits without anything unique about them.Also the plot is not that complicated to compensate for it. It\'s pretty straightforward and you can often guess what will happen next. The final ""plot twist"" or ""grand reveal"" of the show is more or less obvious from the start and thus disappointing. I won\'t spoil it here but the show gets out of its way to help you make a connection between the main character and one plot-important concept as early as you can.So, overall, if someone asked me to rate this show to know if it\'s worth watching, I\'d tell them 6/10 to not discourage them. But for me personally it\'s closer to 4.5/10. If you are more or less new to anime or haven\'t watched many shows with similar premise, it\'ll probably be a decent way to kill time and get a non-zero amount of positive emotions from it. In other case, it probably isn\'t worth your time. all those different emotions. It\'s much easier to be interested just in the plot than to be interested in a story as a whole.

This is my first time reviewing an anime so I will explain how I watch and rate things.there are a few criteria that I look for, most importantly the animation quality, the story, and the characters. What is less of a priority for me is the concept of the anime and the music.now onto the review:animation: 5. The animation is alright. nothing really bad (ahem ahem... nanatsu no taizai), but also nothing to write home about. What is missing is dynamics and fluidity in the climaxes of the episodes. It feels static.Story: 6. I think that the story line is pretty fluent....There is nothing really surprising at this moment, but the mysteries are slowly being laid out and are waiting to be answered.Characters: 7. The characters are pretty good at this moment. Some are there for obvious reasons (Jingi), but most of the characters are playing well of eachother. It is to early to speak of character development (except for Yukito). So this grade could change.Concept: 8. This is more of a subjective thing, but for me, the concept of this anime is what will make me watch the season. It's really interesting how the powers work in Ayaka. it has a mix of JJK and Naruto. which are both good.Music: 7. good music, not groundbeaking but just good music.all in all, I enjoyed the first three ep. and I think I'll watch the entire season There is nothing really surprising at this moment, but the mysteries are slowly being laid out and are waiting to be answered.Characters: 7.

I just couldn\'t wait to tell you how much I hated this piece of garbage. boring art, more boring characters, typical plot about a nobody who finds out he was secretly awesome all along. There\'s nothing new here except maybe the level of awfulness.Honestly, if you watched this and thought ""hmm, this is acceptable level of quality"", please tell how bad a show has to be for you to drop it.• Totally unoriginal premise you\'ve seen a million times before• The art totally fits the story as both are extremely boring•...The characters are unlikable and unbelievable• Whoever wrote these characters has probably never met a human before• I don\'t see any reason why anyone would ever enjoy this garbage The characters are unlikable and unbelievable• Whoever wrote these characters has probably never met a human before• I don\'t see any reason why anyone would ever enjoy this garbage', 'Yeap...this was, and still is, hot garbage.You would think that from the writing group of studio GoHands\'s most famed series, K Project, the anonymous GoRA would have another jewel on their hands. But this is 2023, not 2012, and what they had for the always risky anime original show that is Ayaka (or its full name - Ayaka: A Story of Bonds and Wounds), yeah sure, it was INDEED a story of bonds and wounds, but this somewhat simple story, to put it simply, is an absolute chore to sit through.Just about the only thing that I appreciated about this show is the setting: similar...to the Pokemon Adventures of FireRed and LeafGreen, there exists a range of islands that are all interconnected to each other, which make up the Ayaka Islands, along with the supernatural-backed mythology of the monsters and spirits they call ""Mitama"" and ""Ara-Mitama"" to separate between the good and evil. Especially those blue Mitama blobs that surround the island, they\'re such cute and adorable creatures that manifest life onto the islands.But otherwise, this show is shitting the shat onto the trash all around, like a ""wait for something to happen"" scenario, because this show ultimately is driven balls to the wall with a simple premise that drags on and on until shit hits the fan, then literally, skate and die with emotions overflowing, thinking that it can win the people over by the now-infamous death flag.Simply put, you have this boy who was wrangled off the Ayaka Islands due to the imbalance between the gods, and him not knowing of the rich history behind it, had to have a caretaker to accompany him...and then bring him back when the time is right. This is what is happening to Yukito Yanagi, growing from a child then to a young adult uneventfully, until the green jacket-laden Jingi Sagawa has to find him and escort him back to the Ayaka Islands, telling him that it\'s his duty to remain on the island and train up on their Ley Mastery magic system, and train until something bad happens to be able to put that training to use. Thereafter, with the others like caretaker Momoko Amamiya, Ley Mastery experts Haruaki Kurama and Aka Ibuki, and many more, Yukito\'s life begins to shake slowly as an innert feeling calls him from deep in the recesses of his heart, only to be told that he would be the key to determine the fate of the Ayaka Islands.The TL;DR if you don\'t care about the story: it\'s simple, and simple stories can work well, but it\'s the execution that really counts, and this show is the embodiment of a sloth scratching its head and in its usual ""question mark"" brain of what to do next. It\'s just bad execution with a boring story and forgettable characters, even when given the death flag.The same can easily be said about the animation, which coming from Studio Blanc, maybe you should change your name to Studio Bland, because it\'s not at all impressive. Though I could speculate the reason that the studio\'s pairing with director Nobuyoshi Nagayama on Winter\'s Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki a.k.a The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World, was partially why they wanted to continue the good business relationship since he had secured a hit with the exact same studio for Uramichi Oniisan back in Summer 2021. And almost conspicously as everything was suspiciously in line, music artiste angela took the reins for the show\'s OP, which was decent at best, along with saji\'s ED.Nevertheless, with each progressing episode, I was finding myself having to tune the anime up to 1.3x watching speed just so that there will be some plot progression, but I guess with the supposedly ""succinct"" writing that had limits placed all over the place, it isn\'t saying much that the anime basically had nothing going for it, and only showing its cards once everything falls into place as it should.It\'s just really meh and boring, please don\'t waste your time watching this crap. to the Pokemon Adventures of FireRed and LeafGreen, there exists a range of islands that are all interconnected to each other, which make up the Ayaka Islands, along with the supernatural-backed mythology of the monsters and spirits they call ""Mitama"" and ""Ara-Mitama"" to separate between the good and evil.

This is what is happening to Yukito Yanagi, growing from a child then to a young adult uneventfully, until the green jacket-laden Jingi Sagawa has to find him and escort him back to the Ayaka Islands, telling him that it\'s his duty to remain on the island and train up on their Ley Mastery magic system, and train until something bad happens to be able to put that training to use. Thereafter, with the others like caretaker Momoko Amamiya, Ley Mastery experts Haruaki Kurama and Aka Ibuki, and many more, Yukito\'s life begins to shake slowly as an innert feeling calls him from deep in the recesses of his heart, only to be told that he would be the key to determine the fate of the Ayaka Islands.The TL;DR if you don\'t care about the story: it\'s simple, and simple stories can work well, but it\'s the execution that really counts, and this show is the embodiment of a sloth scratching its head and in its usual ""question mark"" brain of what to do next. It\'s just bad execution with a boring story and forgettable characters, even when given the death flag.The same can easily be said about the animation, which coming from Studio Blanc, maybe you should change your name to Studio Bland, because it\'s not at all impressive. Though I could speculate the reason that the studio\'s pairing with director Nobuyoshi Nagayama on Winter\'s Saikyou Onmyouji no Isekai Tenseiki a.k.a The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another World, was partially why they wanted to continue the good business relationship since he had secured a hit with the exact same studio for Uramichi Oniisan back in Summer 2021.

Cheburashka Arere?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7176/Cheburashka_Arere,"['Overview:It is time for another round of ""Is this really an anime?!"" The show where I review the most questionable entries on MAL\'s anime list and also try to determine whether or not they should count as anime.  Last time we looked at the Transformers Movie from 1986. Today we will be looking at Cheburashka: the anime!Background:Cheburashka is a popular Russian cartoon character created during the 1960s in the Soviet Union. However, Cheburashka never gained the same international popularity outside the Soviet Bloc countries that the 1960s American cartoons did. Like with automobiles, the Soviets decided to protect domestic products by banning all foreign...competition, in this case any cartoons from the West. Which is why Cheburashka is referred to by every Polish person I\'ve ever met as ""that fucking stop-motion rat that the Russians forced us to watch!"" Despite the fact that Cheburashka is unknown in most countries and absolutely despised in countries like Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Estonia, Hungary, Czech Republic etc, Cheburashka remains extremely popular in Russia, Belarus, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Cuba, Armenia, ...and Japan for some reason! For reasons that NO ONE knows, Japan is the only country that isn\'t a steadfast ally of Russia, yet absolutely loves Cheburashka. As a result, it was only a matter of time until Cheburashka got his own anime. This anime was written, directed, and produced in Russia, but used Japanese animation, voice acting, and music composition. By contrast, the Transformers movie from 1986 only used a Japanese animation studio and EVERYTHING else was American. It is questionable whether or not this is an anime, but it is fair to say it is MUCH closer than the Transformers movie.Plot:Cheburashka is a monkey like creature with giant ears that lived on a tropical island before accidentally falling asleep in a cargo box full of oranges and being shipped to Moscow. Once in the big city, Chiburashka has episodic, 3 minute per episode adventures with his friends. His most commonly recurring friend is the talking crocodile named Gena, who wears a bowler hat, plays the accordion, and often bemoans the fact that one\'s birthday only comes once a year. Each episode is an independent event and no effort is put into really developing the characters or creating an overarching plot. However, it IS very adorable and was aimed at very small children, so it seems a bit silly to be THAT harsh on it for being what it is.Art:The art is actually really well done in how it captures the look and feel of the original, even though the original was stop motion animation. This actually still looks and feels like a real Cheburashka cartoon, for which the animation studio deserves some serious credit.Sound:The Japanese voice acting is of course very cutesy and the soundtrack is what you would expect in a show for small children. It isn\'t exceptionally good, but isn\'t grating either.Overall:Sometimes ratings have to be relative and take into account the target demographic and primary objective of the series. This was a short sketch cartoon aimed at small children to get a few laughs and be cute and innocent. Did it accomplish exactly what it wanted to? Yes it did. Would I say this was one of the greatest children\'s shows I have ever seen? No, but it certainly wasn\'t bad. I actually gave it an extra point for not doing anything to piss me off, which children\'s movies and shows tend to do...a lot. Ultimately, I give this series a well earned 6/10. competition, in this case any cartoons from the West.

Binzume Yousei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/348/Binzume_Yousei,"[""Anime like this makes me think I'm going to have diabetes before I'm 30. Packed to the brim with saccharine sweetness, Bottle Fairy delivers a heaping helping of brain-rotting sugar... which can be a good or bad thing depending on what kind of anime you like.The story is set up quite well in the OP. Four fairy girls come to the human world to learn to become humans. They pin their hopes and dreams on a boy whom they call &quot;Sensei-san&quot;. Living with &quot;Sensei-san&quot; and given advice by his neighbor, Tama-chan, the fairies try to learn as much about being human as they can.It's not...the best &quot;let's make funny takes on everday life&quot; story, but it's certainly not the worst. It's mildly humorous and with a 15-minute run time per episode, it's something you can swallow quickly and easily in between series or if you have time to kill. The plot is shapeless and the story is easily forgotten. Keep your expectations low and you should be fine.This transparent story is told from the perspective of the fairies, each given a generic personality that cater to moe fanatics in particular, but they come off so weak that the cliches that come with them are often just as weak in impact.Generic animation and music abound. Given how long it is, that's to be expected though. It looked like someone had this idea, wanted to make it a reality, but really didn't want to take it seriously. Thus this is a series I recommend if you watch, that you do not take seriously whatsoever.If you do that, Bottle Fairy is actually pretty fun. People who don't mind an unhealthy dose of super-deformed adorability will eat this up, but others who prefer more serious anime will probably want to steer clear. Still, if you're in the former category. It's a quick flash of sunshine you can enjoy and subsequently forget. the best &quot;let's make funny takes on everday life&quot; story, but it's certainly not the worst.

And ofcourse the faeries are so cute that you wish them luck all the way to &quot;adulthood&quot;.', 'Xebec is one of those studios with a decent output that I\'ve somehow managed to largely overlook. I\'ve reviewed three of their works so far. The good Rinne No Lagrange, the mediocre Bakuretsu Hunters and the downright terrible Mnemosyne. One trend you may notice is that these works tend to be for older audiences. So, how does a studio like Xebec handle an anime with  children as the primary audience? To find out let\'s look at Bottle Fairy.Bottle Fairy doesn\'t have a cohesive story so much as it does a scenario. Four faeries associated with the seasons come to Earth in bottles where...they live with a bloke they know only as ""Sensei-san"" and try to learn about the human world. Unfortunately for them, most of their information comes from television dramas and the first grader next door, Tama-chan, who thinks she\'s more knowledgeable than she actually is. The main elements of comedy revolve around them finding out about an aspect of the human world, be it love letters, Golden week, a school\'s opening ceremony or something else, and trying to figure it out and explore it through imaginative play coloured by what they\'ve seen on television and the misinformation they get from Tama-chan. It actually reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes in the way imagination is employed. Now, a lot of the humour in this is firmly based on Japanese culture. However, since the faeries are learning about the human world, I don\'t think the humour loses much in translation. The audience basically learns about the various aspects along with them unless the audience knows the information already. Except for possibly the jokes that work as plays on words, but there really aren\'t many jokes like that. Most of the humour comes from their imagined scenarios which are pretty hilarious. The only episodes that don\'t really work very well are the last two which don\'t have a lot of the imaginative play that defines the rest of the series in favour of doing a slightly more serious plot. They still have some funny moments, but the humour is much weaker. I do like the way they give each month it\'s own episode in order to explore a year of time and various events throughout. It\'s quite a clever setup, especially since there isn\'t much in terms of plot.The characters in this are quite simplistic. I know, it\'s shocking when an anime for kids has simple characters. That being said, they are a lot of fun and they interact well with each other. The weakest character is probably Sensei-san who tends to stay out of the humorous segments, returning to help wrap things up. He\'s not a horrible character, but he is pretty bland.The art in this is cutesy, which fits in with the series even if it\'s not an art style I tend to like that much, and kind of minimalistic. Don\'t get me wrong, there are some really good details in the imagination sequences and the costumes they wear during those sequences tend to be surprisingly intricate. However, they never do more than they really need to. So a lot of the backgrounds are pretty bare.This series got a pretty spectacular cast. Nonaka Ai, Horie Yui, Nazuka Kaori and Mizuki Nana take on the main roles as Hororo, Sarara, Chiriri, and Kururu and they\'re all fantastic. They give energetic performances with some emotional scenes, usually when the girls are over-reacting to something for the sake of humour. One odd thing about the music is that the series has five ending themes. This anime has all of thirteen episodes. I mentioned earlier that each month gets one but there\'s also a finale. Each faerie gets to sing her own seasonal based ending and the finale has an ensemble cast. So, while it\'s kind of odd to have that many endings, it does work for the series and they\'re all sung well. The music is mostly energised and pretty enjoyable.The yuri factor is a 4/10. Here\'s the thing, the faeries engage in a lot of different imagined scenarios. Some of which put them in the roles of love interests for each other. So you do get quite a few homo-erotic moments in the series.So, how is Bottle Fairy? Well, it\'s a creative work with a lot of imagination and a great sense of humour. Even with a few weak episodes, it\'s still really enjoyable. I\'m going to give it an 8/10. Check it out for some light-hearted fun. You may just learn something about Japanese culture in the process. Besides, the episodes are less than fifteen minutes long so it\'s a quick watch. they live with a bloke they know only as ""Sensei-san"" and try to learn about the human world.

The weakest character is probably Sensei-san who tends to stay out of the humorous segments, returning to help wrap things up. He\'s not a horrible character, but he is pretty bland.The art in this is cutesy, which fits in with the series even if it\'s not an art style I tend to like that much, and kind of minimalistic. Don\'t get me wrong, there are some really good details in the imagination sequences and the costumes they wear during those sequences tend to be surprisingly intricate. However, they never do more than they really need to. So a lot of the backgrounds are pretty bare.This series got a pretty spectacular cast. Nonaka Ai, Horie Yui, Nazuka Kaori and Mizuki Nana take on the main roles as Hororo, Sarara, Chiriri, and Kururu and they\'re all fantastic. They give energetic performances with some emotional scenes, usually when the girls are over-reacting to something for the sake of humour. One odd thing about the music is that the series has five ending themes. This anime has all of thirteen episodes. I mentioned earlier that each month gets one but there\'s also a finale. Each faerie gets to sing her own seasonal based ending and the finale has an ensemble cast. So, while it\'s kind of odd to have that many endings, it does work for the series and they\'re all sung well. The music is mostly energised and pretty enjoyable.The yuri factor is a 4/10. Here\'s the thing, the faeries engage in a lot of different imagined scenarios. Some of which put them in the roles of love interests for each other. So you do get quite a few homo-erotic moments in the series.So, how is Bottle Fairy? Well, it\'s a creative work with a lot of imagination and a great sense of humour. Even with a few weak episodes, it\'s still really enjoyable. I\'m going to give it an 8/10. Check it out for some light-hearted fun. You may just learn something about Japanese culture in the process. Besides, the episodes are less than fifteen minutes long so it\'s a quick watch.', ""Bottle Fairy, cleverly disguised as a lighthearted and innocent comedy about four small fairies discovering the world around then and learning to become humans, also hides a dark side that may not be readily apparent.The man known only as 'Sensei-san' keeps these fairies in bottles on his desk. If you're like me, the first thing you think of is the Legend of Zelda, and you wonder if he sacrifices the fairies to restore his own life. Rather than that though, he uses them as his own personal harem, taking advantage of Stockholm Syndrome, causing a prisoner to develop affection for their hostage-taker.Furthermore, Sensei-san...frequently has his next-door neighbor over to his house as a guest. Who is his neighbor? A first-grade girl. Imagine letting your first grade daughter go next door to spend time with an unmarried man living alone in his house. She even spends New Year's Eve sleeping over at his house!As if that's not enough, Bottle Fairy teaches poor morals. In addition to all the examples Sensei-san lays out, the fairies, and even his neighbor, Tama-chan, all set bad examples. In one episode, all four fairies marry the same man (polygamy). In another episode, Tama-chan is sitting on her front porch playing a video game, which would be fine, but it's a dating simulation game (usually suitable for 18+ only!)With that aside, the rest of the review...StoryThere is no story, really. Each episode stands on its own, and it keeps in mind the concept of 'During this month, we must do __________ in order to be human'. Acceptable, but not all humans follow those same traditions. Shortsighted and assuming.Story: 7/10ArtThe animation itself is very simplistic, dressing the fairies often in nondescript white blobs, as a service for their painfully generic Sensei-sama. The only reason it got more points was because of the artwork during the ending themes, into which it appears as though they actually put effort.Art:8/10SoundWhat, who pays attention to sound?Sound:7/10CharactersProbably one of the main draws to this show. The fairies, although all similar in that they have no idea about the human world, all have unique personalities, except for Kururu, who has absolutely no personality to speak of. It's rather typical of main characters, though, and not to be unexpected. Lost points due to Sensei-san being named Sensei-san.Characters:9/10EnjoymentEasy to watch, funny enough to matter. Many of the jokes are puns off Japanese words, and may not appeal to people who don't care about Japan. The rest of the humor comes from the interactions of the fairies with one another, and Hororo's brain short-circuiting.Enjoyment:9/10Overall:8/10Do not, absolutely do NOT watch this show for moral value.

If you want a real good story, look farther because Bottle Fairy is about 4 fairies who want to become human. They learn about us and try to be like us, what most of the times doesn't work...so it's funny too. Bottle Fairy is not really bad but not something I can recommend. "", 'i found the anime Bottle fairy  a really cute and anime seiriesthat can be enjoyed by anyone,the story maybe simple only showing 4little fairies trying to learn and study the human way of doing so they can be human,but its easy to understand the character design are really cute nice song and graphics ', 'First off, this is really stinking cute. It really was created for little kids to learn about their culture and in turn, it actually helps us understand a bit. It goes threw the 12 months and what happens in each month in Japan. It has a little bit of comedy in it, more in the sub then the dub because of word plays. The English does still have Japanese words in it and try to help explain them but it’s somewhat hard to understand when some of the pronunciations are off. One thing that I do wish they would have done was explain how they...came to be and how they found Sensei. I also wanted to know what Sensei’s real name was.The characters are easy to know who is who in personalities… infact, most of them can be seen in Lucky Star as well. Kururu sort of becomes the leader for most of it, rather athletic and loud. You can see her in Konata Izumi though not so much an otaku. Chiriri is the sweetheart, think Miyuki from Lucky Star if you need to. She is sweet, gentle, and motherly. Sarara is pretty much the Kagami of the group. She is pretty much a harsh character at times similar to a boy. And then there is Hororo… and she is sort of like Tsukasa and yet like all the others together. She is very spacey, always hungry, and extremely quiet. I guess you could say she’s the slow one.Tamachan is really off. That’s the grade schooler next door. She always says things that sound really smart and I guess if you were not really up to par with culture, you might think what she was saying was true some of the time, but she really isn’t right. She says a lot and yet doesn’t seem to say anything at all sometimes. Every once in a while, she will be right in some things.The art style is very moe. Those that don’t like moe will cringe and maybe weep if they had to see this. Colors are pretty much all pastel and gentle, there are three primary colors that are all over and each one goes for a special character, Kururu is blue, Chiriri is yellow, Sarara is red, and Hororo is green. Each in turn, you can sort of tell when someone is the main character on screen from the background.The music is alright, though the opening is a little bit sappy. It really shows that it’s for little kids in that aspect. In the dub, the Sensei sounds a bit dopy and not as good as in the sub. The girls also sound a bit too high pitched as well. They don’t really say the names right and the pronunciations also lack. Things just seem a bit off in that aspect.

The episodes are divided into months and each month has a Theme. The episodes are also very short, lasting onlt 12 minutes, but each are filled with cuteness.

With help from the one who looks after them, called ""Sensei-san,"" they do just that. But, in the process, their neighbor, a 7-8 year old girl named Tama-chan, misinterprets some of the things humans do, and passes it off as advice to the fairies.This gets repeated in each episode,...as the fairies learn valuable information that could lead them to become humans.I think this series could be completely enjoyable to someone who loves anime that can make them laugh, as there is mild humor in it. But if you like more serious anime that actually follows the story well, then I wouldn\'t go for this anime at all.I liked this anime because of the abundance of adorability and the music.

I got to tell you right off the bat that this show is almost too cute for me, after the first episode I got used to the cuteness though, but does that mean it will hold up to being a good series?...Not really, I mean its okay, but the characters are a bit bland and there isn\'t enough time for them to evolve their personality.  There isn\'t much comedy for me with this series, I only laughed a little because of the main casts adorable antics.

Eiyuu Densetsu: Sora no Kiseki The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10260/Eiyuu_Densetsu__Sora_no_Kiseki_The_Animation,"[""Video game adaptations are not easy to execute, and for good reason. Taking something from one medium to the other, especially mediums like video games or visual novels (in some cases, even manga) is difficult, because whatever has been written is written, well, for that medium.For example:1)- There's the interactive elements which simply have to be removed or done in a way that doesn't feel forced (if you've seen many video game or visual novel adaptations, you know what I'm talking about). Say, people randomly stumbling across the main character and talking one by one, or it being too easy to tell the important...characters from the irrelevant ones.2)- The world-building that is so intriguing and interesting may come off as boring and irritating in anime form, because since you're watching people infodump information rather than reading it at your own pace, it comes off as slow and dragging the show down.3)- The show may end up butchering all sorts of extra content, like side quests which may have added layers to certain characters, added to the feeling of adventure, fleshing out the setting or even simply being a fun scene where we see the characters messing around.With all this in mind, this adaptation of Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky manages to walk out not only as one of the very worst adaptations I've ever seen, but also as among the worst anime I've ever seen.The story is atrociously handled, with absolutely no set up towards any of the events in the story or any context as to why things are happening. You see, this technically isn't an adaptation of the first Legend of Heroes game, but rather its direct sequel which continues off the first game. Because of this, nothing makes sense if you haven't played the first game, and as such, it completely fails as a stand alone before it even starts.Secondly, the games' world is among the most well-written and complicated worlds I've ever seen in a fantasy work period. This adaptation fails miserably at providing us with a feeling for how the setting works, no reason about the majority of the conflicts happening and doesn't bother doing much of anything to make viewers acquainted.Last but not least, the games at their core are incredibly character-driven, with character motivations clearly built up and foreshadowed with a great deal of care and subtlety. None of that exists here, everything is in your face and over the top, and above all, the audience is disconnected from everything that is happening since there's no real reason to care.The animation is generally extremely fluid and nice to look at, with backgrounds looking pleasant and interesting. What isn't pleasant to look at, however, is the artwork. The games generally have an incredibly old-school feeling to them, and one major influence for the game's setting is the Miyazaki movie Castle in the Sky, which the character designs and backgrounds for both the original release as well as the Evolution remakes clearly reflect. This is thrown out the window, as none of the characters are clearly identifiable for most of the show, and especially the long distance shots look atrocious. The close-ups look pleasant, but the OVAs have a habit of rarely ever focusing on facial features, which ruins the almost non-existent immersion the viewer may have even further.The soundtrack is a treat for the ears, and I can confidently say that it is easily the best thing out of this entire mess. Many tracks which are already great in the games are remixed, and a special mention needs to go to the absolutely phenomenal remix of Silver Will. Seriously, here you go. You're welcome.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxTM6NaqWMMWhat you will regret, however? The voice acting. It's atrociously handled, the characters voice actors are constantly yelling for no real reason, everything is over the top and lacks any degree of passion or care and honestly feels incredibly ill-fitting (which is strange, considering that the same voice actors voice the characters in the Evolution version and they sound perfectly fine there). I blame whoever directed this travesty, it's clear they just wanted to cash in on some cheap money and didn't care about anything else.The worst thing about everything here are the characters, however. They feel like running cliches saying cliche things, and not a single piece of dialogue sounds like something humans would actually say. Why is this a problem? Because the game has among the most human characters I've ever seen in a work of fiction, almost every line they said to each other sounds natural and consistent, their traits came off as the results of their experiences and upbringing rather than being there simply because they have to be, and you know what? They grow up over the course of the games, practically each and every single one of them.You know, I can rant on about other things. I can rant on about how it doesn't follow the game properly, how it ruins the power levels (which are given an incredible amount of detail in the games), how literally half the story arcs within the games aren't there, how they ruined the beginning and the ending of the game, about how characters who should have died didn't, how they cut out entire characters out of the OVAs and so on.But you know what? Don't watch this. Play the games; they're immersive, rewarding, fun, interesting and above all, don't insult your intelligence the way this sack of crap does.I can confidently say that this is easily the very worst adaptation I've ever seen, and I recommend you avoid it.

Anime adaptation from a video game. Anyway, whatever it\'s called, my expectations are USUALLY low whenever a video game gets an adaptation, whether its a live-action movie(or simply just movie) or an anime. And to no one\'s surprise, Eiyuu Densetsu is no different. So for this, Eiyuu Densetsu Sora no Kiseki or Legend of Heroes : Trails in the Sky The Animation gets an anime. One note though, Nihon Falcom is one company which makes one of my favourite RPG game series - Ys.Getting straight to the point - Overall, Eiyuu Densetsu is just so-so. Story is so...very rushed (and very difficult to understand) and with the amount of episodes(only 2 with approx.40 mins each, since its an OVA) is just not enough for all to fit everything into that time span. It starts of with a very brief introduction of ""orbments"", goes straight into the OP then followed by a sudden ""kissing"" scene. Most characters don\'t get much (ANY, to be more exact) introduction themselves, so you might end up having a hard time knowing the characters.So the only two redeeming qualities for Eiyuu Densetsu lies in the action-scenes and the animation of the whole OVA. One word for the action - Incredibly satisfying. I\'m not kidding, the battles are fast, fluid and its pretty much the most you\'ll get of out Eiyuu Densetsu. How about the animation/visuals? Character visuals are very detailed and ""amazing"" is the easiest way to describe Eiyuu Densetsu\'s animation quality.Anyway, moving into more detail on the characters, you\'ll either love or hate them. Main character Estelle Bright is the typical tomboy who isn\'t so bright and is more to brawn over brains. Her past is later revealed in the OVA but only lasting for a couple of minutes. Joshua, is the typical cool and strong guy cliche. Like Estelle, his past is revealed, but again, very briefly. He is called the ""Enforcer No.13,"" but nothing is mentioned whatsoever about these so called ""Enforcers"" and his objective is to destroy ""Society""; again, nothing much is explained. Estelle and Joshua are the only two characters who gets most of the spotlight in the OVA, later on in the second episode of the OVA, majority of the ""other"" main characters get tossed out. Frankly, I don\'t even remember the names of characters (nor do I particularly cared for any of them) in the anime except the two main MCs.Ending was also very disappointing, it was clearly unfinished and much is left to be explained. But what much can I say? That was rather expected for a 2-episode OVA; introductions and explanations are simply non-existent. Perhaps if you\'re a fan of the video game, then just maybe you\'ll enjoy this OVA a lot more. Anyway, one thing\'s for sure, after watching that OVA, I\'m now very interested in trying out the video game. In conclusion, Eiyuu Densetsu : Sora no Kiseki feels like a very plain action(but with very solid action scenes) anime throwing out most of the story. very rushed (and very difficult to understand) and with the amount of episodes(only 2 with approx.40 mins each, since its an OVA) is just not enough for all to fit everything into that time span. It starts of with a very brief introduction of ""orbments"", goes straight into the OP then followed by a sudden ""kissing"" scene. Most characters don\'t get much (ANY, to be more exact) introduction themselves, so you might end up having a hard time knowing the characters.So the only two redeeming qualities for Eiyuu Densetsu lies in the action-scenes and the animation of the whole OVA.

Trails in the Sky is worst than most because this is actually an adaptation of the SECOND game in the series. Every emotional beat misses its landing, because it's missing the context of the entire previous game, and tons of stuff is rushed and insufficiently explained.  Furthermore, the game's final act was entirely cut from this adaptation. As a result, there's also details that are left hanging with no payoff. I can't imagine anyone who hasn't played to entirely get what's going on, or if they did,...I'm sure nothing would resonate.On the other hand, if you're a fan of the games, you'll likely still hate this adaptation. The way the games are designed do not lend themselves to an anime adaptation. They made tons of changes.What ticked me off the most is some changes to Estelle's characterization, which was one of the BEST things about the games, in my opinion. In the first game, she starts as a young teen, very silly, immature, and a little dumb. But her character experiences major growth.  She really matures, and becomes really competent and independent. Sure, she wants to find Joshua, but she also wants to be good at her job. When she finally meets him, she tells him off for leaving her, as SHE SHOULD. Because he chose to leave her without giving her any say at all. He told her he loved her, drugged her, then left. She's pissed that she never got a say.Meanwhile, in this adaptation, she's so weak. Her entire motivation is finding Joshua, then he appears just to rescue her, and she weakly begs him not to leave. But of course he does. They robbed the character of her strength, and she lost a lot of depth.They also chose to not keep the translation consistent with the translation used in the English ports of the game.  Enforcers are now the legion, Oroborous is mostly called the organization, and the Bracer guild is the association. It's very bland in comparison.The only good point I can say is they used the stellar music from the games for the OVA's soundtrack. The downside is that the music is usually faded into the background because there's so much talking as they rush to forward the plot.

Some scenes have also been drastically changed in order to fit some plot points in such a small running time.Overall I feel like if this was longer, they would have been able to fit the emotion the history deserved, however with only...the duration of a film that was just not possible to do, hell, they did not even finish the history to be honest. Still though, I found the animation to be enjoyable, and if you played the game ""The legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC"" you will probably find it enjoyable as well, so it is still worth a watch, just do not expect anything too great out of it. the duration of a film that was just not possible to do, hell, they did not even finish the history to be honest.

Futakoi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/125/Futakoi,"[""[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]Person A [sighing]: Man, that show was underwhelming.(Person B had just walked into the room, when he heard his complaint and asked.)Person B: Hm? What do you mean? What show is underwhelming?Person A: I mean…Futakoi is…boring and unoriginal. Well, not really, but it kinda is....Person B [confused]: I don’t understand. Could you elaborate?Person A [shrugging his shoulders]: Sure. The story is about a young boy named Futami Nozomu, who returns to his old town and attends a local high school, and while attending school, many girls begin to fall in love with the protagonist. But, here’s the catch, each girl that falls in love with the protagonist has a twin, so technically there are 12 girls (i.e. 6 pairs) going after the protagonist!Person B: Well, I guess that’s original. I mean, adding twins should spice up the story. Right?Person A [shaking his head]: Not really, because each girl doesn’t really have much of a personality and the same goes for our ‘lucky, happy protagonist. Basically, in this show, nobody has a really developed personality.Person B: The more I listen, the more it sounds like your typical harem.Person A [nodding]: Precisely. And I can name some of the cliches from this show:– Overly nice and ‘lucky’ protagonist with no redeeming qualities– Overprotective and badass butler– Jealous bullies and his associates who pick on the protagonist– Childhood Marriage Promise– Childhood friends (twins) in love with protagonist– Rich Ojou-sama (twins) in love with protagonist– Homeroom teacher and nurse in love with protagonist– Daughters of your friend’s mother declaring the protagonist as their future husband– Tsundere and well-natured girl in love with protagonist– Unexpected rival (with better qualities) appears– Home Economics Event (i.e. prepare food of protagonist)– Beach Episode– Cultural Festival– New Year’s Eve Episode– Christmas Eve Episode– Valentines Day Episode– Melodrama at the end– No Romantic ResolutionPerson B [surprised]: Wow. That is a lot of cliches. But, could you be more elaborate?Person A: Certainly. Futami Nozomu is a forgettable character, besides him smiling constantly and helping people, he's weak and a coward when it comes to confronting his bullies and his mortal enemy the 'badass goat'. He's 'lucky' because he runs into different types of girls by random coincidences and they all fall in love with the protagonist by his good deeds. Moreover, he gets jealous whenever a rival makes a move on his 'harem', making him appear possessive.Person B [shocked]: Wow! That's pretty bad.Person A: That's not the worse of it. The ending is terrible. There's this whole melodrama about the Sakurazuki twins being transferred away because the butler believes the twins are getting hurt due to Nozomu's indecisiveness and his inability to speak his true feelings. But, once Nozomu hears about the transfer, he suddenly becomes a 'man' and speaks his true feelings, thus preventing the whole transfer. In the end, all the girls becomes rivals with one another, as they fight for Nozomu's love. Funny thing is, Nozomu thinks in his mind, how great it was to return back to his home town. Pretty selfish to me.Person B [nodding]: I see. A typical harem ending, then. But, hey, if it’s a harem series, then there must be fanservice with lots of panty and boob shots, right?Person A: Actually, no. There is no blatant fanservice. No panty or boob shots. No ‘lucky pervert’ situation. Nothing. This series is just a  bunch of happy girls going after the protagonist with some forced drama.Person B: That sounds…boring.Person A: I know it is.The End Person B [confused]: I don’t understand.

But that\'s not important. What is important is that he was ""proposed\' to by a pair of twins before he left. He comes back to them, and they still like him/he likes them. As the story goes on, five other sets of twins make their introductions (his harem), and he has to decide who to love.Story (7/10)A little unoriginal, with male harem lead coming back to girls he left behind (ai yori aoshi),...but you could make the argument that more shows with this storyline aired after futakoi (kanon, myself; yourself). I\'m sure I missed some. The story was enjoyable. There was plenty of romantic tension, which is a must for harem shows to do well, in my opinion. Although the show is 13 episodes long, the show is nicely paced and doesn\'t seem rushed.Art (8/10)I don\'t have anything to complain about here. The characters look their age, the background art is well done, and the animation is fluid. It gets an 8 because it isn\'t overwhelmingly superb, like say, 5 centimeters/second was, but it gets the job done and leaves you satisfied.Sound (8/10)The OP was a good choice for the show; it set up the right mood to watch the show in. It was done by eufonius (they did the OP for the clannad series, which are some of the most musically beautiful OPs out there). It is really hard to fail with the main twins voiced by Yui Horie (Naru, Minori) and Ami Koshimizu (Kallen, Tenma). Nozomu is voiced by Claymore\'s Raki. I hated his voice in Claymore, but it works in this show quite nicely.Character (8/10)With six sets of twins, character development for all of them was impossible to do adequately in 13 episodes, and the show knew that. The show didn\'t take away from the development of the main characters by wasting time on minor characters. If it did, it was done to further develop the main characters. There is delicious tension between some characters, and plenty of love is thrown around too.Enjoyment (9/10)The show was very enjoyable for me. Very rarely was I so bored that I conscientiously wanted to fast forward to move the story along. It has its moments of comedy, drama, and romance, all of which are done to your satisfaction.Overall (8/10)My scores averaged out to exactly an 8/10. Futakoi is one of the better harem shows out there in my opinion. It offers a deeper kind love in a sense, because to love one identical twin over another (yes, all six sets of twins are identical) means you truly love them for who they are, not for their looks. If you\'re looking for a pretty good comedy/romance show that isn\'t all that time consuming yet leaves you satisfied, give Futakoi a try. It\'s a show that\'s not as well known as say, Love Hina, or Shuffle. It also doesn\'t have as much fanservice as either show. What it does have is a pretty good story that\'ll have you asking yourself some interesting questions, and leave you in a good mood when you\'ve finished episode 13.Note: This was my first review. If this review wasn\'t helpful, please spend the time to write me a quick personal message on what I did badly. Constructive criticism is highly appreciated.

Well, this is a story about a boy who is surrounded by twins and is haunted by the ancient myth of the small town that he moved to (wont go any further coz it'd be a spoiler =P)[Story]The story is very good, but not awesomely amazing. It follows the story of a boy called Nozomu and his two childhood friends: Sumireko and Kauruko. He develops a very deep relationship with Yura and Kira, the daughters of a rich person, with a stingy butler who dislikes Nozomu. There are A LOT of twins in this anime. They all seem to have feelings towards Nozomu. Which...one will he pick in the end? Thats the question that pops up in your head around the middle of the anime. It builds up the tension by ... oh nearly spoiled it for you there.Its a good plot and storyline that will leave you wanting just a little bit extra at the end[Art/Animation]The art/animation feels like a toddler walking around in your dad's shirt and pants. It feels  like they were running on a tight schedule and a low budget. The smoothness of the animation is great. Its just that the artwork feels somewhat childish and incomplete.[Sound]The sound is great period. You wont be disappointed by the characters sounding sarcastic at critical moments (*Glares at dubbed versions of Elfen Lied and Chobits*).[Character]This was kind of disappointing. They didnt go all the way with the Ichijou sisters or in fact any of the twins. They were trying to add color to too many characters in the short amount of time they had (13 eps). Ill give it a 7 because they havent completely failed in making the characters believeable.[Enjoyment]Even though this anime has its bad points, you dont realize the bad points until you actually sit down and think about it (like me writing this review). The anime is an 'on the spur of the moment' thing and can get really heart pounding and enjoyable at times. Im heart broken i have to give it an 8 because when you think about it, after you've calmned down, its not that awesome after all.[Overall]A modest attempt at a romance/harem anime with a little splash of humour.

Lala and Lulu were just there for comedic relief, same goes for the teacher twins. The Shirogane twins are the most interesting and overall best girls, but due to them coming into the series late they also very quickly fade as we have to focus on the very, very boring ""main"" girls.The Sakurazuki twins have the same gimmick...and behave in the exact same way, one is always just echoing the other and they don\'t really do anything to standout. It is the same character just copy pasted for threesome fantasy purposes. While they work well with other characters and added some decent comdedy due to their stupidity, their extreme similarity makes any scene with them feel sooooo sloooooow.The exact same problem goes for the Ichijo twins but even WORSE. They are both the typical ""kind"" girls and also the token osananajimi. Aside from a little in fighting that comes to a head later on, they are just BORING, there is no other way to put it. They are plain pieces of untoasted wheat toast.Harem series are very much about the quality of the girls and how much they manage to charm you, so having twice amount the girls should\'ve given this a decent leg up and get a wide appeal. However, due to most twins acting the exact same together or having a very lackluster dynamic you are left with nothing more than wasted potential for a otherwise decent premise.It doesn\'t help that the main guy is a coward who keeps romantically leading all the girls on (ON PURPOSE) only to then pussy out whenever things get too real and he has to actually make decisions that could impact him. He had to be guilt tripped into doing the right thing and even then it seems like he\'s just gonna get away with being a dipshit. and behave in the exact same way, one is always just echoing the other and they don\'t really do anything to standout.

This is the first series I've dropped.Maybe someday I'll come back to it just so I can have it completed, but as of right now, I can't stomach anymore of it.I'm not one for harem anime to begin with, the idea of all of the female love interests being twins however convinced me that maybe I can watch it to see how they decide to differentiate the characters and make each of them unique in their own way.They don't.You literally have a cast of duplicated characters throughout, which means you're just getting a double dose of generic characters. There are...twins that were friends with the lame protagonist since birth, rich girls that happen to notice his good deeds, teachers, children, you get the idea. They're all affectionate to the protagonist just because he's a #niceguy. The second another guy comes into the picture and states he has feelings for one of the several girls, the protagonist gets all mopey because it's possible he could lose one of his 12 options. He's a really lame character and his only redeemable quality is being in the right place at the right time, as his equally generic jealous best friend character points out.The art is atrocious. School Rumble came out during the same season and the art for that still holds its own. Many of the characters have ear piercing whiny voices, which is made worse because they do the generic thing where they have each pair of twins speak at the same time when they address the protagonist. It's strange that they even hired separate voice actresses for all of the love interests because they sound alike.I couldn't force myself to sit through any more of this series. twins that were friends with the lame protagonist since birth, rich girls that happen to notice his good deeds, teachers, children, you get the idea. They're all affectionate to the protagonist just because he's a #niceguy. The second another guy comes into the picture and states he has feelings for one of the several girls, the protagonist gets all mopey because it's possible he could lose one of his 12 options. He's a really lame character and his only redeemable quality is being in the right place at the right time, as his equally generic jealous best friend character points out.The art is atrocious.

Escha & Logy no Atelier: Tasogare no Sora no Renkinjutsushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21167/Escha___Logy_no_Atelier__Tasogare_no_Sora_no_Renkinjutsushi,"[""The thought of video game adaptations in film or anime usually leads one to imagine the more frequently popularized aspects of video games: Stylish violence and sensuality, high-velocity, no-holds-barred plotlines with worlds that need saving, and iconic, stone-faced heroes and heroines. Atelier Escha & Logy, an adaptation of one installment in a series of well-received roleplaying games, is about as far removed from that generalization as possible—its heroes and heroines are not particularly adept, and its focus drifts towards some of the more humble aspects of gaming, such as navigating the environment, gathering resources, communicating with other characters, and gradually honing skills. The idea is...respectable, but the result here is a slice of fantasy life that is calm and benign, but also difficult to become invested in.It is immediately clear that, whatever other virtues Escha & Logy might possess, a budget isn't one of them. Put bluntly, this show screams “cheap.” The backgrounds lack any noticeable texture or detail, and are reused frequently. The character art, while usually not too bad up close, can sometimes stray wildly off-model at a distance. The animation, bordering on cut-rate to begin with, actually degenerates in quality as the episode count mounts, until fight scenes or even just scenes of quick movement are nothing more than montages of still-frames.A simple lack of production values can, of course, be overcome by visual creativity, and a show with this much whimsy seems like a prime candidate for such a treatment, but a series of poor design choices prevent it from happening. Perhaps handcuffed by a desire to remain true to the game's image, the character designs here are about as typical as a fantasy can get—a witch is a girl with a hat riding a broom, a warrior is a bulky dude with a sword, and so on. Color, however, is the biggest obstacle to my saying this show looks anything but mediocre; the palette is painfully light in tone, with soft yellows, whites, and reds in huge numbers, and even its dark colors look bleached and faded, resulting in a uniformly washed-out blur of pastels. In general I'd rather not beat up a series for its looks, but there simply isn't a lot of room for compliments when something looks both creatively bankrupt and technically inept.The music, however, manages to slightly bolster the technical side of the series. It's difficult to pin down the vibe emitted by the show's setting—vaguely steampunk with numerous elements of medieval fantasy—so the soundtrack wisely paints in broad strokes, from soft modern orchestral to anthemic rock to Celtic-sounding folk music. Though it doesn't contribute much toward an overall sense of consistency, this scattergun approach works surprisingly well on a scene-to-scene basis; the score is a little too typical at times, perhaps, and a little too overwrought at others, but at any given moment the odds that it's complementing whatever is happening onscreen are solid.Escha & Logy's world is a barren one in which human settlements are ringed by The Land of Dusk, a wasteland of cliffs, deserts, and dry, cracked soil which cannot sustain plant life. Civilization has resorted to the research of alchemy in order to restore the desolate land to a more hospitable state, and main character Escha, who lost her mother when she was a child, is the last in a line of alchemists. Raised by the automaton Clone in the tiny frontier town of Colseit, she has joined her town government's research and development branch in order to assist with alchemical development and various expeditions into The Land of Dusk. There she meets Logy, an alchemist from a much larger city who has been sent to assist the Colseit branch in their adventures. The conceptual high points of the show are revealed early on—Escha's personal history merging with the history of alchemy and the battle to restore The Land of Dusk to a fertile state is a curiosity-piquing idea. Some scenes, such as the revealing of the town's generations-old, hand-tilled apple orchard, have a sort of modest grandeur. The lone spot of noble green in the wasteland, made possible only through hundreds of years of human effort and sacrifice, seems like a tiny hint at what Escha & Logy is about: The little ways in which we choose to fight ruination, be it within ourselves or within the world. Initially, the skeleton of a story seems to be in place.Unfortunately, it soon becomes apparent that a skeleton is all that it is. Escha & Logy is quick to talk at length about anything but its overarching plot, instead diving into a series of episodic shenanigans in which the eponymous pair explore old ruins or meet the many denizens of Colseit and help them through personal problems. They help a local swordswoman through a quarrel with her sisters, help a local witch capture a fire spirit, help a local girl with a wish to make medicine. The more the list goes on, the more disconnected the show begins to feel from what could have been its strengths—the dusky world eventually looms like a forgotten backdrop rather than an essential element, and the two main characters eventually seem more like walking panaceas who exist to provide conclusions for the stories of others rather than humble, newly-minted researchers with goals and motivations of their own. The arc which concludes the series seems like a slapped-together combination of all the standalone adventures, a desperate attempt to prove that there is, in fact, a narrative thread holding the show together. There isn't, though. A mindless amalgamation of supporting characters piled on top of a final objective does not a story make.That doesn't mean the series has nothing to offer. As far as simple, lazy, Sunday afternoon entertainment goes, one could do a lot better than Escha & Logy, but one could also do a lot worse. It's innocent enough in content, and each adventure can occasionally offer a tidbit of humor or a tidbit of genuine cuteness. There are men and women who need saving, pies that need baking, petite dreams that need to be reached. All of that has a certain charm. The series bumbles along, but, other than failing to capitalize on the potential of its own ideas, makes no great transgressions. There's nothing particularly malignant about it—the average episode is just a warm and fuzzy (if shallow and predictable) little story which might serve as that most basic type of escapist entertainment, vapid and insubstantial, but mildly pleasant and passable as a brief distraction.Ultimately, though, watching Escha & Logy feels a little too much like watching someone else play a video game, with each episode a quest. You can practically feel the boss at the end of the dungeon approaching, or the pop-up box of success when a character is helped. Simply by virtue of its constant movement from place to place, such a thing might draw the attention of the eye and the brain for twenty minutes. But when it's over, you'll take whatever miniscule reward it offers, walk away, and, hours or days later, forget that the whole thing ever happened. respectable, but the result here is a slice of fantasy life that is calm and benign, but also difficult to become invested in.It is immediately clear that, whatever other virtues Escha & Logy might possess, a budget isn't one of them.

To be honest I was satisfied by how the actual show turned out, it is simple yet fun to watch. The story isn\'t bad but not as consistent compared to the game, the art is pretty decent and the music is brilliant as well. I would recommend this show to everyone. ', 'So everyone knows this is based on game series and yes, it\'s not that easy to understand the whole thing without playing those games.Yet it doesn\'t mean that you won\'t be able to enjoy this anime at all. Even if you\'re not familiar with games, there\'s a certain aura to this anime that you can enjoy it as well as others do.Story 7/10 - isn\'t anything too complicated, it\'s rather easy-going, may feel a little slow-paced but that\'s just the nature of this anime. There\'s nothing much to talk about story actually, most of the episodes are concentrated on individual characters. They don\'t go...really too much into background and keep it easy to understand.Art is quite good, you can just see that on your own~ but it\'s nothing to great either so it\'s 7/10.Sound - well, it\'s all about taste I say, 8/10 for really relaxing osts.Characters - nothing too complicated here either, most of them are easy to understand/guess what kind of characters they are. Still they\'re rather enjoyable bunch of... ""people.""  ( not all of them are humans) 6/10 because there\'s nothing really unique here.Enjoyment - this is the key part of this anime, if you like animes like Aria for example, slow, relaxing, peaceful, than this is for you. Even battle scenes won\'t get you worked up. You can just turn this on and relax from a tiring day. Some of course can\'t really enjoy this kind of entertainment, but for some it\'s a rare opportunity to go into a fascinating fantasy world, where you enjoy every second you spend.Overall I give this 7/10. People who enjoy this kind of anime, should definitely watch this, and for people who\'re looking for fantasy world filled with action, keep looking, this one isn\'t for you. really too much into background and keep it easy to understand.Art is quite good, you can just see that on your own~ but it\'s nothing to great either so it\'s 7/10.Sound - well, it\'s all about taste I say, 8/10 for really relaxing osts.Characters - nothing too complicated here either, most of them are easy to understand/guess what kind of characters they are.

Although not many reviews or others have really focused on the what anime can teach someone.. but personally I think it is rather important to at least touch on it because it is something that many people overlook. Many people underestimate the power of anime.Anime is one of the few things that can shed\'s light on issues that people may not be able to understand, teaches and reminds us of morals and also provide entertainment for all kinds of people (but.. as we all...know..some things in anime that can be disturbing for some people and does tend to show women as objects in some anime)Escha & Logy no Atelier is an example of a pretty standard anime that centers around the idea of ""Don\'t give up on your dreams"".Story: 7The story is interesting and standard at the same time. It is about a girl name Escha who is from a long line of Alchemist and she starts working for the R&D branch of the Colesit. It then revels the back stories of the people around Escha. But what makes it interesting in the end is the part about the abandoned ruins and the connection it has with Escha and the others. I won\'t go into any more detail or else it\'ll revel to much of the plot. However as interesting as the plot developed it was still rather predictable. This is coming from someone who hasn\'t watched a large extensive amount of anime (around 50 days worth only at the time i\'m writing this review). It isn\'t some mind blowing plots like FMA or Guilty Crown. Overall in terms of story if you can get past the standard plot you\'ll find it interesting (I can\'t explain who it is because it\'ll give to much away)Art: 9The art overall was amazing just like any anime these days. There were a few scenes where the animation does glitch in a sense. Example- when it was Escha holding the envelope and then the next scene Logy has it all of a sudden. But otherwise it was amazing  in terms of colour and art.Sound: 8There were two songs that stood out to me from this anime. The opening theme was good in terms of how it fits with the anime. Also the piano theme that comes out whenever something sad would happen was also pretty suiting. However I wouldn\'t say it has a masterpiece soundtrack like Clannad, Guilty Crown, FMA, and Angel Beats. Or anything extremely catchy like Binbougami ga! or Melody of the Wild Dance from Bleach. The voice acting in anime as usual always impress me. The voices suited their character, I can\'t imagine Escha\'s voice sounding like Clone\'s voice xD..that would be different.Character: 6Ok..here is the part where I found that this anime had problems with. However I don\'t want to discredit the character set-up, which was very suiting and I thought was well planed for this type of anime. But there was little to no character development in this anime (although it is hard with 12 episodes). To kind of put in context.Escha: Care free, Airhead, Kind, and skilled in alchemy at the start-> then becomes Care free, Airhead, Kind, and still skilled in alchemy.Logy: Resolved, Mature, Strong, Caring, Smart (you\'ll get why if you watch the anime) he then becomes... EVEN MORE RESOLVED, mature, strong, caring, and still smart.Linca: Strong.. Like so strong she could punch through walls and fight a small beast that can turn into a huge frikin dragon. She then becomes pretty much the same by the end. However for Linca I felt that this character was pretty well made. Especially her back story did make things very very interestingWilbell: well... how do I put this..... she\'s not your stereotypical witch that\'s for sure. But she is caring (especially for Nio), laid-back and seemed to be very strong in magic (but it\'s hard to somewhat tell because of how rushed the anime was)Ya... you pretty much get the point.... However I really like the character set-up and I really wished they did more with it. I would have loved to see more development with Nio, Marion and Lucille. Also they kind of screw with you w/ Logy and Escha relationship.... it\'s like they are teasing the audience sometimes xDEnjoyment: 8Ya.. I liked it.. it was a fun anime to watch if you don\'t want to watch anything really intense. But I think if you can get passed the rushed plot Escha & Logy no Atelier brings some interesting aspects and I wished they would have developed it more.Overall: 8I wouldn\'t reallly feel comfortable recommending it to others if I know they don\'t like animes that aren\'t original or mind blowing but it\'s one of those anime\'s that one could enjoy watching every once in a while.

(although i know it would bug a lot of veteran anime watchers because of how standard it is)', ""Although the story may be told in a different way, the anime adaptation of Atelier Escha & Logy is by all accounts a solid and competent one; as an avid fan of the game I can vouch for that- allow me to explain.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The story of Escha & Logy is but a simple story centered primarily around the themes of cooperation, ambition, caring for the natural environment and the perils of the unbridled lust for wealth. In fact, such are the themes that deeply pervade the Dusk series in the Atelier franchise of video games.However, what differentiates this anime adaptation from the video game is that...the game focuses more on establishing and developing the setting of the world of Dusk while less so on the individual characters themselves. The characters themselves do have many interesting, heart-warming and heart-felt moments, but they are all ultimately overshadowed by the melancholic bleakness of the seemingly never-ending Age of Dusk which has continued to go on for many millennia.Which contrasts it with the anime, whereby the story instead places greater emphasis on the characters and how their individual motivations are deeply connected to the aforementioned themes; thus, while the games are a fair bit more complex as it seeks to further elaborate upon the world of Dusk, the anime's story line is more simplified and the core themes of the Dusk series are constantly reinforced via individual plot points that are developed based off the characters for a thematically stronger, more concise narrative. This is true for the tone of the narrative as well, for just as the games are bleaker and much more melancholic and aims to inspire awe at the grandiosity of the ancient alchemic civilization, the anime is much more lighthearted and optimistic in return.In regards to the overall scripting of the anime, many events and character arcs have been rewritten to a significant extent in order to promote this alternative narrative focus. The anime features many original and altered plot points that are actually creative, well-constructed and cohesive while paying homage to the first 2 games. The anime also features additional lines of dialogue that are exclusive to the anime, as well as integrating many lines that were originally found within the game and reworking some of them to better fit the altered events and character arcs. And while this does lessen the poignancy of several plot points within the game, the anime however manages to compensate for that by ensuring that its new and altered plot points and dialogue are up to par and faithful to the source material.Very impressive work indeed, I must say.Narrative, Thematic & Scripting Design/Direction (Rating: 8)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The visual qualities of the anime adaptation are well-made and many of the artistic designs from the game are faithfully recreated and adapted. This can be found in some of the backgrounds which feature solid watercolor and pastel work. In general, the color scheme of the anime is much lighter and softer than what can be found within the game where it is very deep, rich and vibrant, but this change in color scheme helps to further accentuate the lighthearted tone that the anime adaptation opts for- thus sufficiently differentiating it from the game and providing it a distinct identity.Animation wise, the show is overall decently-animated with hand drawn and computer-rendered animation being used in tandem. The hand drawn animation is rather decent, however it frequently suffers from characters being off-model when they're portrayed at a distance (especially the details on their faces- eyes specifically), but the computer-rendered animation on the other hand is surprisingly well-made and very well integrated with the aesthetics of the show, wherein it adopts the same color scheme. There's no choppiness in the frame rate of the computer-generated models either which only serves to enhance the seamlessness of the viewing experience- minus the off-model characters.The particle effects, lighting effects and camera work overall are also well-done, and can be quite impressive at times. The shot composition and editing of the material is very creative in several scenes, but can sometimes be uninspired or sub par during conversational scenes where the characters are mostly static.Finally, the OP sequence is easily the best animated aspect of the show, what with fluid animation, energetic editing, and stellar camera and effects work. The ED sequence however is slower-paced, focusing on developing a calm, wistful atmosphere when an episode comes to an end.And therefore based on the points that I brought up, I can unreservedly say that this adaptation is without a doubt, competently produced... Just work on those faces alright? Please?Visual & Animation Design/Direction (Rating: 7)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The sound design in the anime adaptation is well-done overall. Sound effects are very varied and adequately depicts the action on screen, in addition to being professionally made. The anime's approach to the soundtrack on the other hand consists of original material that are faithful to the style of music found within the more recent Atelier games, in addition to incorporating a few of the tracks found within them as well.The voice acting is once again well-done with the voice actors from the game reprising their roles in the anime adaptation. There are simply no complaints in that regard or even to the overall aspect of the sound design, for the standards are high and the quality assured.Sound Design/Direction (Rating: 8)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{See P.S.}Characters Rating: N/A~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To conclude, I would like to express that I personally found this adaptation to be quite enjoyable, and am delighted that it's a creative and well-made alternative retelling of the overall story of the video game. It's just that perhaps due to many constraints, the anime adaptation was just simply unable to greatly expand upon and incorporate both the character-focused and setting-focused narratives into a larger whole. This is disappointing but regardless of such constraints, I can very easily recommend this anime to anyone who's a fan of the Atelier games or even to those who are interested in history and fantasy in general.Personal Enjoyment/Appreciation (Rating: 6)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~And with that, I shall bid all of you farewell and thank you for reading- till next time then!(Personal Rating: 6)(Critical Rating: 7)P.S.: I have stopped using the 'Characters' dimension as a separate category of analysis in my reviews, as I have found it to be redundant since incorporating discussions on character design as part of the first analytical category. the game focuses more on establishing and developing the setting of the world of Dusk while less so on the individual characters themselves.

The anime features many original and altered plot points that are actually creative, well-constructed and cohesive while paying homage to the first 2 games. The anime also features additional lines of dialogue that are exclusive to the anime, as well as integrating many lines that were originally found within the game and reworking some of them to better fit the altered events and character arcs. And while this does lessen the poignancy of several plot points within the game, the anime however manages to compensate for that by ensuring that its new and altered plot points and dialogue are up to par and faithful to the source material.Very impressive work indeed, I must say.Narrative, Thematic & Scripting Design/Direction (Rating: 8)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The visual qualities of the anime adaptation are well-made and many of the artistic designs from the game are faithfully recreated and adapted. This can be found in some of the backgrounds which feature solid watercolor and pastel work. In general, the color scheme of the anime is much lighter and softer than what can be found within the game where it is very deep, rich and vibrant, but this change in color scheme helps to further accentuate the lighthearted tone that the anime adaptation opts for- thus sufficiently differentiating it from the game and providing it a distinct identity.Animation wise, the show is overall decently-animated with hand drawn and computer-rendered animation being used in tandem. The hand drawn animation is rather decent, however it frequently suffers from characters being off-model when they're portrayed at a distance (especially the details on their faces- eyes specifically), but the computer-rendered animation on the other hand is surprisingly well-made and very well integrated with the aesthetics of the show, wherein it adopts the same color scheme. There's no choppiness in the frame rate of the computer-generated models either which only serves to enhance the seamlessness of the viewing experience- minus the off-model characters.The particle effects, lighting effects and camera work overall are also well-done, and can be quite impressive at times. The shot composition and editing of the material is very creative in several scenes, but can sometimes be uninspired or sub par during conversational scenes where the characters are mostly static.Finally, the OP sequence is easily the best animated aspect of the show, what with fluid animation, energetic editing, and stellar camera and effects work. The ED sequence however is slower-paced, focusing on developing a calm, wistful atmosphere when an episode comes to an end.And therefore based on the points that I brought up, I can unreservedly say that this adaptation is without a doubt, competently produced... Just work on those faces alright? Please?Visual & Animation Design/Direction (Rating: 7)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The sound design in the anime adaptation is well-done overall. Sound effects are very varied and adequately depicts the action on screen, in addition to being professionally made. The anime's approach to the soundtrack on the other hand consists of original material that are faithful to the style of music found within the more recent Atelier games, in addition to incorporating a few of the tracks found within them as well.The voice acting is once again well-done with the voice actors from the game reprising their roles in the anime adaptation. There are simply no complaints in that regard or even to the overall aspect of the sound design, for the standards are high and the quality assured.Sound Design/Direction (Rating: 8)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{See P.S.}Characters Rating: N/A~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To conclude, I would like to express that I personally found this adaptation to be quite enjoyable, and am delighted that it's a creative and well-made alternative retelling of the overall story of the video game. It's just that perhaps due to many constraints, the anime adaptation was just simply unable to greatly expand upon and incorporate both the character-focused and setting-focused narratives into a larger whole. This is disappointing but regardless of such constraints, I can very easily recommend this anime to anyone who's a fan of the Atelier games or even to those who are interested in history and fantasy in general.Personal Enjoyment/Appreciation (Rating: 6)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~And with that, I shall bid all of you farewell and thank you for reading- till next time then!(Personal Rating: 6)(Critical Rating: 7)P.S.: I have stopped using the 'Characters' dimension as a separate category of analysis in my reviews, as I have found it to be redundant since incorporating discussions on character design as part of the first analytical category."", ""This anime in every way is my least favorite anime. It can really be summed up as extremely boring.The characters are very boring, there is nothing important going on in the story. I wouldn't recommend it, but that's just my opinion.

Polluted water works in konosuba because they added comedy to it, there is no comedy in the anime. It's was not a fun time the only thing i will give the...anime is the art style is decent.

It turned out more like a slice of life, at least for the first half of the series. Two alchemists start working in the Development Department and from then on the first half of the series is largely focused on our main characters, Escha and Logy, meeting the rest of the cast. Small things do happen, but nothing plot focused happens until...the latter third of the series. Although there was not much story to be found, the last few episodes picked up the pace quite quickly, and what was there was enjoyable and relaxing to watch.

The character design is nothing startling, the only one who stood out a little was Escha with her tail. They weren't bad though, and they didn't suffer too much from same-face syndrome. One thing I did like about this was when you were introduced to new characters, the game-like pop up came up with a short description. A nice touch!Sound - 8/10.The opening theme for this anime fits in nicely with the largely character relationship based first half of the series - it is quite catchy to boot. The actual sound within the episodes I didn't notice too much, they were neither amazing or bad. The general slice-of-life ish sounds were there, but not overbearingly so, it just set up a nice atmosphere. Character voices were good, not great, though I thought Clone's seiyuu did a nice job of making her sound monotone and machine-like, as she is not human but crafted by alchemists.Character - 7/10.The characters in this anime were largely lovable and worked well together, though there was not much development or change in them due to the lack of stuff happening. They get a decent score for their interactions and the fact that each one of them is relatively unique in their own way, and though you don't learn much about their back stories you learn a little about each one eventually which gives them a little more depth. It was a shame the relationship between Escha and Logy was not developed a little more, at least for me - it was easy to see their chemistry and feelings for one another.Enjoyment - 8/10.Despite its flaws, this was a great anime to watch. It always helped me to relax after the more action-centric shows airing this spring and it was generally lovely.

If you're into alchemy, magic and supernatural then this anime would be one of the best. Normally I'm not into alchemy, but this series made it look amazing. The two main characters (Escha & Logy) were great characters to take note on for development in personality. You could also see the romance between them sometimes( sadly it never happens T_T). The characters were developed really well, and you could see their...personality within the first line they said!The story was only just being fulfilled in the last couple of episodes. The other episodes seemed like filler, but was drawing in more characters for the finale. The last episodes were based on action and strategies.Overall, it was a really good anime for those who like anime that have a daily life setting, but with a lot of twists. It showed a lot of character and mystery throughout the episodes, which made me keep on wanting to watch the rest.

It's unassuming from the surface and doesn't really stand out as something I would particularly like, but a few episodes in and I was hooked.  The worldbuilding is incredibly rich, and the characters are each unique in both personal and visual design.  Despite having somewhat of a large cast, I wasn't ever annoyed or put off by the characters.  The plot progression was very gamery, but I feel like that was never a detriment to the overall feel, unlike with so many other video game adaptations.The biggest strength of this anime is the...characters and the environment those characters build.  There's no real social tropery going on, and despite having few men and many women, the interactions are pleasantly free from haremization.  On the contrary, it feels like everyone is extremely deep, so deep that every time you interact with them you're learning more about them and their past.  That's a very realistic way of including character depth that eludes even the best writers sometimes, and I was really happy to see it on display here.  If I had to pick a second strength, it would be the character models, which impart a real sense of beauty and wonder to the show.  In particular, the Hummingbird Princess was particularly well done, but with all the characters their models were both distinct and notably devoid of fanservice.I would say the weak points were the appalling animation, the time wasted with the one tropey fanservice episode, and the ending.  But animation and sound quality are really just icing on the cake for me, so I'm still going to give this anime an 8.  It probably objectively deserves more of a 7, but there were a lot of things which had a sort of personal appeal.I'd recommend this anime for anyone who likes fantasy, can look past bad animation, and likes soft and pretty worlds and plot structures. characters and the environment those characters build.

Posting now cause why not?)Most anime are made to sell or promote their source materials via it be manga, light novels, or video games. Escha and logy is the latter. Escha and logy is set in a fantasy world with magic, witches, and alchemy. But due to certain circumstances the world is slowly coming to an end. So the people of the world decide to work together to try and halt their spending doom. The story follows our two protagonist, Escha and logy.The show is like a slice of life in a fantasy world. Most of the episodes are episodic...with only one plot line being brought up at near the end of the series. This is one of my main gripes with the series. The show was awfully boring for the most part. We got to learn the core mechanics for the world and nothing else happens after. You think with the worlds impending doom there would be some kind of urgency, but guess not.The budget for this show was pretty much non existent. Lot of the artwork looked jarring at times. The animation wasn't very good. The movement wasn't very smooth  and looked very unnatural at times. Also I understand many studios use recycled animations, but when the same scene happens four times in a row its very noticeable. The color palate for this show was very dull and bleak, which did fit for the show and its setting.The characters for this show are just the basic archetypes that we see all the time.

This anime will be forgotten like so many others and only be remembered by the few who did watch them. with only one plot line being brought up at near the end of the series. This is one of my main gripes with the series. The show was awfully boring for the most part. We got to learn the core mechanics for the world and nothing else happens after. You think with the worlds impending doom there would be some kind of urgency, but guess not.The budget for this show was pretty much non existent. Lot of the artwork looked jarring at times. The animation wasn't very good. The movement wasn't very smooth  and looked very unnatural at times. Also I understand many studios use recycled animations, but when the same scene happens four times in a row its very noticeable. The color palate for this show was very dull and bleak, which did fit for the show and its setting.The characters for this show are just the basic archetypes that we see all the time.

It adapts one of the most popular entries in the franchise, but that game is the second in a trilogy and the anime assumes that you played the first game. Well, I haven\'t. And the way that it incorporates the first game tries to hit a middle ground where it\'s clear that knowing exactly what the references to it mean isn\'t very important, but that also makes those moments seem pointlessly vague. That\'s not a huge quibble with me, but it\'s why I wouldn\'t recommend this unless...you already like Atelier, like me, and you might play the Dusk Trilogy one day.It is pretty good (sometimes very good) at capturing the FEEL of the Atelier games, which is my favorite game series. It\'s slow and steady with a lot of focus on the characters and their relationships with each other and the place where they live. It\'s practically a pastoral story, and I love that stuff. But it always feels like it\'s missing something, and that something is the interactive component. In the Atelier games, you are the one collecting ingredients and trying to get the right arrangement of traits and quality. It breaks up the conversations and story beats and, especially, the fighting with a unique puzzling element. Without that, it feels like experiencing an Atelier game with just the cutscenes, which seems like it would be unpleasant to me. The aggressive cuteness of the characters might wear on me over time without a buffer, like it did here.A particular way it captures the feel of Atelier quite well is by showing off a lot of cost-saving production work. I know people are going to say this show looks like crap because it doesn\'t have many (if any) scenes that belong on Sakugabooru. But that\'s fundamentally misunderstanding the aesthetic of this series. Atelier games never look *horrible*, but they do look cheap because they reuse assets from previous games and aren\'t very high-poly. And that\'s fucking great. They turn out a new game every year and focus almost entirely on the story and it works for me every time while not killing the game developers. I want games with worse graphics made by people paid more to work less and I\'m not kidding. This is what games used to look like, and it still looks good without requiring years of crunch. And, so, the anime seems to use a similar approach. There are a lot of scenes that are barely animated. They use postcard memories. They use shots that are clearly based on shots from other shows. I love that shit. Work smarter, not harder.Also, because the obvious ship is between Escha and Logy, this series is missing the obvious Shoujo Ai vibes of Atelier that I enjoy. We get a little bit at the end, but it\'s not enough.But, yeah, this is a pretty weak entry in the franchise overall. I enjoyed parts of it and I dig it in concept.

This anime is a disappointment.The premises were interesting, but the development is boring, and the plot goes nowhere - it\'s not fun enough to be called a comedy, not enough action to be a battle shounen, and it doesn\'t have the balls to be truly dramatic. The animation is ok. The soundtracks are decent. It\'s pure nothingness. The characters are uninteresting and bland, with little to no arc, and the ending is so anti-climatic and pointless, underwhelming, that it... indeed perfectly matches the way this anime felt the whole time. Underwhelming.You\'re left with a frankly uninteresting and tedious slice of life...that ends where it began, with no overarching stake and no actual progress made - the FMC wants to explore the ruin of an ancient civilization or whatever? She does (yay!), everything falls apart, a girl nobody cares about finally appears (after being hinted at the whole series), talks with a robot for two minutes, and then basically dies. That\'s it. That\'s the ""main"" plot. Nothing worthwhile happens, and the male MC departs. Just like that. He just goes. Wew, there goes nothing, right?All of the ""effort"" for naught - completely inconsequential: they didn\'t find a solution (not even the promise or prospect of a solution) to ANY of their issues. And again, the rushed departure of the male MC who goes back to the big city within the last 10 seconds of the last episode, with no prior preparation or anything: totally anti-climatic. This anime is a complete defeat and a waste of time. Go watch Ryza\'s Atelier\'s instead.I\'ll give it a 6 because, give and take some forced last-minute revelations, that little ""story"" you\'re shown is solid enough not to be total trash, but I see no reason why I\'d ever recommend anyone to watch it. that ends where it began, with no overarching stake and no actual progress made - the FMC wants to explore the ruin of an ancient civilization or whatever?

Orpherus, nicknamed Orphe, is surrounded by his friends and rivals and together they struggle to make their dream come true — being the king’s advisers.First seasonThe first season begins by introducing the characters, their past and their ambitions. Orpherus, Eduard, Camus, Ludwig and Naoji are five noblemen who attend the prestigious Rosenstolz academy, and who are a part of the Strahl class...– a class for potential candidates for the advisory positions in the royal palace in the small European country of Kuchen. Isaac is an English writer who visits Kuchen. While still students, the five noblemen are forced to deal with corrupted politicians, secret agents, attempted murder and ambitious individuals from both inside and outside of school who threaten to break the fragile peace in their country, and even assassinate the king.Second seasonThe five Strahl candidates return to their final year in Rosenstolz, but troubles are far from over. The previous headmaster disappears without saying a word and the new headmaster has a revolutionary idea that threatens to tear the academy apart. But there are troubles not only inside the academy. The king is hiding information, Lui’s mother is depressed and Lui himself is being accused of severe treason. While on the run Orphe is nearly shot once again, and Ed finds out that figures from their past have once again arrived at Kuchen. Now the five of them must prove Lui’s innocence while stopping a hideous ploy to sell Kuchen to foreign hands.My thoughts:Although subbed this anime was really good. I enjoyed it. The characters are great and stay the same in both seasons with a few new characters introduced in season 2. I really like Eduard. His friendship with Orpherus is very deep; they have a understanding of each other and can sometimes know what the other is thinking. I recommend both for your viewing pleasure. – a class for potential candidates for the advisory positions in the royal palace in the small European country of Kuchen.

Himitsu no Akko-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3285/Himitsu_no_Akko-chan,"[""As a magical girl anime enthusiast, i wanted to check out the anime that served as the pioneer for the FIRST REAL magical girl transformation.I had only watched one episode of it which is the VERY FIRST episode that has been fansubbed into English. I've gotta say that although the VERY FIRST transformation sequence in magical girl history is VERY underwhelming, i give it a pass because it was made in the 1960s so the creators had little opportunity to make it MORE alluring.It is still kind of entertaining to watch even if it's just one episode especially when you compare it to the magical...girl anime that came BEFORE it, Mahou Tsukai Sally. Unlike Sally who is a magical princess from an alternate dimension, Akko-chan is a ORDINARY school girl who was given EXTRAORDINARY magical powers so it is kind of nice to see the girl using her brains to figure out how to use her given magic to solver her problems.Though she is a normal kid with some selfish desires to use their given magic to achieve, Akko also has a heart and learns to use her magic powers to help others as well.Plus, some of the best episodes of the anime involves the MAIN direction of the anime's assistant director, Isao Takahata, where his emotional and empathetic directing style is at work in there somewhere.Overall, despite being an antique from the late 1960s, the FIRST Himitsu no Akko-chan is a surprising mix of comedy, melodrama and fantasy elements that STILL holds up which is impressive by the standards of anime that was BORN from that time period. girl anime that came BEFORE it, Mahou Tsukai Sally.

The animated series followed the series Mahoutsukai Sally as another defining work when it comes to the girls entertainment in Japan in 1960s - 1970s.The series follows Kagami Atsuko (Akko) who at the start of the series had buried a mirror after it broke and is presented a magical mirror from heavens as a present for her kind gesture towards the old mirror. This mirror holds a very special power that allows Akko to transform into anything that she wills by chanting a magical phrase ""Tekumaku Mayakon"". The...exploration in the series is focused mainly on this power and how Akko utilises this power to help her friends and relationships while also exploring these relationships in depth and from different perspectives utilising this power.The series also poses an interesting approach to the characters and the morality of Akko posing as these different characters to escalate or fix these situations. The power is also used to drive home the comedic presence of these characters and escalate the situations to highlight the comedic aspect of the series. The relationships and their importance around Akko is also highlighted through the usage of the transformation power that Akko utilises in the series.When it comes to the characters Akko herself is obviously on the focus when it comes to the series. The surrounding characters are mainly presented as ""caricatures"" and serve as a contrast to Akko and the power, the surrounding characters also highlight and escalate the comedy and other situations that arise from Akko utlising the power.The art style of the series draws parallels to the earlier series ""Mahoutsukai Sally"" and I\'d say utilises similar approach when it comes to the design and visaul aspects of the series.

Godzilla 1: Kaijuu Wakusei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33783/Godzilla_1__Kaijuu_Wakusei,"['I wish I could enjoy this movie in its entirety, but alas, that\'s only the last 30 minutes of it. For all it\'s elaborate setup, it\'s still a simple, cheesy kaiju movie. Have the monster appear out of nowhere, cause carnage and destruction, work out a solution, proceed to the cheesy action. It\'s a shame such a simple sequence of events had to be made convoluted mostly because the screenplay had to fill the alloted 1:30h hour mark for a full on movie to be released in theaters.The story is the worst part of it. Gen Urobuchi could never make exposition dumps natural or compelling...in any way. So the 1st whole hour is just a grueling trudge through pointless politicking and technobabble all alluding to the final fight and the character of our MC. It is blatant, obvious and patronizing, on top of being needlessly convoluted. Godzilla attacks! Gasp! Let\'s have 2 alien races come and not-save-us-by-making-mecha-godzilla, cuz we need to throw that reference in, all to have us start in the setting of spaaaace! What the fuck does space have to do with my kaiju apocalypse?! The movie agrees and has us go back to Earth... 1000 years post-Godzilla cuz spacetime continuum. Except it\'s 10 000 years once we see the Earth, except it\'s 20 000 years after we examine the carbon contents of the plants. So all this setup was to just get us into a jungled up foggy ass Earth to face Godzilla, and dinosaurs while we\'re at it! All the talk about living in a ship, wandering through space, that\'s just to fill time, we\'re on Earth, so everything\'s fine right? It\'s not like you\'ll be facing those same issues when plant leaves are harder than your pocket knife and shatters it on impact. There\'s no point to it all, it doesn\'t ground itself for the super serious tone it goes for, and doesn\'t really explore the despair it mentions.Characters, as usual, make the story in anime. Except when they don\'t, when we have a rebellious MC that starts out with a suicide bomber threat because he cares for his grandpa, only to obsess over Godzilla\'s murder for the rest of the runtime. Very consistent, deep character writing indeed. Metphies, the ""alien"" companion gets a special mention as being the plot device that enables the MC to be batshit crazy without consequences and be reprimanded again, on top of blatantly stating in metaphor what\'s about to happen, the worst kind of foreshadowing, when you\'re too lazy to allude it and just outright state it. He also doubles as a mouthpiece preaching not-Christianity like a crazed priest, who worships *drumroll* God(zilla) - The King of Monsters!The rest of the cast are your usual military hardasses and politicking council members who don\'t do jackshit, but get to expodump it anyway. The rival that screws the MC, gets it wrong and redeems himself. Add a stock waifu, and bam, a whole cast of colorful characters which you will instantly forget once you\'re done watching!Polygon Pictures have been infamous for their shoddy CG Netflix shows, but this time, they actually improved their model rigging and it doesn\'t feel like animations are played in 15 FPS. Movement is just smooth enough to feel natural from the characters. The grimy aesthetic isn\'t bad when it works, but those are rare few moments. The shadows are too heavy, too high on contrast, the metalic scratches don\'t seem natural at all, the background art which they use seems unpolished and blurry in order for the CG to fit in easier. And despite all that the directing is competent enough to make use of 3DCG action framing that makes things feel tense and exciting. A shame that even the director\'s professional work couldn\'t make up for Urobuchi\'s amateur approach to exposition and setup. And something important for Kaiju fans- Godzilla is but ugly and the crew knew it, the shots were skewing away from the rough model, deliberately avoiding to show it off. It\'s very disappointing to see how the studio is taking 1 step forward, yet 2 steps back into the pit of ""CG trash"".Sound design just doesn\'t really match what you\'d imagine is bullets hitting metal-like objects. There\'s no real satisfying crunch to the explosions, just a loud noise. Again it falls down to the serious presentation of the show falling flat on its face, As all the the inappropriate OST used for key battle scenes, it really takes you out of the experience, trying to piece together what it\'s conveying with techno chip music when it\'s been using ambiance and orchestra for the most part. Shows that live off spectacle alone can get away with shoddy SFX if they get it right, and even when it does, it\'s immediately undermined by another sound effect that just doesn\'t seem to fit or make sense, because the audio director also didn\'t have a good idea of what the scenario was supposed to be.The only enjoyment I got from the movie is the Godzilla fight obviously. It\'s so cheesy, and very much feels like a video game boss raid. Controlling the movements, the timings, positioning, distracting aka aggro control, now THAT is some fun stuff to any gamer to observe. Virtual tactics applied in a movie. On top of the visual spectacle, the movie redeemed itself on that front, as an in-the-moment thrilling joyride. Only to end on a cliffhanger with a cynical message that holds no water or meaning due to the empty setup up to the Godzilla encounter.So yes, this is a pretty awful movie when you watch it with any modicum of standards, be it for narrative or visuals. It doesn\'t even work as a cheesy action flick due to the grueling 1 hour exposition setup before the actual Godzilla scene. It was torturous to watch, and I didn\'t even get a proper reward for getting to the end, I only got another preaching lecture to hype up the next movie, as this is now a trilogy... yay... in any way. So the 1st whole hour is just a grueling trudge through pointless politicking and technobabble all alluding to the final fight and the character of our MC. It is blatant, obvious and patronizing, on top of being needlessly convoluted. Godzilla attacks! Gasp!

It\'s not like you\'ll be facing those same issues when plant leaves are harder than your pocket knife and shatters it on impact. There\'s no point to it all, it doesn\'t ground itself for the super serious tone it goes for, and doesn\'t really explore the despair it mentions.Characters, as usual, make the story in anime. Except when they don\'t, when we have a rebellious MC that starts out with a suicide bomber threat because he cares for his grandpa, only to obsess over Godzilla\'s murder for the rest of the runtime. Very consistent, deep character writing indeed. Metphies, the ""alien"" companion gets a special mention as being the plot device that enables the MC to be batshit crazy without consequences and be reprimanded again, on top of blatantly stating in metaphor what\'s about to happen, the worst kind of foreshadowing, when you\'re too lazy to allude it and just outright state it. He also doubles as a mouthpiece preaching not-Christianity like a crazed priest, who worships *drumroll* God(zilla) - The King of Monsters!The rest of the cast are your usual military hardasses and politicking council members who don\'t do jackshit, but get to expodump it anyway. The rival that screws the MC, gets it wrong and redeems himself. Add a stock waifu, and bam, a whole cast of colorful characters which you will instantly forget once you\'re done watching!Polygon Pictures have been infamous for their shoddy CG Netflix shows, but this time, they actually improved their model rigging and it doesn\'t feel like animations are played in 15 FPS. Movement is just smooth enough to feel natural from the characters. The grimy aesthetic isn\'t bad when it works, but those are rare few moments. The shadows are too heavy, too high on contrast, the metalic scratches don\'t seem natural at all, the background art which they use seems unpolished and blurry in order for the CG to fit in easier. And despite all that the directing is competent enough to make use of 3DCG action framing that makes things feel tense and exciting. A shame that even the director\'s professional work couldn\'t make up for Urobuchi\'s amateur approach to exposition and setup. And something important for Kaiju fans- Godzilla is but ugly and the crew knew it, the shots were skewing away from the rough model, deliberately avoiding to show it off. It\'s very disappointing to see how the studio is taking 1 step forward, yet 2 steps back into the pit of ""CG trash"".Sound design just doesn\'t really match what you\'d imagine is bullets hitting metal-like objects. There\'s no real satisfying crunch to the explosions, just a loud noise. Again it falls down to the serious presentation of the show falling flat on its face, As all the the inappropriate OST used for key battle scenes, it really takes you out of the experience, trying to piece together what it\'s conveying with techno chip music when it\'s been using ambiance and orchestra for the most part. Shows that live off spectacle alone can get away with shoddy SFX if they get it right, and even when it does, it\'s immediately undermined by another sound effect that just doesn\'t seem to fit or make sense, because the audio director also didn\'t have a good idea of what the scenario was supposed to be.The only enjoyment I got from the movie is the Godzilla fight obviously. It\'s so cheesy, and very much feels like a video game boss raid. Controlling the movements, the timings, positioning, distracting aka aggro control, now THAT is some fun stuff to any gamer to observe. Virtual tactics applied in a movie. On top of the visual spectacle, the movie redeemed itself on that front, as an in-the-moment thrilling joyride. Only to end on a cliffhanger with a cynical message that holds no water or meaning due to the empty setup up to the Godzilla encounter.So yes, this is a pretty awful movie when you watch it with any modicum of standards, be it for narrative or visuals. It doesn\'t even work as a cheesy action flick due to the grueling 1 hour exposition setup before the actual Godzilla scene. It was torturous to watch, and I didn\'t even get a proper reward for getting to the end, I only got another preaching lecture to hype up the next movie, as this is now a trilogy... yay...', 'Godzilla has had it rough since his reawakening. With the boringly slow pace of the Legendary Godzilla, to the blazing fast pace with no real motivation that was Shin Godzilla, none of the recent Godzilla movies have really been all that good lately.Will this Movie make the difference and usher in a new age of excitement and kaiju goodness for Godzilla and all his fans?No… no it won’t.To be honest… the trailer was enough to make me want to avoid this movie. The CG looked god awful, and I wasn’t entirely impressed with the premise… I don’t even really understand what motivated me to...watch it. I should have skipped it as I had originally plannedThe movie was poor on all accounts, but the thing I want to complain the most about is the visuals… they are awful. Nothing looks good. Everyone looks like videogame characters from ten years ago, and the G-man himself looks like a giant lump of bashed metal. No details to pick out at all. His overall design seemed to me to emulate the Legendary (thicker) design, and as I wasn’t a fan of that design to begin with, rubbing all the detail out and making it look metallic didn’t help.It wasn’t all bad though… there was this moment when, not one, but TWO alien races came to the planet to kill Godzilla and failed spectacularly… the ridiculousness of it did make me laugh… it was the only laugh though.Speaking of these aliens though… why didn’t either of them mention to the humans that “Look, we’ve been refugees ourselves for like… ever? There are no planets out there, fight for this one” at the beginning? And what happened to their “fleet” of ships. Did they just drop some of their kind off and leave?” Why didn’t humans evacuate on those ships since all of these aliens just seem to be so “we’re in this together”?There was also a off hand remark about how one of these aliens has seen the fall of civilizations all over the galaxy, and MOST of them fall to creatures like Godzilla.That last one took me out of the experience more so than ANYthing else in this God(zilla) forsaken movie. What are the Kaiju then? Are they actual tools of destruction? Tools for whom?All in all, the movie was terrible. watch it.

For everything that happens, I didn\'t feel like I was rewarded or really that surprised, even with the ending events. Although it does open it up nicely for part 2 and 3 in the future. This movie is a glimpse at what the whole series could have been but never quite gets there.Note - This review will be spoiler-free so I won\'t go too deeply into itAs for the story, it was one of the movie\'s biggest...letdowns. While I admit I have not seen any Godzilla films before, I could tell this was a change from what I have heard about other Godzilla movies. With the premise of the film being the monsters have invaded Earth, destroying everything and Godzilla rises above all of them, killing everyone including the other monsters. The humans fail and even with the help of two alien species (only thought there was one originally). They fail to kill Godzilla so they go off to space to find somewhere else. That was the interesting parts, but this is never really extended.They could have then look at morals of being with other ""aliens"" for one thing, I mean surely if you are on a ship with a load of aliens with you all alone in the vastness of space, not knowing if you are ever going to find a habitable planet to live on, that there would be divisions starting to appear in the community. Not just leave it as oh the committee are starving everyone so they are bad. Only then having them not really protest against anything at all for the rest of the movie??? I wouldn\'t know though as the film never really tells much the audience that much. That is the problem that keeps occurring throughout the film. While I agree it doesn\'t need to tell us everything, you hardly learn anything which doesn\'t fit the pacing of the show which is slow yet fast...Which leads me to my other main problem with the story, the pacing is poor. The pacing is too slow for the film to be an action thriller, while it\'s too fast to be able to explain much. It\'s weird as it seems like it is slow but it then it looks like it skips mini events, making the whole story feel incomplete.Moving on to the art, I was disappointed with it (best part of the film as well). I have seen the best of polygon pictures works with ajin and knights of sidonia (Pingu in the City does NOT count) with the animation in them suiting the shows and looking good/decent because of that. For this though, while it was nice in places. It was not really improved compared to other polygon picture tv series which you come to except this not to be the case. In fact, I would say it is worse than them. I don\'t mind this type of CGI that much, I mean the animation for space portion of the film and the last event, that was good. But for the rest of it, it\'s just a lack of effort with elements looking similar to each other and colours moulding into one instead of blending together with the fog to limit the fov. Also, I was pretty sure they blurred bits of Godzilla as if to make look faster, not really sure why. Movies are usually meant to be pretty crisp but this film isn\'t really.Sound...well very mediocre with not really remembering much of it music wise. Only the ed song was decent and that was about it. While for va, well I couldn\'t really tell you much since not many people talked that much other than the mc and his two buddies. I didn\'t feel much from the va so it was pretty forgettable.Now the other main problem with the film...the characters.The range is pretty bad, we have the mc who I have not seen him smile once yet and is always thinking about just killing Godzilla instead of anything else such as relationships and protecting others lives. The film is pretty much mostly focused on just him as well (except for his alien buddy). This really affects the plot as it doesn\'t allow for anything else to be explored at all, no fears, no morals, no friend beef (that mini fight by the ladder was pathetic so doesn\'t count) none of that. That only leaves focusing on killing Godzilla and THATS IT. The others barely say anything to build up their characters properly and mc alien buddy is always just serving the mc like some king and he has the second most lines. I would honestly say that Godzilla himself had more lines than most of the cast and he can\'t even talk.All the complaints with big problems with the story, I still kind of liked parts of the film. I can see why people like it. It is simple (too basic for me but anyway) and interesting (can be) that isn\'t saturated with action. It just doesn\'t push itself to be anymore though which is why I can\'t give it a higher rating.Overall, I just wouldn\'t recommend it, it isn\'t a cheesy action flick, nor is it a well detailed/explained story. It just leaves it with something eh and never really rewards you anything at all.note - The film will be part of a trilogy so you can\'t really skip this. Just will have to see how the next one is then... letdowns. While I admit I have not seen any Godzilla films before, I could tell this was a change from what I have heard about other Godzilla movies.

After being adrift in space for what they think is 1000 years they finally go back to Earth and try to kill Godzilla.Yep it\'s a very simple, run of the mill story that has absolutely nothing interesting going for it,...hell it took more than half of the movie for Godzilla to show up and it wasn\'t even the original one apparently.The buildup to the battle is so boring, I was starting to fall asleep numerous times, because it was boring the hell outta me.Whats also really stupid is that the movie jut keeps on changing the amount of time humanity has been away from Earth, they thought it was a 1000 years, then it\'s 10,000 years and finally it lands on 20,000 years. It just kept me thinking like ""ok does the film even know how long they\'ve been away"" because it was so stupid seeing this change happen so often.Even when we get to the battle with Godzilla, it felt so poorly done that it\'s probably the worst battle I have ever seen with a giant monster, so you know you fu*ked up if I\'m saying that.The film pretty much ends with the humans thinking they\'ve won, then the real Godzilla appears and completely annihilates them, until an after credit scene shows us something complete bullsh*t.Characters (1/10)The characters are the worst part of the entire thing, I\'m not even gonna say stuff about any individual characters, because they were so horribly bad and boring that I honestly wanted Godzilla to kill every single one of them.Trust me if you\'re watching this for interesting or badass characters you\'ve come for the wrong reason, in fact don\'t even watch it in the first place.Art (4/10)The only thing that has some kind of redemption is the artstyle, now Blame was the most recent anime movie I had seen that was in the 3D format and it looked pretty damn good, here I will give credit for the characters looking pretty smooth and the spaceship looked pretty awesome too. However that\'s where it all stops because Godzilla looked absolutely awful and I\'m glad that wasn\'t the actual Godzilla, because when that one showed up it looked pretty damn cool.The spacesuits, vehicles and weapons all looked bland as hell, like run of the mill stuff you see in low budget video games and there were also 3 different species of humans, yet there was no clear differences apart from skin colour and facial hair, which is a poor way to identify them.Also the landscape for Earth looked boring too, just jungle and even then we\'re mainly looking at the dropzones so that just made the movie even more boring to look at.Sound (3/10)God the sounds were horrible, the soundtrack sounded like it had completely butchered the Godzilla theme and was just awful, even the sounds of the weapons and vehicles sounded completely lackluster and had no omph to them.Also whenever the humans were being attacked by those random ass monsters or Godzilla, barely any screams were given off when someone died or got knocked over and it made me think ""what people aren\'t afraid of dying anymore?"" and it was just stupidly random that they didn\'t put any screams in.Extras:This movie definitely had some of the most boring action I have ever seen, despite how terrible the movie was, I was hoping the final fight would manage to save it a few points. But nope that wasn\'t to be and it just ended up being a stupid fiasco.Enjoyment (2/10)Overall (3/10)Overall this was a terrible movie, probably the most terrible anime movie I have seen to date, which sucks because it\'s a Godzilla movie.

Polygon Pictures led the way for this one. Yes, the studio behind Ajin. So, I\'m pretty hopeful. I haven\'t reviewed anything bad from Urobuchi. Plus, Godzilla is just easy to write for. So, let\'s see how this goes.Story:We open with a space ship. Aboard, we find a young man, Sakaki, threatening to blow a shuttle craft to smithereens because he doesn\'t want the higher ups to send a bunch of elderly volunteers down to a harsh planet and, most likely,...their deaths. His grandfather talks him down and he\'s arrested. We then go into a painfully long exposition dump about how the humans were forced to flee Earth when Godzilla appeared. And here you thought that climate change was going to make our planet inhospitable for us. After failing to find a readily accessible planet to colonise, the crew decides to return to Earth and try to retake it. Thankfully, Sakaki has a plan that might be able to beat Godzilla if she\'s still there.Okay, here\'s the big problem with the film. We barely see Godzilla. And I know that was common in the old films but they were dealing with a guy in a rubber suit or animatronics with a limited budget for a model city to destroy. There were practical reasons for it that don\'t exist in an animated feature. We see Godzilla very briefly in the flashback and then we see her almost an hour into the hour and a half film. And there\'s nothing interesting to take up that time.\xa0 There\'s a long exposition dump, a bunch of techno babble and a bunch of non-characters looking around what\'s become of Earth.Here\'s another issue, there\'s not much reason for them to actually want to retake Earth. They know, even before they land, that Godzilla is still\xa0 on there and the atmosphere\'s become such that they can\'t survive outside of their space suits. One of the characters actually suggests settling on the moon and taking scavenge trips to Earth for resources as a safer alternative, but it\'s after they\'ve landed and it\'s become difficult and I just wonder\xa0 ""why didn\'t they do that from the get go?"" Seriously, if their probes showed them the atmosphere issue and they knew Godzilla was still stomping around, why didn\'t they just make that their first plan? Because then they wouldn\'t get the Earth itself back? You mean a planet that\'s really hostile for them? Oh no, what a tragic loss. *sarcasm*So we don\'t just have a tedious build up but we also have\xa0 a conflict born out of nonsensical decisions. And you\'d think maybe it gets entertaining when they actually encounter Godzilla, but that isn\'t the case. The climactic battle is really shit. I\'ll go into more detail when I talk about the art.Characters:There\'s not much to say about the characters in this. Sakaki is obsessed with revenge\xa0 because his parents died due to Godzilla when he was just a lad. The other characters fulfil very basic roles like the religious one, the stern warrior or the girl. Considering how much time we spend with these guys before the action even starts, you\'d\xa0 think they\'d have some modicum of personality. But, no.Art:Let\'s get right into the big problem with the big, humans versus Godzilla sequence. Godzilla barely fucking moves. Seriously, most of the sequence sees her standing like a bloody log with the occasional light tilt to fire off\xa0 a burst of atomic breath. Then we get to see the humans in their futuristic vehicles shooting at Godzilla and grimacing. When the unwieldy rubber suit moves more dynamically than your animated version, you know you screwed up. And the futuristic vehicles look less impressive than the ones that were in that C.O.P.S cartoon I reviewed. Yes, the cartoon from the 80s with lazy animation looked better than this film.Sound:This is one of those works where you know the actors are capable (they got actors like Miyano Mamoru & Sakurai Takahiro) but the script really gives them nothing to work with so you end up with performances that are, at best, barely passable. Hattori Takayuki\'s OST is, unfortunately, not very good either. His work for the Slayers film was much better.Ho-yay:Sakaki and his male alien friend are pretty touchy, but they also aren\'t well enough developed for their relationship to have much to it. I will say, it\'s the closet thing to a romance the film has\xa0 but that isn\'t saying much. It\'s basically just the least shit relationship dynamic so it wins by default.Final Thoughts:This film is pretty abysmal. To recap, long exposition dump, a bunch of techno babble, nothing and a disappointing climax where the monster barely moves. the only Godzilla film that this is better than is the American one from 1998 and the cartoon based off of that was better than this. It earns a full 2/10. Tomorrow, Mahoutsukai Sally the film version, obviously. their deaths. His grandfather talks him down and he\'s arrested.

It\'s basically just the least shit relationship dynamic so it wins by default.Final Thoughts:This film is pretty abysmal. To recap, long exposition dump, a bunch of techno babble, nothing and a disappointing climax where the monster barely moves. the only Godzilla film that this is better than is the American one from 1998 and the cartoon based off of that was better than this. It earns a full 2/10.

A whole lot of world building and exposition, some brief, sporadic action scenes involving nameless characters dying in bloodless battles, and then a big, pretty boss fight at the end filled with heroism, explosions and the word ""BASTARD!"" being yelled a lot.Unfortunately, Godzilla doesn\'t really work as an action film the way Blame! (kinda, sorta, not really) does. The best Godzilla films are not action films, they\'re disaster films. It\'s fun to watch cities (usually Tokyo, which must...have the record for number of filmed destructions by now) get torn down by a giant fire breathing lizard while humanity struggles to find a way to deal with it. The monster\'s defeat usually comes about via science and human ingenuity, because if you could just shoot at Godzilla and kill him, that would be pretty f*cking boring.Godzilla: Monster Planet bypasses everything fun about Godzilla, and is indeed pretty f*cking boring. An under-prepared military team fights a weird, dog/lizard Godzilla-ish thing in a forest (eventually, after what seems like hours of exposition). No buildings to be torn down, no panicked evacuations, no hard choices by political leaders. Just a big, stationary monster to shoot at in the woods. It\'s videogamey, it\'s lame, it\'s what netflix thinks anime fans want (and maybe they\'re right :/).I wasn\'t completely let down by the film though. The animation is decent if you can stomach Polygon\'s signature CGI, although there are some recycled shots and lazy mouth flapping scenes (you know, where the only thing animated is the mouth?), but overall it\'s a pleasant film from a visual standpoint. It\'s also tough not to get hyped when you hear the old-school Godzilla roar. It means sh*t is about to hit the fan, and you better be ready, even if in this case sh*t hitting the fan is just Sergeant No Name and Lieutenant Tough Guy blowing up on their hover bikes because they can\'t dodge Dogzilla\'s slow ass laser beam.So yeah, long story long this movie kind of sucks. It\'s disheartening to see Polygon Pictures blow another big chance at making a decent adaption of a great brand, but what can you do?

It should have been extended into a 12 ep series, going deeper into characters, motivations and decisions. My score is as generous as i can bring myself to be. I feel that most people will at leave having felt that this was rushed and should have been expanded. Wasted potential and opportunity.Worst point i'd say is character development. There is very little in the means of complexity. Many characters are relatable, decisions are understandable and emotions are sympathisable...to a point. It is a very shallow point and, as is...a theme throughout, it just needed..more.Best point i'd say is spit between animation and story. There were some parts of the animation that were better than expected, and some that weren't. But on the whole, better. The story and premise and series of events was also not terrible, but it had so much more potential. a theme throughout, it just needed..more.Best point i'd say is spit between animation and story.

They managed to make a film about Godzilla into a snore fest. Prepare for massive spoilers if your a massive Masochist and are gonna watch this despite the warnings.~Spoilers~This was my first time watching a Godzilla film made by Japanese. So it might be me and my overly high expectations but I was expecting something decent. It was so much worse and I actually enjoy that shitty \'98 film Godzilla more than this.At least with \'98 Godzilla, there wasn\'t just an unending feeling of boredom. I am able to sit down and watch that film while...laughing at how bad it is and some of the scenes were actually pretty decent. But this Godzilla film is just boring.Takes 53 minutes of this 1Hour 30Minute film to actually see Godzilla. Hell, That estimate might be off and could\'ve taken longer.So you must be wondering, What the hell do they do for 53Minutes? Well, a whole ton of nothing.  It mostly consists of the MC (Haruo) Bitching and moaning while people praise him for his plan to kill Godzilla.Haruo honestly is an obnoxious existence. He is the embodiment of cliched Japanese boy. He lost his parents at a young age, He\'s a rebel and does what he thinks is right and isn\'t afraid to go against authority. He\'s also a mastermind Genius that has no faults what so ever.Actually, When I heard he was gonna nose dive into Godzilla and sacrifice himself, I was actually getting a bit excited hoping this annoying character would die. But sadly no.~World Building~So we get this god awful exposition dumb that goes on for about 10 minutes. Pretty much saying how shit Human life is and how we had to evacuate Earth.As soon as I realized that this film is gonna be about Humans leaving Earth. I realized I wasn\'t gonna like this film. It\'s such a dumb thing to do. If you have the power to make long-lasting Spaceships and Warp capability. Wouldn\'t it just be easier to lead Godzilla onto a Giant ass rocket and send his ass into space? The story tells us no reason as to why or how come they can\'t. This honestly seems like a way more practical thing to do then Humans abandoning Earth. I also always hated this Plot development in stories.We are also told that... Fucking Aliens are in this. This shitty new development happened during the Exp dump. It\'s just like "" Hey Yeah Monsters are really being a nuisance, Also there are Aliens"" They don\'t really offer anything and have no special abilities or appearances that are different than Humans. You\'d also think that fucking Aliens with would be able to do shit. Such as towing an Astroid right onto Godzilla or something. Not only just one Alien race shows up. But two. I really want to know the chances that they\'d just show up at that moment when Earth needed them.~Action & Weapons~The action in this is pretty bad. Earth is completely taken over in this new form of mutated plants and Monsters. Barely some ruins still exist of a city. But you get no Godzilla destroying cities or anything. It all takes place in some forest that looks really bad. There is no real scale of the Size and destructive power of Godzilla. It looks like some slightly tall monster is fighting against a bunch of small Robots. The New Godzilla that Is over 300M or about as tall as the Empire state building if I remember correctly. He doesn\'t look that menacing at all. He\'s just there and all we see is some tall monster.The weapons in this are all futuristic. We aren\'t ever told the power they hold behind them or anything. But let\'s say you see an Attack Helicopter like an Apache or a Tank like the M1 Abrams. You know that these are powerful machines and are not something to be trifled with. So when you see them doing nothing against a Godzilla then you realize how great of a Monster this thing is. But these futuristic weapons that don\'t seem to have any power or weight behind them with stock audio sounds. It\'s just kind of boring watching. How are we meant to know what these weapons are able to do and how effective they are. They just look like stock explosions going off.Then there are some small things that make no sense. Like why do these Landing Ships have Unguided bombs? Modern Militaries don\'t even use Unguided bombs nowadays. So when we get scenes where a ton of bombs drop but most of them land nowhere near Godzilla, I can\'t help but feel annoyed. This wouldn\'t be a problem if you were using a more precise weapon. There are more examples of annoying small things.Here is the most annoying thing. The entire time that Humans on Earth were Fighting Godzilla, They never once thought about his weakness? It seems really obvious and when we are told that they dropped an over the top 150 Nuclear Warheads and it didn\'t even kill him. It makes no sense. It\'s even more laughably dumb when some edgy kid on a spaceship 20 years in the future can figure that out but not all of the worlds best scientist with the impending destruction of the human race can\'t figure out.Hell, We are shown that a bunch of rocks are able to stop the Godzilla that is fought in this film. I really got to wonder if this was just an unstoppable monster or Natural Selection at work.~Characters~I talked about this a bit earlier in the review. But let\'s talk about the Characters.Haruo- Like I said earlier. He\'s the cliche Japanese schoolboy with a dark past and is somehow really skilled even with no training or experience in anything. He literally is just a kid on a spaceship. His constant ranting is not fun and his zero regard to human life is annoying.Memphis- Is one of the Aliens. He is pretty much just an Elf. That\'s how the entire race is portrayed. An Elf. All wise and skilled with a strong devotion to something.Mulu- Is also an Alien and is pretty much just a Beastman you see. The ""Alien"" Races in this are pretty much just reskinned versions of Fantasy roles we see so commonly in stories. Nothing original about them. This dude is no different.Yuuko Tani- is actually surprisingly the only character I liked kind of. She\'s the only one that has some interest to her character. It\'s kind of interesting seeing her question whether or not her Grandfather\'s shuttle was sabotaged or not. She also is the only one that doesn\'t do anything obnoxious really. I\'d say she is a decent character that you may find in other popular shows and an excellent character in this. I actually think she should be the MC instead of what we got.~Animation~Now lets talk about the Animation. It\'s completely CGI besides the Expo dump at the start and that\'s in 2D stock images.The animation is decent. I quickly got used to the weirdness of it. I think Kimono Friends has much more appealing animation than this.The issue for me is the Environment and monsters look bad. I don\'t know if it\'s cause of the restrictions with the program they used to animate. But the Environments all look the same with no detail and has an uncanny appearance. It\'s kind of hard for me to explain.Then We get to the monsters. They are just not good. They all have this weird look that just doesn\'t seem right. The Godzillas now. That\'s something else entirely.They look so bad that I almost laughed. They look like a group of muscles put together. Nothing about them looks even decent and I never thought I\'d actually say this. But the \'98 Godzilla looks better and more like a Godzilla then these things.Overall, Is this thing bad? Yes defiantly. Is this the worst thing ever? No. But it\'s not good. It\'s insultingly boring and bad. This is the first time I\'ve rated a show I\'ve watched this low. I think you are more likely to find interest out of something like Boku No Piku then this.Edit: i forgot to mention this. But I only remember ever hearing one song throughout the entire movie. It was at the ending credit scenes. So you get a lot of quite scenes that don\'t fit. The one song we do get I actually think is pretty good and doesn\'t fit being in this story. laughing at how bad it is and some of the scenes were actually pretty decent.

Not ""The Hobbit"" slow but slow none the less.The sound was outstanding, there was one moment just before the credits rolled and the use of sound honestly sent a shiver down my spine it was just stunning.Overall the movie was definitely worth the watch and was actually really enjoyable, despite what people say about it i thought it was a nice take on the Godzilla brand that brought something new and refreshing to the table.Also just a heads up there was a scene after the credits on Netflix so watch out for that. get me wrong isnt a bad ideas its just a bit slow.

However for other Kaiju fans, this film promises to be the start of something definitive when it comes to the MonsterVerse. The film shines with it's crisp animation and voice-acting. I highly recommend watching the Subtitled version with Japanese audio, as the English audio has more than a few issues with both translation, and syncing with lip-movements.When it comes to the story, one does get a sense that too much as...been added into the pot too early. In particular, the introduction of two extra-terrestrial humanoid races, who's motivations and rather convenient timing of arrival raises questions, and the fact that very few monsters actually appear alongside Godzilla which is kind of a downer if the title says 'Planet of the Monsters'. However, when you take into account that this is 'Part 1' in a trilogy then it's always good to have things that need further development and explanation. Presuming that the explanations and development will be done well.Another aspect where the film has done well is the evolution of Earth itself. Earth has been devoid of humans for 20,000yrs. and as such, the planet itself has been molded around it's new occupants, the Monsters. Without spoiling anything, all I'd like to say is, the concept of 'evolution' is a key plot point. Aside from that, Kaiju lovers (especially those who have followed Godzilla over the years) will be elated to find mention and references to some of the most iconic monsters from the Godzilla franchise. So, if you crave Kaiju and animation then Godzilla Planet of Monsters is the film for you.P.S.: As a marketing strategy for the trilogy Toho studios (creators of Godzilla) have launched a book called 'Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse'. Which explains the timeline of when and which monsters began appearing on Earth. The book is yet to be translated from Japanese into English, but several amateur translators have managed to translate bits and pieces of it online. YouTube has a few videos talking about the excerpts from the book, so happy hunting. been added into the pot too early.

I love Godzilla movies and I love Sci-fi and mecha.Overall: 8This is great in terms of a movie but since it is a movie things will be rushed. I feel that this would've been better split into episodes. But everything felt really rushed. The story progressed way too fast to be really enjoyable. If this were made episodically then I'm sure the rushed feeling wouldn't be there but would throw something off. If it were made into a series of movies like the Break Blade series then there would be enough time for everything without the feeling of being rushed.Story: 7I believe there...could've been more in terms of background information and substance it felt a bit lacking but with what it had I believe that the story was adequate enough not to be too troubled by it.Art and Animation: 93D art and animation brought a new style to Godzilla. Big fan of Knights of Sidonia they both have the same off white textures and scratch patterns. I didn't even need to see the full trailer to know that this was made by Polygon Pictures. I know 3D art can be a downer for some but its still well worth the watch.Sound: 9Music fit the scenes very well, bringing, more excitement every time. Great soundtrack selections.Character: 7There could've been more character development but then again there are restraints on time since it is a movie so all development has to be condensed or rushed. There's no building of a viewer-character connection or feelings for any of the characters. A characters death that I'm sure if a connection was developed would've brought some emotion didn't because of insufficient character development. I will personally say that if this movie wasn't pressed on time duration, character development would've been significantly better.Enjoyment: 8If it wasn't for the rushed feeling, I believe that I would've enjoyed this more.

The story is really typical... the monsters came from nowhere and now the humanity is basically extinted.There are some new elements in the premise... but nothing really innovating. The animation has some pretty scenarios (really beautiful)... but the character's design is ugly... not THAT ugly like in Ajin, but bothers a little.There is no great character here, but there are some great moments in the story (the last 30 minutes).If you are looking for a cliché kaijuu apocalypctical story with some good scenarios... here it is!! "", 'So... this movie happened. And, as I had anticipated, I did not enjoy it. It\'s unfortunate because I love the Godzilla franchise, honestly. Even the goofy movies where he\'s doing wrestling moves.Story: 3/10So, the story is that a bunch of Kaiju popped up on Earth one day, forcing humanity to go into space to seek another planet. Eventually, the last of humanity decides to just return to Earth, believing that Godzilla and Co. would probably be dead by now (like a few thousand Earth years had passed by the time they decided to go back. All in all, it\'s not a very good story (which...doesn\'t really affect the final score because Godzilla movie plots are deep as a kiddy pool, usually). It\'s little more than a vessel to move the plot and to allow for some Kaiju action.Art: 1/10This movie looks TERRIBLE! Outside of a select few ""passable"" looking Godzilla scenes, it looks like an unreleased PlayStation2 game cinematic. The decision to make the entire thing CG was very poor. I don\'t expect it to look like something out of MadHouse, but good lord is it hard on the eyes. The sad thing is, the movie could have been redeemed if the art was halfway decent. I\'ve seen better stuff animated in MMD.Sound: 5/10The sound is actually alright. I watched the dubbed version and it was above what you generally get. The music was also decent. Really gave off that godly vibe when the choir kicked in during the Godzilla scenes. Outside of Godzilla\'s atomic breath making a dubstep BWAAA noise, there isn\'t much to complain about when it comes to audio.Characters: 4/10The characters were fine, and you understood their motivations well enough. It\'s a shame the artstyle was so godawful I had genuine difficulty differentiating between them, at times. Otherwise, not a terrible cast of characters (just don\'t go in expecting them to be memorable).My overall enjoyment: 3/10At the end of the day, even if this is technically apart of a series I love, I can\'t look past the flaws. Even if everything is hovering around mediocrity, the animation just drags the whole thing down. In a visual medium like animation, a lot of the enjoyment comes out of the art, which is just awful here. Seriously, get a better studio to produce one of these next time.

Polygon Pictures (a CGI anime studio that brings you Knights of Sidonia) provides the movie\'s animation and IMO is the second movie after Blame! and is a part of Polygon Pictures Anime Universe. (Ahem) Let\'s get to the review, shall we?Voice Acting:In terms of voice acting, They brought all-star cast members and their voice acting skills are good....Music and Sound:Awesome music and sound especially during Godzilla fight scenes that bring you to the edge of your seat. However, in terms of sounds of gun shots and explosions, it doesn\'t looked like one that you\'ve heard from most action anime and movies.Story:Sadly, the story has several inconsistencies and plot holes that make you feel confused and makes you say ""Why we don\'t fight Godzilla and take back what he took from us?"", ""Why we abandoned our home plant in the first place?"" and ""What\'s Godzilla\'s purpose in this world? Is he an ally or a threat to humanity?""Overall, the movie is one of the worst Godzilla movies that I\'ve ever seen despite it\'s good voice acting and suspenseful music. I hope the sequel will correct this blunder in the future. Music and Sound:Awesome music and sound especially during Godzilla fight scenes that bring you to the edge of your seat.

Do keep in mind that it was all done in CG.Plot: It actually pretty good even though it sounds like something a japanese Micheal Bay wrote.The plot however in the beginning part seems very unnesscarily complicated. There is also a romance thing that really sucks as the two individuals apart of it have little chemistry and I feel little to none spark with them as it is a one-sided relationship.Characters: The characters motivations really make sense but the extras...are exetremly unconvincing and get inspired way to easily. It\'s like every character is Deku (My Hero academia) that grew up but still has the mentallity as his 6 year-old self. The main character Harou is a pretty big edge lord and is Mr pissed off for the whole facking movie. The other cast members are pretty plain and uninteresting except for Metphies who looks like trouble and peaks my interest.sound:The voice acting is done very well as expected from a movie but it isn\'t somthing to gloss over. Some sounds have too much bass and would make your head vibrate at the right volume if you chose to wear headphones (godzilla\'s roar). The music sounds very epic or intense all the time and really engrosses you in the battles and some action scenes.animation/artThe animation is done in CG and in regular scenes it takes some time to get used to or not be distracted by it. However the action scenes and camera work in action scenes are done very well and look really great all together.The backgrounds look really cool and full of life. The characters movements look kinda weird with them being CG and all which is very distracting as stated before.setting/atmosphereThe settings in this movie look very cool and actually pretty nice as they reflect Gozilla\'s impact on the world. The atmosphere in this movie is very tense for the most part or gives off a grand feeling of epicness during an action scene ( since Godzilla is a giant and all).conclusionIn conclusion ""Godzilla: Planet Eater"" is an above average sci-fi action movie with a great setting, a wannabe edgelord protangonist and a soundtrack that replicates godzilla\'s size. I would reccomend ""Godzilla: Planet Eater"" if you can stand CGI in anime see some very nicely done action scenes or hear a soundtrack that you can listen to while you fight a 1oom giant that just needs to breathe on you to kill.

Then in the 90s, US of A's take went something so Hollywood-ish about a radioactive lizard, and how the US Army and every American arsenal can defeat it.This, then, is just the true story of Godzilla rehashed into a modern Netflix-y thing: a monster that cannot be defeated (despite again, one of the...characters are voiced by KanaHana) and threw the world into dystopia. Decent plot elements like space-time continuum had good decent explanations; but even Ultraman...the one with Mirai in it--Ultraman that I forgot what, also offered a little of that relativity theory.But wait--this show supposedly was written by Gen Urobuchi; the same creator of Fate/Zero; Psycho Pass; and Puella Magi Madoka Magica... right. Gen Urobuchi's dog, maybe.The thing is, no matter the premise about humans defeating an overpowerful monster, even if Gen Urobuchi wrote its modern take, I wasn't really interested about how it turned out because the spine and bone of the story was just the repeat of the classic, and I know what happened: Godzilla won't be defeated.The 2nd movie already said it. In fact, the second movie just dropped a bombshell of what the third movie is like. Seems like Mr. Gen Urobuchi ran out of creative juices.ART = 5I really can't be bothered.SOUND = 5CHARACTER = 3Japan bet with a powerhouse cast of seiyuus: Kana Hanazawa, with Takahiro Sakurai; Mamoru Miyano, Tomokazu Sugita, even Yuki Kaji. If Gen Urobuchi himself can't make much of this, then I'm certain none of them can save the ludicrousness of the plot; the characters are flat, and how for hundreds of times, we've seen these character-tropes: like Shingeki no Kyojin (the will or vengeance to strike the monster); stupid-love-syndrome (every romantic anime and show there is); and this show is entirely plot-driven, anyway. It is too obvious when there's too many Deus-ex-Machina at work, and that you just don't get and can't possibly relate with the scale of high-tech-nonsense they placed in there: yes, humanity got a helping hand from aliens or those people from other planets, religion thrown into the mix, but seriously, the premise of putting an overbearing monster with them, just don't work.ENJOYMENT = 4Won't be watching this if it weren't for Kana Hanazawa.OVERALL = 5Consider watching this IF AND ONLY IF, you're a massive fan of Kana Hanazawa.

Shin and G2014 are probably my favorites, with the 1954 original being in a league of its own. So believe me when I say that on paper, this movie looked incredible to me. A human-centric Godzilla movie in an anime art-style with new interesting lore to go with it? Sign me up!But no, it's pretty terrible. Let's break it down into a few bullet points because I don't even feel like writing a structured review:-Characters are so painfully generic that you might as well copy...and paste their MAL description from TV tropes and no one would notice the difference. Being cliched is not necessarily an issue in itself, but it either has to support an otherwise good story or the characters have to be interesting in their own way. This movie achieves neither. The characters don't ever go beyond the trope they represent. You have the hot-headed leader that vows to avenge humanity which often puts him at odds with the higher-ups. There's the pure-hearted love interest whose advances go unnoticed. There is also the smart one. You get the gist. After watching two of these movies I can only vaguely remember the name of the protagonist.-The plot is not much better. It takes an hour to get going after which it becomes just another action anime. The movie sets up interesting concepts like the interplay between humans and two alien races and the question of whether it's even worth it to come back to a hostile Earth in the first place. But they go unexplored in favor of generic drama where the young, ambitious hero has to convince the by-the-book higher ups to execute his seemingly suicidal plan that will of course work out in the end, leaving the leadership astonished and rallying everyone behind the protagonist. You've seen it all before done better elsewhere.-I genuinely enjoy the art-style, but the animation is too janky to give it anything above a 6. The sound design and especially the soundtrack are great. The music is somber and foreboding and it reminded me of the original PS3 Demon's Souls of all things. Godzilla's theme is especially well done. It's different to anything that came before but it still manages to hold its own.-The lore and world-building are very interesting. They blend the familiar elements of the previous Godzilla adaptations with a completely fresh lore which makes it stand out from all the other movies. But it goes largely unexplored beyond the surface level, in favor of the aforementioned generic action story. If you're a Godzilla fan, you'd be better off just reading the related entries on Wikizilla rather than watching the movie itself.If after reading this you're still interested, go watch the movie, since the following section will contain spoilers.**SPOILERS**I usually don't like to nitpick the story if the anime is otherwise good, but this one isn't, so here we go:-The colony ship has been traveling just under light speed for 20 years while exhausting its resources and barely making any progress on the cosmic scale. The situation is so dire that the leadership council decides to dump all the elderly and some women on a hostile planet just to get rid of them, killing them instantly. But a day later it's revealed that the ship can also open wormholes, which enables them to travel back to Earth instantly. Again, literally a day after they killed a third of their population to prepare for the journey ahead, they came back to Earth.-A couple hundred malnourished refugees equipped with some scouting gear manage to achieve what the entire Earth and two alien races couldn't (it's mentioned that the kaiju they killed is pretty much identical to original Godzilla 20,000 years back). Haruo, who's only seen Godzilla when he was a kid, spent 20 years on a spaceship and isn't otherwise portrayed as above average in terms of intelligence, deduces that Godzilla's shield has to be generated by something, and doesn't just appear like magic. All of humanity and two advanced alien races couldn't come up with that.

For anyone put off by the large number of negative reviews it's just worth keeping in mind expectations.Are Godzilla films supposed to be 'good'? No. They all about a ridiculous monster blowing things up and a ridiculous plot that really shouldn't work but it does and it's bloody brilliant. it's why they became so famous. why Godzilla became so iconic.This newest incarnation of the Godzilla films do not have mind-blowing plots, super detailed characters with fascinating developments who are memorable.It has brilliant visuals, awesome soundtracks and a REALLY badass...monster blowing s*** up. What's not to love??? Why criticise something for being bad when it's not supposed to be (sarcastic quotes) 'good'? I think these films are extremely well done in their relative simplicity. i personally really enjoy the world building, even if there is a lot of 'pointless dialogue' as some reviews have accused it, i don't feel thats fair.

It's sweet!honestly people manage youre expectations a bit and just appreciate what were given!! How many times do we viewers accuse animes and stories of having 'no world-building'??? and then when a show takes the time to include it... We complain!TL DR: This show is a Godzilla film.

You just had a giant lizard minding its own business, not doing anything to anybody.  It's just hanging out, roaming through the forest, having little dragon babies and such, living a life of peace for tens of thousands of years, just chillaxing.  And, boom, humans gotta come through and start shooting and stabbing it.  Poor giant lizard.  It did nothing wrong.  Shame on humanity.  SHAME!In all seriousness though, this was a decent film.  You know the synopsis from the front, Godzilla runs humans off the...planet, then humans come back to try and take it back.  That's really all this is.  I do have to say that for a 3D animation film, it was gorgeously done.  The characters still had that bland 3D look, but the action was very nicely animated.But, the movie is devoid of any kind of character.  Almost everyone but the MC and the Priest were just faceless fodder there to fill up action scenes.   As such, you don't really care much when they face the inevitable fate of those who oppose the King of the Kaiju.

', 'I remember the first time I came across Polygon pictures back in around 2014, where the anime section of Netflix was a new thing for Irish people so I felt the need to check out what stuff they had that I’d never seen before. One of the shows they had that caught my eye was this space adventure series called Knights of Sidonia. I put it on, and dropped it in around 2 minutes because why the fuck is it all bad CG. This bad CG I would later realise is the aesthetic that polygon pictures want to achieve…this was an intentional decision.I’ve had my...fair share of fully CG anime since knights of Sidonia, some good, like Houseki no Kuni, and some…uh…we don’t talk about-(Berserk 2016 Vietnam Flashback Intensifies) with Polygon pictures consistently hitting that middle ground, consistently adapting beloved series into mediocrity over and over again, consistently utilising their talent to the most passable extent possible. It has never outright ruined a show, but at the same time there hasn’t been anything that Polygon pictures did up to this point that I found particularly engaging.The biggest problem I had with the studio I’d say is that aside from using fully CG works, they like to adapt gritty, edgy work into this style. To say that Polyon pictures aims for a desaturated colour pallet would be the understatement of the century – a black hole would have more colour than one of their shows.Yet, for some reason, despite this Godzilla movie doing absolutely nothing differently from the typical Polygon Pictures production, I had an absolute blast while watching it and I think that’s because Godzilla is at its best when it takes all of its goofy elements seriously. There is the occasional moment when mentioning elements like mecha-godzilla in such a grim and serious tone can’t help but come across as clunky, even if it’s a nice nod to the beloved franchise, but I think that what this tone adds does more than justify these moments.This CG Godzilla movie take place 22 years after humanity lost to the ferocious beast, gave up and ran away. Now is the time when they strive to reclaim their homeland from the monsters. Their home planet which has been abandoned for almost 20,000 years because time works differently in space. Before humanity fled however, literal aliens helped them come up with their failed fighting tactics, gave them the technology to build spaceships and eventually joined the crew and even started spreading their own space religion. This take on the Godzilla franchise is obviously weird, but more than that its completely new. The film thrusts humanity into the position where they already tried and failed to overcome the king of monsters and they’re still defiantly trying to fight again, thus, staying true to the theme of hope in dire circumstances that makes the series so fun to return to.This film is far from perfect, but considering how low my expectations were when going into this, the end result did nothing but shock and delight me as a viewer. I haven’t seen the other two films in the trilogy as of this review, but what I will say is that unlike  certain other films that launch trilogies, I actually want to continue. I actually want to watch more, and see what happens to the crew as their forced to learn more about what their home planet has become.

It has never outright ruined a show, but at the same time there hasn’t been anything that Polygon pictures did up to this point that I found particularly engaging.The biggest problem I had with the studio I’d say is that aside from using fully CG works, they like to adapt gritty, edgy work into this style. To say that Polyon pictures aims for a desaturated colour pallet would be the understatement of the century – a black hole would have more colour than one of their shows.Yet, for some reason, despite this Godzilla movie doing absolutely nothing differently from the typical Polygon Pictures production, I had an absolute blast while watching it and I think that’s because Godzilla is at its best when it takes all of its goofy elements seriously. There is the occasional moment when mentioning elements like mecha-godzilla in such a grim and serious tone can’t help but come across as clunky, even if it’s a nice nod to the beloved franchise, but I think that what this tone adds does more than justify these moments.This CG Godzilla movie take place 22 years after humanity lost to the ferocious beast, gave up and ran away. Now is the time when they strive to reclaim their homeland from the monsters. Their home planet which has been abandoned for almost 20,000 years because time works differently in space. Before humanity fled however, literal aliens helped them come up with their failed fighting tactics, gave them the technology to build spaceships and eventually joined the crew and even started spreading their own space religion. This take on the Godzilla franchise is obviously weird, but more than that its completely new. The film thrusts humanity into the position where they already tried and failed to overcome the king of monsters and they’re still defiantly trying to fight again, thus, staying true to the theme of hope in dire circumstances that makes the series so fun to return to.This film is far from perfect, but considering how low my expectations were when going into this, the end result did nothing but shock and delight me as a viewer.

The story was kinda lacking, but that's to be expected. Its a 3 part movie series. If you don't like cliff hangers or minimal knowledge of the characters then I would advise you to wait for the next 2 parts and watch it in one go. this way it will feel more natural and hopefully they end it with all questions answered. BUT AGAIN THIS IS A 3 PART MOVIE SERIES. You will Not get all the info you want on the first movie.The art was good for the style they were using. Its not my favorite...art style but they pulled  it off in my view.The sound was excellent from the intro to ending and everything in the middle. lips were synced in the dubbed version perfectly.For the characters again you don't get that much. Its part one and you really only get partial background for the main character and even less for others but there's sure to be more info in the next couple movies so again if you don't like cliff hangers or like good character backgrounds wait for all three movies to be done and watch in one go.I enjoyed the movie and will most likely re-watch it before i watch the next movie.It has great fighting scenes. The beginning will be a bit slow but the later half will be fast paced and enjoyable. I hope my review helps you. art style but they pulled  it off in my view.The sound was excellent from the intro to ending and everything in the middle. lips were synced in the dubbed version perfectly.For the characters again you don't get that much.

The story while sort of slow is still interesting enough. The plot doesn't get away from its self and keeps a decent pace that keeps you interested in the movie. The characters are solid enough to draw you in and capture your attention but they are definitely not on par with some of the stronger anime series out there. The monster its self is not very threatening and I...think that has a lot to do with the lack of things to destroy. The Godzilla franchise has always used the destruction of towns to evoke fear in it's viewers. This monster simply has nothing to destroy other than a few human ships and hover bikes. I think this hurts the film but doesn't make it unwatchable. The the end is pretty cool if you understand the metric system and have some idea of the size of past Godzilla's from the older live action movies. If you don't know how big Godzilla normally is then this reveal probably won't mean a thing to you.All and all this is a solid film with decent animation and good story. It could have been better but it also could have been so much worse. If you are a fan of the Godzilla movies go ahead and watch this film because you won't be disappointed.  Overall I give this film a solid 7! I can't wait for the third film to come out next year. think that has a lot to do with the lack of things to destroy.

Even when considering the older cheesy Godzilla schlock those movies could be alternatively enjoyed in an ironic way. This one is neither good legitimately, nor good ironically.-Once in a while the movie has a good concept, but the concept doesn\'t go anywhere. Concepts like the alien\'s relationship to the humans or the ""world remembering humanity"" creating this manifest destiny feeling of the monster world were great ideas. Nothing really came of it though.-The protagonist...is a generic vengeful hero without a satisfying story arc.-The use of pixel shaded 3D anime style could\'ve been tolerable if not for the god-awful color choice. Making the movie completely boring to look at. The action is nothing to write home about either.-The movie does nothing to play on the strengths of the kaiju genre. Nor does it try to do anything new.Overall it\'s very bland and mediocre as a movie, and pretty bad as a Godzilla movie. is a generic vengeful hero without a satisfying story arc.-The use of pixel shaded 3D anime style could\'ve been tolerable if not for the god-awful color choice.

Actually, it is not a 100%, but the movie has good qualities and deserve some attention.First, let\'s talk about the CGI animation. This is not bad! The ""3D"" animation used to be very bad and unnatural, less lively than the classical animation. But recently, it is becoming better. And, according to me, this movie show this !

It\'s hard to judge the entire story to this one based solely on this film alone since it is part of a trilogy and therefore incomplete. However, as a film on it\'s own its nothing terrible but it\'s nothing amazing either.In the last summer of the 20th century, giant monsters began plaguing Earth and humanity is driven...to near extinction by one monster which eliminated the others: Godzilla. Two alien races with ulterior motives, the religious Exif and the technologically advanced Bilusaludo, came to Earth and offered their assistance against Godzilla.

After 2 decades of bad luck, humanity turns around and heads back to earth, arriving 10,000 years later they discover Earth is still inhabitable but Godzilla still remains...Directors, Kōbun Shizuno and Hiroyuki Seshita both do an excellent job and provide us with some great battle sequences and lighting techniques, very visually appealing, which is step one. However, I feel they played it too safe in some areas so it comes across as rather flat. I was a little iffy about Takayuki Hattori returning to compose for this franchise after his efforts on SpaceGodzilla and 2000, but the musical score for this one is by far his best yet.

While it is average anime as a singular movie, each movie adds more and more depth to the Godzilla myth so it keeps you wondering and watching. The Godzilla movies from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s are source material for this new storyline.  Given those awful plots, the makers of this anime should be praised for this new, cohesive, and comprehensive story.  Overall this movie series is a masterpiece because the payoff is incredible!

The plot is very unique; it’s a far step from the tried-and-true formula that Godzilla movies tend to follow. Despite this, Planet of the Monsters ended up being duller than the Japanese government trying to repel Godzilla for the nth time. There were three things that made the synopsis of this movie enticing: how Godzilla won this time, what a future Earth would look like after being dominated by Godzilla, and of course what Godzilla does during the movie. None of...these lived up to their expectations at all.The worst part about this movie is how dull it looks throughout the entire 1.5 hours. You start the movie on a spaceship with lifeless colors, characters in copy-pasted uniforms, and pretty bad character models that don’t do lighting well. Earth itself also has a greyish hue over everything, and not just because of the fog that covers it. While you can argue that it represents how awful it is to live on the spaceship and how dark a world ruled by Godzilla is, it’s exhausting to look at pretty quickly.Only one of the few notable characters isn’t dull. And while the single character that stands out is fortunately the protagonist, the more unfortunate part is that he’s unlikable and single-minded. To make matters worse, his mantra of saying that Earth belongs to humans completely clashes with the message of humility that the entire concept of Godzilla is based around.Godzilla is the most passive and dull he’s ever been. With no cities to minimize the damage of, there’s no sense of urgency besides him killing the crew. All he ever does is fire his laser, and it loses a lot of its magnificence because he only ever fires it for 0.5 seconds at a time. If you’re here for Godzilla being cool, I think literally any other Godzilla movie is better. At the very least, this movie has a revelation about Godzilla’s biology that’s new and interesting.The one thing I think this movie does right is how the plan against Godzilla is coordinated and executed. As much as I don’t like the main character, the way he’s able to make orders, change plans on the fly, and make big calculated risks makes the battle with Godzilla exciting. And with this crew being the last stand against Godzilla, the stakes are the highest they’ve ever been. Considering that finding out how to stop Godzilla is the actual point of Godzilla movies, Planet of the Monsters getting this part right at least redeems it somewhat.Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters is a movie I feel like I should hate, but it doesn’t really do anything that actually draws my ire that much. The concept is interesting and the execution of that concept is actually mostly competent (…ignoring the few plot holes that the movie even brings to your attention). At the end of the day, I just feel an uncomfortable apathy for this movie. If you’re really curious you can give it a shot, but as for me I don’t think I’ll be continuing the trilogy. these lived up to their expectations at all.The worst part about this movie is how dull it looks throughout the entire 1.5 hours.

The Godzilla franchise has been one of the most popular and successful Tokusatsu franchise in the world, starting from the 1954 film, which has proven to be a hit by the Japanese audience. While it has experienced falls, it is still growing strong today, with Hollywood stepping their feet into the franchise with the success of Godzilla 2014, and the masssive box office hit of the very recent Godzilla Minus One.  Few years past, Netflix have also tried to enter their feet into this massive franchise... But it seems it is proven to be difficult.STORYStory is pretty straightforward, it is...exactly what you would expect in a monster anime. I am enthusiastic for science fiction, so i appreciate the inclusion of sci-fi elements in the movie. The exposition however is a slow, taking up about half of the film\'s length before the rising action. This in turn caused the film to feel somewhat ""lacking"" in content, but do be mindful that this is an introductory film for the planned trilogy.CHARACTERSThe film seems to have a lot of attention to our quick-tempered protagonist Haruo Sakaki. The film did a good job introducing important characters, but less so when it comes to developing those who ""seemed"" important. It\'s not to say that I do not care for them, but you can only do so much when half of the film took its time explaining the backstory and setting of the whole 1hr length film.If you\'re new to anime, you might find the character designs odd. But if you\'ve been watching sci-fi animes for quite some time, you\'d understand that the character designs are pretty decent. Not to say that they\'re bad, they do have a clear distinction between the 3  species, such as their body-types, culture and clothing, but it could\'ve been better.Considering this is a ""sci-fi"" anime, there are also mechanical designs in the film. They did not appear as much in the film as i\'d like them to be, but they\'re all pretty neatly designed, without coming off as ""generic"" or ""brutalistic"".And for our titular monster, Godzilla. I love the rugged, muscular shape of the kaiju. It is different, yet gives off a familiar aura. Although at times, he may come off as a bit lanky, such as the lax expression he always gives whenever he appears on screen, making it ""less"" thrilling.ANIMATIONThe animation of this film seems to get the most criticism, I\'d say they\'re half-right. Again, Godzilla tend to have a very ""lax"" behavior throughout the course of the film, making it seem like he\'s not that big of a threat. There\'s also those weird scenes with environments made in 2D over a 3D background, although not a lot throughout the course of the film. Aside from that, the animation is very expressive and dynamic in a way that comes out as ""natural"", rather than being lanky, and the action scenes revolving the mechas are pleasing to watch.MUSICThe music in the film isn\'t the most exceptional, but they do stand out in the scene they\'re placed on. It has a composition that resonates with the themes of science fiction and Godzilla kaiju films, which makes it feel natural.OVERALLSimple and straightforward. That\'s how I can describe this film. Although it\'s not the most deepest and the most complex Godzilla film out there, it still had its deep moments, and an enjoyable experience. Despite all its flaws, I\'d say you should give the film or the trilogy a chance, even if this particular film does not appeal to you. Who knows maybe you might find the next one great! exactly what you would expect in a monster anime.

Aside from that, the animation is very expressive and dynamic in a way that comes out as ""natural"", rather than being lanky, and the action scenes revolving the mechas are pleasing to watch.MUSICThe music in the film isn\'t the most exceptional, but they do stand out in the scene they\'re placed on. It has a composition that resonates with the themes of science fiction and Godzilla kaiju films, which makes it feel natural.OVERALLSimple and straightforward. That\'s how I can describe this film. Although it\'s not the most deepest and the most complex Godzilla film out there, it still had its deep moments, and an enjoyable experience. Despite all its flaws, I\'d say you should give the film or the trilogy a chance, even if this particular film does not appeal to you. Who knows maybe you might find the next one great!']"

Akanesasu Shoujo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37561/Akanesasu_Shoujo,"['* Please, I ask you to take the trouble to read my point of view on this series . SPOILERS ALERT*In recent years, the industry has endeavored to make adaptations of fairly cheap works or create their own, also influencing those commercial works, with the purpose of making money. The last thing usually tries to show a premise that was ""original"", under the concept that these types of works are not directly adapted from other works (But, I emphasize again, they have an influence of other series). There are original series that, if well received by popular opinion, end up becoming a franchise that includes...adaptation to a manga, light novel, video games, toys, etc.From the series that I am going to talk about, it is about one that decided to be a franchise from the beginning, taking the risk of being or not received by public opinion.In mid-May, the launch of an anime called ""Akanesasu Shoujo"" was announced. When the Previews, I really did not get my attention because I just thought that the premise was quite boring (Secondary Girls doing a ritual, seeing the word ""Girls"" was evident that the main purpose was to attract the viewer), besides that previously that I had experiences with harem/ecchi series where the cast was dominated mainly by the female sex. I had high expectations that the series was going to have a high content of ecchi and fanservice with the excuse that the main cast were girls (And yet I decided to watch the series on the first day of its premiere).I was wrong.Akanesasu Shoujo (The Girl of the Twilight) tells the life of five students in the fictional city of Akeyuki, among them is Asuka Tsuchimiya, a very energetic, extroverted and very positive girl who, after finding an urban legend on the Internet, decides to drag to her four friends to the Sacred Tree of Akeyuki, to do the so-called ""Ritual of 4:44"", which is said that ""Using a player capable of generating frequencies, in front of the Tree, if the ritual is done at 4 o\'clock: 44, it can take you to a dimension other than ours. "" At first, this fails, but because of things of destiny, the girls decide to do it with a correct frequency until finally they are led by an apocalyptic world of Akeyuki. It is from there that our four girls know the Asuka of the other dimension (Serioasuka), and there begins the adventures of these four students.At first, the series presents a problem with the start of the frame. Although the first three episodes give you an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat the series is basically, are just the first three episodes where the anime is wobble too much and makes the viewer easily bored. The archetypal personalities of the girls and the quality of animation presented put salt to the wound, and it is simply these three factors that make this series seem to go to the lowest of the average quality of the anime.So, why do I give it such a high score of 9/10?Although its beginning was quite awkward, Akanesasu Shoujo quickly presented a particular formula that, although it did not work in the first three episodes, when the fourth premiered, the aesthetics of the series began to change at an overwhelming rate. The series began to take lightly of other sorts like the ""Comedy"" and the ""Mahou Shoujo"", for example, and began to reinforce a little the sort ""Action"" and ""Sci-fi"".In some things I felt that this formula went with some random things. However, this made the series begin to have a narrative quality quite impressive than expected. The humor of the series, during the first half of the series and the beginning of the other half, made the plot of the series balanced and makes the viewer entertain with the stupidities that arise between the girls and their selves of other dimensions ; at the same time that the plot began to mature and little by little it became as serious as possible.However, something that really should be considered spectacular and wonderful are the last episodes of the series. I will not say much because it would be spoilers:After having about 5 episodes full of humor and youthful fun, the series little by little becomes darker, taking basic elements of ""Suspense"" and ""Drama"", which makes the spectator stay alert of what is going to happen. The narrative presented in these last episodes is perfect and generates a big blow to the heart of what you expected. To complement this, the genre ""Romance"" goes surreptitiously between these last two genres, even if you are a person quite critical of anime, it is impossible for you not to feel that cliffhanger that is gradually generating the series.As for the cast, I said from the beginning that they maintain an archetypal stance. This, in part, is true. Both in appearance and in the way you behave, it is nothing different compared to other series clichés. We have a protagonist who is hyperactive and full of optimism; to the ""student of honor"" who tries to stop the stupidities of the protagonist; a shy girl whose personality makes her look cute; a girl with mad hormones; and a girl with a cold and lonely character.However, as the series progresses, the one-dimensional character of the cast begins to move away from them, and we can witness how little by little their history and personality begin to be quite detailed. Naturally, who would receive more development would be Asuka Tsuchimiya. However, this does not mean that the rest of the cast is left behind. In each arc a brief history is dedicated to each girl, her past and the reason for which they met Asuka; The evolution of girls is also a way of criticizing the most common personalities in anime stereotypes. Nana, the girl must have been the crazy hormones, wants to be an independent woman and not be submitted to any man; Mia, who is supposed to be the beautiful and shy girl, wants to be a person who fights for justice; and Chloe, cold and lonely, wants to be more with her friends. As for Yuu, this character who seems to be Asuka\'s annoyance during the whole series, also shows a very interesting evolution, which involves her relationship with the other girls and their feelings. The proof of this is in alternate I, which Asuka calls ""Ero-Yuu"", due to her daring personality with the original Asuka and at the same time something corrupted.However, of all of them, from which I take off my hat is Mia Silverstone. I will just tell you that she is one of the reasons why Akanesasu Shoujo began to improve in narrative quality. On the other hand, I was a little surprised by who makes the voice of Chloe Morisu is from Inoue Marine.One of the most surprising details of this anime is that although Akanesasu Shoujo presents a premise that gives us many obvious ideas of what is going to happen, in reality these break with all the expectations we thought of this series. I\'m not saying that the cliché is not present, on the contrary, Akanesasu Shoujo takes advantage of this resource to make us believe an idea of \u200b\u200bhow predictable the plot can be, and then ends up executing the plot in a way that we could never think of in this series. What I\'m saying is that the series uses the cliché to make fun of it, and make fun of us, which we have already experimented with certain series of this theme, such as Mahou Shoujo, for example. The execution of the script is masterful and, I repeat the above, do not neglect any of the main cast. Except that the series presents a gag to Asuka\'s ass and a beach episode Akanesasu Shoujo does not depend much on the fanservice as we thought; And still, these details do not hinder the plot, instead, it gives them an unexpectedly humorous touch.The arcs of the series are interesting to see and connect with the personality of each protagonist, respectively, making the series show a small critique of the archetypal personality that these girls initially presented. Additionally, Akanesasu Shoujo also uses references of Western films and series to give him a satirical approach, doing parody to it either through some quotes said by the protagonists, or the way they are expressed in general.To finish this section, I will say that labeling them as ""Three-dimensional"" would be an exaggeration for the girls. But they comply with all the traits of being ""Bidimensional"", and practically comes close to being ""Three-Dimensional"" if not because the series has only twelve episodes. Amazing.Let\'s talk about the animation: Both Jumonji, who just debuted as his first production, and DanDelion, which the latter are also responsible for the CGI used in this series, leave much to be desired. No, I do not say that the animation is a mess, it is simply that the graphic portrayed in the characters has great ups and downs. Although the design of the protagonists are good, there are moments when the artistic quality falls to the lowest, be it in the way in which it focuses on the girls, like the details given to them when they are near or far from the viewer, and even There are some movements of the girls that seemed abnormal to me.The good thing is that the series presents a palette of pretty good colors. The most recurrent scenarios of Akeyuki were very detailed and colorful, in contrast to the way in which the characters were drawn. Personally, I liked the Twilight scene, although it seemed simple, the saturation of yellow, and the almost destroyed buildings, complemented by those yellow snowflakes, gave it a rather apocalyptic approach.The CGI is more decent, and was used mostly in fight scenes. I liked the choreography used in the combats between the protagonists and the so-called ""Clutters"", as also the designs of their costumes when they were transformed were striking. The special effects used when the characters used their weapons were good. The only thing is that these fight scenes hardly lasted two minutes, however, they were still quite entertaining in the eyes of the viewer. Anyway, the fights were something subjective.As for soundtrack, Akanesasu Shoujo presents a varied OST, where J-Pop is dominant. The way in which the music was performed in the great majority of the scenes was well done, and it fit with the duration of the scene. However, at first I felt that the anime repeated the same series of songs in very specific scenes; however, as it progressed, the musical quality began to resonate and vary in different environments.Between those that we can emphasize we have ""444 ~ Four Forty-Four ~"" interpreted by MiChi, that previously had been the interpreter of the Opening of Dagashi Kashi, used frequently in the scenes of the battle, be with the voice of the singer or only the instrumental, and, as the name suggests, refers to the ""Ritual of 4:44"", with a series of violins taking the melody of the song, giving it a focus of hope and motivation in the battles of the girls.Regarding the opening theme, we have ""Soranetarium"" played by the same singer. A J-Pop song that mixes moved elements of electronic music, plus a series of violins playing dramatically, complemented by the singer\'s thick tone, gives it a very serious and powerful approach contrasted with the theme, for the most part comic, of the series. As for the ending, we have ""Kowarekake no Radio"" played by Ami Wajima, a pop ballad that takes a relaxed and somewhat nostalgic rhythm, personally.CONCLUSION""Are you looking for a series on parallel worlds and / or time travel?""""Are you looking for a group of girls who live rare adventures and stupid situations?""""Are you looking for a series that manages comedy and drama together?""Well, maybe I\'m not the right person to recommend this series. His story is simple, his characters are cliché, art is regular and music is a decent j-pop. All Akanesasu Shoujo is merely a cliche. However, it is a cliche that the series knew how to take advantage of from beginning to end; It was maturing narratively and we see how these characters begin to have a great relevance. Despite the setback he had at the beginning, Akanesasu Shoujo knew to go back to a pace too fast, and failed to neglect any detail in the plot (If so, it will only be an open end).I, personally, enjoyed this series too much. Although most of the plot was not taken very seriously, there were times when the anime left you with the heart beating sharply due to the strongest scenes, sentimentally, or those that left you in uncertainty of what was going to happen.Akanesasu Shoujo is far from being a masterpiece, but I\'m sure it\'s the biggest surprise of this season. Outside the comedy, this series takes into account the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, probably the message they want to give us this series is how we should move forward, towards the future, thanking that we have friends and family in whom we can tell if We are going through a personal problem. It is what I think.I\'m probably giving a high note to a series full of eccentricities and a potential rarity, but I really congratulate the seiyuu for being able to properly manage their characters; to the direction to resolutely resolve the script of the series and the good OST shown throughout the series. Pretty spectacular.And, ending here, I invite you to witness that sky tinged with intertwined veins of resplendent gold and jet black, which we call Twilight. adaptation to a manga, light novel, video games, toys, etc.From the series that I am going to talk about, it is about one that decided to be a franchise from the beginning, taking the risk of being or not received by public opinion.In mid-May, the launch of an anime called ""Akanesasu Shoujo"" was announced.

Just knowing the series composition to be from the guy behind the nonary game series, and the fact that it's an anniversary show AND a multimedia project show (ie gacha up the ass), I was fully prepared (and anticipating in fact) a trainwreck of epic proportions. What I got instead was a surprisingly heartfelt show on guilt management along with some pretty good comedy.Akanesasu Shoujo is a show where Wild and Horned Hermit Reimu meets Forbidden Scrollery Reimu. If you would excuse the Touhou reference, it's basically a dimension hopping show with one...of the most lovable genki baka protagonists since Phos and her serious depressed counterpart (also Phos) about defeating evil yellow things. It's surprisingly fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, and yet when dramatic moments hit, they hit hard and can surprisingly resonate with you (the last episode in particular). I wasn't entirely onboard until episode 3, the show really does take a while to truly revel in its silliness and I'm glad I didn't give up on it when it did. I'm not one to commend something for merely subverting expectations, but the execution of Akanesasu's finale was done so well I'd be hard-pressed to find any other anime original exceeding it for this season.The show has its fair share of dark moments and comedic moments, but the reassuring thing is that in spite of this it manages to handle both rather well without feeling tonally inappropriate or disorienting. Take some hints, Takahiro, and don't mess up that Yuru Yuri OVA.The quality of the animation is pretty dreadful but the CG is nice. Direction-wise it doesn't do anything that interesting save for the finale, but the plot and mystic of wondering what's gonna happen next is enough to keep me onboard for the whole ride.All in all, a surprisingly fun show that doesn't go off the rails, shockingly enough. Don't bother with the mobage though.

It manages to mock everything that is pseudoscientific and even mildly religious while it simultaneously parodies fake ghost hunters by using radio waves and those one-time-use light sticks army dudes use at night with night goggles. These girls have real professional take on the supernatural, and whoever came up with this stuff gets my praise for capturing the idiocy behind these themes so accurately that the outcome is nothing less than comedic gold.Outside the story that is just goofy and overboard ridiculous, the cast is flawless and the best part of...this show. Asuka A.K.A. DJ Asuka has to be the most hyperactive character seen in anime since Ichinose Hajime (Gatchaman Crowds, 2013). This girl has no shame. She radiates excitement and the joy of living with every fiber of her being. This is best seen in scenes where she takes control of the school radio (without permission) and starts rapping, or moments when she catches radio signals and concludes there is no other option than the source of them being ALIENS. ""Yeah, it\'s aliens."" Her friends are almost as funny. Few of them start dancing to her DJ work and the one thing they all have in common is how they just don\'t give a fuck about their surroundings or anything. This is wonderful. It\'s like all those ""girls just wanna have fun"" Hollywood movies except not cringey, but actually hilarious and whatever they do, it feels completely genuine behavior that is purely the outcome of their weird personalities. This is the type of stuff I like. It\'s close to meeting the 2pure4this world standards.Chloe Morisu is the best girl. She is a self-proclaimed intellectual and I find myself laughing whenever she does anything. The first thing she does is explain how finding certain boys bodies sexy or hot is completely subjective concept relying on personal bias and it\'s not an objective analysis the least. And whenever someone criticizes her she throws some oneliners in French. I haven\'t laughed this hard since the 7th season of Trailer Park Boys. ""The way you analyse this boy\'s sexiness is very subjective."" And she says it while being 100% serious. She is doing it so unironically I can hardly breathe.The animation details absolutely serve this series. When our girls get scolded, one of them almost jumps when her name is being said because she wasn\'t listening at all, second one is yawning like this is the most boring thing that has ever happened to her while third is just playing with her hair. The person scolding them is also my man. He automatically forgives one of the girls after making a cute anime sound when her name is called ""awww, never mind."" This show just keeps on giving.This series is worth my time because the characters are so damn fun to follow. The story isn\'t all that great tho, feels like Oxenfree except done half-comedically. this show. Asuka A.K.A.

You have been warned.Based off an original idea Akanesasu Shoujo also known by its English title Girl in the Twilight is a sci-fi and action genre anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a group of high school girls whose interest into the arcane and in urban legends were to enact a mysterious ritual that was said to be able to allow...them to open up routes to other dimensions and the events that transpire as their wildest dreams and hopes of being able to enter other worlds become reality. The subject matter of traveling between different worlds have always been one of the subjects that interested me ever since I saw my first-time travel series and while this subject isn’t one that’s particularly common within the field of anime, I always wanted to see one where dimensional travel serves as one of the main themes. In this when I heard that this subject would be one of the main themes for the series my curiosity for the series grew and I decided to take up this series for this season a decision that I never regretted. The first episode of the series I felt did a great job of not just showing the mystery behind the rituals that allow the cast to travel to other worlds but also of the types of dangers that they can run into while doing so. At the same time, it also did a great job of showing what will happen if you were to run into the unique elements that come with traveling to different worlds which is what happens if you run into a different version of you.Taking place in modern day Japan which also serves as the series main anchor point for the casts dimensional trotting adventures the overall story of the series follows the adventures of Asuka and the members of a high school interest circle the Crystal radio club whose enactment of a mysterious ritual that was said to open up routes to other worlds proved to be not only successful but also allow the members of the circle to enter such worlds and solve the mysteries that are unique to each world. However while exploring each world the members of the circle soon realize that each world while seemingly beautiful and possessing unique settings and themes are ones that are closely tied to the inner struggles of the girl that serves as the link that makes travel to that world possible and that to solve the mystery the members of the circle must not only find the true villain before they destroy that world but also identify and solve the inner struggles of the member that serves as the link to that world. However, while formidable the villains that the girls face in their worlds are only the vanguard of a much larger threat and that beyond them is the forces of twilight a hostile power that seeks to absorb every parallel world that lies in its path under the orders of its mysterious leader the enigmatic twilight king.Faced with this dire threat Asuka and the members of the circle must not only overcome their innermost struggles that they keep hidden from their friends but also use the powers that they awaken from overcoming them to fight back and stop twilight from destroying everything that they consider dear. Joining Asuka in this wacky adventure of discovering new worlds and overcoming inner struggles while protecting those that they consider dear to them are Asuka’s friends and fellow members of the circle that includes the quiet and peaceful Mia, the intelligent and rational Chloe, the positive and popular Nana and the level-headed and perceptive Yuu.AsukaAsuka Tsuchimiya played by veteran seiyuu Tomoyo Kurosawa of Black Bullet and Houseki no Kuni fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A cheerful, positive and energetic person by nature Asuka from initial appearances can be seen to be someone that’s enjoying fully the unique time period that being a high school girl involves. A carefree and outgoing person by nature Asuka can be seen to someone that can be said to have an abundance of energy within her that ensures that she is never someone that can just sit still and indeed is someone that takes advantage of this energy to keep things interesting for both herself and her fellow circle members by leading them on sudden adventures or jobs and by teasing and playing jokes on them as well. A unique trait that comes from this is her curious ability to seemingly give nicknames to everyone that she encounters a trait that I felt matches well with her personality.  As a result of this carefree nature of hers, it's perhaps not unusual to see that Asuka is someone that believes heavily in the occult and is willing to try all manner of odd rituals even if these rituals lack any kind of scientific proof that they will function. However rather than being a mere passing interest as one would expect it can be seen that Asuka’s interest into the occult are genuine and borne out of her desire to explore and solve mysteries. This is evidenced by not just the fact that she leads her circle to try out new radio frequencies often but also by her determination to enter such worlds despite the inherent risks associated with them.As the series goes on and Asuka’s character is expanded upon her personality gradually starts to change as we get to see the real personality that she masks beneath her cheerful nature. On the surface Asuka while admittedly a bit of a klutz is shown to be someone that’s kind and caring by nature and is someone that’s able to bond easily with others and remain loyal to them no matter what and is always ready to lend them a helping hand when needed. This is best shown in how she managed to help each of her friends overcome the inner struggles that had so constrained their lives and in doing so awaken the latent powers that lay inside them. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that Asuka is someone that is emotional by nature and when combined with her carefree nature often leads her to enter potentially dangerous situations. However, at the same time, this also allows her to be able to sympathize with the feelings that others may have and enable her to forge strong friendships with the people that she meets whether or not they wanted to or not. This within the series is best shown in the strong friendship that she forges with seriousAsuka. As the series goes on and Asuka bears witness to the kind of threat that the twilight poses to not just themselves but also to the many worlds that exist Asuka’s personality gradually starts to change. While still retaining her carefree nature Asuka gradually becomes braver, more cautious and more willing to hang back and analyze a situation before committing to an action. While still fearful of the power posed by Twilight it can be seen that with these changes Asuka has also become determined to fight the clutters and the twilight king that commands them in her desire to protect her world and friends from them. The character of Asuka I felt was an interesting one that while a carefree and positive girl that loved to tease others in the beginning gradually changed to someone that was brave, cautious and willing to think before acting as she realized the gravity of the threat posed by twilight was something that I really enjoyed seeing. While still carefree to a degree I felt that the experiences that she had experienced with her friends in her adventures not only made her more willing to see the pain that others had but also allow her to help them overcome this more effectively by being able to relate to them through her own heart that she managed to free.  I felt that her seiyuu Tomoyo Kurosawa did an excellent job at portraying the character of Asuka.MiaMia Silverstone portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Nao Touyama of Beatless and Kakuriyo fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the Crystal Radio club. A teenage high school girl Mia on initial appearances can be seen to be a quiet, soft-spoken and polite person by nature that gives the impression of her being an Ojou of a noble family. True to this fact Mia is a calm, positive and intelligent person by nature that while lacking the energetic nature of her friend and fellow circle member Asuka is someone that can be seen to be cautious, perceptive and level-headed and able to adapt to new situations easily. However, it can be seen that due to her quiet and her somewhat indecisive nature Mia is someone that can easily get intimidated by others and indeed is someone that tries to just follow the flow of the world around her and not make any attempts to change anything.As the series goes on and Mia’s character is expanded upon it can be seen that Mia also has many struggles of her own. On the surface, Mia can be seen to be the ideal image of what a teenage girl of her age should act like and to those that don’t know her well this is indeed the truth. But beneath this, it can be seen that Mia is someone that above all desires the freedom to be and do what she wants without any restrictions. In line with her desire for freedom is Mia’s desire to not just overcome her quiet and indecisive nature by becoming braver and more determined but also of her desire to show her true face to her family and not hide them anymore. As a result of this, it's perhaps not surprising that Mia would try to seek out some kind of medium that she can make use of to fulfill the one wish that she cannot do so in the real world in the beginning. However, never in her wildest dreams did Mia expect to enter a world that would allow her to not only act out her prized childish dream but also enter a world where the burden of trying to be a perfect young lady no longer existed. While the journey to this world was a dangerous one it can be said that Mia also benefited greatly from this trip as in the aftermath it can be seen that Mia as a result of awakening the hidden side of her personality not just become visibly braver but also more determined and more willing to take the initiative and fight not just to protect her friends but also for the ideas that she believes in. The character of Mia I felt was an interesting one that showed well the kind of personal struggles that can exist in girls who are trapped between the pressures of their families and their own personal desires to live out their lives the way that they want. The evolution of Mia from a quiet and indecisive girl who simply followed the flow to someone that was not just braver but also more willing to make her own decisions was something that I felt was well done. I felt that her seiyuu Nao Toyama really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Mia.ChloeChloe Morisu portrayed by veteran seiyuu Marina Inoue of Darling in the Franxx and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the Crystal Radio club. A teenage high school girl Chloe on initial appearances is shown to be an intelligent, curious and quiet person by nature that seems to prefer solitude and reading than hanging out with friends which itself is rare among girls her age. A fast thinking, logical and adaptive person by nature Chloe while not completely shunning friends and human contact as some would expect nonetheless views friendships with a certain amount of detached curiosity that many would find surprising in a high school girl. As a result of her logical and independent personality, Chloe like her fellow member Yuu is someone that believes only in solid facts and as a result serves well as the more rational part of the circle that tries hard to rein in Asuka’s desire to try outlandish things.As the series goes on and Chloe’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Chloe also has struggles that she wrestles with unknown to her friends. From the onset it can be seen that Chloe is someone that prefers solitude and while others may view this as being sad and proof that she has no friends it can be said that the opposite is true for Chloe can be seen to treasure the time that she’s alone as she can use it to explore new areas and take in new things every day while not being constrained by things like hanging out with friends. Indeed, as the series goes on it becomes obvious that Chloe also possesses an unusual fear in that she believes that getting too close to others and forming strong bonds with others will cause her to end up relying upon them and lose her sense of independence. These fears of hers gradually came to a head when she and the circle entered a seemingly perfect world that fitted Chloe’s personality like a glove. However, this world while seemingly perfect on the surface was one that proved to have a hidden evil behind it and one that proved to Chloe that her initial view on friendships and the weakness that it can cause her was an incorrect one. The journey to the perfect world while certainly a dangerous experience for Chloe was one that proved to be most enlightening to her as it made her realize that friendships rather than causing her to develop a weakness instead had the opposite effect in that she can actually find strength from it as she can not only rely on them for help when needed but also use them to enhance herself by improving her knowledge of subjects that she knows nothing about. As a result of this new understanding of hers Chloe’s personality in the aftermath of the journey to the perfect world began to change with Chloe visibly becoming more cheerful and willing to show her emotions more openly to others and at the same time learning to trust and value her friends instead of distancing herself from them a change that I felt was most welcome for her character. The character of Chloe I felt was an interesting one that showed well the kind of struggles that those that are used to being in solitude would wrestle with when they enter areas of society where forming friendships would be important. The gradual evolution of Chloe from someone that was both quiet and preferring solitude to someone that learned the value of friendship and the unique advantages that it can bring to a person I felt was well done.NanaNana Nanase portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ami Koshimizu of Saki and Darling in the Franxx fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the Crystal Radio club. On initial appearances, Nana on the surface is a popular, cheerful and intelligent high school girl that more than any within the circle seems to be living an ideal life that comes from having both great friends and a supporting family. A positive, fast thinking and curious person by nature Nana at the beginning of the series can be seen to be taking great advantage of her situation and enjoy the life of being a high school girl by hanging out with friends and trying to enhance her rep of being one of the cool kids. As a result of her curious nature, Nana in the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that didn’t put much thought into her actions seemingly following the decisions that are made by others on impulse making her relatively similar to her friend and fellow circle member Asuka.As the series goes on however and Nana’s personality is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her cheerful nature Nana also has struggles that she keeps hidden from her friends. Outwardly Nana can be seen to have the life that most high school girls would dream of having being both pretty, popular and having both many friends that she can hang out with and a family that tries hard to support her. However, beneath the surface, it can be seen that this is anything but true for her. Despite having everything that most girls her age would desire it can be seen that Nana is bored with the life that she’s living and longs to be able to walk her path in life. While certainly grateful for the life that her family has given her, it can be seen that she also feels somewhat weighted down by the social responsibilities that come from this especially in relation to the future paths that are dictated by them. These secret struggles of hers that she kept hidden from her friends gradually came to a head when Nana and the members of the circle entered a world that while appearing perfect on the surface actually used as a theme one of the secret fears that Nana had which was a progression into the next stage of life via marriage. The journey into this new world while certainly a dangerous one for Nana and friends also proved to be an educational one for Nana as well as it provided her the spark that she needed to overcome the barrier that she had for so long been unable to overcome herself. In the aftermath of this journey, it can be seen that Nana while gaining new and powerful abilities as a result also developed a change in her personality. While still retaining her core nature of being positive, cheerful and fast thinking Nana in the course of her journey to that world realized that her insistence on keeping her inner feelings and worries hidden from her friends and her family while doing well in protecting her and buying time for her also had the unintended effect of making her distant from both parties and thus making it very difficult to understand her actions and worries. As a result of this realization in the aftermath, Nana began to gradually open up her closed off heart to not just her friends but also her family as well and allow her to not only make her true feelings clear but also allow her to once again reforge the bonds that existed between them.YuuYuu Tounaka portrayed by veteran seiyuu Lynn of Eldlive and Angolmois fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the Crystal Radio club where she serves as the overall club leader. A teenage high school student Yuu on initial appearance is an intelligent, logical and calm person by nature that gives the impression and aura of an honor student that ensures that she stands out among her fellow club members. A perceptive and level-headed person by nature Yuu unlike the likes of her childhood friend Asuka is someone that can be said to be a realist and as a result is someone that refuses to believe in the existence of the paranormal without first seeing actual proof a trait that she shares with her fellow member Chloe. As a result of this, it can be seen that among the team Yuu functions as the foundation of the team that keeps the members of the team grounded.As the series goes on however and more of Yuu’s personality is revealed it can be seen that Yuu also has many struggles that she wrestles with unknown to her friends. At the beginning of the series as a result of her honor student like aura, it can be seen that Yuu takes exams and education very seriously and tries hard to impart these teachings into Asuka in an effort to rein her in. As a result of this out of the members of the club, Yuu was perhaps the least interested in going on adventures to other worlds as she felt that such time can be better used for matters like studying. However, as the series progresses and as Yuu bears witness to the variety of worlds that they visit as well as the fun that comes from exploring such worlds with her friends this attitude of hers gradually starts to change. While still serious and direct with her feelings Yuu’s attitude gradually starts to soften becoming more understanding and considerate of the feelings of others and willing to understand the reasons for someone’s actions as shown in her attempts to protect her friends over the course of the series. At the same time this change in attitude also awakened within Yuu the joy that can come from having fun with her friends that she cannot find within textbooks and cram schools and as a result created a change within her in which she sought to increase the amount of time she spends with them and her family while balancing her commitments to her future. The character of Yuu I felt was an interesting one and I felt that her gradual evolution from someone that acted more like a honor student that believed solely in facts while remaining somewhat distant from her friends to someone that learned to appreciate the types of experiences that can come from exploring new and exciting worlds with her friends and in the process becoming more human as she learned to consider the feelings of others I felt was done really well and help prove that there’s more to life than what you see within a textbook.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main cast were pretty well done with the uniform designs of the girls doing a great job in differentiating the girls from each other. The transformed states of both the girls as well as that of Alt Asuka I felt were also done well and reflected well on the lessons that each girl learned in their respective fragment. In terms of locations and settings, I felt that the series made great use of the parallel world concept which when paired with each of the inner struggles that each girl struggled with ensured that each of the worlds that the cast visit was unique. These unique worlds I felt took great advantage of the unique struggles that each girl wrestled with by making use of a great variety of themes that resonated well with the core problems of each girl. Of the ones present within the series my personal favorites were the western and marriage-themed ones. Combat animation wise while combat wasn’t the main focus of the series, I thought that the fights within the series were done reasonably well that was helped greatly by the variety of enemy types that the cast had to contend with within the series.In terms of music, the series made use of a single opening and ending theme which in this case was Soranetarium that was sung by Michi and Kowarekake no radio which was sung by Ami Wajima. The opening theme I felt was an interesting one as its melody gave a haunting type of feeling of for me which resonated well with the main theme of world traveling and experiencing new experiences. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether main ones or support ones. In particular, I felt that Tomoyo Kurosawa, Nao Touyama, Marina Inoue, Ami Koshimizu and Lynn all did a fantastic job of portraying the characters of Asuka, Mia, Chloe, Nana and Yuu respectively. In addition, I also feel that this series also had some interesting support characters that did well to make the overall story more interesting by not just expanding upon the story but also in introducing more personal stakes into it. One notable example is the character of Seriouska who within the series was an alternate version of Asuka that hails from a parallel fragment. This version of Asuka as a result of being shaped by the unique circumstances of her home fragment was markedly different from the prime Asuka both in terms of temperament and beliefs and I felt she contrasted well with her. Her development from someone that tried to do everything alone and try to push away every attempt by the team to befriend her to someone who gradually learned to see the value of bonds and friendship and in the process learn to make friends for the first time in her life was well done and the effect that she had on the team is something that cannot be understated. I thought that Tomoyo Kurosawa who also voiced the prime version of Asuka also did an excellent job portraying Seriouska.Overall conclusionIn overall Akanesasu Shoujo was an interesting anime that had among its main strengths an interesting premise, strong story, characters and a unique pairing of dimensional travel with superpowered abilities.The overall premise of the show which was a look into what will happen if a group of high school girls whose interest into the occult and the paranormal were to enact a mysterious ritual that is centered around a certain location in their world is a concept that’s already well established within the world of anime forming the foundation for most mystery based animes. However, what makes this simple premise unique in this regard is the manner in which the girls travel to each world. This is because within the series for the girls to be able to get to a new world one of their number has to act as the mental link to that world and this link also acts to create the world based on the inner struggles and fears that they are experiencing inside their hearts. This pairing of a character’s inner struggles with the world building for their respective worlds I felt was an interesting idea and helped ensure that each of the worlds in which the members of the circle visit is unique.The overall story of the series I thought made great use of this premise as it not only showed the many adventures that the members of the circle undertook in the course of the series but also show the many trials that each member had to overcome in their respective worlds as they came to accept that the life that they were trying to live was nothing but a lie and that to improve themselves they have to overcome their shortcomings and be willing to reveal their true selves not just to their friends but to the world as well. This combination of paring the act of realizing your true self with the awakening of powers that will allow the girls to face the enemies that had come to destroy their linked world I thought was an interesting idea as it provided the girls with the perfect opportunity to get payback for the time they had to hide their inner feelings. While the individual world bosses that the girls face were fearsome adversaries I felt that the overall story also did a great job of using these as stepping stones as it not only allowed the girls to see the kind of threat that the clutters to which the world bosses are named as but also show that beyond them is a much more major threat that they cannot hope to face until they learned to realize their true selves.Overall Akanesasu Shoujo was an anime that I really enjoyed and while it made use of elements that are rarely used together I felt that in this case it managed to make great use of both the mystery, sci-fi and action elements and combine that with a story that allowed us to see how the members of the circle were able to use their newly awakened powers and the lessons they learned to defend against a threat that if not stopped will erase everything that they consider dear. Seeing each of the girls not just overcome their inner struggles but use the powers that they gained from it to face down the threat posed by twilight to both protect their world but also walk the path that they desire was pretty satisfying. As a final score, I would say that Akanesasu Shoujo deserves a final score of 8/10. While the core ideas were sound, and I enjoyed the journey of seeing each of the girls awaken their latent powers I felt that Twilight and the threat that it posed was introduced a tad too late within the series. I also felt that the many boss fights that the girls have to face in order to awaken their abilities were too similar and lacked enough variety in them. them to open up routes to other dimensions and the events that transpire as their wildest dreams and hopes of being able to enter other worlds become reality. The subject matter of traveling between different worlds have always been one of the subjects that interested me ever since I saw my first-time travel series and while this subject isn’t one that’s particularly common within the field of anime, I always wanted to see one where dimensional travel serves as one of the main themes.

The journey to the perfect world while certainly a dangerous experience for Chloe was one that proved to be most enlightening to her as it made her realize that friendships rather than causing her to develop a weakness instead had the opposite effect in that she can actually find strength from it as she can not only rely on them for help when needed but also use them to enhance herself by improving her knowledge of subjects that she knows nothing about. As a result of this new understanding of hers Chloe’s personality in the aftermath of the journey to the perfect world began to change with Chloe visibly becoming more cheerful and willing to show her emotions more openly to others and at the same time learning to trust and value her friends instead of distancing herself from them a change that I felt was most welcome for her character. The character of Chloe I felt was an interesting one that showed well the kind of struggles that those that are used to being in solitude would wrestle with when they enter areas of society where forming friendships would be important. The gradual evolution of Chloe from someone that was both quiet and preferring solitude to someone that learned the value of friendship and the unique advantages that it can bring to a person I felt was well done.NanaNana Nanase portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ami Koshimizu of Saki and Darling in the Franxx fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the Crystal Radio club. On initial appearances, Nana on the surface is a popular, cheerful and intelligent high school girl that more than any within the circle seems to be living an ideal life that comes from having both great friends and a supporting family. A positive, fast thinking and curious person by nature Nana at the beginning of the series can be seen to be taking great advantage of her situation and enjoy the life of being a high school girl by hanging out with friends and trying to enhance her rep of being one of the cool kids. As a result of her curious nature, Nana in the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that didn’t put much thought into her actions seemingly following the decisions that are made by others on impulse making her relatively similar to her friend and fellow circle member Asuka.As the series goes on however and Nana’s personality is gradually expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her cheerful nature Nana also has struggles that she keeps hidden from her friends. Outwardly Nana can be seen to have the life that most high school girls would dream of having being both pretty, popular and having both many friends that she can hang out with and a family that tries hard to support her. However, beneath the surface, it can be seen that this is anything but true for her. Despite having everything that most girls her age would desire it can be seen that Nana is bored with the life that she’s living and longs to be able to walk her path in life. While certainly grateful for the life that her family has given her, it can be seen that she also feels somewhat weighted down by the social responsibilities that come from this especially in relation to the future paths that are dictated by them. These secret struggles of hers that she kept hidden from her friends gradually came to a head when Nana and the members of the circle entered a world that while appearing perfect on the surface actually used as a theme one of the secret fears that Nana had which was a progression into the next stage of life via marriage. The journey into this new world while certainly a dangerous one for Nana and friends also proved to be an educational one for Nana as well as it provided her the spark that she needed to overcome the barrier that she had for so long been unable to overcome herself. In the aftermath of this journey, it can be seen that Nana while gaining new and powerful abilities as a result also developed a change in her personality. While still retaining her core nature of being positive, cheerful and fast thinking Nana in the course of her journey to that world realized that her insistence on keeping her inner feelings and worries hidden from her friends and her family while doing well in protecting her and buying time for her also had the unintended effect of making her distant from both parties and thus making it very difficult to understand her actions and worries. As a result of this realization in the aftermath, Nana began to gradually open up her closed off heart to not just her friends but also her family as well and allow her to not only make her true feelings clear but also allow her to once again reforge the bonds that existed between them.YuuYuu Tounaka portrayed by veteran seiyuu Lynn of Eldlive and Angolmois fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of the Crystal Radio club where she serves as the overall club leader. A teenage high school student Yuu on initial appearance is an intelligent, logical and calm person by nature that gives the impression and aura of an honor student that ensures that she stands out among her fellow club members. A perceptive and level-headed person by nature Yuu unlike the likes of her childhood friend Asuka is someone that can be said to be a realist and as a result is someone that refuses to believe in the existence of the paranormal without first seeing actual proof a trait that she shares with her fellow member Chloe. As a result of this, it can be seen that among the team Yuu functions as the foundation of the team that keeps the members of the team grounded.As the series goes on however and more of Yuu’s personality is revealed it can be seen that Yuu also has many struggles that she wrestles with unknown to her friends. At the beginning of the series as a result of her honor student like aura, it can be seen that Yuu takes exams and education very seriously and tries hard to impart these teachings into Asuka in an effort to rein her in. As a result of this out of the members of the club, Yuu was perhaps the least interested in going on adventures to other worlds as she felt that such time can be better used for matters like studying. However, as the series progresses and as Yuu bears witness to the variety of worlds that they visit as well as the fun that comes from exploring such worlds with her friends this attitude of hers gradually starts to change. While still serious and direct with her feelings Yuu’s attitude gradually starts to soften becoming more understanding and considerate of the feelings of others and willing to understand the reasons for someone’s actions as shown in her attempts to protect her friends over the course of the series. At the same time this change in attitude also awakened within Yuu the joy that can come from having fun with her friends that she cannot find within textbooks and cram schools and as a result created a change within her in which she sought to increase the amount of time she spends with them and her family while balancing her commitments to her future. The character of Yuu I felt was an interesting one and I felt that her gradual evolution from someone that acted more like a honor student that believed solely in facts while remaining somewhat distant from her friends to someone that learned to appreciate the types of experiences that can come from exploring new and exciting worlds with her friends and in the process becoming more human as she learned to consider the feelings of others I felt was done really well and help prove that there’s more to life than what you see within a textbook.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main cast were pretty well done with the uniform designs of the girls doing a great job in differentiating the girls from each other. The transformed states of both the girls as well as that of Alt Asuka I felt were also done well and reflected well on the lessons that each girl learned in their respective fragment. In terms of locations and settings, I felt that the series made great use of the parallel world concept which when paired with each of the inner struggles that each girl struggled with ensured that each of the worlds that the cast visit was unique. These unique worlds I felt took great advantage of the unique struggles that each girl wrestled with by making use of a great variety of themes that resonated well with the core problems of each girl. Of the ones present within the series my personal favorites were the western and marriage-themed ones. Combat animation wise while combat wasn’t the main focus of the series, I thought that the fights within the series were done reasonably well that was helped greatly by the variety of enemy types that the cast had to contend with within the series.In terms of music, the series made use of a single opening and ending theme which in this case was Soranetarium that was sung by Michi and Kowarekake no radio which was sung by Ami Wajima. The opening theme I felt was an interesting one as its melody gave a haunting type of feeling of for me which resonated well with the main theme of world traveling and experiencing new experiences. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether main ones or support ones. In particular, I felt that Tomoyo Kurosawa, Nao Touyama, Marina Inoue, Ami Koshimizu and Lynn all did a fantastic job of portraying the characters of Asuka, Mia, Chloe, Nana and Yuu respectively. In addition, I also feel that this series also had some interesting support characters that did well to make the overall story more interesting by not just expanding upon the story but also in introducing more personal stakes into it. One notable example is the character of Seriouska who within the series was an alternate version of Asuka that hails from a parallel fragment. This version of Asuka as a result of being shaped by the unique circumstances of her home fragment was markedly different from the prime Asuka both in terms of temperament and beliefs and I felt she contrasted well with her. Her development from someone that tried to do everything alone and try to push away every attempt by the team to befriend her to someone who gradually learned to see the value of bonds and friendship and in the process learn to make friends for the first time in her life was well done and the effect that she had on the team is something that cannot be understated. I thought that Tomoyo Kurosawa who also voiced the prime version of Asuka also did an excellent job portraying Seriouska.Overall conclusionIn overall Akanesasu Shoujo was an interesting anime that had among its main strengths an interesting premise, strong story, characters and a unique pairing of dimensional travel with superpowered abilities.The overall premise of the show which was a look into what will happen if a group of high school girls whose interest into the occult and the paranormal were to enact a mysterious ritual that is centered around a certain location in their world is a concept that’s already well established within the world of anime forming the foundation for most mystery based animes. However, what makes this simple premise unique in this regard is the manner in which the girls travel to each world. This is because within the series for the girls to be able to get to a new world one of their number has to act as the mental link to that world and this link also acts to create the world based on the inner struggles and fears that they are experiencing inside their hearts. This pairing of a character’s inner struggles with the world building for their respective worlds I felt was an interesting idea and helped ensure that each of the worlds in which the members of the circle visit is unique.The overall story of the series I thought made great use of this premise as it not only showed the many adventures that the members of the circle undertook in the course of the series but also show the many trials that each member had to overcome in their respective worlds as they came to accept that the life that they were trying to live was nothing but a lie and that to improve themselves they have to overcome their shortcomings and be willing to reveal their true selves not just to their friends but to the world as well. This combination of paring the act of realizing your true self with the awakening of powers that will allow the girls to face the enemies that had come to destroy their linked world I thought was an interesting idea as it provided the girls with the perfect opportunity to get payback for the time they had to hide their inner feelings. While the individual world bosses that the girls face were fearsome adversaries I felt that the overall story also did a great job of using these as stepping stones as it not only allowed the girls to see the kind of threat that the clutters to which the world bosses are named as but also show that beyond them is a much more major threat that they cannot hope to face until they learned to realize their true selves.Overall Akanesasu Shoujo was an anime that I really enjoyed and while it made use of elements that are rarely used together I felt that in this case it managed to make great use of both the mystery, sci-fi and action elements and combine that with a story that allowed us to see how the members of the circle were able to use their newly awakened powers and the lessons they learned to defend against a threat that if not stopped will erase everything that they consider dear. Seeing each of the girls not just overcome their inner struggles but use the powers that they gained from it to face down the threat posed by twilight to both protect their world but also walk the path that they desire was pretty satisfying. As a final score, I would say that Akanesasu Shoujo deserves a final score of 8/10. While the core ideas were sound, and I enjoyed the journey of seeing each of the girls awaken their latent powers I felt that Twilight and the threat that it posed was introduced a tad too late within the series. I also felt that the many boss fights that the girls have to face in order to awaken their abilities were too similar and lacked enough variety in them."", ""It started feeling kind of average with kind of a weak plot. The plot didn't improve too much but the characters really grew on me. I was about to drop it but episode 3 won me over.The characters are the best thing this show has going. They're nothing ground breaking in terms of character design/development/whatever but they're all likable and fun to watch. They're silly, charming, sometimes annoying and usually very funny. They feel organic even though the show follows the good old magical girl formula pretty closely. Good stuff.The battles, even though they're in crappy 3d, are actually not bad and the plot even...though it's kind of vanilla doesn't really hurt the other things the anime has going for it, in fact, some of the places they visit in their dimensional travels are actually pretty interesting.Overall, looks good, sounds good, plot is alright, characters are good. It's not AotS but it's a pretty solid, pretty overlooked show. though it's kind of vanilla doesn't really hurt the other things the anime has going for it, in fact, some of the places they visit in their dimensional travels are actually pretty interesting.Overall, looks good, sounds good, plot is alright, characters are good.

As a viewer, I found myself wishing for a deeper dive into the main storyline. There\'s a sense that the creators had more to tell, and a bit more revelation could have added that extra layer of intrigue the series seems to be reaching for.Where the anime shines, however, is in its battle animations. Going into it, I didn\'t have high expectations in this department, but I was pleasantly surprised. The fluidity and dynamism of the combat scenes are a visual treat, showcasing...a level of quality that is sometimes missing in contemporary anime productions. It\'s a clear indicator of the effort and skill put into these sequences, making them a standout feature of the show.On the flip side, the armor designs left something to be desired. They didn\'t quite hit the mark for me, feeling somewhat out of sync with the rest of the anime\'s aesthetic. This is a bit of a letdown, especially considering the overall art quality of ""Akanesasu Shoujo"" is quite good. This anime manages to capture some of that old-school charm, making it visually appealing despite the occasional design misstep.A notable aspect, for those who appreciate a touch of fan service, is the depiction of Asuka\'s pantsu. It\'s a playful, cheeky addition that adds a bit of light-heartedness to the show. This little nod to fan service is tastefully done, enhancing Asuka\'s character without overshadowing the story or other elements of the anime.In conclusion, ""Akanesasu Shoujo - The Girl in Twilight"" is a mixed bag with some notable highs. The story is adequate, the battle animations are a visual delight, and the overall art quality harks back to the glory days of anime, even if the armor designs don\'t quite live up to the same standard. The subtle fan service adds a fun element to the show, making it a worthwhile watch for those who enjoy a well-rounded anime experience. a level of quality that is sometimes missing in contemporary anime productions.

The concept is decent, a multiverse scenario that is just ruined by an amateur studio taking the reigns. The frame will obviously stay on the same picture for 3-10 seconds at a time with slight alterations. The art is so bad and inconsistent that it completely takes you out of the experience. Because of the amateur studio the pacing is off balance as well, clearly they failed to meet their deadlines and the story suffers for it. The problem here is that the director had some amazing ideas, something like Stein's gate with alterations to the main timeline...via leaps to a different trajectory, but he was chipping away at it until the last minute resulting in a poorly shot fizzling pile of shit. It's a  shame as one of this studios first original anime that it went so bad. I feel sorry for the voice actors and the staff that split off to form a subsidiary company that was not ready to produce an anime that shat this nightmare out. via leaps to a different trajectory, but he was chipping away at it until the last minute resulting in a poorly shot fizzling pile of shit.

But even so, is Akanesasu Shoujo any good?..well...Akanesasu Shoujo has a quirky premise to it, that of the Crystal Radio Club that Asuka Tsuchimiya viced by Tomoyo Kurosawa started. They do a ritual every now and again of chanting some gibberish with a cassette player and random frequencies and expect things to happen, however one time they do and they are transported to a parallel world but is plagued by yellow bunnies...that bite. From then on, Asuka and the Radio Club becomes intrigued and goes to other parallel worlds where a...bigger plot lies, that of the King of Twilight that destroys worlds using those yellow bunnies or Noizies and humanoid version known as ""Clutter"".Now Akanesasu Shoujo for the better part of half the anime, Akanesasu Shoujo follows a character focused arc as it were with the members of the Radio Club. Like Nana Nanase voiced by Ami Koshimizu and her dilemma and problems with her stepfather and what that does to her as a person, Mia Silverstone voiced by Nao Touyama, wanting to have the courage and be a hero but she\'s always been painted as a shy girl that can\'t do action because of her surface-level personality barring her, Chloe Morisu voiced by Marina Inoue known for being a loner and thinking that\'s her most efficient yet actually longs for friends once Chloe came into contact with Asuka and finally Yuu Tounaka voiced by Lynn who puts on a facade and yet one of her alternate self is anything but that. Oh yeah there\'s alternative versions of the characters, being an anime setting with parallels worlds it\'s to be expected. There are only two however due to this, Sexy Yuu and Seriousuka based on an alternative Asuka who\'s able to fight the Twilight.Each of the character arcs follows with their character development but it always ends in the character focused in the arc in question to fight and defeat a Clutter that is plaguing their alternative worlds before that Clutter swallows that world in Twilight rinse and repeat...it\'s formulaic but it makes sense as each of the main cast and their dilemma\'s in the real world taken a different form in an alternative world and once they awaken their ""Twilight Selves"" they not only get superpowers that reflect their problems but they also self-improve as a result due to how the Clutter links with the character in question\'s dilemma and thus the character in question defeating the Clutter has a narrative meaning. LA\'s favourite character however did become Mia by default, however LA did have a bit of relatablity with Chloe by the end of the series, while Asuka probably gotten the longest and most development of all the main cast but that is both because of her screentime and being the main protagonist.The bigger plot of Akanesasu Shoujo hits near the final 3 episodes and changes from it\'s usual character focused arcs (in a ways) and really digs deep into some plot twists and spoilers of what and who the King of Twilight is and how this links to both Asuka as well as Asuka\'s lost brother to all this and it gets crazy yet sane in a ways, yes sure alternative worlds, alternative selves and whatnot but it still makes sense by the end of it. Overall the plot is decent, slightly formulaic but the character development helps ALOT to all this to the bigger picture of Akanesasu Shoujo.In terms of animation by DandeLion Animation Studio and Jumonji. See DandeLion Animation Studio are the one sin charge of the 3D CGI, YUP , this anime implements it in, mostly when the girls transform into their twilight selves and it\'s janky yet fluid. Janky through how clashing to the background the 3DCGI is, BUT the action and fighting is oddly fluid, it\'s a weird balance but it kinda works. The character designs and backgrounding for the anime was actually pretty decent, both DandeLion and Jumonoji were in the animation for this and being a joint venture...well it worked out. Overall, the animation of Akanesasu Shoujo was decent enough if you can stomach the 3DCGI, it\'ll grow on you...Now the voice acting, well we have a good cast if anything and no it\'s not just because of Nao Touyama. Tomoyo Kurosawa shows her extremely wide range of cadences as different alternative version of Asuka, this also applies to Lynn with her alternative Yuu\'s as well. Ami Koshimzu, Nao Touyama and Marina Inoue also does well even if they don\'t have their alternative selves, as their character focused arcs helps with their voice work in that respect. If anything the voice casting for Akanesasu Shoujo was good.The finale at the very least resolves Asuka\'s situation with her missing brother. How the final episode itself takes itself with an introspective look at Asuka as a character and her journey through multiple Fragments and meeting the ""King of Twilight"" and how this entity links to both Asuka and her little brother is resolved though felt like the resolution was done too quickly, trying to cram in Asuka\'s development all into one episode but to it\'s defense, we do get most of Asuka\'s development helped by the rest of the main cast\'s arcs as well so the ""rushed"" flaw becomes only slightly detrimented. The finale was nonetheless all Asuka but nicely tied itself together, giving us hints as to other characters\' fate as well.So was Akanesasu Shoujo good?...well Akanesasu Shoujo is a decent venture with some interesting and in-depth character development from the majority of the cast while Asuka herself being a bigger link to the bigger plot of Akanesasu Shoujo tying things together. Sure the plot is pretty formulaic for the bulk of the anime but many of the plot twists were actually pretty unexpected BUT the 3DCGI was altogether meh to balance things out. Akanesasu Shoujo\'s strengths and weaknesses all and all just made Akanesasu Shoujo and what LA watched as LA experienced it was that it was ""ok"", nothing too great but nothing too awful either...it goes right down the middle and that is completely fine as middling as it was...it was a fun and decent experience in all it\'s quirkiness. bigger plot lies, that of the King of Twilight that destroys worlds using those yellow bunnies or Noizies and humanoid version known as ""Clutter"".Now Akanesasu Shoujo for the better part of half the anime, Akanesasu Shoujo follows a character focused arc as it were with the members of the Radio Club.

I had not read absolutly anything about it and I decided to go blindly in at it without reading anything beforehand.Now I gotta ask, have you ever heard about or played a game called Oxenfree? Personally, I got alot of Oxenfree vibes just by watching the first few minutes of the anime and that REALLY brought this anime to my attention.As of the first episode I had no idea...where this anime was heading, but after the first few episodes I understood very well the direction it was in. So far I believe that the review displayed on MAL is surprisingly quite low. Im amazed that this anime hasnt caught the eye of many people as it has quite a unique concept. (And some Madoka Magica vibes to it aswell)I really enjoy the art style and the sound / music is also quite enjoyable.I would sugest that you give this anime a go (if you have time and have nothing else to watch of course). <3Minor Spoilers ahead:Now that the anime has finished airing and after watching all the episodes I have came to the conclution that Akanesasu Shoujo has its upsides and downsides. The main downside is the Story and all the parts that decided to include CG. I feel like the concept for this anime is absolutly outstanding and brilliant, but I feel like it could have been executed way better. Alot of segments dont make ANY SENSE (especially the ending), but in the end does any anime TRULY make sense? #AnimeLogic :PAs far as all the battle scenes go, they all include CG and I gotta admit... I rarely ever see good CG and this anime is no exception, therefore the CG parts are a major turn off for me. But other than that, I do quite enjoy the characters and the soundtrack. In the end, the only thing the anime was actually was the good story but other than that, it was quite an enjoyable experience.Final verdict: 7/10 <3 where this anime was heading, but after the first few episodes I understood very well the direction it was in.

I want to write the review about this one.As an original anime, the story is good itself. But!! There are still many mysteries that probably cannot be solved. Im sure 100%, all of the watchers still curious about kyo-chan dissapeared and what happen to the other dissapear parallel worlds aftter twilight loli Asuka was gone 8/10The art was, wow amazing and well detailed. I like the chara drawing since they looks cute for me. The environtment and twilight also impressive. Let's rate this 8/10.But other than that, I...found the music is good, since Michi and Ami Wajima sing for the OST. The BGM for action also not bad. But I thought they will go all out for the 3DCG (unfortunately didn't). And I apppreciate Kurosawa Tomoyo who fill many characters for different styles Asuka.Design for chara also good, truly I never saw this type of characters face in an other anime (maybe I'm not enough watched other anime LOL). They seem like an idols for me anyway. But the personality improvement is standard, except the always happy Asuka.Anyway, I like this type of parallel world story. So I'm enjoyed with this anime. Thanks for Animax who made this original anime. 7.5/10 found the music is good, since Michi and Ami Wajima sing for the OST. The BGM for action also not bad.

They seem like an idols for me anyway. But the personality improvement is standard, except the always happy Asuka.Anyway, I like this type of parallel world story. So I'm enjoyed with this anime. Thanks for Animax who made this original anime. 7.5/10"", ""No spoilers.Wow, easily one of the coolest anime out this season.  Akanesasu Shoujo delivers on all fronts and pumps on all cylinders at every moment, with deep character development, perfect pacing, and well-executed action scenes.  The dialogue is always on point with the characters displaying a deep, human understanding of each other.  Some people may question the idea of the show represented in the first episode, however I think it's a more accurate reflection of realistic high school girls than what we normally see.  The character models are absolutely stunning, and each action sequence is a visual spectacle.That said I didn't...give this show a 10, for the following reasons.  I felt Mia was particularly shallow in her character development, and kind of feels out of place in general.  Also, there was a non-zero amount of ero-fanservice, which personally puts me off, and which probably could have netted the show a 9 had it been replaced with more tasteful shots.  A swimsuit episode is not a necessity.  Finally, the plotline, while engaging and overall very good, left nothing to the imagination and sort of played out as expected.Definitely one of the best shows this season, which is saying a lot considering how many good shows came out this season.  I'd recommend this anime for anyone who likes Magical Girls and really visually-stunning anime. give this show a 10, for the following reasons.

Akanesasu Shoujo doesn\'t take itself too seriously when *very minimal not really spoiler* one character didn\'t want to be married to a celebrity because of his last name and another wanted to be a hero.Don\'t take it too seriously, just sit back and relax. Don\'t think too much of how the plot progresses. Just stay along for the ride. This isn\'t...one of those it\'s so bad that it\'s good. It\'s actually really enjoyable if you allow yourself to take it all in. You\'ll actually be in for some nice surprises and have tons of fun if you just enjoy it in the moment.There were actually moments where I was just watching and went ""WOAH WHAT!?!?!""The animation is fantastic by the way. They did a really good job with the CG.The characters themselves aren\'t bland, I really like their diverse personalities.Edit: The soundtrack for this series is amazing. OST/ED and the background music during the show. All great.The first show where I\'m actually debating whether or not I should buy the $30 soundtrack. Who chooses the music? Is it the sound director?

I just want to see all of the shows that the person in charge of that has worked on.', ""Akanesasu Shoujo (Which I will refer to henceforth by its English title, Girl in Twilight) is one of the more fascinating pieces I've watched lately, a curious mixture that both knows what it wants to be and somehow manages to be a little bit of everything alongside.  It might not be what it appears to be at first, but when you get down to it, the truth is more than worthy.Let's talk about the story – we're centered around the Radio Research Club, a group of five high-school girls who like hanging out with each other (sort of) and messing with crystal radios when...they have the time.  One of them, Asuka, seems to have some passion for both the hobby and an odd little practice called the ritual of 4:44, a mysterious invocation to be performed at twilight.  Sure enough, despite who knows how many attempts before, the ritual finally works, and transports the girls to another world, a space of golden light and drifting sand, inhabited by strange creatures that quickly prove hostile.  The girls are rescued by an alternate universe version of Asuka, and from there the story really begins.Girl in Twilight, though, is not what it seems on the surface.  Which is to say, it's not a dimension-hopping action/adventure.  OK, the characters do hop dimensions, and there is occassionally some action and it's decent when it occurs (more on that later) but the pacing and conceits are more about character drama than they are sci-fi exploration or beating up monsters.The pattern for the show is this: The girls travel to a new world – one of countless alternate branching timelines that somehow have all the same people in different roles – with one of them serving as the “link”, merging with their alternate dimension self rather than simply traveling.  The world they go to will be some kind of dystopia where the girls, spearheaded by the Link who will gain new powers through self-realization, will battle a minion of the Twilight, a force of stasis and emptiness that consumes dimensions because... well, basically the Twilight is to space what the Langoliers are to time.Here's the thing: each time the show actually runs its pattern, it takes two episodes to do it, not one as you might expect.  The show uses the extra time in order to do what it's really good at, the character drama.In the end, Girl In Twilight isn't about the struggle of transforming heroes known as Equalizers against the forces of Twilight, it's about our five leads and how they can grow to understand and accept themselves in ways they didn't to begin with.  As such, each iteration of the show's pattern is mostly about one character's personal issues.  While all five characters start off looking like they could be fairly flat, each and every one of them grows dimensional when explored over the course of an arc.There is, however, that meta-story.  I'd describe it as... serviceable.  The Twilight is a pretty easily understood threat.  Even if it has deeper implications, it's pretty easy to get that this world-consuming force is bad.  And while the individual arcs and their dystopian visions don't always hit the mark, in that they mostly don't feel like real might-have-been scenarios, the larger plot does land, mostly because it takes its sweet time building it up bit by bit.  It's good throughout.  The moments work, and the whole works, and the ideas are potentially dynamite, so I can't ask for a lot more.The art, however, is a topic I'm split on.  Some of this show is absolutely gorgeous.  The Twilight's golden glow is stylish, and the colors and backgrounds overall are very pretty.  The character designs are good, they express a lot in small details, and actually mostly fit into their various scenarios.  When we get into the action scenes, though, things aren't quite so good.  The action itself is nice: there are only a couple enemies involved, but there are only a couple fights in the show so that works out, and the choreography of the fights is... it's decent, at least.  Some of the enemies and monsters lend themselves to more dynamic battles than others, but there's always at least a good sense of motion and a good ebb and flow.  The CGI though can be kind of conspicuous and detracts overall, while the designs of the super modes of the characters are a real mixed bag.  Some of them look decent all the time, some can look amazing at times but goofy at others, and at least one is just an unintentional laugh riot.  Granted, the characters aren't transformed long (because, again, not a lot of combat; it isn't the point) but I feel like a little more care could have been taken here.  The sound is good, but not amazing, I didn't find fault with any of the voices at least.Then there are the characters and... they're probably the best reason to watch this show.  The characters are, in the end, very real.  You feel the pain they're going through, and want to see them reach their resolutions.  Talking about each one in depth is something I could do, something I would love to do... but more than anything, that's what would count as a spoiler.  The show is at its best when the characters are feeling things, or realizing things about themselves, expressing and communicating their emotions.  The show has some advantage that they seem like real people with real problems in their “main universe” lives, so the relatively tropey alternate universe versions we see work not as a replacement for their real issues, but as a lens to understand those issues by them being expressed in less subtle scenarios.Girl in Twilight isn't here for transforming monster fights.  It's here for conversations and explorations of what makes people who they are, and how they can deal with their problems and move forward.  That's what makes the show strong.If there's competition in what the show does best, though, it's ideas.  I'll be honest, I underestimated this show right to the end.  It's hard not to; it starts off presenting “A world like ours but every X has to Y!” dystopias, which aren't exactly the freshest concepts.  But it's not using them for themselves, it's using and discarding them to reach something greater.  Throughout the first half of the show, I didn't exactly love it, though I thought it was better than its rating at the time had lead me to expect.  In the second half, though?  The show really takes off there as we explore the Twilight and the concepts behind it, and in that it has good turn after good turn.  Girl in Twilight went to places much more honest, heartfelt, and mature than I would have dreamed it would go, and I have a lot of respect for the show for it.Now, I want to step back to a moment.  I want you to think about the bits of media you really remember from your youth, and the marks they left on you.  For me (and a lot of Americans my age) one of those is The Neverending Story.  It had evocative imagery and a really grand sense of wonder, and it challenged me as a child for a ton of reasons, two of which were because it didn't shy away from something just because it was sad and because it didn't have a villain you could just punch out.  The Nothing wasn't like the Wicked Witch of the West or Darth Vader.  It wasn't a person, it was an esoteric idea that would destroy a beautiful world simply because that was its nature.  And the struggle against The Nothing is one that's uncompromising, where the losses along the way feel real and heavy.  The Nothing is iconic because it forces you to think.  It's an idea, and though the destruction it wreaks is very real, the source is something that requires at least a little work to understand.I think a lot of the things that really stay with you are like that – challenging and uncompromising.At the start of my review, I compared the Twilight to the Langoliers (of Steven King fame), but when you get down to it, the Twilight here is the closest anything I can think of has come to recapturing what made The Nothing a great nemesis.This isn't just because it's a somewhat mysterious force that consumes worlds, though the similarity in that nature certainly helps – it's because the Twilight and The Nothing are ultimately both ideas that tie deeply into the stories they find themselves rooted in.  The Nothing is a destructive force of void and annihilation that's formed by ennui and dying imagination, loss and despair, and the struggle is ultimately to hold on to wonder and beauty.  The Twilight is different – we learn early on that the Twilight is stasis, and for a long time we're just left with that, and don't necessarily make much of it: Stop shiny gold monsters with swirly masks, that's good right?  What you don't realize is that there's far, far more to the conflict between the Twilight and our heroes than might initially meet the eye.I've mentioned before; the characters in this show grow a lot.  They're forced to grow, and their experiences cause them to come to terms with their pasts and move forward to the future.  But, as an agent of halted time, unmoving in nature, the Twilight would deny that very idea.  Stasis is the natural opposite of moving forward.  Even the sometimes silly dystopias are anethmatic to the Twilight, because they represent possibilities.  In Girl in Twilight, new worlds are created from different possible histories, ways the world could move forward that diverge from one another.  And the Twilight is the 'world' that could never diverge, could never spawn any of these new worlds, because it is the world that doesn't change and can't change.All of this is addressed in the show, at least eventually.  And it's addressed very smartly.  Asuka and her friends don't need to spell out why the Twilight is bad, or how they're different from the Twilight's ideals; they just interact with their universe and you see it in how that falls out.  The show does get a bit esoteric, but I think that's a good thing.  There are experiences it wants to convey that aren't easy to understand and the use of non-literal but powerful visuals helps support the sense that there is something very different going on.Girl in Twilight has the potential, in the end, to be the same kind of challenging as the greats that stick with you.  It doesn't tie up everything nicely like a fairy tale, it doesn't answer every question it raises.  And I think that's a good thing.  There's more than enough hope in the tale and the ending alike to believe in, so even if you don't fix every little thing, even if the characters have to accept their pain and carry their scars rather than erasing them... it feels earned.I don't think that Girl in Twilight is a masterpiece on the whole.  There are too many parts that work only passing well; The individual worlds we visit before really engaging directly with the Twilight are the kind of setups that really need a Rod Serling Twilight Zone narration, and wouldn't necessarily be great even with that treatment.  The action is alright, but only just alright, and to an extent I question its necessity (though it is very well used at times) and the designs of the monsters and transformations are a bit hit or miss.  I think the deliberate pacing of the show, taking its sweet time to build up its ideas and characters over episode after episode, is fine and even works to the show's advantage, but especially for the first half it means you don't get real gratification.  And while the ending is powerful and moving, I have to admit that it doesn't necessarily make literal sense; it would take some work on the part of the viewer to put together what really happened.  It's strange... I appreciate the show a lot, but it was not among the most entertaining I've watched.That said, I do think Girl in Twilight is a show that deserves to be seen.  You need to give it your time, rather than relying on a taster of a couple episodes, because it builds steam constantly towards its final episodes.  It only gets stronger with every passing movement.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 8Art: 8Sound: 8Character: 9Enjoyment: 10Total: 8.6 (9)Final Verdict: Akanesasu Shoujo has powerful ideas, deep characters, and a beautifully adult attitude if you let it take the time to get where it needs to go.

Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51632/Isekai_wa_Smartphone_to_Tomo_ni_2,"['Despite all the hate it rightfully received, I really enjoyed the first season of In Another World with My Smartphone. The English dub of the first season brought self-awareness to the characters, injecting humor into an otherwise insipid storyline. This season, that spark of life from the English voice actors is sorely absent. Everyone goes through the motions, counting the days until their paycheck arrives.Season 2 is purely an abysmal descent into the depths of mediocrity, doubling down on the repulsive misogyny and complete lack of creativity of its predecessor. The episodes are a disgraceful showcase of women reduced to objects.To start,...we should get the animation out of the way—or should I say, the absence of it? Instead of breathing life into the action, they serve up mind-numbing still shots that make a snail’s pace look like a Formula 1 race. Who needs fluidity when you can have a slideshow of stagnant scenery? And the art? It’s a mishmash of confusion and chaos. Character designs morph into distorted monstrosities, mocking artistic coherence. You’ll play guess-the-character as they transform into unrecognizable blobs before your eyes.But hold on, we can’t overlook the anime’s defining trait—the abominable off-model faces. When our forgettable protagonist Touya and his harem dare to look sideways or tilt their heads, brace yourself for a roller coaster ride of contorted faces. Their faces twist and warp into grotesque abominations giving the impression that the animators were overworked to exhaustion. As if character designs were inspired by a deranged dadaist.The compositing is equally inept when the characters use their invisibility power. Instead of employing subtle visual cues to convey their appearance, the artists opted for a shockingly horrific eyesore. The resulting effect is a jarring combination of poor color grading, sloppy filters, and clashing layers. The characters appear hastily glued onto the scene, disregarding proper lighting or integration.Now, let\'s summarize the story—equal parts mind-numbingly dull and painfully predictable. In this pitiful season, we witness Touya’s shameless pursuit of multiple engagements, and his harem of indistinguishable girls expands. The show stumbles through a series of contrived scenarios, presenting forgettable female characters solely to satisfy our protagonist’s romantic interests. Along the way, we witness coerced relationships, absurdly imbalanced power dynamics, and endless sexualization, all woven together in a quilt of tastelessness. The only time he rejects a girl is when a child flirts with him. Her father offers her hand in marriage, but Touya respectfully says, ""Wait until I AM eighteen.""This season fails to rise above the misogyny cesspool established by its predecessors. It revels in reducing women to objects of desire, forsaking originality, and engaging storytelling. The abomination continues with episodes that range from cringe-worthy to appalling. We witness the main characters frolicking in a hot spring, girls non-consensually kissing Touya, and fanservice while dismissing any semblance of storytelling or character development. The plot introduces female slaves, miraculously transforming them into “employees” for our esteemed hero. What a good guy! And let’s not forget the fascination with Yaoi-themed books because nothing says respect for women like reducing them to fetish objects.And what about humor? Prepare yourself for a tidal wave of juvenile jokes and stale innuendos, the sort that make middle schoolers laugh. The writer’s misguided comedy attempts only amplify the show’s overall pitiful quality and reinforce its grim treatment of women.Political intrigue in Smartphone, or so it\'s meant to be, dissolves into a mishmash of forced engagements and the protagonist’s relentless pursuit of romantic conquests. The show’s obsession with accumulating wives and establishing kingdoms reaches nauseating heights. This reaffirms its status as a prime example of the harem genre at its most repugnant. The plot, if it can even be called that, lingers in a wasteland of predictability and worn-out tropes. The dialogue is contrived, lacking depth or meaningful exchanges. Instead, we’re subjected to endless vacuous relationships centered solely on gratifying the self-insert protagonist’s ego.In Another World With My Smartphone’s second season is a seething pile of excrement. Its abhorrent misogyny, creative bankruptcy, and absence of character development make for a hilariously awful twelve episodes. Protect yourself from this animated accident and seek out a series that treats women with a modicum of respect, subverts stereotypes, and offers an engaging story worth your time. we should get the animation out of the way—or should I say, the absence of it? Instead of breathing life into the action, they serve up mind-numbing still shots that make a snail’s pace look like a Formula 1 race. Who needs fluidity when you can have a slideshow of stagnant scenery? And the art? It’s a mishmash of confusion and chaos. Character designs morph into distorted monstrosities, mocking artistic coherence. You’ll play guess-the-character as they transform into unrecognizable blobs before your eyes.But hold on, we can’t overlook the anime’s defining trait—the abominable off-model faces. When our forgettable protagonist Touya and his harem dare to look sideways or tilt their heads, brace yourself for a roller coaster ride of contorted faces. Their faces twist and warp into grotesque abominations giving the impression that the animators were overworked to exhaustion. As if character designs were inspired by a deranged dadaist.The compositing is equally inept when the characters use their invisibility power. Instead of employing subtle visual cues to convey their appearance, the artists opted for a shockingly horrific eyesore. The resulting effect is a jarring combination of poor color grading, sloppy filters, and clashing layers. The characters appear hastily glued onto the scene, disregarding proper lighting or integration.Now, let\'s summarize the story—equal parts mind-numbingly dull and painfully predictable. In this pitiful season, we witness Touya’s shameless pursuit of multiple engagements, and his harem of indistinguishable girls expands. The show stumbles through a series of contrived scenarios, presenting forgettable female characters solely to satisfy our protagonist’s romantic interests. Along the way, we witness coerced relationships, absurdly imbalanced power dynamics, and endless sexualization, all woven together in a quilt of tastelessness. The only time he rejects a girl is when a child flirts with him. Her father offers her hand in marriage, but Touya respectfully says, ""Wait until I AM eighteen.""This season fails to rise above the misogyny cesspool established by its predecessors. It revels in reducing women to objects of desire, forsaking originality, and engaging storytelling. The abomination continues with episodes that range from cringe-worthy to appalling. We witness the main characters frolicking in a hot spring, girls non-consensually kissing Touya, and fanservice while dismissing any semblance of storytelling or character development. The plot introduces female slaves, miraculously transforming them into “employees” for our esteemed hero. What a good guy! And let’s not forget the fascination with Yaoi-themed books because nothing says respect for women like reducing them to fetish objects.And what about humor? Prepare yourself for a tidal wave of juvenile jokes and stale innuendos, the sort that make middle schoolers laugh. The writer’s misguided comedy attempts only amplify the show’s overall pitiful quality and reinforce its grim treatment of women.Political intrigue in Smartphone, or so it\'s meant to be, dissolves into a mishmash of forced engagements and the protagonist’s relentless pursuit of romantic conquests. The show’s obsession with accumulating wives and establishing kingdoms reaches nauseating heights. This reaffirms its status as a prime example of the harem genre at its most repugnant. The plot, if it can even be called that, lingers in a wasteland of predictability and worn-out tropes. The dialogue is contrived, lacking depth or meaningful exchanges. Instead, we’re subjected to endless vacuous relationships centered solely on gratifying the self-insert protagonist’s ego.In Another World With My Smartphone’s second season is a seething pile of excrement. Its abhorrent misogyny, creative bankruptcy, and absence of character development make for a hilariously awful twelve episodes.

In the post-era where Re:Zero reignited the fuel the year before that more than it exploding in popularity almost overnight, the anime industry has earned a cash-cow in the process that would proceed to slowly decimate the quality that we\'ve come to expect from the seasonal Isekai trash, with only 1 or...2 shows out of the many others that stand out in the best of ways.Literally, NOTHING has changed since Season 1 all those years ago, maybe except for the long-awaited reveal of the supposed side character Ende, as well as the harem king of Touya Mochizuki winning the hearts of the same group of girls and even more to become his wives in the process. A chad, Touya is not. I\'d thought that the girls would have more power as compared to Season 1 when they were just walking tropes onto a literate human ""god"" in the process, and indeed they have gotten stronger, it\'s just that the love is accepted as one whole heart of a family instead of polygamy, which they are totally fine with. The smartphone gimmick is still there, sadly, though it seems to have found more use this time because of more dastardly attacks ranging from the Phrase monsters to literate kingdoms having in-fighting against each other. And that\'s all I can say from a sequel that more often than not, surprises and shocks people with its resurrection from the perils of time, but for what reason it did justify that, I cannot tell you why.Rather than the kind of perfect pacing of the first 3 volumes of Patora Fuyuhara\'s now infamous LN, this adaptation, led by the now recent rom-com director Yoshiaki Iwasaki, has proven that rom-com source materials can flourish under his belt, with the caveat that this all comes at the sacrifice of quality. Mainly, the anime rushed through the remainder of Volumes 3 to 7 of the LN; almost the entirety of the staff refresh from the prequel is gone and replaced with new people, and the drop in quality in the animation department since Production Reed (now Ashi Productions) is replaced by J.C.Staff (with ENGI as production assistance), not like Isekai Smartphone had any big reputation to begin with.The music, however, is a noticeable downgrade this time as the idol group AŌP has disbanded since 2021, and the remainder of the once prolific group (along with Hio Sano) comes back to perform Season 2\'s OP, it\'s just not as good as Season 1 is. However, I am glad that the ED returned to the character-focused song (which is as enjoyable as Season 1) that\'s just one song made into different versions with the various VAs attached, although you don\'t get 6 versions of Season 1\'s ED this time and have to settle for the 3×3 grouping version instead with Season 2 here.But seriously, if you ask me: ""Is there ANY merit to even watch Isekai Smartphone nowadays?"" to which I\'ll answer: ""Nope. Isekai Smartphone was fun back then, when the criticism didn\'t amount to the social media backlash and cancel culture of today. But as of today, it\'s a shell of its former self, despite being an obvious follow-up as one of the most hated Isekai works seen over the last few years.""If you ABSOLUTELY have to watch Isekai Smartphone, be my guest, because I\'ll actually recommend Season 1 over the sequel, which is just bland and serves nothing new in its slate.

This season has less action than the first, but this has much more development of the world they live in. I like how fast-paced it is in regards to getting things done. I'm a fan of any protagonist who doesn't stress over punishing the bad guy and the fact that this protagonist enjoys making them suffer is an added bonus (as well as some comic relief).

There are of course numerous ways to execute these ideas, and there is no singular “tried-and-true” method that applies to all stories. But *In Another World with My Smartphone* season two opts to try a daring experiment – create a show in which any sense of tension is thrown out the window almost entirely, where plots that have the capacity to shape the face of a nation are resolved within twenty-three minutes at a time, and the guy always gets the girl....Perhaps this could be thought of as the power fantasy’s final form, having ascended to a new plane of transcendent understanding after six years of dormancy that our “critically-minded brains” could never dream to comprehend.Or, maybe it’s just woefully inept storytelling. Either or, really.Truth be told, I’m not going to waste my time (nor yours, for that matter) trying to convince you to try watching this franchise if you haven’t already done so. If its sense of stupidity built into the premise is not for you, nothing the show offers will change that. Visually, the show does not dazzle, either in regards to its standard animation presentation or its effects. While it might have a good character design or two interjected somewhere, there’s not much to grab the eye, which is to say nothing of its lackluster music that doesn’t escape beyond the blasé.As such, this show—and this season especially—are a thing that one actively seeks out when you know precisely what it is you’re getting into, and do not care in the slightest about the faults within it that you acknowledge are right there in front of your eyes. In some realm of your anime-viewing mind, Touya inventing ice cream in this new fantasy world and breaking familiars by causing them to constantly trip and fall amused you. Yumina’s enthusiasm at Touya having his own harem of wives, the unusually-horny gynoid Francesca, and boob jokes ruled the roost and had you chuckling more than you’d ever care to publicly admit. The second season does not disappoint in this respect. Everything that made the first season tick or fall completely flat, depending on who you ask, is alive and well here. The series therefore offers no tension, and as a result, no illusions about offering surprises beyond dime store gags. When it seems like something will come along to provide a shock to the system or status quo by turning it upside-down, the anime snaps itself right-side up again lickety-split, all without breaking a sweat.There’s something to be said for *In Another World with My Smartphone* delivering precisely what its audience wants, even if it results in a product that could be called “by-the-numbers” at-best and “creatively bankrupt” at-worst. There is indeed a function for anime’s indulgences in junk food, and much like the endless sea of snacks in a supermarket aisle, everyone has the flavor that they flock to in order to get their fix. So, when Touya spontaneously creates a public bathhouse in the span of about ten seconds, finds out that there’s a substantial request for yaoi fiction in-universe, or doesn’t need to worry about jealousy because his future wives are so excited to add another to their group, it’s a feature of the show rather than a bug. It is not aspiring to be anything more than an excuse to indulge in silliness for a half-hour every week. It will never enshrine itself in the annals of anime fantasy, but if a third season is on the horizon, I’ll do exactly what I did with my friends – happily answer any question about the show’s paper-thin lore like an eager fool, enjoying my own gluttonousness while I get bewildered looks.Just remember one thing – *In Another World with My Smartphone* got a second TV season, while others like *No Game No Life* and *Deadman Wonderland* never got theirs.

While the first season presented an entertaining if predictable concept, the second season fails to capitalize on its potential, resulting in a mediocre continuation of an overused formula.The story picks up where the first season left off, with the protagonist Touya and his companions embarking on new adventures and facing various challenges in the fantasy realm. The premise of utilizing...a smartphone as a tool in a different world initially held promise, offering a unique twist on the isekai genre. However, the second season fails to introduce fresh ideas or significant character development, relying heavily on tropes and predictable plotlines.One of the main shortcomings of the Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. 2 is its lack of originality. The anime falls into the familiar trappings of isekai storytelling, with an overpowered protagonist, a harem of female characters, and predictable conflicts that are resolved conveniently. The lack of depth and character growth makes it difficult to become emotionally invested in the narrative.Animation-wise, the series maintains a standard quality that is neither outstanding nor particularly lackluster. The visuals are pleasant enough, with vibrant colours and decent action sequences. However, the animation fails to make a lasting impression or offer any standout moments that would elevate the viewing experience.The characters in Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. 2 are largely one-dimensional, lacking significant development or depth. Touya, as the central protagonist, remains an unremarkable character with little growth or personal challenges to overcome. The supporting characters, particularly the female members of his harem, often fall into typical anime archetypes without adding much substance to the story.One of the few redeeming qualities of the series is its light-hearted and comedic tone. The anime occasionally delivers amusing moments and playful interactions among the characters. These lighthearted elements provide some entertainment value but are not enough to overcome the overall lackluster storytelling.In conclusion, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. 2 is a disappointing continuation of an isekai anime that fails to break new ground or offer meaningful character development. While it retains some light-hearted humour, the lack of originality and predictable plotlines hinder its potential. With its average animation quality and underdeveloped characters, the series falls short of standing out among the vast array of isekai anime available. Therefore, it receives a modest 6/10 rating on my anime list. a smartphone as a tool in a different world initially held promise, offering a unique twist on the isekai genre.

However, the animation fails to make a lasting impression or offer any standout moments that would elevate the viewing experience.The characters in Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. 2 are largely one-dimensional, lacking significant development or depth. Touya, as the central protagonist, remains an unremarkable character with little growth or personal challenges to overcome. The supporting characters, particularly the female members of his harem, often fall into typical anime archetypes without adding much substance to the story.One of the few redeeming qualities of the series is its light-hearted and comedic tone. The anime occasionally delivers amusing moments and playful interactions among the characters. These lighthearted elements provide some entertainment value but are not enough to overcome the overall lackluster storytelling.In conclusion, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. 2 is a disappointing continuation of an isekai anime that fails to break new ground or offer meaningful character development. While it retains some light-hearted humour, the lack of originality and predictable plotlines hinder its potential. With its average animation quality and underdeveloped characters, the series falls short of standing out among the vast array of isekai anime available. Therefore, it receives a modest 6/10 rating on my anime list.', 'I enjoyed the first season. It wasn’t a top tier anime but it was fun.  I’ll generally watch anything in the isekai genre. That said, the more I see the less I like ones that follow a cookie cutter template of boy gets reincarnated, boy is OP, every young female character throws themselves at boy and don’t bring anything else to the table.After so long, the cold open of season 2 and the subsequent remainder of the episode where nothing of note happened other than a bunch of girls fawning over the MC really set the tone for what followed. It’s just boring...and following the same old tropes and cliche which just isn’t enjoyable this time around after a 6 year break. In a season jam packed with other great anime, I couldn’t justify my limited viewing time being spent on this any more so it got dropped. and following the same old tropes and cliche which just isn’t enjoyable this time around after a 6 year break.

There are a ton of other new Isekai\'s that are worth watching over this sequel, To the people who may be fans of the first season, they might like this show but generally this show really isn\'t worth wasting your time unless you want to.Probably the thing that turned me off the most is how the MC is literally just collecting hoes every damn episode and mygod how annoying that was, It is the aspect of the show that I hated the most for this particular season and I am someone who is fine with harem but man bro has no chills, Literally every episode you see this guy charming some random bitch anywhere he goes to. Anyways enough about the harem part lets talk about the girls themselves, Most of the harem really aren\'t that interesting they\'re all bland and they do nothing other than moan, seek the MC\'s attention, and frown over the fact that the MC is collecting hoes every episode. and the MC himself is not even that good, Just a goody two shoes kirito clone.As for the story, this season was really boring although they were making progress it was just messy and the way they collect different parts of Babylon was completely repetitive and boring. I\'ve seen more engagement\'s happen than actual plot progress and action, Although I quite enjoyed the civilization building of the show I don\'t think it is enough to call it anything above decent.Overall It\'s not that I was disappointed about this season(well I wasn\'t expecting much to begin with lol) but I think it definitely is a downgrade of the first season. To the people who liked the 1st season, they might find this 2nd season quite enjoyable some might not but it definitely isn\'t the worst Isekai of this season.

I think that tells you everything you need to know about his personality,Given the long gap since the first season, I have literally forgotten any semblance of plot or character details due to the genericness of the first season. The second season didn\'t reintroduce any interesting plot elements or character quirks, likely because they aren\'t present in the first place. Rather it keeps going with a new plot with barely any background or setup.In terms of world building and storytelling, this anime literally feels like the creator threw a dart...on a board of generic anime troupes, and added them in without any consideration. It feels like elements of plot and world details are popping up erratically and disjuncted from each other, not to mentioning generally just quite boring and bland.The actions here are much worse than the first season. There is basically no clear system for the combat power of the protagonists unlike in an anime like Overlord, so they are literally just performing as the plot requires, and there is no satisfaction at watching them beat an opponent, with pure confusion when an enemy is somehow ""too strong"" for them.Now, it\'s clear that the anime focuses heavily on the Harem of girls around the MC. It does do pretty well in unique physical designs, ecchi scenes, and somewhat rarely it\'s a harem where they are in clear agreement rather than each trying to win. The anime also introduces new girls at an astonishing pace, continuing its average of almost one per episode since season 1.The representation of the MC Touya is mostly cringe inducing, overusing the most basic troupes in a forceful manner. His dialogues showcase him as a bland character at best, and pure cringe at worst.This anime is the literal definition of turn your brain off and watch, because leaving them on is likely to induce severe boredom.

SPOILER-FREE TL;DR AT THE ENDSeason 2 of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni (hereon referred to as Smartphone Isekai) is a very apt continuation of the show’s first season, with the caveat that they now know they don’t have to hide the real themes and genres of the series. Where season 1 had a lot more Isekai, action-adventure overtones, we’re now fully on romance/harem land with some mecha (?) in there for whatever reason.I tend to consider shows to be mainly either plot-driven or character-driven. The plot took a very significant backseat this season, and we’re in...generic fantasy-land with the titular smartphone barely being important and information/knowledge from our world just stops being brought up. Maybe, for a lot of viewers, this was a relief: why waste time on exposition when we’re here for OP-MC-getting-all-the-girls simulator. But for me to be fine with moving to a character-driven show is I have to care about the characters waaay more than I currently do.Someone’s got to say it, so I guess I’ll be the one, but Touya’s harem is too big and it’s growing too fast. There’s the official 7 (really?) fiancees plus Leen, and the 3 or 4 Babylon guardians, and the goddess, and Sakura. Trying to make me care about how almost 15 pre-teen to teenage girls think our character is so cool and handsome for 12 episodes is a bit too much, and I’m honestly terrified about future seasons. Also can we talk about Sakura? They just said “this girl has amnesia and is going to fall in love with Touya, okay cool, back to the show” and kept going with unrelated stuff. Why would they choose this narratively? I’m genuinely wondering if the Manga/LN is a nightmare to adapt or what.Rest of the show’s traits are inoffensive and unimportant. Very basic animation and music but they don’t take away from the experience; most of the review’s positives and negatives center around plot and characters anyways.SPOILER-FREE TL;DRSeason 2 of Smartphone Isekai is an okay continuation of the previous season. If you were watching because of the plot, you’ll be disappointed. If you were watching because of the romance and the characters, you’ll love it.

He does go on dates and kisses them, but he\'s basically forced to do it. This season he seems like he really wants nothing to do with the girls, he always seems like he is being forced to show any romantic interest at all. Technically they are his ""fiancés"" not his wives since they haven\'t been married yet (he wants to wait until he\'s 18) yet anytime ANYONE says ""wives"" or ""wife"" he ALWAYS reminds them that they aren\'t actually married yet. Overall, it was a average season, the action was down, no real character development, the romance was nowhere to be found and that\'s bad considering this is a harem, they storyline seemed to be all over the place.', ""Art : ★★★☆☆BGM : ★★★☆☆Story : ★★☆☆☆i don't know if there's some improvement from the Season 1 since i really haven't watch it for a long time xD but the art was kinda like the same with the previous Season, the BGM was also okay, but the story was kinda rushed i think.......... but overall it's still enjoyable, at least for killing time, but having 9 wives still better than 100 girlfriend LMAOOO, the Phrase was really reduced to appear in some episodes only, rather it fixed on how Touya gather his remaining wives, kinda like the Goddess of Love tho xD also Flora <3...anyway some might like it, some might not like it, as always i really appreciate the effort of making a new Season, but, well, like i said the art kinda the same for me xD and there's some movement that still looks so stiff, hope there will be future improvements and i hope there will be a continuation.Thanks for reading this :3 anyway some might like it, some might not like it, as always i really appreciate the effort of making a new Season, but, well, like i said the art kinda the same for me xD and there's some movement that still looks so stiff, hope there will be future improvements and i hope there will be a continuation.Thanks for reading this :3"", ""After the wait for 6 years the 2nd season has finally shown itself.Despite the potential of this anime, it has rather underperformed in various sections.AnimationThe anime had good animation at the start but got much worse towards the end to a point where you would think whether it was a powerpoint presentation.

Master all of them! Wait, not overpowered enough? Have God on speed dial before you even start. 10/10 would watch again!

In particular, the harem grows beyond the point where I could convince myself he genuinely cared about each waifu like I did in season one. There is a mix of new old and tired tropes like create-your-own-country, mecha, secondary harem of robo-girls, more inexplicable waifu overpoweredness-by-association, etc. The novelty of being in a new world is gone now and replaced with routine, and the focus shifts slightly from being on the hero more towards the overarching plot concerning the whole world. About damn time if you ask me, and actually it\'s not enough. We\'ll have to wait for a third season, just let\'s hope it doesn\'t take another 6 years again.I still rate this high because of subjective feelings, like the fond (even if by now vague) memories of season one.

I like the Isekai genre and although this isn't a masterpiece is an anime that you can watch to casually, it doesn't have a complicated plot or characters, it's just a simple anime and for Isekai and Harem lovers this is an anime to watch. I have already watched the first season like 5 times cause it's really easy to watch and I found myself craving for a second season and thanks that happened. "", ""Ever walked into a store and thought wouldn't it be sweet if you had a card that could buy you anything yet never exhaust it's balance, and you wouldn't need to do anything for it. No consequences, no repercussions, nothing ever changes. In a way this Anime perfectly encapsulates that and more.The second season is exactly like the first one, if you were bored out of your mind and had nothing better to do, perhaps this would have appealed to you, and also because there is quirky little gimmick attached to it, that of a smartphone. Apart from that it has nothing worth mentioning....Nothing.I think most of us checked this out for that reason alone, and found it rather bland and tame when it aired intiailly. Can not say much has changed since then. Whether it is the plot or the characters, everything is still the same, only elongated and further addition of those exact varieties under new guises. Animation is as bland as ever, music is as dull as ever, and enjoyment is still far from what it can really give.So with that in mind, if you really love the series and can't live without it, do yourself a favour and just stick to the Light Novel.

Anemone,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10516/Anemone,"['The word ""anemone"" comes from the Greek word for “windflower"", ánemos, and means ""daughter of the wind."" It has both a positive and negative meaning; they can represent fading/dying hope and/or a feeling of having been forsaken, but can also symbolize anticipation. I\'ve also read that in Japan it symbolizes ""sincerity"" but I don\'t have any evidence to back that up. According to Greek mythology, the anemone sprang from Aphrodite’s tears as she mourned the death of Adonis. They are also thought to bring luck and protect against evil.In the case of this short animation, however, I think they are being given not only...to protect against evil, but also in anticipation of making a better decision. Right now our nameless protagonist is searching and deciding if she wants to live. This is the part of her that is feeling a loss of hope, as though she were forsaken. Symbolically it is her past or youthful, hopeful self that gives her the seeds that anticipate what the future will bring.The rabbit is the guide that transports our protagonist out of the gray sea of nameless faces and back to the warmth and comfort of her childhood home.*Geeky side note: To me, he looks like an Amami rabbit (found in Amami Ōshima), which interestingly are an endangered species.According to once source, the rabbit denotes ""quiet endurance of one\'s pain."" A white rabbit can symbolize the awakening of spirit or a symbol for Easter and resurrection. A prolific rabbit can symbolize the power of the sexual feelings.  While I don\'t see anything like the last option in this anime, the first one actually makes a great deal of sense. If I were to guess, I would presume (possibly incorrectly, but in this case what harm could it do) that many people who attempt or are considering committing suicide usually are quietly enduring some form of pain, whether it is their own or someone elses. If this is the case, the presence of a rabbit would be ideal - particularly if the rabbit also symbolized an awakening of spirit.I felt the music for this work was fine, but certainly nothing extraordinary. It didn\'t affect me in anyway and served mostly as pretty background music. As a bit of a snob, I think it could have been better if it had followed more of an effectual path that changed throughout the piece, however it was a short film and I don\'t begrudge them any for chosing the music they did.The art style was interesting and effective though. It encourages the message and conveys the feelings of the protagonist exactly. While in cold and faceless world, she is living upside down and watching the world around her pass as she feels lost and honestly probably bored as well.What really made this interesting for me was the choice of symbolism. It\'s a nice little anime and it gives a good message. to protect against evil, but also in anticipation of making a better decision.

In the author comments, at the beginning of the book, there was a peculiar advice: ""Stop reading the author notes now, read the novel, and then come back here. That way you\'ll understand everything"". For Anemone, I will give you a similar advice: read this review, THEN SEE THE VIDEO, AND LASTLY, READ THE SYNOPSIS (IN ANEMONE\'S PAGE, OF COURSE). THAT WAY, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT HAPPENS (well, at least for me, it worked that way xD).Understood? Ok, let\'s begin.Anemone is a five minute short...created by Junichi Yamamoto, and is about... well, let\'s say it\'s about how re-watching our past can help us to overcome the present, and move forward.The characters in this work are: our protagonist, and ordinary young girl, a bit depressed and confused by her current situation, a yellow rabbit (looks like Mr. Yamamoto really like those, he also used one in the short film Melody), that in the style in Alice in Wonderland, have an important watch, and a child, who would be the trigger for the progress of the story. There are other characters, which I will simply call “the masked ones"", which remind us, once again, that you can be alone even if you are surrounded by people...Visually, this short is impressive. We have landscapes amazingly well done, contrasting a grey distorted world (my personal favorite) that has many dimensions (or lot of camera angles), with a much more friendly and homely atmosphere (just a regular and comfy house), full of color and hope (and... anemone seeds, apparently... I didn\'t get that part xD). The character design is a bit more... let\'s say, experimental. Not bad in any way (pretty cool, actually), but they\'re a bit weird.The music is the typical in Yamamoto\'s works (and in the drama genre, at least in the short films I watched), pretty similar to the one in a music box, very soft and calm.As a closure, I will simply say that Anemone is a beautiful short. When I was writing this review, I noticed (actually, already knew), that drama is not my area. Is just way out of my league. Still, I decide to make it anyway, for the same reason I did the rest: to draw attention of the people on this page, to watch something not very popular (at the moment writing this, only 200 hundred people watched it). Unlike the things I usually see, this short has a message. I recommend this film to everyone reading this. See it. Understand it, absorb the message. And be happy, which is the most important thing :).Oh, and the other Yamamoto works are pretty similar, so, if you liked this one, you will surely like the others.--------Hace varios años, leí una historia llamada “La especialidad de la casa”, de Stanley Ellin. En los comentarios del autor, al principio del libro, había un consejo bastante peculiar: “deje de leer las notas del autor, lea la novela, y después vuelva a estas notas. De esa forma lo entenderá todo”. Para Anemone, voy a darles un consejo similar: lean esta review primero, DESPUES VEAN EL VIDEO, Y POR ULTIMO LEAN LA SINOPSIS. DE ESA FORMA, ENTENDERAN MEJOR QUE ES LO QUE PASA (bueno, al menos así paso conmigo xD).Entendido? Bueno, empecemos.Anemone es un corto de cinco minutos creado por Junichi Yamamoto, y trata sobre... bueno, solo digamos que trata sobre como reever nuestro pasado puede ayudarnos a sobreponernos al presente, y a avanzar hacia el futuro.Los personajes presentes son nuestra protagonista, una joven común y corriente, acaso  deprimida y confundida por su situación, un conejo amarillo (se ve que al señor Yamamoto le gustan, también uso uno en su corto Melody), que al mejor estilo Alicia en el país de las maravillas, tiene un reloj muy importante para la trama, y una niña, que será el disparador para que la historia avance. Hay otros personajes, a los que simplemente llamare “los enmascarados”, que nos recuerdan, una vez más, que podemos estar solos a pesar de estar rodeados de gente...A nivel técnico, este corto es impecable. Por el lado grafico, tenemos unos paisajes muy, muy muuuuuy bien hechos, contrastando un distorsionado mundo gris (mi favorito personal) que posee varias dimensiones, con un mucho más amigable ambiente hogareño, llena de colores y esperanza (y de semillas... de anémonas... esa parte decididamente no la entendí bien xD). El diseño de personajes desentona un poco con el de los fondos, pero creo que eso es a propósito. No por eso estoy diciendo que están mal hechos, solo que parecen mas... “experimentales”, por usar una palabra.La música es la típica de Yamamoto (y de este estilo de cortos dramáticos), similar a la de una caja de música, muy tranquila y conciliadora.Para terminar, Anemone es un corto hermoso. Cuando me plantee escribir esta review, me di cuenta (en realidad, sabía de antemano) de que el drama no es mi área. Simplemente está más allá de mis habilidades.

That world is upside-down as well. Later she meets an anthropomorphic rabbit in suit and top hat who transports her, like in Alice in Wonderland, to a different scene. The scene turns out to be her childhood home.This anime short is a visually stunning and very wise, no-dialogue commentary on losing and regaining hope, the force of memories and...what keeps us going.

If you\'ve answered yes to this, here are some quick tips to help you...out:▸Is there a typical school setting? ☑▸Is the protagonist a pussy magnet? ☑▸Is there a beach or hot spring episode? ☑▸Is there a love interest story that goes nowhere? ☑▸Is there unnecessary fanservice in the cover photo? ☑▸Is the lead easily flustered by anything involving females? ☑▸Does it go from tensionless fights to school rom-com at the drop of a hat? ☑▸Is there some kind of a pussy beta-male protagonist with a ""unique""/hax superpower? ☑▸Is there a lot of instances where your lead is viewed as a pervert due to stupid misunderstandings? ☑▸Is there at least one obligatory scene where this meta-male either walks in on a girl changing or accidentally gropes them? ☑If you answered ""yes"" to most, if not, all of those, then congrats! You\'ve just found yourself a mouth-breather tier anime title. Either that or you\'ve accidentally watched this piece of garbage, Absolute Duo. Absolute Duo does absolutely nothing new. It\'s the same cookie-cutter assembly-line product regurgitated yearly from the anime industry. With a few slight tweaks here and there, and a fresh coat of paint to mask the stench of unoriginality, these titles are excreted out by the dozen on constant demand. Absolute Duo is just another statistic.Why bother writing a compelling narrative when excessive info-dumps and monologuing could do the trick? Why bother to make something with a modicum of artistic expression when you would just flash a few pantsu to win over mouth-breathers? Why bother trying when the audience being pandered to don\'t even demand anything more? It\'s hard not to be sardonic about titles like these, especially when the problem stems far deeper than simply ""the studio\'s fault."" And in the case of Duo, what we have here is a symptom of audience complacency. Here\'s a world that exists byways of audience participation to do all the legwork for it. The show doesn\'t try because it\'s effectively harvested a viewership that doesn\'t expect it to.The world of Absolute Duo is that of a dystopian future. A detail that\'s rendered entirely pointless given that it all takes place in a high school setting, with the purpose of even addressing the nature of the world\'s construct only coming to play to allow these teens the ability to wield supernatural weaponry—no, that\'s not a joke, the show is really that lazy. And as is the tradition for these kinds of stories, we\'re given hints of a manipulative government faction. We\'re given hints at a budding school romance. We\'re given hints that the powers in the show have something more behind its mechanics than what\'s being told. We\'re given hints at a troubled backstory for our protagonist. We\'re given A LOT of hints but that\'s all, as this is yet another ""read the manga"" kind of title, where its entire purpose of existing hints towards being an advertisement for the source material. An ugly-looking, drably produced advertisement at that.The color placement is flat. Its environment evenly lit, like the backlight of a computer monitor or the glow of a tracing table. This is an anime that can\'t be bothered with the trivial task of having a personality. It would much rather slouch about. Cardboard cutout characters designed with no discernable feature from its usual counterparts. Personalities equally as stock-piled, their behavior as lackluster as the color choices used to bring them to life. Not a single characteristic that expresses passion. Just a heartless product pumped out by the iron presses of a studio machine looking to make a quick profit with as little effort as possible.It\'s hard to find anything here worth mentioning, as the only thing interesting about Duo is just how much it manages to fail. All you simply have to do is look at all the genres it\'s supposedly made up of and see it misses the mark with all of them:▸It doesn\'t work as a school title since the school is just a backdrop and was never truly utilized.▸It doesn\'t work as a romance since nothing ever happens between the main love interest and the protagonist.▸It doesn\'t work as an action title since the fight sequences were barely animated with any sort of energy or dynamics.▸It doesn\'t work as a supernatural show since none of the power mechanics or lore gets fleshed out beyond face value.▸It doesn\'t work as a harem since the protagonist is a typical beta-male that freezes up at the thought of a woman\'s touch.▸It doesn\'t work as an ecchi title since it\'s not titillating, made worse when titles like Queen\'s Blade exists with amazing ""plot.""This is a title that quite literally fails at everything it attempts to cover, and as such, I can\'t see how this could be anything less than a waste of 4 hours of your life.Overall: Duo/10Absolute Duo is Absolute Garbage. It\'s a cheaply made cash-grab that serves no other purpose than selling the source material it\'s adapted from. A quick glimpse into the ugly side of the entertainment industry, showing just how far a studio is willing to compromise its principals to make a quick buck. out:▸Is there a typical school setting? ☑▸Is the protagonist a pussy magnet? ☑▸Is there a beach or hot spring episode? ☑▸Is there a love interest story that goes nowhere? ☑▸Is there unnecessary fanservice in the cover photo? ☑▸Is the lead easily flustered by anything involving females? ☑▸Does it go from tensionless fights to school rom-com at the drop of a hat? ☑▸Is there some kind of a pussy beta-male protagonist with a ""unique""/hax superpower? ☑▸Is there a lot of instances where your lead is viewed as a pervert due to stupid misunderstandings? ☑▸Is there at least one obligatory scene where this meta-male either walks in on a girl changing or accidentally gropes them? ☑If you answered ""yes"" to most, if not, all of those, then congrats!

Absolute duo may seem like your average action/harem anime, because it is.Story: 2/10First off let me remind you that the plot is set in a world far, far away where girls possess all the cup sizes from A to Z cups. So don\'t be suprised if they turn out to be the only thing worth watching in the whole show.Absolute Duo is about your average male protagonist who gains a special power and wants to seek...revenge for his deceased family. Tooru Kokonoe is a teenager who has the ability to materialize “Blazes” out of his soul. But he has no ordinary Blaze his blaze is an irregular, while other people generate Weapons Tooru can generate a shield. (Big deal right?) He then uses his special ability and enrolls himself into a school that teaches him to become stronger (even though he’s a bit overpowered already). At this school he is forced to kick some booty, which then leads the female protagonist, Julie, to realize his existence. She takes interest in him, and by some random chance they are forced into the dorm room, and as the series goes on they become an “absolute duo” which also forges an intimate relationship with each other. The anime throws you a couple curve balls later on, which keeps the story somewhat interesting.Sound: 7/10-\tGreat Choice of voice actors, Matsuoka who voiced Sora and Kirito from NGNL and Sao voiced Tooru.-\tThe OP’s and ED’s so far are pretty great, in my opinion.-\tGreat soundtracks for most scenes especially the romantic scenes.-\tDid a good job of using music for suspense and such.-\tThey need better soundtracks for action scenes.(not really many action scenes so far tbh)Characters: 3/10Most of the characters are a bit bland and unoriginal.-\tTooru- Your average male lead who has a harem, he cares for his peers, and has overpowered combat abilities.-\tJulie- Your average shy airheaded dandere who’s a few slices short of a fruit cake, also has good combat abilities-\tMiyabi- Your average shy useless character who’s afraid of males and her only job is to piss the audience off. (At least for me)-\tTomoe- Your average female protagonist who doesn’t know what love is, but then realizes she falls in love with the male protagonist. (So let the awkwardness ensue)-\tLilith- A bratty rich girl, who is apparently from England, and also an irregular, she has mastered the fine arts of Engrish.-\tUsa Sensei- Their homeroom teacher who has two personalities. (Probably the most interesting character in the show)Needless to say if all of these females had the brains the size of their bust it would make the show a whole lot more interesting.Art: 8/10The only thing that was good in this anime.-\tCharacters have big boobs.-\tGreat use of vibrant colors.-\tGood contrast between light and dark.-\tNicely animated action scenes.I’d say 8-bit studios did a pretty great job.Enjoyment: 3/10The anime definitely wasn\'t worth my time. The anime was pretty horrid from it\'s stupidly broad plot to it\'s equally broad characters. It\'s sad to see the anime end up so horribly because it actually had a lot of potential, but the directors or whoever does the screenplay ruined the whole show by making the show 99% fanservice with no plot.Overall: 4/10I gave the anime an overall score of 4. Taking all things into consideration I had high hopes for this anime and I\'d hoped it wont let me down. But several episodes in, I\'d realized that even Jesus couldn\'t save this anime. The genre and tone seemed to be right up my alley, which is action, harem, and a slight dab of comedy. But after watching this many episodes I think my opinions were most likely clouded.

This is my first review of Winter 2015. Oh yeah. Before I get on with the review just let me put some more nails in the coffin which now lies the ecchi jokes. Excuse me for a second.Ok. I\'m done.STORY (2):Absolute Duo or Absolute Hatred follows these two bland characters by the name of Tor Kokonoe & Julie Sigtuna who attend Koryo Academy where they are trained in combat skills using Blaze. Blaze are supernatural weapons that suit different combat skills.Let me tell you that I have 0 expectations when going into this anime. The concept is boring and it is an...ecchi genre. In fact, after that horrendous atrocity known as Rail Wars, I wasn\'t looking forward to watching this anime. So you know what, why not I review this anime.You might say ""Why are you viewing an ecchi anime with expectations?"" My answer is ""I\'m sorry. My butt cannot stand being violated by Winter Season Anime especially when it comes to ecchi jokes.""This anime has some of the most horrendous dialogue and horrendous jokes I have ever seen since Rail Wars. There is one scene which is the worst scene I have ever seen in this anime. It is when Tomoe meets Tor for the first time, she keeps apologizing and jumps onto Tor and her head lands on Tor\'s crotch. Then some pauses and ""I\'m Sorry!"" again and then Tomoe does another flip and Tomoe\'s butt landed on Tor, and pauses again. Rail Wars did that kind of joke like when Takayama accidentally gropes Haruka\'s boobs, there was a pause and then ""I\'m sorry"". Seriously, how many times must an anime follow that kind of rule? I\'m sorry, whenever I think of that scene, I always cringe inside.There is also this girl get embarrassed when guy looks at the boobs. Bouncing of boobs. Beach episode. I can\'t take it.Oh yeah, there was the fight scene between Miyabi & Tomoe. How they end the fight scene was so ridiculous. It ends with Miaybi saying ""I\'ve been foiled by the power of love"".At the very end, they tried to tie everything together and it was a fail. The fight scenes were rushed.ART (4):The animation is nothing impressive. When it is dark, it is very dull. The action scenes are all dull and boring. These action scenes are all the ""Been there, done that"" action scenes. I never pay attention to the action scenes because I don\'t care anymore.SOUND (4):The opening and ending are not memorable.CHARACTER (2):Where do I begin?Tor & Julie might be like the new Sora & Shiro. However, Tor is more generic than compared to Shiro. His personality is as interesting as Edward Cullen. Especially, Julie, she is just another Bella Swan, who clings onto Tor with no personality.Tomoe Tachibana - Her voice actress is Ayaka Suwa who voiced Tokaku Azuma from the atrocity known as Akuma no Riddle. She had the potential to become an interesting character like Mikazuki Yozora from Haganai. However, her character is annoying by apologizing to Tor a lot of times and she get into comedic misunderstandings with Tor.Miyabi Hotaka - What can I say? She is the most generic character I have ever seen.Lilith Bristol: I also have nothing to say about her. She is just an generic tsundere.The teacher bunny by the name of Rito Tsumiki was so annoying. She tried to sound cute but she sounded more like nails scratching on chalkboard. The voice actress Yukari Tamura, her voice is no longer funny or cute, her voice was just annoying. Your cute voice is no longer relevant anymore, you just sound like a broken record player trying to work.K is a generic villain. He looks like Gilgamesh from Fate/Stay Night. However, his personality is as interesting as a cardboard box. K only appears on the later half of the show.CONCLUSION (2):I am so tired of these clichéd ecchi jokes. They are not funny or entertaining anymore. I didn\'t get a boner in any of the episodes. They are just cringe inducing. Saekano at least tried not to use these ecchi jokes but instead focus on good character development and serve its purpose well. This anime on the other hand tries to use all those ""been there, done that"" jokes and try to pass it off as entertaining. NO! You don\'t do that!Ecchi jokes don\'t work anymore. Anyone who is planning to make an anime, DO NOT use ecchi jokes. Ecchi jokes are dead. They are not funny. All the ecchi jokes are just cash-grabbing, like to take people\'s time. I value my time and money and you should too. If you want to make a good comedy anime, do not use ecchi jokes. Make a good story with effort. There is no bigger crime than an anime that is meant to make people laugh or have a boner failed to do that.This anime might not be a complete atrocity unlike ""Pupa"". But just like ""Pupa"", this anime is a prime example of the continuing bad practices of anime companies producing terrible anime in Winter Seasons. Especially when it comes to Ecchi genres.I don\'t have any expectations. The reason why I give this anime a 2 out of 10 is because the voice acting was decent except for Yukari Tamura, decent fight scenes and the animation at least wasn\'t bad compared to Pupa.

Way to start my first review for Winter 2015, well done ""Absolute Duo""!I now need to rest my head because there are more reviews to come for Winter 2015.', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)Wanting to be stronger is something that a lot of people strive for. And that isn\'t just in the sense of lifting weights to tone one\'s muscles. There is strength of mind in the form of intelligence or strength of spirit in having the courage to do what\'s right. But no matter its form, strength isn\'t something that is easily obtained. Hardship and difficulties are what give shape to such strength, and subsequently determine what strength is ultimately earned. This is what Absolute Duo tries to convey, but without much strength to support even itself.STORYAbsolute Duo follows young...Tor Kokonoe as he enrolls in Kouyou Academy to take part in the ""Duo"" program. There, he meets Julie Sigtuna, a mysterious girl who eventually becomes his fighting partner.Absolute Duo is an ecchi series, therefore making much of the content focus on showing the girls in promiscuous situations. In other words, there are many scenes involving bouncing breasts, unfit clothing, and risqué positions that attempt to entice the viewer. No girl is left unscathed: Julie often wears a single button-up shirt, Miyabi always has the camera aimed at her enormous bosom, and Lilith revels in her sexuality which gives her the confidence to perform more daring ventures. The ecchi itself isn\'t too classy or original, usually falling back on easy tropes like lost panties or chest-hugging, but there is a nice amount of it throughout its entire run.And that\'s as far as Absolute Duo gets in terms of positivity. When it isn\'t sexualizing its characters or going through with a comedic moment, the show doesn\'t know what to do with itself. The story it attempts to tell is entirely contrived, filled with disjointed segments and an apparent lack of cohesion. The students are fighting in a mall one episode, only to be whisked away to a secluded island the next. The motivation behind many of these events is spurred on by the so-called principal\'s desire of obtaining ""Absolute Duo,"" but what that really is isn\'t explained. And that goes for a large portion of the show: What was ""Equipment Smith"" trying to do? Who killed Tor\'s loved one? How does one become an ""Exception?"" There are other questions that are raised similar to these that are never answered, or even when they are, they are done in a slipshod manner. For example, Julie\'s actual status and powers are hastily shoved in minutes before the end of the series. Another is the ""Reign Conference"" that brought many different leaders together, but the meeting\'s purpose wasn\'t explained properly nor did it affect the outcome that followed. Again, these are just a few, but suffice it to say that the majority of whatever is presented is largely given the bare minimum of attention. All of this says nothing of the fight scenes, the powers everyone uses in them, and how lame most end up being. Tor\'s hammer-fist exists without explanation, bad guys let people live for no reason, and the battles usually give the side-cast the short end of the stick. It\'s all just a mess that it never recovers from, from start to finish.Hearkening back to the anime\'s theme, the show plays with the idea of strength, what it is, and how one obtains it. Many of the characters have separate drives when it comes to finding said strength: for revenge, for love, and for protection, to name a few. In order to make the idea more meaningful, the anime also tackles how some kinds of strength are evil: ""taking the easy route"" to get it is bad, as is simply wanting to have it without a purpose. The problem, though, is that such a theme is muddied by the fan-service, the lame narrative, and the pointless battles. Beyond that, the classification of strength in such a way is strange. Because it isn\'t so much how you get such strength, but what you do with it that matters. ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" as they say. In other words, Absolute Duo\'s segmentation of strength is not only difficult to see but also difficult to accept.ANIMATIONThe art for Absolute Duo is somewhat boring. It usually consists of the same-looking schools and buildings, with some variation in location. Some forests, a beach, and an amusement park here and there, but nothing that catches the eye or causes wonderment for the audience. Perhaps this is simply a product of the setting of the anime itself, with it not lending to such interesting environments. Regardless, what is presented is generally devoid of high detail, making it look general and same-y.The character designs are strangely hit-or-miss. Julie\'s white hair and magenta-filled eyes are nice, yet Tor\'s, Tomoe\'s, and Miyabi\'s lack of detail is not. Their school uniforms have many layers, with blues, whites, and blacks making up most of their composition. On top of this, the Blazes (the weapons the cast wield) are jagged and black in color, giving them an ominous feeling that reflects the weapons\' very nature.Actual animation is not wishy-washy. Bluntly put, it\'s bad. And that\'s something that is sorely unneeded for a show that spends a lot of time on the fighting scenes it constantly throws the audience\'s way. During these scenarios, there are way too many close-ups and simple movements to reduce the amount of animation required. There is also the very jarring use of 3D used for particular situations and characters that is nothing more than distracting.CHARACTERSThe characters of Absolute Duo do not fair too much better than their story brethren.Tor is the star of the show, so his ""importance"" is the highest. Yet he\'s arguably the worst of the bunch. Average, kind, and compassionate, he\'s probably the perfect protector for Julie. This is further reinforced by his lone character trait: screaming ""Julie!"" whenever he has the chance. Obviously, he cares about her, which is fine. But there isn\'t anything else to him than that. That is, his past is mired in failed protection, so he makes it his life\'s duty to do what he previously could not. And he doesn\'t budge from such a stance; he doesn\'t experience other tribulations nor does he see such protecting as much of a challenge. He\'s the same super-nice, super-friendly, super-bad character for the whole show.Sadly, Julie isn\'t much of an improvement, either. She\'s very quiet, sticking to Tor at all times due to some strange attachment. Furthermore, she isn\'t accustomed to her new surroundings, meaning she constantly does things incorrectly -- a gag rather than a meaningful characterization. Regardless, she, too, has a past that is controlled by death. But where Tor wanted to protect, Julie wanted to eviscerate. This development isn\'t revealed until much later into the show\'s run, meaning, once again, she is similar to Tor in that her growth over the course of the anime is nonexistent. She ""likes Tor"" and ""wants to be his Duo,"" but there is nothing more to her character outside of her quasi-girlfriend relationship with the main hero.The rest of the cast is wholly uninspiring as well. Rito is the professor who is also a bunny with a good and evil personality. Ryuutarou likes to flex his muscles. Aoi is quite annoying. Tomoe is quick to misunderstand and Miyabi is very shy. Both of these girls, though, are slightly better off than the others, receiving some focus later on in the series. But the problems they face are resolved too quickly to prove worthwhile to their overall characters. If anything, Lilith, the ""Exception,"" really is the only exception. She begins rather abrasive towards others, acting wholly arrogant given her special status. But after dealing with Tor\'s unwavering attitude and competing against the people she deemed worthless, she opens up, becoming both approachable and a good friend to the rest of the gang.As a further look into everyone\'s character, and as becomes somewhat known over the course of the anime, the Blazes of the students are designed in such a way as to reflect the soul that wields it. Tor\'s is a shield due to his absolute need to protect the people around him. Julie wields two swords, demonstrating her need to punish first and ask questions later. Lilith uses a rifle to not only align with the ""Exception"" status but also due to her rather aimed personality. Tomoe\'s is a whip due to her cracking back-and-forth from being judgmental to apologetic, whereas Miyabi\'s is a massive jousting spear due to her already large amount of untapped potential. This technique can be applied to each of the named members of the show. And while not a fascinating detail, it is at least an okay concept that is employed to aid in characterization.SOUNDThe OP for the show is rather fast, with the vocalist doing a lot of work. She shows a large amount of range, with both high and low notes, as well as extended note-holding. The beat and instruments are surprisingly modern, sounding more techno than instrumental. It\'s an okay song overall, but largely forgettable.The first ED is very aquatic in nature. It\'s slow, with the drums and violin working during the first half. Around the middle, the sound somewhat cuts away, having the singer sort of ""skipping"" with the lyrics. Afterwards, the beat picks back up, with the vocalist continuing with the softer way of singing. Again, an okay piece that isn\'t highly memorable.The second ED is rather lackluster, with its easy beat and simple singing. The only mentionable part of the track is the ending ""Happy, happy!"" speaking, which is both cute and fun.Lastly, the third ED is more melancholic than the rest. The first third is interspersed with harp-like sounds and high violin playing. The second third becomes more hopeful, with the singer and instruments slowing down just a bit, with the final third picking back up the tempo. But like the second ED, this song just isn\'t that good to listen to, either on its own or within the show.The soundtrack has nothing worth remembering, either. There are ""soldier""-esque tracks with drums and violins during battle segments, piano tracks during sad moments, and elevator music during the laid-back ones. They\'re simple mood pieces that aren\'t special or significant in any way.Voice-acting is about average across the board. Special shout-out to Nozomi Yamamoto as Julie for all of her ""Ja\'s"" and ""Nej\'s.""ENJOYMENTThe show could be funny at times, especially in regard to Julie\'s ignorance of social cues and general cuteness. From her hair wiggle to her constant clinging to Tor, she could usually put a smile on my face. The other girls could, too; Tomoe\'s prostrations after mistaking the situation or Lilith\'s unabashed advances were enough to make me smile.I can\'t say that I like any of the characters, though. Or any of the battles for that matter. Or any of the world\'s rules and what-not. All of it is just ""there,"" with barely any semblance of ""oomph."" And it\'s not that it had a lot to work with, but more so the fact that it couldn\'t do anything with what it had.Absolute Duo is an anime that focuses on pairings: relationships and boobs being the most prominent. But no amount of fan-service could save this one from its awful plot, lame characters, boring art, and forgetful music. It\'s simply a really bad experience the whole way through.SUMMARYStory: Bad, okay ecchi scenes, disjointed plot, lame motifAnimation: Bad, okay art style, okay character designs, below average actual animationCharacters: Bad, Tor and Julie are poor characters, the rest of the cast besides Lilith is just as poor, Blazes at least serve some purposeSound: Bad, okay OP, okay first ED, bad second ED, bad third ED, bad soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, could be comical at times but not much elseFinal Score: 2/10 Tor Kokonoe as he enrolls in Kouyou Academy to take part in the ""Duo"" program. There, he meets Julie Sigtuna, a mysterious girl who eventually becomes his fighting partner.Absolute Duo is an ecchi series, therefore making much of the content focus on showing the girls in promiscuous situations. In other words, there are many scenes involving bouncing breasts, unfit clothing, and risqué positions that attempt to entice the viewer. No girl is left unscathed: Julie often wears a single button-up shirt, Miyabi always has the camera aimed at her enormous bosom, and Lilith revels in her sexuality which gives her the confidence to perform more daring ventures. The ecchi itself isn\'t too classy or original, usually falling back on easy tropes like lost panties or chest-hugging, but there is a nice amount of it throughout its entire run.And that\'s as far as Absolute Duo gets in terms of positivity. When it isn\'t sexualizing its characters or going through with a comedic moment, the show doesn\'t know what to do with itself. The story it attempts to tell is entirely contrived, filled with disjointed segments and an apparent lack of cohesion. The students are fighting in a mall one episode, only to be whisked away to a secluded island the next. The motivation behind many of these events is spurred on by the so-called principal\'s desire of obtaining ""Absolute Duo,"" but what that really is isn\'t explained. And that goes for a large portion of the show: What was ""Equipment Smith"" trying to do? Who killed Tor\'s loved one? How does one become an ""Exception?"" There are other questions that are raised similar to these that are never answered, or even when they are, they are done in a slipshod manner. For example, Julie\'s actual status and powers are hastily shoved in minutes before the end of the series. Another is the ""Reign Conference"" that brought many different leaders together, but the meeting\'s purpose wasn\'t explained properly nor did it affect the outcome that followed. Again, these are just a few, but suffice it to say that the majority of whatever is presented is largely given the bare minimum of attention. All of this says nothing of the fight scenes, the powers everyone uses in them, and how lame most end up being. Tor\'s hammer-fist exists without explanation, bad guys let people live for no reason, and the battles usually give the side-cast the short end of the stick. It\'s all just a mess that it never recovers from, from start to finish.Hearkening back to the anime\'s theme, the show plays with the idea of strength, what it is, and how one obtains it. Many of the characters have separate drives when it comes to finding said strength: for revenge, for love, and for protection, to name a few. In order to make the idea more meaningful, the anime also tackles how some kinds of strength are evil: ""taking the easy route"" to get it is bad, as is simply wanting to have it without a purpose. The problem, though, is that such a theme is muddied by the fan-service, the lame narrative, and the pointless battles. Beyond that, the classification of strength in such a way is strange. Because it isn\'t so much how you get such strength, but what you do with it that matters. ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" as they say. In other words, Absolute Duo\'s segmentation of strength is not only difficult to see but also difficult to accept.ANIMATIONThe art for Absolute Duo is somewhat boring. It usually consists of the same-looking schools and buildings, with some variation in location. Some forests, a beach, and an amusement park here and there, but nothing that catches the eye or causes wonderment for the audience. Perhaps this is simply a product of the setting of the anime itself, with it not lending to such interesting environments. Regardless, what is presented is generally devoid of high detail, making it look general and same-y.The character designs are strangely hit-or-miss. Julie\'s white hair and magenta-filled eyes are nice, yet Tor\'s, Tomoe\'s, and Miyabi\'s lack of detail is not. Their school uniforms have many layers, with blues, whites, and blacks making up most of their composition. On top of this, the Blazes (the weapons the cast wield) are jagged and black in color, giving them an ominous feeling that reflects the weapons\' very nature.Actual animation is not wishy-washy. Bluntly put, it\'s bad. And that\'s something that is sorely unneeded for a show that spends a lot of time on the fighting scenes it constantly throws the audience\'s way. During these scenarios, there are way too many close-ups and simple movements to reduce the amount of animation required. There is also the very jarring use of 3D used for particular situations and characters that is nothing more than distracting.CHARACTERSThe characters of Absolute Duo do not fair too much better than their story brethren.Tor is the star of the show, so his ""importance"" is the highest. Yet he\'s arguably the worst of the bunch. Average, kind, and compassionate, he\'s probably the perfect protector for Julie. This is further reinforced by his lone character trait: screaming ""Julie!"" whenever he has the chance. Obviously, he cares about her, which is fine. But there isn\'t anything else to him than that. That is, his past is mired in failed protection, so he makes it his life\'s duty to do what he previously could not. And he doesn\'t budge from such a stance; he doesn\'t experience other tribulations nor does he see such protecting as much of a challenge. He\'s the same super-nice, super-friendly, super-bad character for the whole show.Sadly, Julie isn\'t much of an improvement, either. She\'s very quiet, sticking to Tor at all times due to some strange attachment. Furthermore, she isn\'t accustomed to her new surroundings, meaning she constantly does things incorrectly -- a gag rather than a meaningful characterization. Regardless, she, too, has a past that is controlled by death. But where Tor wanted to protect, Julie wanted to eviscerate.

However, I liked that fact that the plot consists mainly of two 'avengers' seeking power to avenge their loved ones who died. it may be cliché but It works (for me anyway). And then there's the underlying story of the head mistress and her goal to reach absolute duo. On top of that there's also the character K who is a soilder of a different origin than the exceeds. The plot is under developed but I feel that there's a lot to it which can be explored...in depth which is my main reason for having hope for a second season.In terms of characters, I like it because all of the characters seem relatable in some way e.g. Tor dealing with the situation of having to live with a girl. Then there's Miyabi who gets turned down by Tor and you get to see how she deals with rejection (although her response was far more radical than it would be of a normal high school kid it was still along the lines of what you'd expect i.e. thinking there's something wrong with herself and wanting to change in order to get Tor to like her). Then there's Julie who gets jealous because of lilith's affection towards Tor etc. There's also Tomoe who cares about everyone and so on. and you've also got Rito who at the start all of the characters don't really like (similar to the way kids in school will have that one teacher they're not that fond of). However, that does change at the end because she protects the dorm and the pupils inside. On a side note, lilith is a very interesting character as she is the only other character other than Tor who has an abnormal blaze. She is also fixated on ensuring that Tor becomes her future husband which leads to an awkward relationship between herself, Tor and Julie. All of the characters are in desperate need of development but there has been slight developments i.e. Tor finally accepting that he'll be living with Julie - that his duo is a girl etcThe combat is pretty poor for the most part I have to admit, but, I feel like that may be primarily due to the fact that one of the main protagonists are based on protecting and defending. But yeah the actual combat overall is pretty poor but I'm fully invested in the characters and story which make up for the lack of intense combat.Overall, Absolute duo - to me - feels like it's slice of life high school drama but with a twist and that twist is that it's an academy focuses on combt training etc which I guess is why I like it so much. There are a lot of over sexualised moments which aren't needed in the slightest. And the story does need more depth for its viewers to sink their teeth into but I find the anime overall incredibly enjoyable.To anyone wanting to watch this anime - don't expect much, have an open minded approach to it and I'm sure you'll gain some enjoyment out of it.P.s this is my very first review and I'm new to watching anime so my ideals may seem stupid etc but I'm hoping that over time I'll be able to become an adept reviewer. Any feedback - positive or negative - is welcome, just send me a message.

Thanks!"", ""Absolute Duo is like a raisin cookie, everyone thinks it's a chocolate chip cookie and it will be good, until you eat it and realize it's not what you expected, unless you actually like raisin cookies.Story: 5/10The story is somewhat unoriginal, mainly because it's those types of anime where you are embedded a certain type of weapon that you carry on for the rest of your life, having the ability to summon it anytime you want. The only twist is, you're in a duo. Now, every time you're in a duo it's likely that your partner is someone of the same sex, right? Well in...this anime the partner is a girl, and they both have to live in the same room. That calls for a shit-load of accidental boob-grabbing in the middle of the night. Not only is that there, but it's a harem. It's not needed for this kind of action anime, mainly because it's set on a duo, not a triplet or a quadruplet. For the action part of it, it's actually somewhat decent mainly because I enjoy those types of anime where the main character is a 'special/chosen/OP AS FUCK' type of character.Art: 9/10The art is very smooth and nice, just by looking at the cover photo. The colors are very bright and easily catch your eyes and the animation is smooth. The details in the eye are quite new to me, but hey new stuff means good stuff right?Sound: 7/10The OST is very modern and fits each scene nicely. My favorite in the sound section is the OP. I first heard it while playing a rhythm game (osu! kek) and instantly to me, it was catchy and stuck to my brain. The ED was the same with the OP, (I also heard it on osu! wtf) but not as good. It's based on apple tea, which is pretty weird for an ED.Character: 7/10Kokonoe Tooru, is a high-school boy who has a dark past. Tooru may look very weak, but as the anime progresses, he does get much more powerful. He's a very kind person who has the resolve to protect Julie and his other friends. He is an irregular.Julie Sigtuna (heh tuna), is a high-school girl who also has somewhat of a dark past. She is introduced as a very powerful character and as the anime progresses, she gets much more powerful. She's very attached to Tooru and possibly has feelings for him. She is a very quiet girl and likes apple tea.Together, they both make a duo.Bristol, Lillith is girl who graduated and came all the way to Japan to meet the irregular, who is Tooru. She was introduced as a small antagonist but as the anime progresses, she develops feelings to the point where she even mentions of being his future wife. She is a prideful girl who would not let anyone stand above her.Hotaka Miyabi is a high-school girl who is introduced a very shy character. She is introduced as weak and a not-very-athletic character, but as the anime progresses, she starts to also develop feelings for Tooru. A very kind girl who wants to be with Tooru.Tachibana Tomoe is a high-school girl who is introduced as a strong character and is skilled at martial arts. She is the type of character who has never thought of being in love.Miyabi and Tomoe are both a duo.Enjoyment: 8/10Although the story wasn't original, I still enjoyed it mainly because it was made in 2015 and I thought it was going to be something new.Overall: 6/10The anime to me was very rushed, because other things have not been explained, like the history of Exceeds, why this or why that. I doubt that there will be a season 2, because of the low ratings it got. It didn't live up to my expectations though. Would I re-watch this anime?

Maybe, because I might have missed a lot of stuff."", ""In the ocean of generic harems that we've been all been graced by the last few years, here we finally have a show that breaks free of all those bonds and- ...no sorry, Absolute Duo is just yet another one of them from start to finish. After the hilarious trainwreck that Studio 8bit presented with their adaptation of Grisaia no Kajitsu last season, you'd think that at least they couldn't make anything worse right afterwards but you may very well argue that they did. Admittedly I don't think anyone had very high expectations on Absolute Duo in comparison, but that still doesn't change the fact...that the show did absolutely nothing to try and defy those expectations.The story takes place in a typical magic high-school where the students learn to utilize what's referred to as their Blaze: a physical manifestation of their human soul which normally takes the form of a melee weapon. The school also has a so-called Duo partner system where all the students cooperate in pairs of two for the sake of combat training, which of course conveniently enough enables our protagonist Tooru to end up living with a beautiful silver-haired girl named Julie. It's a shocking plot twist for sure and a never-before-seen way to build up the setting for an action/fantasy/ecchi/harem light novel adaptation. Beyond that, there isn't really much to be said about the story other than it has some fanservice moments, some cliché ecchi jokes, some hack & slash fight scenes with generic villains and more along those lines throughout the anime. It really isn't any more interesting than that.Pretty much all the characters are incredibly generic and follow standard character tropes like cardboard cutouts. They're the types which you pretty much can judge immediately after you've gotten your first impression of them, and they're all shallow enough for you to be able to sum them up in a single sentence. The only one that actually stands out in any way is Julie as she's more of an emotionless dandere moecchi loli, compared to the more standard overly-busty fanservice girl which would normally get the main heroine role in a show of this nature. She reminds me a lot of Est from Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance, albeit definitely not quite on that level of cuteness.The animation is basically what you'd expect; it has a lot of vibrant colors and fancy character designs, but at the same time the limited budget shines through as there are plenty of moments where the overall quality drops, and a few of the episodes look very rushed as a result. On the other hand the voice acting is overall very good with several famous actors in the cast such as Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, Tamura Yukari and Horie Yui. The soundtrack makes good use of music to properly enhance the atmosphere of both the action-packed and the romantic scenes, and also both the OP and ED have some pretty great electronic tracks for them.Overall, Absolute Duo is not a terrible show but it's more of a case of a concept which has more or less been done to death by now, and more often than not it's been done better before. Fortunately these kinds of generic harems are rarely boring per se though so it's still pretty easy to watch, but as far as actual quality goes then it has virtually none to speak of. The only reason I would recommend anyone to watch this show is because of how cute Julie is, unless of course you happen to be someone who never gets sick of seeing the same cardboard cutout storyline over and over again. I don't regret watching it, but I can't say it really provided me much to praise it for either.If you've got nothing better to do, then Absolute Duo is a pretty simple way to spend an evening. However you will have to really run out of options before you're unable to find anything more worth your time than this. that the show did absolutely nothing to try and defy those expectations.The story takes place in a typical magic high-school where the students learn to utilize what's referred to as their Blaze: a physical manifestation of their human soul which normally takes the form of a melee weapon.

The soundtrack makes good use of music to properly enhance the atmosphere of both the action-packed and the romantic scenes, and also both the OP and ED have some pretty great electronic tracks for them.Overall, Absolute Duo is not a terrible show but it's more of a case of a concept which has more or less been done to death by now, and more often than not it's been done better before. Fortunately these kinds of generic harems are rarely boring per se though so it's still pretty easy to watch, but as far as actual quality goes then it has virtually none to speak of. The only reason I would recommend anyone to watch this show is because of how cute Julie is, unless of course you happen to be someone who never gets sick of seeing the same cardboard cutout storyline over and over again. I don't regret watching it, but I can't say it really provided me much to praise it for either.If you've got nothing better to do, then Absolute Duo is a pretty simple way to spend an evening. However you will have to really run out of options before you're unable to find anything more worth your time than this."", '""It was like a scene from a teen movie"" -K (except it was four and a half hours long)Preface:Absolute Duo is what we call least common denominator entertainment. It takes _trite_ and true tropes from a hundred other anime that are equally as generic and cliché, slaps a fresh coat of paint on (and some nasty 90s looking 3D CGI), some new names, and the semblance of a plot, all nicely wrapped up in used toilet paper for your viewing (dis)pleasure. Inspid to the max, somebody dug up some long forgotten, rotting corpse of a moe-harem-action plot from underneath the dumpster outside and said...“hey guys, wouldn’t it be funny if…” and Absolute Duo was born.Animation and Artwork: 3Don\'t let the OP fool you. The OP looks like it could be great for the 1:30 duration of the song, but the visuals in the meat of the show are average at absolute best. The most abhorrent thing is the 3D animated soldiers. If I could vomit fake, run over it with a dump truck, melt it down, eat it, and then crap it out again, it would look better than this hack fraud schlock.Sound and Voice Acting: 6Finally, something worth talking about. Absolute Duo does make good use of some talented VA.Tooru\'s voice, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, is instantly recognizable as the voices of Kirito (SAO) and Arata (Trinity Seven).Yukari Tamura (Kill La Kill, Higurashi) is FAN freaking TASTIC as always. She reprises her role as Nui Harime here and... *whispers*  ""wait wat?"" I\'m being told that she is actually not playing Nui Harime, and is instead Tsukimi, the teacher.

She\'s also the object of many a fantasy, being both in maid costume at all times with bunny ears and a tail, the aforementioned disproportionate breasts, and stupidly overpowered.The character of Lilith was woefully underutilized, in my opinion. Though she says some real groaners, she\'s a more interesting character than the other females for the sole fact that she knows a lot of things they don\'t and doesn\'t act like a giant idiot at all times. She also has a particularly useful power of having a gun when everyone else has melee weapons, but it’s never effectively used, because everyone has to monologue long enough for it to be forgotten about.

It's Harem and Ecchi genres, whenever it involves both kind of categories together, i wouldn't expect too much about the story and character development, but a good fun, enjoyment and laughter. Mainly, as you know, it's more of a fan service type of anime.I wouldn't recommend anyone who is looking for a fantastic story and a good character development for this anime. The story progression is quite how you would have guessed as the episodes progress, yet i think it is rather interesting of how the characters are able to use their unique ability.For anyone who enjoys a fairly good artwork with ecchi and...involves harem in it, i can say that you would enjoy it. involves harem in it, i can say that you would enjoy it."", 'TL;DR An utterly bland, by the numbers fantasy harem romance that feels like it only exists because there was a hole in a schedule that needed plugging. Don\'t bother.To my mind, there are three types of bad show. There\'s the ones that sincerely think they are good, but end up being terrible. There are those that would have been good if their initial ambition had only been matched by their ability to realise it. & then there are those that just don\'t care enough to make the effort. Absolute Duo, sadly, is the last of these.After a brief prologue that foreshadows a possible conflict...to come between the two main characters (that ends up looking nothing like it\'s depicted here *spoiler*), we begin by accompanying Tooru (or Tor or Thor or whatever the translator feels like using at a given point in time) on his first day at a new school for magic people. For reasons that don\'t matter & nobody seems to care, the school is made up primarily of random European landmarks such as Big Ben & the Colosseum, I guess because it looks cool. It is in said Colosseum that our main man suddenly finds himself in a battle royale to decide which entrants are actually worthy of attending the Kouryou Academy, announced by a loli goth who it turns out is the school principal.It is during this fight that we discover Tooru to be a special snowflake, because unlike everyone else his Exceed power takes the form of a shield instead of a weapon, marking him out as an Exception. Not that this apparent handicap matters, because he also has a special falcon punch attack that is never really explained but sure is good for hitting girls in the belly. Anyways to the surprise of nobody he passes the battle royale & so begins his & our journey through quite possibly the worst show of the Winter 2015 season.To sum up Absolute Duo\'s biggest flaws in a sentence, it is that the show is just going through the motions & really doesn\'t care if anything makes sense so long as it keeps the story moving in its desired direction. The most obvious example of this is the titular Duos themselves, specifically the one between Tooru & main loli Julie, a foreign exchange student from a made up place in Europe. It\'s established pretty quickly that forming a duo is a) a pretty unremarkable thing that every Exceed does & b) it is always between two members of the same sex. However, because no homo, when it comes to Tooru agreeing to form a Duo with token guy friend Aoi, suddenly it\'s a really big deal that they have to sign what amounts to a marriage certificate & our MC must do the right thing & form a Duo with Julie instead.Naturally nobody else sees what the fuss is about & indeed Tooru & Julie are noted as odd for being a boy-girl duo, which makes it seem all the odder that Tooru had such a problem forming one with Aoi. Of course the answer to why is that the Duo is really just a contrivance to create a ""romantic moment"" where Tooru asks Julie & also to put Tooru & Julie in a binding relationship together, because writing friendships/romances that form naturally is hard work for a Light Novelist. This adds to the already forced fun that is when, to the surprise of nobody watching, Tooru finds himself sharing a room with Julie & shock horror she doesn\'t know how to look after herself. If you\'ve seen Pet Girl of Sakurasou, you could sum up their relationship as Sorata & Mashiro with magic swords & I think you\'d just about get the gist of it.Beyond this trio (Aoi nonchalantly forms a Duo with another guy but he plays no role beyond kinda making their Duo look like a Uke - Seme pairing), we also have Tomoe & Miyabi, who form the girl Duo in our group. Because :anime: there are some yuri undertones to their bond, with stronger & more outwardly confident Tomoe forming a protective attachment to the more insecure & shy Miyabi. Of course, again because no homo, those undertones are really just there so the second end credit sequence can have them both naked in it, & in fact Miyabi soon forms feelings for Tooru because everyone else is doing it so why not her too? Don\'t be shocked if her feelings & desire to prove herself worthy of Tooru\'s non-existent affection end up causing trouble.Our group, which you can call a harem although it\'s one of those where it\'s clear from the beginning that the MC only has eyes for one girl, is rounded off with the arrival of transfer student Lilith Bristol, another Exception who quickly decides she\'s going to form a duo (& marry) Tooru, but of course his manly man principles see him stick it out with Julie. Much hijinks, many boob grabs & hilarious misunderstandings ensue. It\'s really fresh & original stuff.The story of Absolute Duo is one that\'s best not given too much thought, because it will only hurt your brain. Our first antagonist, for example, is revealed to be none other than the groups class teacher, bunny-sensei (she has a name, but you won\'t remember it. You\'ll remember her bunny maid outfit, though) who for reasons unknown decides to try & kill those Exceeds who are doing well during a class exam/battle royale. Of course, our heroes ultimately defeat her through the power of friendship, only for her to go right back to being their teacher because the loli-goth principal thinks she\'s good at her job. That\'s it. There\'s no real indication that she\'s working with the Rebels, who become the schools main antagonists after this point, nor is it suggested as it so easily could have been that she was doing it on the principals orders as part of her at all costs plan to find the titular ""Absolute Duo"" (which isn\'t really explained but one can assume means the most powerful Duo in Duodom). It just kinda happens.Said Rebels themselves don\'t make all that much sense as antagonists. Their leader, Equipment Smith (only in anime would he be called that), seems to want to make an army of super soldiers to counter the academy\'s Exceeds or something but it\'s not quite clear why or, if that\'s the case, why him, loli-goth & others form a round table of leaders that meet to discuss...I don\'t know what in a later episode. But they fill the roll of bad guys, & Rebel member K the role of Tooru\'s nemesis specifically (something about Tooru & Julie\'s bond really rubs him up the wrong way, for :anime: reasons), so just go with it. Things happen, decisions are made, allegiances shift, & all simply because the plot requires it at that point in time regardless of whether it makes sense.Tooru & Julie\'s relationship, like everything else, is also one of those that feels like it\'s just going through the motions. It starts out with Julie apparently being incapable of looking after herself, so naturally Tooru must, as it were, domesticate her. Then we progress to her feeling unconfident & insecure about her fighting abilities, which naturally Tooru is there to give her the reassurances & head rubs every girl needs to feel good about themselves. Then things take a turn which I wish anime didn\'t do so often (as if it wasn\'t patronizing & weird enough), wherein it becomes apparent that Julie is actually capable of being an incredibly powerful fighter (as the prologue foreshadows) but that power is dangerous & it is Tooru\'s manly duty to both tame it when in danger of going out of control & ultimately for him to get powerful enough that she never need fight herself. Because if there\'s one place safer for a girl than behind a sword, it\'s behind the back of the man wielding her sword for her.It may come as no surprise that despite obviously being the couple, Absolute Duo pulls the usual anime schtick of never actually having Tooru & Julie express romantic feelings towards each other, instead having them develop a more familial, platonic relationship that\'s all about trust & protection (& not sex!) despite this being a romance series & theirs clearly being the romance. I don\'t know why anime does this, but it does get pretty boring hearing the MC shout ""JULIE!"" in that constipated action anime voice during climactic scenes & then the closest thing we get to a romantic moment is a head pat or words of encouragement (I don\'t count Julie doing something that in a normal relationship would be romantic but because this is anime makes Tooru freak out like she just whipped out a penis). Of course, this is pretty standard for anime, so I guess you just have to go with it.It doesn\'t help Absolute Duo\'s case that beyond the at best generic characters & story, there\'s plenty about the shows production to criticize. There is quite heavy use of CGI in fight scenes, & it looks as bad as you\'d expect. It\'s not like the fight scenes are particularly high octane or exciting to begin with, compounded by how the CGI has that weird effect of making everything look slower, which kinds takes the thrill out of some moments. The character designs, as I have alluded to already, seem in a few cases to be more about pillow cover/figurine sales than anything like reflecting the characters personalities. The characters eyes also have a really odd look to them, as rather than having black pupils they\'re the same colour as the iris, only with a black rim denoting where one ends & the other starts. It\'s a minor thing, but I found it really odd, as though they had coloured stones inlaid into the eye socket rather than actual eyes.Beyond that the art & animation is pretty standard. There is also, as you\'d expect, a whole lot of ""titillating"" fanservice, which tends to be like buses in that none comes for a while & then OMG they\'re all naked in a hot spring together. The OST is pretty bad, the fight music in particular suffering from both being underwhelming & clearly looped. I guess the OP is pretty good, with one of those thumping trance-rock hybrid songs over a pretty action heavy animation sequence. It\'s a shame that they seem to have shot it entirely on two\'s, resulting in the OP looking like it\'s constantly buffering. In short it seems the show was given enough of a budget to get the job done & nothing more; much like everything else about the series, really.So then, here we are at the end of a journey we\'d all have been better off not taking. It has to be said that as bad as Absolute Duo is, it\'s not offensively so. Indeed it\'s biggest sin is that it just doesn\'t seem to even try to be good, or at least interesting. The whole thing feels like everyone involved, from the author to the publisher to the animation studio, is just doing this project because it\'s there to be done. If Absolute Duo had been one of those shows that felt sincerely like it\'s trying to be good, or that it was a case of having more ambition than the capacity to realise it, I wouldn\'t have minded as much. But the whole thing reeks of being a by the numbers, who cares if it\'s good so long as it shifts some books & merchandise affair.

But the whole thing reeks of being a by the numbers, who cares if it\'s good so long as it shifts some books & merchandise affair. Don\'t waste your time with it.', 'Anime cliches have been around for a good many years now.  The characters troupes that we become accustomed to, certain kinds of scenes, as well as genres have all become rather well known in the anime community.  It is with this that finding anything really out of the ordinary becomes a somewhat hard task.  And then we have Absolute Duo, a show that touches on both sides of the argument.Story (6.44/10): In the world of Absolute Duo, there is a kind of people known as Exceeds, people who are able to harness the power of their soul to form weapons...known as blazes, ranging from all forms of pre-gun weapons from swords, to daggers, bows, lances, and even a snakeblade.  It is here where we follow the story of Kokonoe Tor, a boy who goes to attend Koryo Academy, a place where they train Exceeds so that one day, they can reach the highest level of power, Absolute Duo.From a story standpoint, Absolute Duo does show promising development.  A lot of anime that involve a lot of sci-fi/fantasy elements do have that little spark that make them different from the others, thus expressing the uniqueness of a show that I feel is necessary to earn any viewers.  With the idea of the Duo System (which is basically a battle partnership) that this series has, as well as the idea of weapons made from the soul, I felt like Absolute Duo did have quite a bit to promise in terms of story idea, and it did, to a certain degree.What I felt was lacking a lot about the show is more or less the amount of detail that was being expressed at a given time.  Throughout the show, the story hints at these past events that our main two protagonists have that drive them to becoming a soul weapon wielding badasses.  Rather than fleshing that out, the show puts that in the backseat of the show and progresses along with a plot that really at times, wasn\'t all that exciting.  A major gripe I have about the show in regards to the backstory, is just how forced it feels, thus creating the ""vengeance"" cliche, as I call it.  Basically, this means that the ONLY reason our characters really bother in becoming an Exceed in the first place, is to hunt down and seek vengeance on the person who slaughtered someone near and dear to them without ANY indication over who that person is or what their purpose was.  To me, it hurts the story more than anything because an idea like this is guaranteed to never be touched on again, and that really is a shame since a lot of anime share this cliche, and none of them follow through.Another fault I find is the fact that the show really doesn\'t try to be different.  While the story idea may be interesting enough, the actual scenes, aren\'t.  What this means is that the show falls back on cliches whenever it\'s trying to tell a story.  In any given bit of plot progression the show relies on a reused scene idea used hundreds of times in order to explain what is going on.  Having a conversation during a battle is fine, but saying that your only reason to fight is to get more powerful and power is the only thing that matters is dumb.  Having a girl make a full 180 on her character after the MC beats her?  Seen it, used it, copyrighted it.  The impact from this mostly equates to making the series just lackluster in presentation.Overall though, Absolute Duo\'s story was more disappointing than anything.  While I didn\'t expect very much from the people who made Infinite Stratos, I felt like Absolute Duo could\'ve turned into something just a little bit more.  The series simply just solves the problems that the series created during the spur of the moment, and not any of the underlying problems like the revenge that Tor is so sought after.Overview:+  Interesting story idea-   Lackluster presentation-   Original problems not solved-   Very cliched storytellingCharacters (6.42/10): Characters, similar to story, follow a similar path to the story, riddled with cliche anime troupes everywhere, and that one interesting character that sorta turns your head.Up first, Kokonoe Tor.  Or, as everyone else likes to say: Kokonoe-kun, Tor, KOKONOE TOR!, Danna-sama, Toru, etc.  As expected by someone who is played by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Tor is the harem lead character of the series, being nice to everyone, spouting the ""I will protect everyone"" speech, and overall being the affection of several girls\' desires.  However, unlike the other characters of the series, Tor\'s Blaze is a shield.  (Unlike a certain swordsman played by the same seiyuu.)  Aside from that one difference, Tor doesn\'t really play off as any real unique character.  Because he plays the chivalry card, there really isn\'t much you can say about him other than the fact that he wants to protect people, resulting in the fact that he barely changes in the series.  But at the very least, you won\'t forget his name!  Cause it\'s not like they mention his name every 3 minutes or anything like that, maybe consecutive times for the antagonist.And then we have Sigtuna Julie, our main female protagonist.  As the main female protagonist of the series, Julie is the Duo of Tor, aka his battle partner and roommate.  (Try and imagine all the non-H things they did.  Whatever you\'re thinking, the show probably did it.)  Similar to Tor, Julie bears the vengeance ideal, seeking revenge on the person that killed her father using two swords that allow her to spin and slice through whatever the hell she wants.  While Julie herself isn\'t a bad character, she does come off a little weak in any actual development, similar to Tor.  There really isn\'t enough emphasis on either one of them, rather putting them both together to make them like a whole with each of them as a half for the other.  Because of this, she, like her Duo, doesn\'t stand up by themselves as a proper character, and the way I see it, isn\'t smart to have characters that rely on each other on personality.And then we have the other characters for the series, such as the rest of the harem girls, Miyabi, Tomoe, and my personal favorite, Lilith Bristol, who wields a freaking rifle.  In addition, we also Tora, Tatsu, Imari, and a couple other characters making up the side cast.  Aside from Lilith, the rest of the student characters that bear any importance suffer a similar problem to the mascot characters of the show, which is not being able to stand up on their own.  A lot of the time, you see the characters fall back on their partner for support and conversation, which for a series that has this for its main plot point, does make a lot of sense.  However, the way it\'s done makes it so that no one character can really make him/herself stand on their own two feet.  They are restricted to getting their minimal amount of character growth from other characters and individually, they feel hollow and incomplete.  (Also, I kinda hate the bunny teacher.  I know that there\'s a fandom devoted to her, but I honestly can\'t take characters like her, what with that stupid bing-bong crap and the dual personality.)Overall, the characters of Absolute Duo weren\'t really shining examples of what could\'ve been.  I didn\'t expect much actual character development from a show such as this, but I wanted something more than just troupes and character reliance.  No one really stood out as unique, (except Usa-sensei, sadly.)  and the series did fall in that regard.  Antagonists in Absolute Duo are also lackluster as well, so don\'t expect anything deep or meaningful with their evil plots.  (Like seriously, who the hell obsesses THAT much over a guy whose only real weapon is a goddamn shield?)Overview:+/-  Anime character troupes.  (Helps ease the characters into the character\'s heads, not so much in terms of significant development.)-     Character reliance for personality-     Stereotypical and overused villain troupeArt and Sound (7.21/10): Absolute Duo was produced by 8-bit, the same studio that made La Fruit de Grisaia, Avengelion Ewol, and the show featuring out favorite harem MC, Infinite Stratos.  (Fucking Ichika.)  Likewise, Absolute Duo is done in a similar quality to those shows.  The art for the series does look rather aesthetically pleasing with some pretty nice designs for the Blazes.  The art for the series is standard for the current age of anime, so there\'s really not much to say beyond that.There are however, some...bugs in the artwork.  At times, the art quality both dips and raises up a little bit, making the show waver in appearances from one scene to the next.  In addition to the lack of artistic regularity, 8-bit also pulled up its IS schematics and used a bit of the wonderful... wonderful CGI.  More than anything, it just looks awkward, and glaringly so.On the music side of things, Absolute Duo hosts a somewhat decent soundtrack.  The most memorable of the bunch being its opening, Absolute Soul, which is a song that I have grown to love.  The opening has a very unique sound and rhythm to it that makes it feel actually quite memorable.  Aside from the kickass opening that you could probably listen to for hours on end, the rest of the soundtrack is kind of lacking as nothing else really stands out.Overview:+  Decent art+  Kickass opening-   Art wavers in quality a lot-   rest of the soundtrack isn\'t as memorablePersonal Enjoyment (7.00/10): While I may have been hacking and slashing away at this show for all its worth throughout this entire review, I can\'t honestly say that this show isn\'t completely bad.  While unwanted and tired cliches are prominent and plentiful throughout this series, the show itself isn\'t completely unwatchable. Of course, the show does literally shoot its characters down with guns of all sorts, but that\'s not what we\'re worried about at the moment.Did I like this show?From an entertainment standpoint, the show gets good marks.  Absolute Duo isn\'t as far as I can see a show that should be taken with the thought of being wowed.  I went into this show thinking that there were going to be some disappointing elements, and I turned out to be right.  That being said, the idea of the soul weapons ""Blazes"" and some of the fights do actually make up slightly for the mountain full of troupes and cliches that make up a lot of the show\'s screentime.What didn\'t I like about this show?What I didn\'t like was simply just how cliched it was.  (Yes, yes.  I am aware that me writing cliched a bunch is turning into a cliche.)  A lot of the show could\'ve been handled in a way that would\'ve made for a more interesting storyline and/or view.  The show goes from one of its more higher points into one that comes from a troupe you\'ve probably seen several times before, and it\'s this where I find the majority of the problems for the series, aside from, you know, giving us a read the manga ending cause neither one of the main characters have completed their self-appointed task.Would I recommend it?Absolute Duo in my opinion serves more like a bit of fluff entertainment more than anything.  The show wasn\'t executed in a way that I felt was worth more than just a show you could watch in your downtime, as reused story points plague its entire 12 episode run with old, tired harem troupes.  (In addition, 5 of the girls in this series basically have balloons sticking out of their chest.  I\'ll leave the rest to you.)  Absolute Duo could\'ve potentially become more than it already was, it had a good bit of groundwork it could\'ve used.  Sadly though, it relied too much on established anime harem scenes, troupes, and characters that I think hurt the show in the long run.  If you want a harem sci-fi show, Absolute Duo does fit the bill.Overall Score: 6.45/10 known as blazes, ranging from all forms of pre-gun weapons from swords, to daggers, bows, lances, and even a snakeblade.  It is here where we follow the story of Kokonoe Tor, a boy who goes to attend Koryo Academy, a place where they train Exceeds so that one day, they can reach the highest level of power, Absolute Duo.From a story standpoint, Absolute Duo does show promising development.  A lot of anime that involve a lot of sci-fi/fantasy elements do have that little spark that make them different from the others, thus expressing the uniqueness of a show that I feel is necessary to earn any viewers.  With the idea of the Duo System (which is basically a battle partnership) that this series has, as well as the idea of weapons made from the soul, I felt like Absolute Duo did have quite a bit to promise in terms of story idea, and it did, to a certain degree.What I felt was lacking a lot about the show is more or less the amount of detail that was being expressed at a given time.

There is nothing innovative nor compelling regarding narrative or story structure, and nearly every element of the story, such as the magic academy setting and similarly magic-based power system, has been done before in other anime to a far more effective extent. Speaking in more depth about the cliche concepts which create the power system, the ones introduced within the anime, such as blazes and levels, are half-baked at best. There is little explanation...for how such systems work other than brief and unsatisfactory descriptions, which give the audience little understanding of the mechanisms behind such abilities. This is especially pertinent to the concept of levels, as they are arbitrarily mentioned yet never expanded upon in any capacity. Characters receive random power-ups in the middle of fights with little to no explanation as to why or how these occur; clearly, they exist only to allow the protagonist and his friends a cheap and unfulfilling victory. The original creator undeniably put exceedingly minimal effort into the power system he created. If I were to ask him to explain in depth, I doubt he could elaborate beyond what is portrayed within the anime. The story has little substance, depth, or even an overarching message other than a tacky and cliche revenge plot based upon the protagonist’s poorly written trauma, which does not affect how he acts or behaves despite how much this apparently plagues him mentally. Furthermore, the story is riddled with moments of fan service and idiotic misunderstandings, which are insultingly braindead even compared to most other anime within the ecchi or harem genre.In terms of characters, they are beyond bland and unmemorable. The main lead, Tor Kokonoe, has no notable traits in terms of personality or appearance and is the personification of cardboard as a human being. We get little perspective into his thoughts or feelings other than a few throwaway lines, and his aforementioned trauma surrounding his failure to protect loved ones is executed in a pitifully shallow manner. The same can be said about the personality and depth of every single female character in the series as well, as most only exist to provide fan service for the audience or to fawn over Tor to an illogical extent. Their reasons for being attracted to him are nonsensical and unrealistic and feel as if an AI was given a prompt about human interaction while being locked in a dark room, never meeting an actual person. Despite being apparently strong and in a league of their own compared to most students at Kouryou Academy, all the female characters, especially Lilith, are given instant nerfs the moment they fall in love with Tor, simply so the viewer can self-insert and see themselves as a valiant knight in shining armor who protects the women who love them. The villains of the anime, dubbed ""rebels,"" are pathetically written, and their inclusion attempts to construct a narrative surrounding the beauty of the soul versus the corruption of technology; however, these ideas are executed in such a banal and meaningless manner that they hold nearly no relevance. Another central conflict of the series surrounds one of the girls seeking validation from the main protagonist, who rejects her. The following actions that this rejected individual takes in response are contradictory and illogical to the core, painting her as an unlikeable incel rather than a character who evokes sympathy.The animation is poor, and the color palette of the anime is dull, just like every other aspect of Absolute Duo; often appearing as if it were made by an amateur and rushed intern rather than professionals in their field. The fight scenes are boring and could lull even an insomniac into a blissful sleep, with little to no engaging aspects such as an inkling of strategy or even the slightest bit of sakuga. The opening theme, ending themes, and OST are about as generic as every other aspect of the anime but not as offensively boring or dumb as every other element of Absolute Duo is.In conclusion, Absolute Duo should be renamed Absolute Dogshit instead because I genuinely can’t think of a single redeeming quality or example of this anime containing elements that exceed mediocrity at best or egregiously poor execution at worst. As a result, I wouldn’t recommend this anime even to the most seasoned fans of light novel adaptations or the magical school genre as a whole. for how such systems work other than brief and unsatisfactory descriptions, which give the audience little understanding of the mechanisms behind such abilities.

It enters the competition of generic battle harems of spring 2015 - and clearly doesnt make the cut. The absolute unoriginality of the characters, the linear and terribly explained story and terrible pacing and conversations make watching all the twelve episodes a clear waste of time.Story: 3/10High school setting; Powerful MC who cant love with mysterious past; all types of girls that fall in love with him for dumb reasons; a linear antagonist who breaks from his shell and gets defeated by MC with nakama power. Uhm, where have I seen this before? Well, everywhere....While the first few episodes definitely arent that bad and actually manage to make the usual harem tropes enjoyable, at latest after the 7th episode it gets just terrible. Even if the story and background sucked, we wouldn't know - there's barely even anything explained. I dont even know what the Absolute Duo is in the end...Art: 8/10Credit due where its due - the art style is good. While not as good as shows like Hyouka, it lives up to today's standards. Especially the animations of the rebel group and the AMAZING dance scene in the opening are worth being called good. Nothing special though.Sound: 8/10Same story as the art. Voices are well chosen - especially Tsukimi-sensei - and the background music is decent. I loved both OP and ED.Character: 3/10Normally I dont dislike the typical dere-characters, but this is going overboard. I havent hated, no, DESPISED a single character ever - until I met Miyabi. Listening to hear and seeing what she does made me cringe every single time and regret watching it. Julie had great potential but got smashed with her demon side. MC is decent, I've seen far worse.Enjoyment: 5/10I'm sure you'd expect a way lower rating here. Well, the first episodes definitely werent bad at all, noone could've predicted the following shitshow in the last episodes. Pointless conversations and repetitive subjects clearly destroy the positive aspects that were built up in the earlier part of the series.Overall: 5/10While not being completely terrible, if you pay a closer look and actually expected anything from the story, then this will be a waste of time. This show made everything wrong that could've been done wrong while writing the script and planning the plot. Dont watch this.I hope that this doesnt get a second season and if it does, I hope it manages to develop a deeper plot and turn away from the extremely boring and even annoying characters.

Every ""Absolute""-Pun from here on is unintended.Imagine ANY generic harem Anime with super power.Done?Good. That\'s ALL you need to know about Absolute Duo. You just imagined EVERYTHING there is to it.

Whether or not this is true is subjective based on personal values. In the case of Absolute Duo, the idea is untrue, and painful to uphold.As an anime, Absolute Duo moved through each episode like a dough ball rolling down an gravelly hill, gradually deteriorating in something that seemed a bit like fanservice wrapped up in cheap Soul Eater cosplay. From title credits and summaries alone, all's fine, but once the thin facade is peeled back, Absolute Duo is an action anime turned...disaster.One can recognize the remnants of the story's original planning, and, as a warning, there are many, many remnants. The problem is that there are too many--ideas flood in unevenly, bits of back-story, battle and boobs all mixed together for a bitter anime trope martini.From the first episode, everything is gathered together to follow Kokonoe Tor's journey utilizing his Blaze, a weapon drawn from the manifestation of his soul. However, his Blaze is not a weapon, but a shield. However-however, despite this hinting that he'd rather be the type to defend and protect, the idea is betrayed by the fact that he is an excellent combatant and can fight with the shield anyway. This may have been an attempt to rescue the action part of the story, which already was being slowly trampled by the sticky, gooey topping of school life harem, and even the harem portion of the anime is dissatisfying.As always, there is the quiet one, the tomboy, the rich girl, but there is a distinct failure to handle any of them well. With all harems, there will always be a certain air of indecisiveness, but unfortunately the problem here is that Tor seems too decisive before derailing from that decision and heading down a different track. Rather than properly balancing screen time between each heroine, one is dealt with for quite some time before another comes out of nowhere, is accepted by Tor and then forgotten about for the first one. There is nothing endearing about the main character pledging his love and protection to everyone like a shameless people-pleaser.Additionally, and as previously mentioned, the harem is not the only piece mishandled--the action side of the anime is often put on hold for fillers that are too obviously fillers, and these fillers end with a random plot point that had little too no previous foreshadowing. The main opposing force is even late to the party in that it doesn't make itself very known until plenty of awkward and useless school day scenarios have been expended. These scenarios also rear their ugly heads once again at inappropriate times, throwing in boob jiggles and pantie shots in the very midst of the emotional thick of a scene. It grows tiring, even to describe.For an anime so determined to be compelling and sexy, the art was lazy. In trying to make the girls look cute and attractive, their faces had little expression and no matter the timing, no matter the cup size, no matter the outfit, the girls' chests were shaped like oranges in push up bras.Even in the final, crucial moments, the main characters were poorly drawn and moved stiffly alongside badly placed 3-D. Like many of the behaviors of the characters themselves, one too many varying head sizes in one scene grew ridiculous, especially given how clean cut the opening could get.And in saying the behavior of the characters was ridiculous, I am saying an incredible truth.For heroines introduced as strong and unique fighters, they all had a way of crumbling and abandoning their character traits for the sake of catering to the useless showing off the main character exhibited. One moment, Julie could fight to the fullest, take down ten foes at once, and the next, Tor is vowing to protect her as she sits on the ground, confused. Everyone seemed to blend together to try and make Tor spectacular, when he was a protagonist who could not be saved. His tragic flashbacks received little to no explanation, and so I found I could care less about him. The fact that he was pushed to me as a sensitive and likable guy offended me.But then again, much of the anime offended me. Everything was handled so haphazardly I couldn't enjoy myself in any other way than making complete fun of it all. 'Oh man they're all about to have a serious showdown, I wonder which girl is going to fall on her face with her ass in the air--I love that battle tactic.' I was offended at the thought that so little care went into managing the basic elements of the story. Should any of you out there chance Absolute Duo yourselves, I expect you shall share in my offense. disaster.One can recognize the remnants of the story's original planning, and, as a warning, there are many, many remnants.

I'm sure you all who are searching for the perfect anime will find this one just outrageous and awesome. I really love how the story was set out and how at the end they found out perfectly. I recommend you watch this, but if you don't want to that's fine too. Watch this from the very beginning don't skip episodes, you'll not understand the story line then. This was an outstanding anime, and my first review yet was put on this one. :) Thanks for reading lol. "", ""This is my opinion and some people might not agree.I have to say, first of all, that I expected more from this anime. I think the show has a lot of potential, but it just didn't make it.The story was nice, but the thing is, it's not really that interesting. The concept is original and the art is beautiful, but there is more to a great anime that just this. I liked a lot the plot, until it started to become more of a harem and ecchi show, than an adventure one. Some people maybe liked it, but I wanted some action, not a bunch...of girls over one boy who has a special power( if this isn't a cliché, I don't know what is) I think those two factors are what dragged down this anime.And another thing, is the lack of romance between the main protagonist and his duo. Because the anime makes a big deal about how important is for a duo to be together, but these two didn't share a kiss in the end, and there should't be a harem involved.But overall, the anime is not THAT bad, but it could have been better. of girls over one boy who has a special power( if this isn't a cliché, I don't know what is) I think those two factors are what dragged down this anime.And another thing, is the lack of romance between the main protagonist and his duo.

Blazes can only hurt the soul..... At this point you already wonder how bad the show is going to be with such childish characteristics.Story:The plot is average. It isn't very well developped and it doesn't feel smooth at all, rather it sometimes feels a bit far-fetched. We have a bunch of kids getting involved into dangerous scenarios with adults which are close to non-existant. Moreover, you get a sort of dramatic feel on the first episode since everyone has to sacrifice something but that gets shattered to pieces later on because why...not make it worse? Of course, just as expected there is still a plot line left undevelopped even though you'd have a good idea concerning it at the end.I haven't got much to say to defend the plot except from the fact that blazes can actually hurt people which is a very little consolation.4/10Art:This is where this anime lacks the most. The characters are beatifully drawn but the action scenes feel like role battles where each character attacks one at a time. There are a billion errors in every fight and all of them are easily noticeable. If you pay attention you can even see some oddness in the drawings during the fights and the pictures feel off every so often. Overall, I think it doesn't really deserve its Action tag.2/10Sound:The background music is well-made. It serves to add some tension when everything else fails at doing so. The ED is above average, and the OP is good.7/10Character:This is where this show should have some worth. The character are well-made altough a tad generic and sometimes gullible and weak. The strength of this anime lies within the interactions in between the charactes. Dialogues that feel akward or out of place don't show themselves much unlike in most anime.Then a character was introduced and we inherited the classical interactions that you would except for a very low tier anime. This anime's qualities weren't numerous but it still managed to destroy most of them.Lastly, let's talk about the boobsy HAREM. As we all know, 90% of boobsy harems are completly crappy animes. Absolute Duo does a good job at hiding the harem aspect of it but it jumps in your face when the previously mentioned character appears.3/10Enjoyment:This show is hard to watch. I think it could have been a good show if there was less drama. It feels out of place. Though the drama isn't the only thing that needs to be fixed I think it'd be a good start.3/10Overall: 3/10This show isn't half bad but still lacks a lot in term of action and plot. I think most people would be able to watch it but it won't ever be considered good. Maybe if it was focused on them growing and ranking up in the academy with more character developpement it would have been much better. Also, if you are looking for an Action anime Absolute Duo doesn't fit the bill.Overall, you should probably avoid this show and try to find another one that is not this bad.

It’s been a long time since I’ve watched an anime series and gone an entire 12 episodes without being able to pinpoint at least one positive aspect. Not only does the plot suffer from being predictable and translucent, but the amount of money grabbing fanservice littering every ounce of substance is beyond upsetting. The premise on its own is promising, but the series ends up drowning in its own inadequacies left and right, leading to a dissapointment for the ages.Unassuming teenage protagonist? -CheckRandom beach episode? -CheckBarely post-pubescent characters with jiggly titties? -CheckUnnecessary lolli panty shots? -CheckA horribly cast English dub?...-CheckAn incoherent plot with as much depth as a kiddie pool? -CheckIf Absolute Duo succeeds in one aspect, it would be to be as underwhelming as humanly possible. Nothing is fleshed out, the storyline never seems to go anywhere and the characters are essentially just cutouts without any amount of development beyond their breasts and oddly deepened voices.

The action scenes often opened up with a still image of the characters with their weapons, multiplying the corny factor, while the animation was inconsistent at best.

The enemies were one-offs without purpose, and were almost completely useless in the scheme of things.

This story starts off with the main character, Tor. Hes the average main character in a harem. He is very similar to most harems that involve some sort of ability or super power out there. He meets girls, tries to protect them, then fails. Then throughout the anime(like most other stories) he magically(duh, this anime involves magic) gets stronger in less than a week, very awkward tbh. This first few episode got off to a goodish~ start(but in all honesty, I wanted Imari to...be his duo throughout the story, as she seems more lively and overall a fun character to watch, whenever shes in any part of the anime). But ends up throwing in this ""mysterious girl"", who apparently suppose to be the ""main"" female protagonist. After watching the whole anime, I\'ve come to realize that, she has the worst character development(as of Tor as well) I\'ve ever seen for a long time now(been watching anime for 8-9 years now) and this disappoints me on who bad it is.

Even if the technical part is fine (not amazing but also not bad) the overused plot, the extremely plain characters and the abuse of overacted emotions make this anime deserve a 4/10.Story (2/10)As I said, the story is just painful to see. The typical high school of superpowers and the typical bad guy. The plot is extremely predictable, not surprises at all. Furthermore they tried to add some complexity, making it worse, because things aren't explained at all. Besides, the...story is bad paced, with a lot of bad fanservice (I am not against fanservice, but in this case It was so bad that I wanted to die), and in some cases I had to go back to the previous chapter to see if I had skipped something. But no, I hadn't skipped anything, It's just that the narration is that bad.Art & Sount (7/10)Very little to say here. Both of them are good, not impressive, but not bad. In general the art is colourful, but the CG animations aren't very good.Characters (2/10)The very same as with the story. All of them are beyond plain. You can expect what somebody is going to say or do. Furthermore all of them overact (if you can overact in an animation) a lot, and made me feel embarrassed of watching this anime.Enjoyment (4/10)I had to push myself to end this anime and not to drop it.

There\'s a cool factor in how the characters throw around their unique talents.

From the synopsis and the opening, you're expecting something awesome then when you watch it after the first episode, you're like: The fuck is this shit?First off, if you don't know by now, Absolute Duo revolves around Kokonoe Tor who is seeking revenge for those he lost to some stranger--who is never named.  He awakens his power as an Exceed (hmm Fairy Tail rip much?) which allows him to manifest his soul into a weapon which turns out to be a shield.  How the hell does...that happen?  As a result, he goes to an academy that specializes in training these individuals to hone their skills and reach something known as Absolute Duo (which has not been explained AT ALL).The first episode lets you know it is going to be a what the fuck moment because right off the bat, the first character Tor meets and forms a bond with almost immediately is forcibly taken out by some bullshit ass opening entrance fight.  Like, why would you introduce a potential friend for the MC then take her out as soon as possible? Anyways, let's get into the details as to why this show is crap.Story - 3The concept sounds cool but the fact that your main character has a mission or a goal, you don't get an explanation as to why he has that goal, nor do you get a look into his past or find out why he even has the power he possesses along with elements of explanation of the events that is going on pretty much make it seem like this series was compiled from loose fitting ideas that the author had.Art - 5Take the art from Date A Live and breed it with Clannad and you almost got the sister of Unlimited Fafnir.Sound - 8The only redeeming quality of this whole series is the soundtrack.  I personally didn't care for the ending themes but the opening and the BG music was pretty good and helped ease my suffering.Character - 2Flat characters are love!Tor - Guy who wants vengeance but also wants to protect someone.Julie - Emotionless loli who also wants revenge but you don't find out shit about her until the tale endMiyabi - Big titted dumbass who goes yandere then back to dumbassLilith - Busty dumb fan serviceAnd everyone else is just as flat with hardly any development.Oh and by the way, for it to be a harem, it sucks.  The fan service is clumsy and half of it isn't even remotely interesting.  The ecchi is pretty lame too.  Like the only scene worth while is the one in the hot springs...enjoy.Overall, Absolute Duo is quite possibly the worst anime I have seen in a long time.

Did you guess 'No'?Story/ Setting: 5To start of first I will begin by talking about the setting which can only be described as a school where students are trained to fight using supernatural powers (Blazes), which you know has been done many times before so don't expect anything different from the usual, with that in respect let's move on the story. The story can also be dumbed down to a standard ecchi harem that has a supernatural twist where the main character wins battles using the power of friendship and similar things...while being oblivious to the girls growing feelings around him; the standard stuff, as it follows main character Tooru and main heroine Julie on there quest to become powerful and take revenge upon those that hurt there families which is also left in the dark quite a lot and the reason for that person hurting them is never explained or brought to light in any shape or form. While also on the same note as predictability along the way they'll meet many friends both guys and girls; with the guys barely appearing or having sceentime and the girls becoming part of an ever growing harem, eventually leading to a predictable ending that just screams out: 'Read the Light Novel'. Overall its average and a really predictable harem story and nothing else.Characters: 6The characters well also follow a predictable route with a lot of archetypes found amongst them which does leave quite a varied cast which is a good thing as the designs of the characters are simply wonderful however, there are far too many identifiable anime archetypes that make the show feel less unique and more like 'just another hare', featuring character like the 'the never losing protagonist', the quiet girl with no emotions, the shy girl with he boobs, the tomboy and so on. This overall makes the show predictable and care less for the characters.Animation: 7The animation can be described only in a few words as mediocre, as it wasn't bad but neither anything special, however fight scenes are well animated except for the bits that go into 3D animation which can be somewhat distracting.Sound: 9On the other hand, the soundtrack was great and was mixed in well with all scenes, in which the best I must say is the music for fight scenes mixed in with the good animation featuring a mix of tracks; this made them feel exciting and more fun to watch. The opening was pretty good but not amazing featuring some great rock sung by Konomi Suzuki; which also gets you pumped up and ready for the show.Overall if your looking for a fun harem show with some exciting ecchi show purely for some light entertainment and fun comedy, this is the show for you; however expect anything else you'll be disappointed. while being oblivious to the girls growing feelings around him; the standard stuff, as it follows main character Tooru and main heroine Julie on there quest to become powerful and take revenge upon those that hurt there families which is also left in the dark quite a lot and the reason for that person hurting them is never explained or brought to light in any shape or form.

Do not take a review seriously. Anime watching is a unique experience for everyone and tastes take time to develop.Since Absolute Duo is a fairly new anime, reviews that have been made are generally aimed at the episodes that were released at the time. So readers beware! Likewise, newer reviews are now based off the anime as a whole so keep an eye on that date!At first glance, Absolute Duo seems too easy to clump with the basic and cliched harem...animes. While it does have a ton of harem elements, it doesn\'t really get to the point where it can be officially defined as a ""Harem"". As a result, many people see the genre ""Harem"" and feel as though diving into it would be a big mistake. Well, it\'s not.  The characters never develop an actual lovey-dovey relationship with the MC, and the season is mainly focused on the back story of each character as an individual.While many points in each episode may make a large group of people cringe, the actual story line and development of the characters is enjoyable. Like I said before, the anime focuses mainly on the back story and development of each character\'s problems and solutions. This perhaps is what makes Absolute Duo stand out among random ""Harem"" shows.The story line makes your heart race, the characters make you smile or cringe, and the jokes are either so cliched its hilarious or so funny you can\'t help but crack a smile. (This is all in my own opinion). Along with the fact that it is only 12 episodes. So if you have the time to go on AnimeList and find an anime, you could probably down these episodes in one sitting (I know I can).All the same, I recommend watching at least the first 5 episodes (That was the point I got hooked). If you don\'t like it, move on. If you do, congratulations! Just realize that you don\'t really have anything to lose but a chance to watch a good anime.Don\'t judge an anime by it\'s review.

This may make my review useless to certain people still wanting to know if it's truly worth a watch.Anyway onto my review. I find Absolute Duo to have a very deep story and the characters also have strong...personality's. Yes it is a typical action/harem series but is that really a bad thing. If you have seen things in the past with the same sort of feel and liked that why not like it again in a different form. Other things I liked about this series is the art style. It's very bright and dark in all the right places giving you a true sense on the atmosphere in all scenes. The sounds are great and fit in everything they are used for not throwing you out of the immersion. The only real gripe I have with the series is that the ending felt a little rushed but I still enjoyed it none the less. personality's.

What I\'ve gotten is more of the same. Notably in these few places:* Tooru; the shounen lead who, despite his powers, still doesn\'t know how to handle women. ""Captain (America combined with) Thor?"" Really?* Basically, nobody in Wapan likes America; as shown with the enemy of the show who goes by the name of ""K.""I\'ll admit that this animu wasn\'t as brutal towards Tooru as, say, Trinity Seven was towards it\'s shounen lead.

Well, thats exactly what it was, sadly. Lets get onto the review:Story: 5/10Though the concept is always interesting and has some promise, there was literally no originality to this story, typical past event that scars the MC for life, and he wants to get revenge. Along the way he meets friends and slowly gathers his harem, meanwhile evil organizations are plotting eeeeviiiillll things. The pacing was also pretty bad, almost nothing of note happening...for multiple episodes at a time, only really getting down to the story ~7 or 8 episodes in, and even then i wasn\'t sure what was going on.Art: 8/10The art/animation was actually very good, probably the only thing that kept me going with the series, everything just looked so good to watch.Sound: 7/10Everything seemed solid when it came to the sound, voices all fit the characters, music went with the mood, though it seemed like I\'d heard VERY similar music in other anime, might be the composer. I absolutely loved the opening song though, same singer that sang NGNL opening!Characters: 6/10The characters were what you would typically find in your ""Battle harem school"" anime, the male MC that wants revenge from a past tragedy, the cute girl that he wants to protect, the shy girl that wants to be strong, etc. I personally loved the bunny teacher, she brought something refreshing to the show.Enjoyment: 4/10I enjoyed all of the battle scenes, they were all on point, but when the episode came around every week, I found myself thinking ""Oh.. Absolute Duo is on.. Eh... Maybe they will have a good fight this episode"" It wasn\'t a very enjoyable series outside of the battles basically.Overall: 6/10Absolute Duo is your typical ""battle harem school"" anime, as I stated a few times already, it was pretty disappointing. I would not recommend this anime to anyone, unless you love this type of anime. for multiple episodes at a time, only really getting down to the story ~7 or 8 episodes in, and even then i wasn\'t sure what was going on.Art: 8/10The art/animation was actually very good, probably the only thing that kept me going with the series, everything just looked so good to watch.Sound: 7/10Everything seemed solid when it came to the sound, voices all fit the characters, music went with the mood, though it seemed like I\'d heard VERY similar music in other anime, might be the composer.

However, I recognize its flaws.Story: 3The story and characters were the shallowest I\'d seen since Sword Art Online, but the series had some redeeming qualities. The story was simply too generic: A school dedicated to magic ended up being attacked for some reason. Worse, the characters were too idiotic to even question the term ""Absolute Duo"" mentioned by the headmaster, and then their cup sizes ranging from ""A"" to ""F"" were used as fanservice devices for the entirety of episode 8. As if that weren\'t enough, the series was a harem for five whole episodes. The good...in the story, however, is that after it is ruined by the fanservice, it redeems itself by creating an interesting villain similar to the protagonist in one way, and then finishing it off with good action scenes. What it needed most was an explanation of the protagonist\'s backstory. At least its open ending made room for a potential second season.Characters: 3Each character had potential, but none developed. Worse was the fact that they were ""harem"" archetypes. Luckily, they were put in a good setting for their characteristics. To see harem characters in a magical school is like sticking a piece of chocolate in curry.Tor - bland main character, but a nice guy.Julie - really quiet and kinda cold, but a great partner.Lilith - my favorite alongside their teacher; badass and assertive.Miyabi - large-breasted harem crush, but brave enough to confess it.Tachibana - shallow, but a great friend.Tora - extremely shallow.Tatsu - shallowest character I\'ve ever seen in an anime.Tsukimi-sensei - The most interesting of the bunch, but really just boobs and a split personality.Art: 8In several scenes, the CG was well-placed, and in the entire series, the art was good, but the animation and characters could have been more interesting, as they seemed just as generic as their personalities.The opening and ending animations are vibrant and colorful, though!Sound: 9 for sub, 7 for dubBoth versions had a really good opening and three endings that are worth buying off of a music store. The opening was catchy and upbeat like Sora Iro Days from Gurren Lagann, and the endings were respectively beautiful, happy, and... awesome. The voice acting and cast were great choices, considering their roles, but in the English version, they weren\'t as great. Imari sounded too old, and Tora (a student) was the teacher from Baka & Test.It was a great touch to put the first ending in the end of the series, to symbolize the return to the beginning plot.Enjoyment: 6Some people hated it, fewer loved it, and in the middle there are the ones who found it to be okay. I am in the third party, as I found it to be very good in some areas, excluding the middle five episodes. It was good, and then it was terrible, but then, it became the second-most underrated series I\'d seen. If you\'re into watching a series with romantic subtext and able to look past shallow themes, it\'s gonna be okay.Overall: 6The series is worth watching once, but not worth a rewatch for some people. I\'d personally rewatch it any day, but a third of it was terrible, so it was several gigabytes short of a hard-drive. It\'s still okay. I recommend the novels, or the manga instead, as the characters are a lot smarter.The verdict:Watch it, but you might not like it.I recommend Soul Eater and Highschool of the Dead. in the story, however, is that after it is ruined by the fanservice, it redeems itself by creating an interesting villain similar to the protagonist in one way, and then finishing it off with good action scenes.

I\'ve got nothing but good things to say. :^)I don\'t write reviews. Ever. Quite frankly, I\'ve never really considered writing one up until now, with my reason being how many negative reviews I\'ve read. Maybe I\'m the only one, and if so, that\'s just fine, but I feel like this show caught a lot of undeserved flak. This show\'s written off as your typical ecchi/harem with, ""no redeeming qualities,"" but I feel like a lot of folk are overlooking what makes this show special, and what sets it apart from the rest in my mind. I\'ll...be as down to earth as I can get, while keeping it vague so as not to spoil anything. Everything is left to your own interpretation in the end. These are my feelings, enjoy the ride.Story: 8/10The story\'s pretty toasty, I\'ll have to admit. There\'s a few grey areas here and there I wish could have been filled, but all in all, I have no qualms. I really wish there were some extra tidbits of information tossed in here or there, or perhaps a little more story in between the last few episodes (which would give us a few more episodes instead of just 12), but I\'m more than satisfied with what I got, for sure. The action was balanced well enough with moments of character development, albeit there\'s an action scene I found to be sort of dry towards the end, but in the end I was happy with what I got. It was kind of like Goldilocks in the battle department in my eyes: Not too boring, not too flashy, but just right. I like the idea of soul-power and manifesting weapons with your soul, and I feel like this is something Absolute Duo did right. There\'s countless other shows out there that toy with the same idea, but never really follow through on the details, all the while making it look bad-ass. On another note, a lot of people were bothered by the fanservice, which I had no problem with. It wasn\'t over-the-top, tits are flopping everywhere, ""omg senpai no look plox!!1!!1"" around every corner like I figured it would be going into it. It was tasteful, for lack of a better word, and quite humorous in some instances. All in all, I enjoyed quite a bit it for what it is, and in comparison to other titles like To Love-Ru or Maken-Ki, it could have done A TON worse.Art: 9/10The first thing I thought when I watched the first episode when the protagonists met under the cherry blossoms was, ""Wow... This is absolutely gorgeous."" Even if you didn\'t like the show, this is something you\'ve got to admit it had going for it. I\'m not going to get super in-depth with my elaboration, but it\'s fairly plain to see that a lot of work was put into how everything looks. From characters, to scenery, you\'re sure to enjoy the eye-candy (if you know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ). Everywhere you look, you\'ll notice that they paid significant attention to detail. That being said, if looks could kill...Sound: 10/10First point of interest: Suzuki Konomi.Now if we take a look at the sideshow, you\'ll also find yourself just as impressed. Every song is ultra catchy, especially the second ending track, ""Appuru Tī no Aji,"" which I catch myself humming at work all the freaking time now. These moments are few and far between, but sometimes you\'ll hear a sound affect that sounds like it was off a soundboard from 2003, which is completely atoned for by the epic soundtrack. An easy 10 out of 10, for sure.Character: 8/10I genuinely enjoyed the character development throughout the story. Others would complain they were a bit ""bland,"" but I saw a colorful assortment of characters from happy-go-lucky to strong and steadfast. The relationship between the two main characters Tooru and Julie is heartwarming. Whether you wish to perceive them as not-quite lovers or close friends, you\'ll feel the deep connection and compassion they share, no doubt. Each character had their quirks, which could have been played on and developed further in my opinion, but they all have unique personalities that set them apart from one another while simultaneously bringing them closer than ever before. The comradery is comfortable, the interaction between the flows quite well. If there had been a little more character development otherwise, it would have been a solid 10 in my book.Enjoyment: 10/10I enjoyed every episode. I\'d find myself riding a hype train all day long, super excited to sit down and watch the next episode. It honestly ended up being what I looked forward to most in the day for the five or so days, which should say quite a bit. The show did a lot right, and hooked me from the start. I enjoyed it thoroughly, for sure.Overall: 10/10From the sweetness between Tooru and Julie, to the cool-ass soul weapons, all the way up to the incredibly catchy soundtrack, it\'s a solid 10 for me. I went into the show enjoying it for everything it is, not what it wasn\'t. It\'s something a lot of us suffer with, and something I found myself slipping into as well. We judge shows by what they\'re not, spending all our time comparing it to other things we\'ve seen and affirming, ""Yeah, Generic Anime #5609 \'Ladies x Butlers\' is trash compared to \'Re:Zero.\'"" instead of picking out the things we enjoyed about it. It took time for me to realize it, but that\'s how it was for me, and quite a few people I\'ve met who watch anime. A lot of people are in denial about it, or refuse to change, and that\'s fine. That\'s what makes you, you; do what makes you happy. But back on topic, this show\'s incredibly entertaining, and I see myself re-watching it sometime very soon. I only wish it was a bit longer, and like many others out there, I\'m desperately holding out for a season 2!Thanks for taking the time to read, honesty.

That woman is crazy! At the beginning of there first school she introduced everyone in a battlefield! 🤣🤣After finishing the anime I had a question, From the starting of the anime Tooru's flashback showed there was someone who killed his entire family & a girl who was in Tooru's arms maybe she was his sister! So where is his story? Where is that man go who killed them? I know now what Tooru has found a different...path he said it himself he wants to protect everyone he wants his powers to protect his friends, I know he isn't in the path of vengeance's now but where did Tooru's past go and I see this anime was released in 2015 now it 2023 there are no season 2! So no continuation? Seriously a Cliffhanger! Well anyway did enjoy the anime so there is that!Could have been a good anime if they made a season 2! path he said it himself he wants to protect everyone he wants his powers to protect his friends, I know he isn't in the path of vengeance's now but where did Tooru's past go and I see this anime was released in 2015 now it 2023 there are no season 2!

Well anyway did enjoy the anime so there is that!Could have been a good anime if they made a season 2!"", 'I have a policy to always finish the series you start, no matter how awful it is and no matter how much you want to drop it.But this series made me seriously consider if I could call it an ""Exception"" just this one time. And I\'ve seen quite a few generic harem series, so for this one to be the first one to make me feel so is actually quite the achievement.Story: 3/10The story is incredibly generic for a school/harem/action anime.The most predictable plot ""twists""? Some power that you can develop by attending this specific academy? A protagonist who attends said academy to gain power...after a childhood incident, then turns out to be special? A ""main"" girl that comes from some foreign country? I could probably name a dozen more series that follow this same, boring pattern in the harem genre.Now, for the development, it\'s pretty much nothing but what you\'d expect from a harem. Most girls taking a liking to the male protagonist, some going boundaries to make him like her (a cliché that I never fully understood why it worked most of the time). Actually, some development is hindered simply because of the term ""Duo"", but I don\'t want to spoil anything if I don\'t have to.Art: 5/10I can\'t hate on the art, yet I can\'t praise it either. It\'s just good enough, yet it doesn\'t hold anything significant or impressive. But, the one thing I found annoying in the art is the ""boob physics"" and how much it bounces. It doesn\'t really help either that almost all girl characters that are somewhat significant to the story have their chests big and outlined.Sound: 4/10This is definitely my bias speaking, but I just can\'t stand the VA that voices Tooru, because he also voiced Kirito in SAO, which I was constantly reminded of almost every time I dived into a new episode and heard his voice again. His shouting made it all the worse. The other characters don\'t sound too bad, except the ""ja"" and ""nej"", which, as a Swede, felt like someone was stabbing my gut with a knife every time I heard it.Other than that, the music for the battle scenes was good. Somewhat generic hard rock, but one of the few things in the series that I could enjoy while watching.Character: 1/10First off, Tooru Kokonoe, the male protagonist. Shy and dense, except when he\'s confronted by it. Had a tragic incident happen when he was younger, caused by an unknown person, and therefore attends the academy. This also gives him the ""resolve to protect"" that most people have grown tired of seeing. The VA choice just strengthens my lack ofThen, Julia Sigtuna, a Swedish girl, and a cliché well fulfilled. Not only is ""Sigtuna"" quite the odd surname for a Swede, but saying ""yes"" and ""no"" in Swedish in a Japanese accent is insufferable. I repeat myself, it\'s like being stabbed in the gut by a knife, hearing her as a Swede. At the same time, her voice felt a tad too weak whenever she wasn\'t infuriated, making me even more irritated by her.Another foreign girl, Lilith Bristol, this time a Brit. She fulfills the ""joyful and open-minded"" cliché, but is more toned down than other characters following the cliché. I always disliked these kinds of characters (unless they got something else going for them, which Lilith doesn\'t), and this time is no exception. She calls Tooru her ""future spouse"", yet doesn\'t do a lot later in to gain his attention, which goes off from the cliché in a bad way, since now she doesn\'t manage to hold up a harem properly.Tomoe Tachibana, the ""onee-san"" character. She is the character I had to cling on to keep my calm, because she felt reasonable. Probably the only character that I enjoyed, but even that was shattered mid-way, for reasons I\'m obviously not going to mention. Just keep in mind that she\'s not one to hope in the series, because no one grants that through the entirety of the series.Lastly, Miyabi Hotaka. The lovebird. She is the character you know won\'t win, and you can tell very quickly in the series that it is indeed the case, so I don\'t count this as a spoiler. Unfortunately for her, it\'s another cliché I despise thoroughly. Being a shyness overlord, almost any solo screen-time she gets is her thinking about Tooru, which is quite pathetic, honestly.Enjoyment: 1/10Although I rated story at a 3, the art at 5 and the sound at 4, the 1-rating for the characters should really be less, and would be if I could. The seeming need to make clichés happen in an attempt to be different but ends up being  almost as any other of their sort. Especially the ""ja"" and ""nej"", but I don\'t think I need to emphasize that any more, because it\'s already dead.Most generic harem series tend to have some point of comedy, but this series didn\'t even manage THAT. Instead, by trying to off-set some clichés and just having a serious feeling to it the entire time, they made it worse.Overall: 2/10Definitely something that I would NOT recommend to anyone, especially not to someone who is familiar with Swedish. It\'s utter trash, and I highly regret even picking it up.If you\'re currently watching this, do yourself a favor and drop it.

Story is weak, romance is a bit weak, sound is okay; only decent enjoyment comes from main female lead and MusclesOther positive notes:- MC isn't completely a tool- MC Isn't a god nor an angsty/edgy little shit- Supporting cast has a slight hint of personality; especially Muscles- Not every bitch wants MC's dick immediately for no reason...Negatives- MC spergs out at anything woman-related regardless of exposure- MC gets caught in moments where he's not allowed to explain himself; not that he could even do it if given the chance (see Con #1)- MC's best friend is a bit edgy and fairly annoying; acting too much like an 8th grader- Overall just a weak romanceShould you watch it?

Also possibly clashing opinions)(Also, there are some spoilers, but they\'re rather vague so it shouldn\'t matter)The reason it\'s good is because it\'s what i\'d call a Junk Food Anime. It\'s good because it\'s bad. For example, HoTD was so bad (imo) that I loved it. Same thing for badly made movies. They have a certain charm to it. Now that i\'ve explained that, let\'s try to actually make this a review.The main character, Genericface McEdgelord(Legitimately can\'t remember his name, because he was just that generic), has a power, same as everyone else,...right? NOPE, he has a special power, along with a... dark past? No no no no NO.I\'m gonna stop you right there, Absolutely Terrible. Making the main character have an edgy past works, but only if you actually go into details and explain it.Nisekoi (Unrelated to the Action Genre, but feel free to watch it, it\'s decent) had a MC with a edgy backstory, but they did it well because they actually explained it within a small amount of episodes.(Small Spoiler, vague as all heck though so it should be fine. Skip this text block if you don\'t want any spoilers!)IIII\\/I\'m 10 episodes in to this and i\'m still not even sure if that chick was his sister, lover, girlfriend, mother, or whatever. Not only that, but in the small amounts of his past i\'ve seen, they don\'t even really show the murderer\'s face enough for you to comprehend it. I understand there\'s supposed to be a certain level of mystery, but that\'s just stupid. If it\'s his memory, he\'d remember that face clearly.Now then, let\'s talk about the female MC...Uh, let\'s see, where is she...Hmm....Oh, whoops, my bad. I mistook her for a piece of cardboard because her voice actor has one tone throughout the entire anime. The voice acting is decent, but I mean, come on.Sometimes characters with only one or two tones work well (EX: Shiro from No Game No Life, or in the one tone case, Rei from Evangelion) because their character actually acts like that. Julie has a bunch of facial expressions, but only one actual tone and it throws off all the scenes she\'s in (which is a decent amount, by the way)Really, there isn\'t much to say about the actual story. Genericface McEdgeLord is on a mission to... protect those he loves? I\'m honestly pretty unclear on the story.Romance? I have no clue what you\'re talking about, all I see is fanservice while the MC is conveniently nearby. The ""Romance"" Between Edgelord and Julie the Cardboard Robot is basically non-existent. Don\'t get me wrong, I WANT to believe there\'s romance, but it\'s just not happening.The real question is, did I enjoy it?----------------------------------------------Well, yes actually. It was bad, but also good. I feel like if they had made the characters less generic and the plot a bit thicker, this could\'ve been a really good anime, up there with (IMO again, keep in mind that I don\'t watch too much anime, so this is just my opinion) Kill La Kill, and Toradora!(For the Romance parts, anyways...)Story: 3 (Poor) Not much to say here, it was pretty bad. (Keep in mind I only got 10 episodes in, never finished it)Sound: 8 (Very good.) The voice actors were actually pretty decent(Subbed, at least), and the sounds they used were high quality, so they got away with an 8.Character: 4 (Mediocre) They definitely could\'ve been better, as they were extremely generic. Although, they didn\'t add a mega-tsundere from what I can remember, so at least they didn\'t go that far into GenericLand.Enjoyment: 9 (Great) While yes, it was extremely bad, that added to the charm of it all. Would I recommend it for serious anime fans? No, of course not. Would I recommend it for people who enjoy Junk Food Animes? Absolutely!OVERALL!: 6! (Fair) But wait, I hear you saying, your tears of anger dripping on to your favorite Manga. But it was so bad, how could you give it a six! Well, my Anime Loving comrade, like I said, it was so bad that it was good. That\'s the same reason I gave HoTD a decently high rating.Would I recommend this? Short answer, no.

The main plot development happens in the last two episodes.The OP is great. I love the music choices.The characters are very typical. They definitely need more work in terms of character development.

I'm not entirely sure what was going on through the producers' heads when they made this anime but Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt was a better anime and the producers were drunk when they came up with that idea so I sure as hell hope that the producers of Absolute Duo weren't sober and maybe then I'll forgive them.STORY 3/10What story? This anime just takes...a bunch of overused ideas and slaps them all into a blender, add a little bit of harem cause why not and a 'story' is born. It's a revenge story (but not really) with romance, action, friendship, and unnecessarily naked women. If that isn't the epitome of generic then I don't know what is.The anime starts off with Tooru, an average highschool boy going to the opening ceremony on his first day of school where it is revealed that he can actually summon a shield out of his right hand, called a Blaze, and use a comet punch. The school he attends is no ordinary school, it is actually a school that trains other Blaze users in hopes of achieving 'Absolute Duo'. What exactly is a Blaze and what does Absolute Duo even mean anyway? Beats me, the anime hardly touches on the subject and you just kind of have to accept the fact that things are happening whether you like it or not.ART 5/10It's not terrible but it's not good either. More work was put in the opening theme than the actual anime and it is very disappointing. Animation is very lazy and it looks like you're watching an anime at 12 frames per second making for very awkward movements and action scenes.SOUND 6/10I actually don't hate the voice actors for this anime and the OP isn't half bad at all.CHARACTER 1/10The character development is horrendous. The entire cast remains static throughout the entirety of the series and it's the same thing over and over again. The anime centers more around Tooru than it does any other character to the point where the other characters serve practically no purpose at all. The anime touches on Julie's past a little bit but it is on such a molecular level that it didn't actually make the story or her character progress at all. There's even a character that doesn't say anything, he literally just grunts and, as funny as it is sometimes, it's just....why? Why even give such a useless character so much screen time?ENJOYMENT 3/10I'm literally drooling during each episode cause each episode is the same as the last one.

For the most part, the anime is fairly open and so is difficult to predict the scenarios which may occur down the line - by no means a negative trait for an anime to have. The protagonist’s unique “Blaze” (the...name for the character abilities in this anime) leads you to wonder how the rest is going to progress, especially with regards to combat, which is an interesting variation on lots of the other action-heavy anime. Characters which have been introduced at intervals throughout the anime, such as Lilith, have sped up the plot and made things more engaging again and again.~Sound~~9~I will start off my saying that Yamamoto Nazomi does an incredible job of voice acting the main female protagonist, Julie. I have to admit that I am not terribly familiar with her work, but if it is anything like in Absolute Duo, then I will be pleased to see her name pop up again in the future. The rest of the voice acting is also done to a high standard. The OP and ED contrast greatly, yet I love them both for their own reasons, the former is fast paced and exciting while the latter is a lot softer and cute. Both compliment the anime nicely, as does the background music throughout it.~Visuals~~7~Absolute Duo has been nicely drawn. The characters seem, for the most part, well balanced and the more action-packed scenes make it clear what is happening while still adding flair to the scenarios. The contrast between colours is crisp where it needs to be and things are pleasing to the eye. The main negative that I would have to comment on is some of the character models; on occasion I have found some of their faces to be irregularly shaped, especially with some of the side views, there is also the matter with a few scenic scenes being relooped shorter segments (such as with the waves). The action scenes do make up for this a little and so will leave the Visuals section with a 7 rating from me.~Characters~~9~The protagonist, Tooru, voiced (of course) by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, is unique in his abilities, even if his character model and personality is fairly generic. The main interest for a large part however, is Julie. This is an intriguing character which you keep wanting to find out more about, you learn fairly early on that things have happened in her past, though it does not go into as much detail as may have been ideal. The multiple side-characters have their own personalities which all seem to tie nicely in together as of present. Character development really started to blossom after the introduction of Lilith and the proceeding episodes, and it is nice to see that they have dedicated time to that portion of the anime.

The plot becomes incredible and the characters are well nicely developed, adding a great deal to the overall feel of the anime. I would not be able to call the visuals a let-down in any way, though it is the largest constituent as to why Absolute Duo was not able to reach the infamous “10” rating for me.For those who are interested ~ Ranking Progression:This is where I show the changes (if any) in my overall rating as the anime progressed, I review my ratings every 4 episodes ~ though if one does stand out for me I will also mention it.E01: 7E04: 8 (Rated Up 1)E08: 8E11: 9 (Rated Up 1)E12: 9 name for the character abilities in this anime) leads you to wonder how the rest is going to progress, especially with regards to combat, which is an interesting variation on lots of the other action-heavy anime. Characters which have been introduced at intervals throughout the anime, such as Lilith, have sped up the plot and made things more engaging again and again.~Sound~~9~I will start off my saying that Yamamoto Nazomi does an incredible job of voice acting the main female protagonist, Julie. I have to admit that I am not terribly familiar with her work, but if it is anything like in Absolute Duo, then I will be pleased to see her name pop up again in the future. The rest of the voice acting is also done to a high standard. The OP and ED contrast greatly, yet I love them both for their own reasons, the former is fast paced and exciting while the latter is a lot softer and cute. Both compliment the anime nicely, as does the background music throughout it.~Visuals~~7~Absolute Duo has been nicely drawn. The characters seem, for the most part, well balanced and the more action-packed scenes make it clear what is happening while still adding flair to the scenarios. The contrast between colours is crisp where it needs to be and things are pleasing to the eye. The main negative that I would have to comment on is some of the character models; on occasion I have found some of their faces to be irregularly shaped, especially with some of the side views, there is also the matter with a few scenic scenes being relooped shorter segments (such as with the waves). The action scenes do make up for this a little and so will leave the Visuals section with a 7 rating from me.~Characters~~9~The protagonist, Tooru, voiced (of course) by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, is unique in his abilities, even if his character model and personality is fairly generic. The main interest for a large part however, is Julie. This is an intriguing character which you keep wanting to find out more about, you learn fairly early on that things have happened in her past, though it does not go into as much detail as may have been ideal. The multiple side-characters have their own personalities which all seem to tie nicely in together as of present. Character development really started to blossom after the introduction of Lilith and the proceeding episodes, and it is nice to see that they have dedicated time to that portion of the anime. There is one character which sees significant development and this adds incredibly to the late portion of the anime - making some scenes very moving.~Enjoyment~~9~(Enjoyment is always difficult to write about so my rating is primarily based off of a scale I have on my profile.

This could be so good but it\'s so... bad. Let me explain why.Animation was meh. It did not blow me off my seat, it did not make me cry in disbelief at how badly you can mess up. Motion was captured just fine, but the last 2 episodes suffered from the Dragonball Syndrome. Namely - dots for eyes and lines for mouths in combat scenes etc.Writing 2/10(for effort): This was a pitiful attempt, at most. No backstory explained. I\'m trying to keep this spoiler free, so I won\'t point out the most obvious stuff, I\'ll just say the story...tried so hard to find focus that it ended up all over the place. Detour after detour, failure after failure until you realize that this story is just a random blob of flashbacks, ""mastermind"" plans, motivations, trying to explain how soulpower works and excuses to throw in more fighting in-between your fighting and fan service. Not to mention efforts to make this battle royale with the story progress at times. This story would put any swiss cheese in shame.Characters 2/10(for effort): Bland, cliché and boring when explained(main cast) but most of them aren\'t even touched, they are just decorations to make you feel this is actually happening in a school, with classmates and all. Length of this anime and its heavy focus on action left no time for character development - which is almost nonexistent, and if it\'s there it\'s always circled around the ""development of their soul""(or how powerful they\'ve become, and even that is inconsistent AND even that focuses on the main cast of like 5 characters). The only character that wasn\'t like the rest was Imari, and she was mercilessly shoved aside by the creators only to be brought up halfway through the series. And don\'t even get me started on the MC, a person this stupid and clueless in real life would be deemed as borderline autistic. Not to mention he looks exactly like the MC of Sakurasou(hairstyle, eye color and posture), but I\'d like to think that\'s an accident. It has to be, since the characters are your generic huge boobs/small boobs and hairstyles thrown together to cover up the fact that they all lack any depth.Sound 5/10: That was bad studio work - voicing was ok, but the way it was edited to somewhat fit into this whole thing... sound effects from battles sounded like they were taken straight from first mortal kombat at times(certain loud thump in 11th or 12th episode or sword clashing sounds when stuff hits a shield...)SUMMARY: If you enjoy anime battles and do not like complicated lore, this is an anime for you. However - if you are on a crusade to point out mishaps and mistakes or you just can\'t help being pissed off at incompetency - you\'d be better off without this stroke you\'ll be getting from watching this. tried so hard to find focus that it ended up all over the place.

I like it a lot but wish there was more than 12 episodes, it has very interesting aspects to it, it is simplistic but has a nice love interest in it so far, and usually when anything bad happens between him and the love interest it\'s usually blown out of proportion and he ends up looking like a perv. It\'s not overly done either which is a nice change from what I recently watched (High School DxD), it seems like a bit more story...could be added to it as it doesn\'t have too much of a flow between the scenes, meaning they don\'t connect very well. It has ""Blaze\'s"" which is essentially a manifestation of ones soul into a weapon, where as some people are exceptions and it manifests in other ways (such as the main character\'s being a shield).I like: the characters, the art style, the plot, the lore, and just it overall.I don\'t like: the length, the somewhat lack of connection between episodes (the flow?), the way the school does things.Very interesting anime, I don\'t normally watch when they have below 24 episodes but this is a nice change so far.

I blew it off at first thinking that it would be another one of those cringe-worthy filler fan service episode, but then they just threw stuff at the audience right at the end.

Main character lost someone, and so he continues to grow stronger so he will not lose anyone else. Is the plot okay? Yeah whatever I\'m fine with the story. It\'s the way they executed it that is so poor. You are always left with more questions than answers. Just what exactly is an absolute duo? What kind of power does it instill? What is the deal with the main characters past? And what about Julie\'s past? Where did the mech suit men even COME from? Too many loose ends...are never tied.Art:I have no complaints with the art.

The animation would show marvelous cracks into the floor and dirt and gravel and dust rising up, clouding the area, yet when you hear it... it\'s just incredibly dissatisfying. It made watching any type of physical scene extremely difficult. There were so many time where if it just actually sounded like what it was supposed to be, the scene would be fantastic.

They had my favorite genres which are romance, action and school life. I gave this series a 8/10 at the beginning but right up to episode 5 or 6 i just couldn't take it seriously.Story: 6/10... I thought the story was pretty original since i don't remember any anime with that sort of plot. So I had high hopes for it. But everything just did not run smoothly they mainly focused on the harem aspect of the show with every girl wanting...the main male character as a duo at first I actually liked it, but as each episode went by I just found it down right annoying. It does have a little drama though.Art: 8/10..The art is beautiful.The colours are vibrant and they stand out. this makes it enjoyable to watch. characters are well drawn and animation is up to standards for this day and age.Sound: 9/10... I have to say, I am in love with the opening theme song , which is called Absolute Soul by Konomi Suzuki; One of my favorite singers for anime Op.. I can't really comment on the ending songs since I didn't care enough to listen.Characters: 6/10... The characters are likeable. I really like Tor and Julie best. I also like Tomoe since she is like best girl friend to Tor. Julie reminds me of that girl from the anime Sakurasou. She has an innocent and honest personality she is like a little kitten which I love.Enjoyment: 6/10.. It is a fairly good anime it isn't bad but it isn't good either. I watch it for the sake of seeing Julie and Tor together. Oh and the sensei. I love her 2 personalities. she reminds me of me :)Overall: 6/10...

It didn\'t impress me at all, but we need to give it a fair trial. This anime turned out to be pretty mediocre, but it clearly isn\'t a 2/10.Story:It started off pretty promising but then suddenly took a turn for the worst. The two main characters have a weird father and daughter bond, but that is all there is to it. It seems they lost interest in the romance aspect between the two main characters after about 3 episodes. It just broke down into this generic harem anime with a boring cast of characters.Characters and...Character Development:The characters were interesting at first and had potential, but the producers had something else in mind. For the first few episodes i enjoyed the interaction between Tooru (Main hero) and Julie (Main heroine). After a little while they added more characters but they were so bland. A blonde spoilt girl who gets everything she wants. A weak and clumsy character who just suddenly falls in love with the hero.  Then the most interesting addition, the black haired tomboy (by interesting i mean, ""kind of acceptable""). Julie seemed to actually have a slightly interesting back story, but then, they revealed it. It was a generic tale of revenge. Boring!Art and Music:This is one of the only reasons why i gave this anime an okay score. The OP sounds pretty good and they don\'t have many quiet moments in the anime. There is always some interesting track playing in the background. The art style was also nice and polished, there isn\'t much to say about this. It was pretty good in the technical aspect.Overall:The anime has pretty good music. That is all i can say about the positives. In my eyes, the ending is PARAMOUNT. The ending for this anime was pretty horrible. No plot twists, no satisfying ending, no NOTHING. It was just one of those, ""and they lived happily ever after"" endings. The last episode made no sense, and since this is a spoiler free review i can\'t go to details on it. You will realise when you see it (if you ever decide to watch this anime).I give it a 6/10, go listen to it\'s opening song Absolute soul, that is the best this anime has to offer.Sorry if this wasn\'t a really high quality review, it\'s my first one, hope you enjoyed reading it!

I know! I fucking know that this  anime isn\'t any worse than the rest of the filth floating around MAL, just waiting to lure unsuspecting viewers with interesting synopsis, all the correct tags or whatever else.And I know I\'m being a bit harsh for taking it all out on this particular shit title, not even bothering to watch the whole cour (and fuck me standing if I ever will), but while I gracefully remained silent while being disappointed, this one simply added that one last nail to the coffin.NOW, TO ACTUAL REVIEW!There is no coherency in this anime, story is a joke. it...tries to mix standard openings of harem animes with a thriller ""our principal is a fucking lunatic 12 year old girl"", all the while rambling about western-sounding soul weapons, stuffing flashbacks wherever possible. Let\'s not forget about the necessary ""MC is too cool to hit girls so he protects the girl attacking him from another dude.

Horrible.', 'first of all I\'im going to say that this anime is getting bashed more than it deserves.Story: 8/10we follow our Male protagonist by the name of Kokonoe Tooru who enrolls in Kouryou Academy. the purpose of the school is to reach absolute duo and that is gained through hard work and dedication. the story isn\'t completely original but it has a nice take on it. there exist something called blazes and they are simply a representation of the persons soul (not original) but even though the concept is unoriginal i still thought that it was planned and executed nicelybut there is some plot holes that...doesn\'t get explained and therefore it would have been nice to see 24 ep instead of 12.there is some ecchi moments and towards the end there is some elements of a harem but that is not that noticeable.Art: 8/10the art was nice and had a lot of vibrant colors but towards the end of the show you can start to see that the budge became a problem so they had to cut down on the quality of the animation though it isn\'t super noticeable though.the fight scenes where nicely choreographed and well animated.overall the animation was good but not outstanding,Sound: 9/10the sound was quite enjoyable but not to the point that i would remember it thought the openings and the endings where a nice touch to the series and i quite liked them. the background music was nicely put to use but i would have wanted a bit more power in the tracks played during fights.and they nailed the more ""emotional"" moments and there isn\'t much to comment on that.Characters: 8/10Kokonoe Tooru: he is the typical male protagonist that is quite generic, a weak boy that receives OP abilities, he has a troubled past that will return to haunt him.Sigtuna Julie: her purpose to enroll in the school is revealed later in the show but she is a quite girl that is a little bit of an airhead, she makes stupid decisions that ends up causing more problems than it helped (which annoyed me slightly)Bristol Lilith: typical rich girl with an annoying attitude though it improves quite a bit the further the story progresses.Hotaka Miyabi: for me this it the person that is here only to annoy and be a burden for the rest of the cast. though for me see was a representation of humanity and the feelings of being helpless, confused and weak. but gains power through her friends as she learns to stand up by herself.Tachibana Tomoe: she was a great addition to the cast as you gave a sort of rivalry with the MC so that both got some character development but other than that she is a side character that just feels a role to explain certain things and be more of the shot caller.Enjoyment: 9/10i enjoyed this anime quite a bit and it had me wanting to watch more and more.the animation was as expected and i didn\'t have a problem with how they structured the story and the ending. it\'s light-hearted but could be serious when it wanted to which i found to be a major strong point in the anime. the story progresses fairly quickly but not to the point where it felt rushed.Overall:  8/10this one brought a nice relaxed but enjoyable story with some serious bits but not to major in a sense. the characters, most of them were enjoyable and i liked the interaction between them as it didn\'t feel pointless. the sound is used well and they nailed the important moments with the right music. for me this was one of those animes were once you finished an episode you wanted more and kept watching, before you know it, it was over and was left with a feeling of wanting even more.there is some ecchi moments and some that point to the typical harem anime but for this one that is not the case. those embarrassing moment that the MC faces where there for comic relief which i found quite enjoyable.when considering to watch this anime. don\'t expect an masterpiece because it won\'t live up to that but it\'s a great show none the less. doesn\'t get explained and therefore it would have been nice to see 24 ep instead of 12.there is some ecchi moments and towards the end there is some elements of a harem but that is not that noticeable.Art: 8/10the art was nice and had a

harem anime but for this one that is not the case. those embarrassing moment that the MC faces where there for comic relief which i found quite enjoyable.when considering to watch this anime. don\'t expect an masterpiece because it won\'t live up to that but it\'s a great show none the less.', 'I haven\'t finished watching the series as I write this but I don\'t feel that my opinions will change much for the last 3 episodes that I haven\'t watched.The anime is mediocre IMO. You have the standard guy ""I\'ll protect everyone"" and is kind of weak and embarrassed of himself. Since the anime has a crutch with the ""Duo"" system, its kind of interesting but his partner aka Julie the loli ""Ja!"" girl is kind of meh. She is more of a child or a pet to him than a proper partner. She barely has a mind of her own IMO.The story is kind of...bleak. Basically its mechs vs magic weapons. Not a bad concept, but the execution isn\'t that good.The anime is both boring and hilarious, because 80% of the girls don\'t really like the male lead because of love but because of how broken they are inside. It feels like they are like his pets rather than girls that like a guy.I can\'t say I recommend this, but if you\'re bored and don\'t have anime to watch this might entertain you for the time. bleak.

It does not contain any spoilers that may affect the plot.Story 3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------Summarizing the story, we get Tooru Kokonoe as the main character, he had a traumatic incident wherein the person he loved was killed, seeking for revenged he enrolled in a school. Tooru has a power called blaze, and this school enhance the potential of his blaze, by the way he wields a shield, and regarded as an irregular due to him having a shield instead a weapon, but in the school you must have a duo, because the school\'s mission is to find the...absolute duo....At first the plot fascinated me and thought ""it might be a good anime"", and I saw this trending so I watched it. I won\'t sugarcoat things here, it was basically horrible, it seems that it was written by some 17 years old who has a chuunibyou, it was stupid the story had no exact plot, backstory, character developement; any of these wasn\'t present in the story. Even if you tell me it is a 12-episode-story that\'s why it isn\'t enough to add in these, then tell me why ""how did they throw in fan service?""I\'m going to spoil you guys now, the main character and his girl go to the mall and suddenly the guy opened the curtain while the girl is changing, There is an episode where they go in the beach because of a field trip and then the bra of the girl got wash up by the sea. Now guys these ""spoilers"" are common in a ecchi/harem story. Almost every harem/ecchi story has these sequences so you could find it in other ecchi/anime stories such as""Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry"" and ""Trinity Seven"". Asking me what is unique with this story, I can\'t answer.Art 6 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------There was inconsistent, sometimes the art was colorful, sometimes it was dark. In my opinion the art wasn\'t bad but wasn’t good either, The background was beautiful but the character design seemed childish; it wasn\'t very fitting for the background. Not much to say in art.Sound 6 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------I must praise their efforts on the sound, because the opening and ending changed even though it\'s just a 12-episode-anime but the reason I gave 6 is because I couldn\'t feel the battle sequence, the romance part, and etc.. The sound is inaudible in some cases; a battle scene without music is just boring.The voice actor is a good choice for the characters designs such as Nozomi Yamamoto, who voiced Julie in this anime, you could really tell the anime was aiming for a kuudere character since she was the voice actor.Character 3---------------------------------------------------------------------------This is what I hate the most in the anime, they introduce characters but they don\'t give notice to these characters? Some characters lack attention, like that muscle guy, what’s his name? I FORGOT CAUSE WTF, YOU DIDN\'T EVEN GIVE HIM ONE DIALOUGE; in one episode he only flexed his muscle. It\'s not only one guy, all of the major characters had no story; there was no reason why the main character even wanted revenge or whom he wanted to revenge against, the series ended full of mystery, not one major mystery involving the main characters were solved. And even though they couldn\'t give attention to the other characters they kept adding more and more characters, that’s just stupidityEnjoyment 2---------------------------------------------------------------------------Basically, It wasn\'t worth my time, it felt like I was just watching other ecchi/harem anime. It was just the same in some points. For an experienced anime watcher it is generic, cliche, and predictable. This anime would surely disappoint you.For those who just started watching anime and want to watch anime, this series wouldn\'t be good for you, there are other harem/anime that may satisfy you (highschool dxd/aesthetic of the rouge hero). This series would just be a disappointment on how you view anime.Overall 5---------------------------------------------------------------------------More complaints:In the review of the story I said the writer was a 17 year-old chunibyou, let me explain it to you. The character\'s dialogue is something so shitty I had to cover my ears and just read the subtitle. A gothic Lolita said 9 times (9 times is an exaggeration) in the show ""everything is done so we could achieve the absolute duo."" why would you emphasize this dialogue? This dialogue should have only been said once for in my opinion it would keep the story more mysterious.And also parts of the story were unrealistic, I\'m not saying being unrealistic in an anime is bad, but atleast keep it consistent. For an example, there was a part they were falling from a second floor in a mall and it took about 20 seconds just to get down, but when they jump from the second floor(yes, jump because they are strong) it only took a split second.TL;DR ---------------------------------------------------------------------Story: didn\'t focus much on the plot but went full fanservice and introduce too many characters that the main characters didn\'t get enough time for them to unravel their past; and by past, meaning the reason why the story started.Art: sometimes good, sometimes bad; inconsistent, character design didn\'t fit too well with the background.Sound: efforts were good, good choice of VA (voice actors too), but it the background soundtracks were inaudible and forgettable too. Imagine Darth Vader walking without the imperial march, seems bland right? That is the feeling on some parts.Character: didn\'t have any developement (by the developements meaning flashbacks or growth of an individual). The characters were not given attention.Enjoyment: did not enjoy this anime at all, waste of time. absolute duo....At first the plot fascinated me and thought ""it might be a good anime"", and I saw this trending so I watched it.

I felt that this whole show could have been better; it had so much potential to be something cool and exciting, which it did for a while. I was going through this show blind & watching it in English dub on Youtube.STORY: School, Teenage boys and girls, archaic weapons that no one uses anymore unless your a pro LARPer. As the story progressed onward, I began to enjoy it just a little bit; however, towards the end, it dropped all my excitement. The dubbing did not help either, which was my mistake to...begin with.ART: I don\'t really know what to say about the art. I guess it was alright.SOUND: The english dub to this was much worse than I expected, during fights. During the rest of the episodes, it was a little better. The male protagonist, Tooru, was probably the only voice that fit. Everyone else was either hit or miss. At times, it\'s pretty cringe worthy. Especially the ecchi, it just feels like they\'re reading off a script, especially one character.CHARACTER: The only character I liked was Tooru, he seemed to be the only one focused on what was going on, even though he could have turned this Absolute Duo to an Absolute Threesome. Julie was tolerable, so was Tomoe. Mami came back with her gun, bigger boobs and a British accent. Everyone else felt useless or burnt out, even some of their voice actors felt bored of their roles halfway through the series. Miyabi was the worst of the worst, I know she was supposed to be this shy character, but the voice put me off and it sounded like she\'s a virgin until like the last few episodes. The only other character I liked was Kevin, I disliked him, and I enjoyed that. I think that as villains go for any movie, you\'re supposed to hate them because of their bad deeds; he does it right because of how annoying he is.ENJOYMENT: Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the show. Its one of those shows where it\'s really bad, but you enjoy it because its bad.OVERALL: It had a potential to be different from all the other shows that have: School, Teenagers, Fantasy fighting, and a protagonist that won\'t give them the Sweet Hawaiian Sauce. Maybe the ecchi could have been ""presented"" better, or maybe remove the misunderstanding and just do it in a tent. I dunno, I just wish it was better. Personally, I think this is a show you can speed through, talk about how bad it is, then make funny jokes about it. begin with.ART: I don\'t really know what to say about the art.

Personally, I think this is a show you can speed through, talk about how bad it is, then make funny jokes about it.', ""Story(5):Absolute duo is a very generic and cliche type of story that takes place in some what a high school with some action as well as a harem of girls. Basically, it's nothing outstanding nor interesting, the pacing and stuffs is okay, but because it's so generic and the development is not deep at all, I find it hard to enjoy this show. of course for audience who don't mind just watching girls with decent assets fighting and having fun, then they may find it interesting, but to me, it's became some what a chore to watch this anime as I always finish the series...that I started. It's not that bad, really nothing interesting.Art (7):The rendering is possibly one of the best aspect of this show, things are bright and vibrant, easy to see, even for night scenes, it's easy to see what's going on. However, I really don't like the fact that they had quite a bit of CGI used in the show. The buildings and some of the villains in armour are all easily identified as CGI, it just didn't blend in with the characters and the movements are all very mechanical and artificial. Animation wise, generic kind of animation, quite a few derps in the details here and there but it's ok for a budget anime. Fight scenes on the other hand has too many pauses to even make it intense though the addition of perspective makes it look more pleasant.Sound(7):Sound wise, the opening and ending are quite memorable and the voices of the female cast are all good, they leave me with a good impression, however the guys are too generic, everyone kind of overuse Kirito's voice actor as their main cast.Overall(5):I didn't really enjoy the series in general since it's not a very meaningful show. Things are too cliche and I'm a guy who doesn't really care much about looking at girls once the plot is weak. I'm not too sure what other reviews had said about this series but mediocre is the best word to describe this show that I started.

This one with many interesting twists.I speak of course, about ""Absolute Duo"".As some of you know, I begin to tire of the almost absolute nature of Japanese authors, that believe all anime (or manga, for that matter) must begin with a high-school environment. But I\'m not going to rant about that. For me, basic story is everything; so the startup environment becomes a small gripe, but a gripe nonetheless.I have been very late in reviewing this anime, because firstly, I\'ve been very busy writing...some fan fiction. But also, because I wanted to watch the show again, in English Dub. The first time I watched it was in the Japanese with subtitles. I can report that the subtitled version is much better. The chosen English voices (aside from Caitlin Glass) were mostly mediocre to terrible.-------------------To that end, I wish to speak a little about Caitlin Glass. Ms. Glass was born in D.C., and raised in California. She presently lives in Texas. Caitlin Glass isn\'t right for every character she plays; but in this case, she was so over the top, that I just had to mention the great outrageous character voice she did for the character Lilith Bristol, supposedly a very English personality.Arrogant, spoiled, patrician; Caitlin Glass faked everything Lilith had to be with charm, grace and fun. Lilith Bristol was so over the top that everything she said and did, had comic overtones that just had me grinning, in every scene she was in. One misses out on Caitlin\'s voice, for the overall much better subtitled version, but if you want to be charmed by a dubbed voice look for Lilith Bristol. You won\'t be disappointed.Caitlin Glass is often caught doing a lot of things one would not expect. She was the ADR Director of this show; and she is heard in other anime. The one that comes to mind is a song she sings, with many other characters in ""Cat Planet Cuties"", where she is the best sounding. Her character sings this song, where her character is an Android that is keeping faith with her previous owner, now dead for more than 900-years. After that, her character travels back to home world, and pitches herself into the ocean, in the commission of suicide. She just couldn\'t bear to live anymore. Anyone who can\'t feel pathos about that, has had his/her pathos button burned out.--------------------Let\'s now return to Absolute Duo.Since most of the characters are quite formulaic, I only wish to speak about one or two, in the main. And that begins with Kevin Wayfair.Kevin Wayfair is a total abomination. His back story does not fit his character. His brother dies, in ways not detailed in the story, so he reacts by believing in nothing and no-one. He becomes the penultimate villain character, with only a one-dimensional face on everything, including his universally single-minded desire to kill anything that becomes a possible threat; in his single-minded drive to become the strongest power center. He doesn\'t even have an over-arching reason to acquire power, and applies it to nothing but the acquisition of more of it.Lot\'s of people lose their brothers. They don\'t become homicidal maniacs. They usually get over it, and live normal lives. Even in the Absolute Duo universe, where several characters have lost loved ones. They didn\'t become insane monsters. Difficult to handle sometimes, but not irretrievably insane.Now I want to speak briefly about one of the teachers in our hero\'s homeroom; Rito Tsukimi. For those of you who have watched part or all of Absolute Duo; you\'ll already know. Rito is \'bang her head against the wall because it feels good\' totally nuts. Couple homicidal rage with latent nymphomania, and you get pretty close to this teacher with the playboy bunny ears and a personality Marquis De Sade would have been proud of. And this is what the head-mistress of the school allows near young teenagers.The other side of Rito\'s equation is that without her, there would have been very little humor in the show, albeit dark sadistic humor. She, with great cheer and aplomb, sometimes decides to include herself in the occasional scheduled combat matches, just to introduce what she thinks is funny. This amounts to converting these matches into death-matches a\'la Freddy Kruger. That\'s reasonably funny too, if you\'re into that sort of thing.It would not have been difficult to edit a few plot-lines, or dialog, to make Rito an \'insider\' spy for Kevin Wayfair. But that doesn\'t happen, she is totally loyal to her head-mistress of the school. No reason I can come up with, and it isn\'t in the story. Don\'t look for it, just enjoy that somehow Rito is on the side of \'good and righteousness\'.Now I wish to switch gears and talk about the plot. Because of the single-sided villain in the story, there isn\'t much for the authors to develop. But they did have some mildly good plot devices in the story that I could enjoy.1). Did anyone notice that this school has enemies that are not a competing club in the school, or other inside faction? The enemies are all external from the main campus of the school, and thereby produces a story plot that is significantly different from most other high-school \'spice of life\' adversarial conflicts.2). Does anyone notice that the head-mistress of this school is not running a school at all, but a factory for super-humans? This explains why she runs two separate campuses. And because of this developing plot-line, she has absolutely no compassion for her students at all. Sakuya Tsukomo is however, a very good politician, and knows when she must appear compassionate when politic to do so. For this reason, many respect her, but she has almost no friends at all. Is it any wonder her handle is \'Blaze Diabolica\'?Sakuya is so dark, that she could almost be classed as a true anti-villain. In the end I had real trouble with her absolute refusal to join forces with the other character that has no back-story. Equipment Smith. I see no reason why not. Exo-suit equipment for augmenting the physical strength of a Blaze Student would in fact produce a pair of \'Absolute Duo\', in a much shorter time. The results were all positive, I could not see a negative to this alliance.In short, Sakuya was a very guarded and secretive individual, for reasons difficult to defend. Equipment Smith\'s main failings dealt with poor choices for personnel to be augmented. The means of augmentation had few negatives.3). Did anyone notice that \'Miyabi Hotaka"" was never defeated at the end? She got talked out of her desire to be powerful beyond all imagining. Plain and simple. This produced a very unsatisfying ending. Without that moment in the story, the pairing of Miyabi and Kevin would have been demonstrably stronger than the \'Blaze\' alone. And head-mistess Sakuya would have met with defeat. She won because of a weak-minded fool who should never have been augmented in the first place. And Kevin was an equally poor choice for augmentation, for opposite reasons.In this way, the authors provide for us a straw-man, that looks like the whole idea of augmentation is a poor one. It isn\'t. Only the choice of people was flawed. For example, a sane man with a gun does not shoot up his neighborhood, just because he can. Only a flawed one would even consider it.---------------------Now I want to talk about the art and sound in the show. The artwork is actually quite good, and even contains some startling parallax artwork and other niceties. But I continue to question the use of eye-colors in the metallic range. It makes the characters look like dead automatons. I wish artists would refrain from this practice. It tarnishes otherwise good artwork.The soundtrack is quite good, although there isn\'t a whole bunch of it. The opening and closing title music is mostly very bad j-pop music. The exception is the first end-title track, which is very good, and its harmonies and rhythm is not too egregious.The dialog tends towards too much, but not to the point of extreme annoyance; aside from Rito\'s dialog which tends to say too much, and give away her characteristics too early in the story.With all of that, I close a review of a very flawed anime in \'Absolute Duo\', which did in fact have some good developmental plot points, and some excellent actions scenes. Oh and don\'t forget the rare and interesting, although poorly developed characters that bear watching; Like Diabolica and Rito. And the never speaking character \'Ryuutarou Tatsuno\' who flexes his muscles to impress the girls, and gets his over-muscled physique stomped into the pavement way more often than he should have.I give Absolute Duo a weak 7. some fan fiction. But also, because I wanted to watch the show again, in English Dub. The first time I watched it was in the Japanese with subtitles. I can report that the subtitled version is much better.

Is it any wonder her handle is \'Blaze Diabolica\'?Sakuya is so dark, that she could almost be classed as a true anti-villain. In the end I had real trouble with her absolute refusal to join forces with the other character that has no back-story. Equipment Smith. I see no reason why not. Exo-suit equipment for augmenting the physical strength of a Blaze Student would in fact produce a pair of \'Absolute Duo\', in a much shorter time. The results were all positive, I could not see a negative to this alliance.In short, Sakuya was a very guarded and secretive individual, for reasons difficult to defend. Equipment Smith\'s main failings dealt with poor choices for personnel to be augmented. The means of augmentation had few negatives.3). Did anyone notice that \'Miyabi Hotaka"" was never defeated at the end? She got talked out of her desire to be powerful beyond all imagining. Plain and simple. This produced a very unsatisfying ending. Without that moment in the story, the pairing of Miyabi and Kevin would have been demonstrably stronger than the \'Blaze\' alone. And head-mistess Sakuya would have met with defeat. She won because of a weak-minded fool who should never have been augmented in the first place. And Kevin was an equally poor choice for augmentation, for opposite reasons.In this way, the authors provide for us a straw-man, that looks like the whole idea of augmentation is a poor one. It isn\'t. Only the choice of people was flawed. For example, a sane man with a gun does not shoot up his neighborhood, just because he can. Only a flawed one would even consider it.---------------------Now I want to talk about the art and sound in the show. The artwork is actually quite good, and even contains some startling parallax artwork and other niceties. But I continue to question the use of eye-colors in the metallic range. It makes the characters look like dead automatons. I wish artists would refrain from this practice. It tarnishes otherwise good artwork.The soundtrack is quite good, although there isn\'t a whole bunch of it. The opening and closing title music is mostly very bad j-pop music. The exception is the first end-title track, which is very good, and its harmonies and rhythm is not too egregious.The dialog tends towards too much, but not to the point of extreme annoyance; aside from Rito\'s dialog which tends to say too much, and give away her characteristics too early in the story.With all of that, I close a review of a very flawed anime in \'Absolute Duo\', which did in fact have some good developmental plot points, and some excellent actions scenes. Oh and don\'t forget the rare and interesting, although poorly developed characters that bear watching; Like Diabolica and Rito. And the never speaking character \'Ryuutarou Tatsuno\' who flexes his muscles to impress the girls, and gets his over-muscled physique stomped into the pavement way more often than he should have.I give Absolute Duo a weak 7.', 'I had a lot of high hopes for this anime when it first started. But by the end of it, I was mostly just disappointed.A few PROS hooked me from the start:1.) I liked the opening and ending theme songs.2.) It had a good cast of voice actors.3.) The animation was fairly good with adequate effects and nice artwork.4.) I also enjoyed the general concept of the story...A school that teaches a duo system for combat, weapons that are manifestations of the soul, a main character whose soul manifests as a shield to protect rather than a weapon to attack with....That all seemed fairly interesting.5.) To top off, the cast of characters was pretty good to start out with...Julie is adorable, bunny sensei provides comedic relief, you have a brain and brawn duo, and another duo of typical moe characters for fan service and harem aspects. The problem is that this cast never matures into anything else.-------------------------------------------------------------------------So here\'s my view of the CONS:1.) The main characters get very little character development, if any.Julie and Tor are given back stories that are never fully explained nor used to advance the story. Their back stories also never receive any sort of conclusion.Romance is foreshadowed at the start of the show but never advanced. I started to question whether it was ever canon to begin with or if I was just imagining things. Tor and Julie don\'t change much as a duo throughout the course of the show aside from their growing urge to protect one another. The show even reverts them to more of a father-daughter relationship than anything else.The secondary characters get more plot development than the main characters too. Bunny Sensei goes from trying to murder the students to protecting them, Miyabi struggles to deal with her romantic feelings, and Lilith matures and learns to make friends.2.) The secondary characters were not utilized to their full potential.The little goth principal seemed promising at first. It made it seem like not all of the cards were on the table yet. As the show goes on however, nothing is gained from her character. She seems utterly powerless yet incredibly important for no reason. The show never gives her a back story or a shining moment. At first she reminded be of the ""Witch of the Void"" (Natsuki Minamiya) from ""Strike the Blood"" but that comparison ended at the visual level.The moe duo of Tomoe and Miyabi seemed to only exist to create a harem. I was hoping their character designs were going to be used in a more clever way. It\'s honestly fine to use tropes and cliches as long as the creators are self aware of this and can poke fun at themselves for it. Use them ironically, try not to have them take themselves seriously, or at least have some sort of intelligent humor behind their incorporation. Saekano, Seitokai Yakuindomo, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, No Game No Life, Outbreak Company, and various others are good examples of this tactic.Brains and Brawn never really do anything important. They don\'t receive any character development and just seem to be there.3.) The battle scenes begin to feel repetitive as all of the characters are inexplicably unkillable and the same villain is reused throughout the entire show.No matter how much a character is injured, they just magically survive for no reason. There\'s nothing more annoying than when a show overplays the near death experience. I was even annoyed with how Aldnoah.Zero ended season 1 with what appeared to be 4 character deaths just to have every single one of them be just fine in season 2. But unlike Aldnoah.Zero, Absolute Duo seems to do this every single episode, does not retain any of the injuries as permanent, and makes no effort to explain away the damage taken by the characters. The biggest problem with this is that because no one ever dies, the same villain is fought over and over again in the show. At least if they actually fully defeated the villain there would be some sort of forced plot development by having new opponents appear.4.) Not much plot development.Honestly the story seems propped up by the introduction of new characters and occasional scene changes. At the end of the show no one gets revenge, there is no romantic progression, the power feud between organizations isn\'t settled, ""Absolute Duo"" is never really achieved or explained, the loli goth principal never unveils the master plan, no one graduates, and we still have no idea why the government is even bothering to train exceeds. The story has an interesting setting but lacks any sort of purpose.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall this show seemed like someone had a good idea for a setting and character cast but then never bothered to develop it at all. It just seems like someone wrote an awesome proposal for a series and then sold it off to be turned into filler.Another big reason this anime may feel so disappointing to me is that all of its PROS are presented right at the start with all of the CONS showing up one after another until the end of the show. There are other shows with just as many PROS and CONS but because they are mixed together and go back and forth, the viewers tend to feel more like they are enduring the CONS to continue experiencing the PROS. Absolute Duo\'s PROS are all front loaded though so it\'s all downhill after you get hooked at the beginning. That all seemed fairly interesting.5.)

In fact I rather liked them. The beginning captivated my interest a little as well. Sure, it was your kind of typical school setting with magical powers and such (*ahem* angel beats *ahem*), but I thought I could get over it. The twist making students fight each other got me too, admittedly. I didn't think it would be too bad.Wrong.Beyond episode 2, everything just spirals into a pitfall. There was close to 0 character development, and the existing bit was overly-cliched. WAY over-cliched. And story? Don't get me started on story....Random plot jumps, overly-used tropes, there were holes just everywhere. You could feel the harem. The absolutely useless harem. Don't get me wrong, I think there are some good harem animes out there and it doesn't get a lot of credit. But the one in this show served no purpose and just tried to make the main character look better.So an overall judgement is this: if you can get past the first 4 episodes without feeling too many issues, or you're just into harem and action scenes rather than story, feel free to watch. Otherwise, not reccomended. Random plot jumps, overly-used tropes, there were holes just everywhere. You could feel the harem. The absolutely useless harem.

The only thing i DIDN\'T like was the lack of character development, it was the typical main guy getting his ass kicked everysingle time then out of nowhere. Beats the badguy in one hit. Rinse and repeat basically. As for the story. I couldn\'t really say there was much of one since it literally never followed anything on their pasts or what they actually had to do, it showed flashbacks but either than that nothing throughout the whole story involving anything about their pasts or any ""Special"" characters. So if you\'re all about the story, i can\'t recommend...this but if you\'re in it for the harem then go ahead there\'s plenty. this but if you\'re in it for the harem then go ahead there\'s plenty.', ""Dropped this after episode 3.  It hit a bunch of my deal breakers:1) latex-like uniforms that implausibly conform to boobs.2) MC is a bland Nice Guy3) Eyes drawn over hair.It's rather average as an anime.  It's not that bad, it's not that good, but with the list above, I dropped it. "", ""This anime embodies what the non-anime watchers think anime is: cute girls, bunny-girls, harem, basic mc, and tons of fan service...Save your time and don't watch this.I first saw a picture of the female lead and I thought she was charming with her white-haired, pink-eyes, and overpowered abilities. Thus, I decided to give this anime a watch. I must say, the idea of the anime isn't terrible. I do enjoy watching an overpowered pair dominating their universe together but, there is too much fan service to take the show seriously and it knows. There was world-building somewhere, but it's barely relevant lol. Plus, it's not...like the fighting scenes make up for it either. The protagonist is one of those basic bois who keeps getting into weird sexual moments. like the fighting scenes make up for it either. The protagonist is one of those basic bois who keeps getting into weird sexual moments."", 'To be honest, almost everything about Absolute Duo has already been said.But still I want to write my opinion, because I think some of the bad reviews are at least a little unfair.Yes, Absolute Duo uses many clichés.The story is quite generic, a Highschool harem fighting show.Tooru is the typical male MC that was too weak earlier, and now wants to become stronger to be able to protect everybody.And the personalities of the harem cast are as well quite generic.But there were a few things that made me like Absolute Duo more than my first impression.The most interesting thing for me was the fact that...the female lead was not a Tsundere, but the more dandere and innocent Julie.So, the interactions and dynamics between the main characters were quite different from what we usually see.Everytime she said ""Ja"" or ""Nej"" (Swedish for Yes and No) with her quiet voice, it was just soo cute.Tomoe, a tsundere-like character who is quite fixated on morality, often misinterprets situations between Tooru and Julie and acts the tsundere way, but she even honestly apologises after her misconceptions are cleared up.Not to forget Tatsuno, or Barbarian-kun, a very tall and muscular student who never speaks a word for the entire show, but grunts like HUMM, MHMMM or stuff like that, accompanied by some bodybuilding poses instead.And last but not least Deathneyland, a famous amusement park.Yes there is some ecchi and fan service, most of it is standard, but some is even cute and sweet.So I think Absolute Duo has some aspects to lift it above the vast amount of mediocre and boring standard shows.It entertained me quite well, although it is certainly far from being outstanding. the female lead was not a Tsundere, but the more dandere and innocent Julie.So, the interactions and dynamics between the main characters were quite different from what we usually see.Everytime she said ""Ja"" or ""Nej"" (Swedish for Yes and No) with her quiet voice, it was just soo cute.Tomoe, a tsundere-like character who is quite fixated on morality, often misinterprets situations between Tooru and Julie and acts the tsundere way, but she even honestly apologises after her misconceptions are cleared up.Not to forget Tatsuno, or Barbarian-kun, a very tall and muscular student who never speaks a word for the entire show, but grunts like HUMM, MHMMM or stuff like that, accompanied by some bodybuilding poses instead.And last but not least Deathneyland, a famous amusement park.Yes there is some ecchi and fan service, most of it is standard, but some is even cute and sweet.So I think Absolute Duo has some aspects to lift it above the vast amount of mediocre and boring standard shows.It entertained me quite well, although it is certainly far from being outstanding.', '((Reviewer\'s Note: This review contains mild spoilers, some profanity, and a Donald Trump reference guaranteed to be dated in about six months. Reader discretion is advised.))You know, there comes a point in one\'s anime hobby where the viewer has to roll their chair back, adjust their glasses or rub their eyes, and wonder exactly what in the hell would possess them to give certain shows any more than a second glance. For me, it was this one.Absolute Duo might just be the single worst anime I\'ve ever seen. In fact, I\'m almost certain that it is. I\'ve never beheld something that is not only completely...devoid of the slightest trace of originality, but takes its generic ideas and smashes them together into an incoherent Frankenstein rollercoaster of awe-inspiring incompetence. It actually kinda scares me that this got picked up to be adapted. Granted, 8bit has been known to take chances on, shall I say, less-established (read: garbage) source material, but the lack of quality in this just makes me wonder exactly what would possess anyone to think the source material was any good, either, and how it managed to get a high-enough profile that an anime studio felt comfortable putting manhours and their name on adapting it.I guess I can start with the story. Tor Kokonoe is our main protagonist. He is a completely average looking, inoffensive dude who is off to this bizarre battle school to learn to fight after a tragedy in his past left him feeling unable to protect anything. Immediately, this should be setting off alarm bells. This sounds like every light novel adaptation in the last five years, and with good reason: this show is the distillation of every light novel trope, cliche, and standard that has been floating in the anime toilet bowl since Sword Art Online rose to prominence in 2012. Nonetheless, I will continue.Tor meets Julie, who ends up becoming his ""Duo"", a partner to eat, sleep, and live with throughout his time at Battle Harem School. What\'s a Duo? Well, besides just an arbitrary pairing, exactly what a Duo is is never really defined by much of anyone. The blackhaired loli school principal implies that the whole point of the school is to find a pairing capable of attaining ""Absolute Duo"", but whatever that means, and why she\'s after it, is left to the viewer\'s imagination.And thus we get to the next big sticking point I have with LN adaptations in this decade: they are always woefully incomplete, and that has something to do with the way that light novels are written nowadays. See, nowadays any hack writer can attach themselves to a decent character design artist and start his own light novel, or at least a web novel that may eventually find itself published in the light novel format. As long as there are moe girls to be found within the pages (and crucially on the front cover!), it will likely sell, regardless of the quality of the actual writing. And as long as these light novels are continuing to produce an income for their writer, there is no incentive for there to ever be a proper ending.As for why I bring this up, well, Absolute Duo is one of the most incomplete adaptations I\'ve ever seen. The 12 episodes produce roughly a dozen plot holes big enough to drive a bus through, and scarce in the way of explaining or elaborating on the very concept they named the show after. What the hell is an Absolute Duo in the context of the show? Why do Julie and Tor have all sorts of unexplained powers that constantly take their enemies by surprise?The concepts that propel the show\'s copious battle scenes are pretty stock: every student at Harem Battle High has a ""Blaze"", a weapon materialized from their soul or some such that somehow can\'t actually be used to hurt people (unless, of course, you want it to, or something). Instead it inflicts non-lethal wounds that eventually render the enemy unconscious, quite convenient for when you wanna hype up your heroes without actually having any meaningful stakes in the battle. After all, killing is wrong! It defies reason how hard it is to care at all about battles where each blow means nothing, where no one is in danger of being maimed or killed, where the drama is completely subverted in favor of unpleasant fanservice and incompetent, unfunny romantic comedy.And yeah, there\'s harem shenanigans in this show. The best harems, like the girls in Nisekoi and Monogatari, give clear and understandable reasons why each girl likes the harem protagonist. Usually these reasons are tied to his personality, sometimes its his looks, sometimes its his skill and confidence, sometimes its a promise he made them when they were kids. Hell, sometimes its just because he happens to be the only piece of man meat within 10 kilometers! Tor, on the other hand, is just a charmless puppet, a soulless, emotionally bereft clod who couldn\'t muster up the testosterone to hold a girl\'s hand, much less deal with the unyielding overt flirtations of the girls at Harem Battle High. The four main girls in the show are all just tripping over his dick to an uncomfortably fanatic degree despite the fact that he acts and looks like he has no interest in the opposite sex whatsoever. He\'s not particularly competent in battle, or even that attractive. He\'s a self-insert fantasy, the kind light novel hacks have been flogging onto the willing masses in droves, and he\'s about as transparent as you can get.That said, Tor is a perfect match for the girls of Absolute Duo, because they too are bereft of anything resembling a character. Julie, our lead girl, is yet another albino deadpan loli. Now, deadpan lolis can make for great characters: Shiro of No Game, No Life is one of if not my very favorite lolita character, and she\'s as deadpan and socially inept as it gets. That said, Julie just comes across as creepy and eerily infantilized. She\'s been through some trauma, sure, I get that that can stunt a person\'s development and hinder their idea of boundaries, but Julie takes it to an insulting and uncomfortable extreme. She behaves like an infant, incapable of doing anything for herself except when danger is imminent, constantly reliant on Tor. It transcends the cuteness factor of her being a helpless girl and starts to trip into creepy land when she starts invading his bedspace in the nude in later episodes.Then we have Julie\'s opposite number, the outsider looking in, Lilith Bristol. Lilith is perhaps the closest we get to a character with something resembling a personality instead of a list of traits stapled to a character design. She\'s resourceful, intelligent, feisty, and is easily the strongest student that doesn\'t rely on plot armor or a superpowered darkside. I won\'t go so far as to say she\'s a well-written character, but she\'s the closest the show comes to producing anything of substance, even if her three episode arc in the middle of the show was rather poor. Hell, ""rather poor"" is actually doing pretty well as far as the rest of this travesty goes.The other two girls, Tomoe Tachibana and Miyabi Hotaka, are a Duo themselves, which leads to some obligatory yuri-baiting as they shower together, change together, and embrace each other buck-naked in one of the EDs. Absolute Duo knows how to pander to the least common otaku denominator, and it does so with great pleasure and glee. However, these two are also interested in Tor\'s cock-a-no-way, and thus the harem is completed. Oh, joy. Their personalities are bizarre, like the author was grasping at straws trying to find some original gimmick, and then just settled on:--Tomoe being really angry at the slightest hint of ungentlemanly conduct from Tor and then apologizing profusely when it\'s a misunderstanding every fucking time; and--Miyabi being useless but then turning evil near the show\'s climax so they can show her in bondage power armor. Oh, and F-cups. Because those are necessary.Have I given you a glimpse at just how bad this is? I could go on, but I think I\'ve already spent about a thousand words too many eviscerating this turkey. Nonetheless, there is more to cover, but I\'ll try to be brief from this point on.The art in this show is nothing to really write home about. There are some decent stills, and admittedly the OP is very poppy, high-energy stuff. The first ED is also kinda artsy and came very close to striking a chord with me with its visuals highlighting Julie\'s loneliness and how arriving at Battle Harem High is her first step into overcoming her solitude and obligatory tragic backstory. The animation is dreadful. 8bit have shown that they know not what they do in this department, with an over-reliance on terrible 12 frame-per-second CG effects. The color scheme is all over the place with no real grounding in a fixed aesthetic style. It\'s just generic. It looks like the basest, most simple visualization of anime.The sound design is functional but doesn\'t strive for anything more. The voice actors in the original Japanese audio do the best they can with the script they\'ve been given. If you look at their filmography you can tell that they\'re all relative newcomers to the industry looking to make a big break, with the exception of Tor\'s voice actor. I don\'t know if I should praise or condemn Yoshitsugu Matsuoka\'s performance, because he manages to make Tor sound like the gormless loser he really is. This man is the voice of Soma Yukihira and Sora Nai. He should be lending gravitas to the performance, but it\'s obvious that he didn\'t care any more than the director of this fecal festival did.I think that about exhausts all I have to say about this show. This has quickly become the longest, most rambling review I\'ve ever posted on this site, but this is what this show did to me. It\'s not just bad, but it\'s the kind of bad that is all too pervasive in anime today, the ever-present idea that a show shouldn\'t aim to actually say or do anything meaningful in the medium, the pervasive notion that you can just pander really hard to the worst demons in an otaku\'s nature and glean some quick bucks out of it. It\'s sickening, and it\'s not worth your time. I hope you\'ll do yourself a favor and not only stay away from Absolute Duo, but make a point to avoid anything that looks like the same kind of show. We can make anime great again, but it starts with building a wall between our wallets and this ocean of half-baked light novel mush.Until next time, remember that hugs can cure anything, including post-traumatic stress disorder and violent schizophrenic hallucinations. devoid of the slightest trace of originality, but takes its generic ideas and smashes them together into an incoherent Frankenstein rollercoaster of awe-inspiring incompetence.

I won\'t go so far as to say she\'s a well-written character, but she\'s the closest the show comes to producing anything of substance, even if her three episode arc in the middle of the show was rather poor. Hell, ""rather poor"" is actually doing pretty well as far as the rest of this travesty goes.The other two girls, Tomoe Tachibana and Miyabi Hotaka, are a Duo themselves, which leads to some obligatory yuri-baiting as they shower together, change together, and embrace each other buck-naked in one of the EDs. Absolute Duo knows how to pander to the least common otaku denominator, and it does so with great pleasure and glee. However, these two are also interested in Tor\'s cock-a-no-way, and thus the harem is completed. Oh, joy. Their personalities are bizarre, like the author was grasping at straws trying to find some original gimmick, and then just settled on:--Tomoe being really angry at the slightest hint of ungentlemanly conduct from Tor and then apologizing profusely when it\'s a misunderstanding every fucking time; and--Miyabi being useless but then turning evil near the show\'s climax so they can show her in bondage power armor. Oh, and F-cups. Because those are necessary.Have I given you a glimpse at just how bad this is? I could go on, but I think I\'ve already spent about a thousand words too many eviscerating this turkey. Nonetheless, there is more to cover, but I\'ll try to be brief from this point on.The art in this show is nothing to really write home about. There are some decent stills, and admittedly the OP is very poppy, high-energy stuff. The first ED is also kinda artsy and came very close to striking a chord with me with its visuals highlighting Julie\'s loneliness and how arriving at Battle Harem High is her first step into overcoming her solitude and obligatory tragic backstory. The animation is dreadful. 8bit have shown that they know not what they do in this department, with an over-reliance on terrible 12 frame-per-second CG effects. The color scheme is all over the place with no real grounding in a fixed aesthetic style. It\'s just generic. It looks like the basest, most simple visualization of anime.The sound design is functional but doesn\'t strive for anything more. The voice actors in the original Japanese audio do the best they can with the script they\'ve been given. If you look at their filmography you can tell that they\'re all relative newcomers to the industry looking to make a big break, with the exception of Tor\'s voice actor. I don\'t know if I should praise or condemn Yoshitsugu Matsuoka\'s performance, because he manages to make Tor sound like the gormless loser he really is. This man is the voice of Soma Yukihira and Sora Nai. He should be lending gravitas to the performance, but it\'s obvious that he didn\'t care any more than the director of this fecal festival did.I think that about exhausts all I have to say about this show. This has quickly become the longest, most rambling review I\'ve ever posted on this site, but this is what this show did to me. It\'s not just bad, but it\'s the kind of bad that is all too pervasive in anime today, the ever-present idea that a show shouldn\'t aim to actually say or do anything meaningful in the medium, the pervasive notion that you can just pander really hard to the worst demons in an otaku\'s nature and glean some quick bucks out of it. It\'s sickening, and it\'s not worth your time. I hope you\'ll do yourself a favor and not only stay away from Absolute Duo, but make a point to avoid anything that looks like the same kind of show. We can make anime great again, but it starts with building a wall between our wallets and this ocean of half-baked light novel mush.Until next time, remember that hugs can cure anything, including post-traumatic stress disorder and violent schizophrenic hallucinations.', ""Truly outstanding, a completely new level for anime storytelling.Story: 10/10The plot is truly on a completely new level from any other anime I've seen. All the exposition dumps and deep mechanics never let me down even once, once I saw the truly incredible and unique setting and wonderfully original powers, I was sold.Art: 10/10Once I was done with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I thought that I had reached the peak of art and design in anime, but this simply blew me out of the water! Never have I ever seen such well designed and well-crafted characters anywhere, truly outstanding. I must also complement the very...extensive use of CGI, it fits wonderfully.Sound: 10/10The audio was really something different from what I was expecting, exotic and beautiful. I must condone the very humble use of royalty-free sound effects, shedding light on how well the animation studio distributes their valuable time and outstanding talent. As if this wasn't enough the ever persistent screams of embarrassment and agony will surely leave you speechless.Characters: 10/10The characters were beautifully presented. Every person in this show had overwhelmingly deep and well thought-out personalities and differences. They really managed to make them blossom and develop to new heights, especially during the beach episodes, I would never rate the characters in this show anywhere under a ten.Enjoyment: 10/10I could never have predicted how incredibly invested I got, how delicately overjoyed I felt. Countless times I wanted to scream out of excitement or weep out of pure heartbreaking sorrow at the tragic moments where girls bikinis suddenly fly off over a cliff. I must say I'm speechless, never once have I felt so satisfied!Overall: 4/10But for real though..The show was pretty mediocre. It has very bland and shallow characters, very cliché setting and plot, an intense focus on fan service and some persistent annoyances (certain characters or plot devices). If your goal is to watch anime to laugh at it, not for it's actual humor but at its obvious lack of quality, then go ahead, that's what I did and I enjoyed it. If you want to watch it seriously, then maybe consider watching the 4000+ anime rated higher first. ~ extensive use of CGI, it fits wonderfully.Sound: 10/10The audio was really something different from what I was expecting, exotic and beautiful.

The school uses a duo system where two people must work...together and one day maybe achieve ""Absolute Duo"" . In the grand scheme of things All stundents must fight eachother and the victors get to stay in the school. Thor is excepted in to the school and gets as his duo the lovely Julie. These two allong with a few two other groups of duo\'s are the main cast and shall find themselves in a whole lot of trouble .( I tried not to give spoilers :p)Art:The art is fine I really don\'t mind it 8-bit studio did they\'re best(I had never heard of them until now so i can\'t really compare)Sound:The sound is pretty good it might not be as good as lets say Highschool DxD but its pretty good by itself. The OP was pretty catchy not gonna lie so were the first and second EDThe third ED I didn\'t really enjoy as much so yeah.Also i have the feeling the soundtrack isn\'t really original can\'t really tell but I know that I had heard some of the OSTs before.Characters :Our main characters are Thor and Julie these two are a duo and their personalities do fit eachother I geuss with a problem of Julie being Bland most of the time yet kindof interestingAnd Thor who is out for revenge and Power but in the end realizes that he doesn\'t want that afterall but rather to protect the ones he cares about. Also Thor is VERY Dense and acts like your generic lightnovel character that reacts really weird when a girl sleeps next to him or really with any girl most of the time .Then we have our second Duo Miyabi and Tomoe which I find a bit more interesting than Thor and Julie . Miyabi starts of interesting but as she falls in love with Thor she gets less ineteresting up until a point where she is just your standard Notice me Senpai character . Tomoe is a whole lot more interesting yet she also falls in love with Thor becoming a bit more Tsundere.Then we have our final Duo Tora and Tatsu which I find the most interesting yet these two don\'t do much which is very dissapointing since i really liked Tora. Tora is a friend of Thor and wanted to be his duo partner but as we all know Thor chose Julie. About Tatsu yeah theirs not much going on there.After this we have Lilith she is from the UK and is Royalty and also falls in love with ThorThe characters don\'t look that original either.Irinia looks like IF from Hyperdimension NeptuniaLilith looks like Chitoge from NisekoiSarah( Liliths maid/butler) looks like Tsugumi also from NisekoiAndKei looks like Kiba from Highschool DxDI don\'t know if their supposed to be references or their just lazy designs..Final verdict :This is your standard Ecchi/Harem/Action series that really doesn\'t bring anything new to the table.Now with that out of the way I\'d like to give my rating based off of Story, Sound, Characters, Animation and My personal enjoymentStory: 5Sound: 7Characters: 6 (too many clichés)Animation: 7Enjoyment: 6Overall : 6.3If you liked this try Highschool DxDAnd with this I thank you and Farewell ! together and one day maybe achieve ""Absolute Duo"" .

Usually, especially female leads, tend to be powerful at the start, yet once the shit hits the fan, they are about as useful as a hedgehog in a condom factory. Yet this time around the power dynamic is closer between the main couple, and...that is refreshing for a show like this.The story isn’t the deepest, but it honestly doesn’t need to. A basic story keeps the show more light, and makes the show more enjoyable. It’s easy to follow along without having to invest too much. This is a good hangover show, or something light to watch just for the sake of entertainment without having to use too much brainpower to keep up.The cast of characters are perfectly suited for the story being told, from main to supporting cast and even the villains. They all have an easy design, making them easy to recognize at a glance.There is lots of fanservice, but it never goes overboard. There tends to be a lot of boob groping and such alike as soon as the Ecchi tag is attached to an anime. But this time around it’s more the girls doing the groping, measuring boob sizes with each other rather than constant male lead stumbling and accidentally groping. It’s more throughout in this anime compared to similar shows.The girls in the show are cute as heck, and most of them have a chance to shine at least once or twice within the show. At least the main and supporting cast of girls actually have something to do with the story, making them a part of a whole, rather than just being there for the sake of fanservice or being a cute girl to look at.The combat in the show is well done, for the most part the action is done well. The animation is fluid, and it all feels like some thought has been put into the choreography, making the combat scenes feel engaging and entertaining. With power fantasy anime too many random things tend to happen in combat, but this isn’t too bad in this show.There are odd plot holes here and there (both storywise and with the combat), but they are not big enough that they ruin your enjoyment. It’s the odd secondary event that might have been more detailed in the source material but could have easily been left out as it didn’t have any impact on the main story. There are also a couple of minor things missing towards the end, things that aren’t explained but doesn’t matter too much the overarching story.The power system is based on the character's motivation, feelings and determination, basically Soul Power. One character wanting to protect others due to past experiences getting a shield. Another one wanting revenge for the loss of their parents, the sometimes reckless personality due to this caused her to dual wield swords, a very aggressive and in-your-face weapon fitting the personality. One being shy and lacking confidence but wanting to be stronger ending up having a lance weapon, powerful weapons yet allowing for some distance to the target. Another one being somewhat arrogant and vain ends up with a rifle, allowing her to stay at a distance, keeping blood, sweat and gore of combat off her clothing staying clean and proper.The weapons the cast of characters are wielding fits their personality, a very simple premise. But it makes things more interesting than just having a sword wielder for the sake of having a sword wielder. None of the weapons are unique for power fantasy, but adding this extra layer to it, makes it more interesting and well thought out.In conclusion, I gave this anime a 7 of 10.Not in any way the best anime I’ve seen, but way better than the normal high school power fantasy trash out there. Good story, nice characters, cute girls, okay amount of fanservice without going overboard. For a hangover show or a “it’s friday night and I’m bored”, this is a good option. It won't enrich your life, but you won’t feel like you’ve wasted some hours of your life either. that is refreshing for a show like this.The story isn’t the deepest, but it honestly doesn’t need to.

At the school he meets very many beautiful young women who all want to become romantically involved with him.

Who is he going to make blush next? Will there be some misunderstanding that is really embarrassing for our beloved protagonist? Will he accidentally grope...someone maybe? Truly remarkable storytelling. Easy ten out of ten.Art. 10/10The 2D animation is impeccable, no other anime stands a chance. Everything is drawn with such care and fidelity.

The 3D models are practically lifelike, I'd even say the uncanny valley has officially been crossed.Sound. 10/10Every single note really resonated with me. This show deserves every single Grammy from this day forward. I don't really have much more to say, listen to it yourself and you will see. You'll especially like that electric guitar that they play for the bad guy over, and over again.Character. 10/10Every character is 8 dimensional, they are literally perfect. They feel like real people with real motivations and I might have even thought they were unless I had been told that they weren't. I've heard people say that the characters can be summed up to a single trait but this is absolutely not the case. The characters are extremely multifaceted and they are absolute perfection, period.Enjoyment. 10/10If you want a good time, this is the anime to watch. It's truly a roller coaster of emotions and it will have you gripped from beginning to end. It has made me laugh as well as cry on several occasions.

It was chosen for me by my poll on Google +. I watched it for my Daily Anime Ratings Collection.We've all seen this kind of anime before. It's a harem anime. With a high school setting and weapons made of spirit. Ya know it's been done before. Like a lot. But ya want to now what makes this anime worth watching. The Relationships with the characters. It's what defines the series itself.Why do the characters push themselves to become better? Their Relationships.Why does the Antogonist push forward with his bitterness? His Lost Relationships.And what makes this show stand out?...Yeah I think you got it.IF you have seen this show before I'd love it if you checked out my Discussion and Review for the series on my Youtube channel Thom Talk Stuff.https://youtu.be/gcdeFebcGTE Yeah I think you got it.IF you have seen this show before I'd love it if you checked out my Discussion and Review for the series on my Youtube channel Thom Talk Stuff.https://youtu.be/gcdeFebcGTE"", ""(Dubbed version)Story (4/10):The story began with great potential, it had glimpses of back story for the main characters, and what seemed like the beginning of a great plot. However it veered away from this and absolute duo became the stereotypical predictable harem/ecchi anime which lacked a good plot and good ending.Art (6/10):Not much to say here, the art itself was okay, nothing exceptional but it wasn't bad....Sound (5/10):Sound is basically the same story as the art, it was okay, nothing exceptional but it wasn't bad. Absolute Duo had 1 opening song and 3 different songs for the ending.Character (4/10):At the beginning each character especially the MC's had great potential to be interesting characters with hidden secrets and different pasts, which I assumed would be explored as the story and plot developed but this was not the case (it did explore to a certain degree) as the story itself was rushed there wasn't really enough time for each character to develop, so by the end of the last episode each character was the same as they were when they first appeared with just more power.Specific genre overview:As an ecchi/harem anime it wasn't anything special it was just the standard.As and action anime it did okay it had its fair share of fight scenes, (with good fluidity) and power developments.As a supernatural anime I thought it did quite poorly, mainly because of the story however... I say this because I think if the story had more chance to develop it could of been quite interesting, the concept behind the abilities of the characters (blazes) but as the story fell short so did the supernatural element of the anime.Enjoyment (6/10):As my expectations were high going into this anime, I was quite disappointed when I was watching it, however it wasn't completely terrible, and it had some redeeming qualities, that kept me watching till then end.Overall (5/10):I had high hopes going into the anime so when it fell short it fell really short of my expectations. If your going to watch this anime I would lower your initial expectations, as the anime wasn't unbearable, but I would only watch this anime as pass time if there was nothing else you have to watch or other options. Sound (5/10):Sound is basically the same story as the art, it was okay, nothing exceptional but it wasn't bad. Absolute Duo had 1 opening song and 3 different songs for the ending.Character (4/10):At the beginning each character especially the MC's had great potential to be interesting characters with hidden secrets and different pasts, which I assumed would be explored as the story and plot developed but this was not the case (it did explore to a certain degree) as the story itself was rushed there wasn't really enough time for each character to develop, so by the end of the last episode each character was the same as they were when they first appeared with just more power.Specific genre overview:As an ecchi/harem anime it wasn't anything special it was just the standard.As and action anime it did okay it had its fair share of fight scenes, (with good fluidity) and power developments.As a supernatural anime I thought it did quite poorly, mainly because of the story however... I say this because I think if the story had more chance to develop it could of been quite interesting, the concept behind the abilities of the characters (blazes) but as the story fell short so did the supernatural element of the anime.Enjoyment (6/10):As my expectations were high going into this anime, I was quite disappointed when I was watching it, however it wasn't completely terrible, and it had some redeeming qualities, that kept me watching till then end.Overall (5/10):I had high hopes going into the anime so when it fell short it fell really short of my expectations. If your going to watch this anime I would lower your initial expectations, as the anime wasn't unbearable, but I would only watch this anime as pass time if there was nothing else you have to watch or other options."", 'Let me start off with that I do reviews more based on my enjoyment of the show and how much I got into it and things of that nature opposed to very technical aspects though i\'ll get into that a bit as well.I knew nothing about Duo other than about a two sentence description going in. Honestly the story is a bit weak. The general idea is pretty good but there alot of sort of oddness and things that don\'t get touched on. In other words some plot holes. I wasn\'t really in Duo for the story though.The place where Duo shines I think are...the charries. As with alot of anime especially in this genre today I think are alot more character powered and centered than plot/story. Which is fine by me for the most part. There is nothing really special about any of them in terms of being something new or different. They can all fit different tropes but they are very likable and done well for the most part especially the female mc Julie. The male mc however is probably in my opinion the dullest/boring of the cast. The sound and music is pretty good and as with most new anime the art is good as well and my preferred style.There isn\'t a whole lot to say about this anime in terms of story and things of that nature it\'s what I would call just one of those guilt pleasure anime. Not a very good plot/story and nothing really special about it but still enjoyable. However one thing I liked that you don\'t see with alot of anime of this type was the little thing they threw in of having the male and female mcs be roomed together at the school for the entire anime. I have thought about this many times before in anime and wondered why they don\'t take advantage of the chances to do this considering how many more options and choices it gives them for different scenes and relationship building among other things. Seems every time the few times i\'ve seen that they do it it\'s more the ""angry raging or oh you perv *slap*"" type girls and it\'s not really taken serious and is more there just to be a joke and cause corny humor. It was nice to see the male and female mcs be roomed the whole show and it be done more normal and less comedic. You see male and female charries and mcs roomed together alot in normal rooms or houses living together but not roomed alone together in a school/academy setting.Other than this not much to say really. If your looking for a deep intellectual masterpiece or great story then skip Duo. If your looking for a fun show with good charries,art,sound then give it a try. Overall I give it a 7 and probably should even be lower but I give it an 8 for enjoyment and that\'s what I like to go by :p. the charries.

I would classify this as an \'Ecchi-Harem\'...anime, so I won\'t be judging it so hard in the story. However, I\'ll judge it by how interesting it is, how great character are and how beautiful it\'s art style-music is.Story: [2 Plain Boring]I\'ll summarize all the ""story"" in one sentence: \'Middle-schoolers got some guns attached to their soul, so bad people want them in the army...\' Maybe I say too much, more than the anime actually does. But it is not only simple and cliché as it could be, it is also REALLY boring and so bad implemented in the anime that it drags you out. The idea of having a sword that represented your soul started as cool. Then the main character came with a shield, running all that could seem interesting there making the main character ""special"" and blah, blah, blah... And then a girl with a rifle. Why? Because f*ck the story, right?Characters: [2 Bad Cliché]Main character? Boring as it could be in a harem anime (Also, as a plus, I never fully understood his name: he was supposed to be named after Thor, a Nordic God, but ended being called Toor or Tooru). Main girl in the anime? Typical white-haired loli kuudere... It\'s okay if you like that type of girls, but this one is nothing that you haven\'t seen before, so you are not missing a big thing. Oppai girl? Clumsy and plain, and even her boobs are too big to enjoy. Her friend? Okay, she was nice, I guess. I have to admit that the few times I laughed while watching this was because of her. His friends? Who were them!? I couldn\'t feel something like \'Oh, they must be important to the story\' or \'They must be really good friends!\'. Blond girl? Useful for an Anime MLG Recompilation, I guess...Aesthetics: [6 Simple but Nice]Don\'t get too much excited about it, this is a necessary thing in Ecchi anime: it HAS to look nice. Still, this one manages to do it a bit better. One of the few things that can be said about the anime is that it looks nice. When it needed to look cute, it sure did with big rounded cheeks and bright colors. When it needed to look serious, maybe the colors drag a bit out, but the combination of red and violet sometimes did it’s job and make the mood feel a bit more \'in the story\'. Still, it\'s an obligation for an Ecchi-Harem series to look this way, so don\'t get too proud. And then the animation was good... until they decided to do fighting scenes, and that it\'s supposed to be the main part of the anime. They were... not so interesting to look at, and by that I mean really boring to look at.Music: [7 Enjoyable the Music]Finally something that was good! I loved the music in this anime, both the openings and endings. The opening, ""Absolute Soul"" was nothing very impressive by the looks, but it did well his job: it showed you the characters, the way they are and their relation with each other, and was the best animated part of the whole anime. I liked this OP so much that I sang the intro at the beginning of each episode, and I even have it in my anime songs folder. Then, the endings ""BelivexBelive"" and ""Apple Tea no Aji"" are also great, they show you a bit more of the two main girls in the harem and have cool songs and nice direction. The \'worst\' song in the anime was the ED ""2/2"", and even though, it was a nice song to listen and okay to watch.Enjoyment:  [3 Exciting as Grass]When the story appeared, it was really slow. When they tried to show character feelings, they were plain and cliché. When they did some actions scenes, the animation make them look stupid and boring. When they show the main villain, he was also boring. When they show the director, boring. But we are not here for story, right? This is just an Ecchi-Fanservise-Harem anime, so the main reason you would watch this anime is because you want to see some boobs, some buts, nice animations, OP characters and funny jokes so you could have a good time, but even there it fails. Why? Because the boring-as-hell story is there, blocking most of the reasons you could have to watch this show.[Personal Opinion]If you made it this far in this review, I want to thanks you your taking some of your time to read this, it means so much for me! (っ◕‿◕)っ Okay, let’s go back to the anime. When I started watching ‘Absolute Duo’, I was with some friends and we wanted to mess around and watch a nice funny anime with great style and, of course, some fanservice for the gentlemen. We were unlucky enough to find this anime and see that the main girl was a white-haired loli, favorite kind of girl for a friend of mine, so we jumped straight into it. We laughed a lot with its incoherence and bad characters, but had a nice time. After that time, we could find any more time to reunite to watch the whole anime, so I had to end it myself, and then I noticed how bad it was. Still, some nice things about this can be said, especially thanks to the presence of Konomi Suzuki, my personal favorite OP singer, in the main song. So, you want my advice? If you are going to watch this, please do it with some close friend so you all could have at least some laughs at this. anime, so I won\'t be judging it so hard in the story.

A fine example of all the fighting school harem anime cliches. It's not good nor bad, just average, if you are not used to seeing anime you may think it's OK but if you have been watching anime for a long time, at this rate you may be already tired of this mass produced animes with the exact same characters, the exact same plot and the exact same jokes. Only recommended if you are new to anime or you have nothing better to watch... or if you like this kind of stuff (if they keep producing this things it's because there are...people who like them after all). people who like them after all)."", 'I bet you already know about Persona. it must be easier for me to explain what this Blaze thingy if you are well-known about Persona series, whether you know only the game nor the anime series. While Persona is showing you another form of you in another world with vary skills and power for each individual, Absolute Duo is showing your soul in a form of a weapon according to each person individually. The differences, of course, about the form. Persona nicely recreate that person\'s image or shadow into something different that I can\'t tell (it looks so..fantasy), meanwhile Absolute Duo...just takes form of a weapon based on the owner itself, the owner holds an unique weapon based on their personality.I\'ve got myself to give 1st impression for this anime before. I can say I was captivated enough to prioritize downloading this anime newest eps every week, because it was cool as f*ck in the introduction (1st and 2nd eps). Despite it gets its popularity in the start line, Absolute Duo series started to feel kinda off and somehow only made us wait the bombastic event which mostly came at the end after Lilith, a minor character in the main characters circle showed up and made her debut a lot. However since the Lilith debut in their circle, by being side by side with Lilith, one by one their strengths level-up and also can strengthen the bonds of friendship between them. Not too bad for the battle scenes because we can get a lot from it.The characters development was exploring more than before, I thought it is because this Lilith brings the core of problem to the front line for main characters. Her emergence paves the way for us to get bunch of informations of the problem awaits. And of course this problem makes turmoil in their friendship that lead them to make decision maturely (developing). The fact that every characters are often involved in every involving cases makes their development growing up steady. Altho\' Miyabi is being a nuisance to overcome her weaknesses mentally, she also develops up-and-down.[somewhat spoiler] The show is getting its hits on 8th eps. Not only because it was summer training and camp time—including beach and hot springs time—but also the start of God\'s Destruction Corps / Libers action and the Exceed to meet the ""Selection"" among Blaze user.This eps is marked too, because of the change of my perception to Miyabi Hotaka who is so fragile and pessimistic and seems like a bother for me. Her courage to tell out her feelings straight to Tooru and the instant flashback Tooru got at that time are thrilling. Then..suddenly it disappears, the whole new perception after watched 9th eps, Miyabi is the target of Libers association to be special soldier to make Tooru and friends fall off to beat their own friend. and Miyabi itself turns into an annoying being in my sight, because she is so easy to get depressed by her own weakness and she is dancing in enemy\'s hand.From the 10th eps, we are served by more battles, more intense battles which is darker than before but losses its cool. The hidden truth behind all of the problem is not shocking enough and it feels somehow plain than the earlier eps. The meaning of Avenger mentioned about and the truth between the school main purpose and enemy\'s will, in fact its blast just for entertaining. Only to entertain and less meaning there. [For the theme song aspect, guessed I already speech my impression on the previous post, the post of Absolute Duo\'s 1st impression]I\'m sure this show can be more promising later, if it gets its 2nd season by being more complicated in the problems and bluntly tells viewers exactly what\'s going on. By giving clear informations with outstanding way will help to boost the interest for keep rooting for the show. Let\'s vote this show 7 as its already entertain me on my summer break.Pros:The time its (characters) on battle. Their movements are awesome, it\'s beautifully firm looks like so fine martial artsNice visualization, especially some sceneriesCons:Still remains, the exact meaning of ""avenger"", the explanation of scars from Kokonoe and Julie\'s past, and another association that haunted those Blaze.

Is that not enough to convince you? How about adding a few trips to tropical islands and luxurious cruises with a class full of bishoujo classmates? Ok... so there is a catch, you have to be injected with a mysterious serum and agree to train for battles with and against your classmates and teachers. Welcome to the world of Absolute Duo.Once more, we find ourselves with a series where a male protagonist enters a school seeking power, only to be overwhelmed...by a room full of already powerful girls. Absolute Duo feels very similar to oh so many action-centric harems such as Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance and Trinity Seven. The lightly-ecchi show centers around Tooru, a typical harem protagonist with some guts and a lot of spare niceness, who is tormented by a tragedy that he blames on his own weakness. He, as well as many other students, is able to harness the power of his soul through a means called blaze. The school is set up by the loli devil er... chairwoman for achieving ""absolute duo"", something that isn\'t terribly fleshed out in the school.If you\'re into action-based harems know that this is one of the weaker ones. Some annoyances include a protagonist who is often just a meat shield, extremely generic antagonists, and weak character development. Not to say that the show doesn\'t have any redeemable value, but the show and its protagonist have low ratings here for a reason.Animation:The show itself is well animated with vivid, saturated coloring and an overall modern look. Backgrounds are adequately detailed and some effects, such as falling sakura petals, are particularly well done. Character styling is fairly nice overall with a nicely rounded (no pun intended) group of heroines. Emotions are a bit stunted in this show, though perhaps a bit intentional as the main heroine isn\'t very expressive.There is substantial action in this show, ranging from sword battles to ranged projectiles. Expect plenty of blood and some pretty serious wounds. That being said, I think that serum somehow impacts recoveries as well as people seem to recover as fast as the protagonist in Unbreakable Machine Doll does. The action is on par with that found in other action-based harems though CGI is grossly abused. The ecchi is rather on the light side. There are substantial amounts of boing and upskirts but clothing actually stays on mostly and the protagonist isn\'t an overt pervert. A lot of the ecchi material is due to misunderstandings caused by the primary heroine, Julie.Sound:The show starts with an energetic, action-centric light rock piece that fits despite not having much of a central melody. The EDs are much nicer in my opinion with lightly electronic touches and more palatable melodies, on top of being performed by the VAs. The BGM is present with a variety of tunes but not particularly memorable.The primary heroine VAs all haven\'t really had breakout roles, most have just done a lot of supporting roles. Haruka Yamazaki probably gets the standout award though her character by nature has a bit more of a distinguishable personality. Yui Horie makes an appearance, though limited to a supporting role. Overall, not bad but nothing particularly great either.Story:The show follows our protagonist Tooru as he learns to harness his blaze along with his foreigner duo partner, Julie, and their classmate friends. Our protagonist is unusual in that his blaze takes on the physical shape of a shield, rather than an offensive weapon, thus giving ""meat shield"" a whole new meaning. The gang is repeatedly challenged by the school as well as external antagonists who use Crysis-inspired suits rather than harnessing the ""power of the soul"".Absolute Duo has a rather simple plot with very few branches. There are sub arcs that span various episodes and culminate in minor climaxes. Though moderately entertaining, the show suffers from an unambitious, shallow plot and poor explanation of the overall setting and its mechanics. It is apparent that this is a harem first and an action show second. Unfortunately, the harem aspect is likewise weak, as I\'ll get to next.Character:Supposedly, this is one of the simpler harems, with only five-ish candidates vying for the protagonist. The protagonist, obviously dull when it comes to relationships, can barely fend off the girl\'s attempts for his attention. However, the show manages to undermine even this simple harem by forcing the Duo pairing system. Tooru is almost immediately paired with Julie (and apparently is the only cross-gender Duo in the class), and you pretty much can guess how that will affect the rest of the ""candidates."" Don\'t expect much competition from the rest of the crew except for a few instances of horrifically bad plot exploiting a character\'s jealousy.The relationships are very shallow and basically can be summarized by Tooru saving a girl who then joins the bandwagon. Despite their being other insignificant male characters in the show, our protagonist mysteriously gets all the attention. As for actual personalities, don\'t expect much from the show. Lilith is probably the strongest in that regard, and by strong I mean average for a show. Julie is emotionally stunted and is only marginally entertaining when she mispronounces things or accidentally says something that causes misunderstandings. The other girls just aren\'t even worth mentioning. Furthermore, the antagonists are as plain as can be, often spewing out generic nonsense with virtually no background or explanation of motives.Overall, this was the most disappointing aspect of the show. The cookie-cutter heroines lacked development and depth and no one was really relatable.Value:This is a generic action-based harem with a weak plot and even weaker characters and relationships. Absolute Duo is a shining achievement in how wrong a harem can get. The entertainment value is present but greatly diminished by the events in the show, and given how simplistic the plot is there isn\'t much re-watch value. I would absolutely avoid this unless you are a masochist and like watching painfully bad works. by a room full of already powerful girls.

A lot of the ecchi material is due to misunderstandings caused by the primary heroine, Julie.Sound:The show starts with an energetic, action-centric light rock piece that fits despite not having much of a central melody. The EDs are much nicer in my opinion with lightly electronic touches and more palatable melodies, on top of being performed by the VAs. The BGM is present with a variety of tunes but not particularly memorable.The primary heroine VAs all haven\'t really had breakout roles, most have just done a lot of supporting roles. Haruka Yamazaki probably gets the standout award though her character by nature has a bit more of a distinguishable personality. Yui Horie makes an appearance, though limited to a supporting role. Overall, not bad but nothing particularly great either.Story:The show follows our protagonist Tooru as he learns to harness his blaze along with his foreigner duo partner, Julie, and their classmate friends. Our protagonist is unusual in that his blaze takes on the physical shape of a shield, rather than an offensive weapon, thus giving ""meat shield"" a whole new meaning. The gang is repeatedly challenged by the school as well as external antagonists who use Crysis-inspired suits rather than harnessing the ""power of the soul"".Absolute Duo has a rather simple plot with very few branches. There are sub arcs that span various episodes and culminate in minor climaxes. Though moderately entertaining, the show suffers from an unambitious, shallow plot and poor explanation of the overall setting and its mechanics. It is apparent that this is a harem first and an action show second. Unfortunately, the harem aspect is likewise weak, as I\'ll get to next.Character:Supposedly, this is one of the simpler harems, with only five-ish candidates vying for the protagonist. The protagonist, obviously dull when it comes to relationships, can barely fend off the girl\'s attempts for his attention. However, the show manages to undermine even this simple harem by forcing the Duo pairing system. Tooru is almost immediately paired with Julie (and apparently is the only cross-gender Duo in the class), and you pretty much can guess how that will affect the rest of the ""candidates."" Don\'t expect much competition from the rest of the crew except for a few instances of horrifically bad plot exploiting a character\'s jealousy.The relationships are very shallow and basically can be summarized by Tooru saving a girl who then joins the bandwagon. Despite their being other insignificant male characters in the show, our protagonist mysteriously gets all the attention. As for actual personalities, don\'t expect much from the show. Lilith is probably the strongest in that regard, and by strong I mean average for a show. Julie is emotionally stunted and is only marginally entertaining when she mispronounces things or accidentally says something that causes misunderstandings. The other girls just aren\'t even worth mentioning. Furthermore, the antagonists are as plain as can be, often spewing out generic nonsense with virtually no background or explanation of motives.Overall, this was the most disappointing aspect of the show. The cookie-cutter heroines lacked development and depth and no one was really relatable.Value:This is a generic action-based harem with a weak plot and even weaker characters and relationships. Absolute Duo is a shining achievement in how wrong a harem can get. The entertainment value is present but greatly diminished by the events in the show, and given how simplistic the plot is there isn\'t much re-watch value. I would absolutely avoid this unless you are a masochist and like watching painfully bad works.', ""Well guys, I'm not an expert, and this is my first review, but I want to express my opinion.This anime had potential to be a better anime than the final result.The story's development is predictable and some aspects are cliché.There were some interesting characters that saved a little bit the anime.However, like I said before, the story is predictable and if you had already seen animes with a similar story, maybe you enjoyment is going to be smaller....The art and animation, was standart, nothing out of this world, so the animation is nothing new.The music was forgettable (except the Opening that is pretty cool), some pieces are great, but nothing so epic to remember.It could be a better work.It's not perfect, but IMO was enjoyable.

I believe that this anime wouldve been alot better if they focused more on backstory and such, But in the end its a 12 episode anime. and sometimes its not easy to create a backstory for 12 episodes.So i say that this anime is for people...who are casual watchers.Spoiler :Its overly sexualised ;) Enjoy fellow walruses. who are casual watchers.Spoiler :Its overly sexualised ;) Enjoy fellow walruses."", ""Absolute Duo was the anime I watched when I needed something that was funny and serious at the same time.

I personally enjoyed the show, however this show will not appeal to everyone. If you aren't too keen in mild sexual depictions of high school girls that are near naked, then maybe this anime is not for you. It has its funny and serious moments; ups and downs etc... It can be a bit absurd with these special 'Blaze' weapons and the fact that there is really only 1 male protagonist with a bunch of other supporting female characters. It becomes a lot like a harem where quite a lot of girls want to have this guy and it...becomes a love triangle.. or square... If you don't mind sexual depictions of female characters, then this anime might be just for you. The 'Blaze' thing idea might be a bit absurd but the anime picks itself back up with character development. It absolutely nails character development and I don't think that they left any back-stories or any general knowledge of any characters and one character doesn't seem to have an excessive, overpowered skill that would absolutely obliterate everyone else.That being said, unless you like a little fan-service, you probably won't like this anime. becomes a love triangle.. or square...

The action could be better thought, but it wasnt like I was forcing myself to watch it just to finish the anime, if I had seen this while airing, I would possible had found it less enjoyable, but seeing it whenever you want makes some of its faults more easy to tolerate.So it was a fine anime, it is nothing I would really reccomend to people with something to watch, or newcomers to the medium, but if you have some dead time and are bored, you will be way less bored watching the anime.There are alot generic harems outhere, but almost all of them I have enjoyed more than Absolute Duo, and this had hidden potential to reach to the quality of those others (which for themselves isnt such a great one, for starters).It was almost your good-to-watch average show, but it couldnt be more than a pleasant to-watch-and-conclude anime.

Well, I went to public school, so I am going to assume the exam was similar to this anime. The similarities consist of beating the crap out of another student to complete the exam.In Absolute Duo, there is a school called “Koryo Academy High School.” In this school, students have powers called a Blaze. A Blaze seems to be a weapon created by one’s own soul. To get into the school as a student, the group of potential people...had to fight one another until they beat somebody with their Blaze.The main character is “Thor Kokonoe” and he appears to be an average guy. Hopefully, we all know by now that average characters are not so average. “Thor,” other than being named after a Norse god, is considered to be an irregular. His irregularity stems from his Blaze. Every Blaze is supposed to be a weapon, but “Thor” has a shield for a Blaze.It is safe to assume that “Thor’s” fighting style is to use his shield to protect himself, and to punch everyone for his offense. I am also hoping that whenever he punches people that he will charge it like a Kamehameha, but yell “THOR’S HAMMER!”Now, lets talk ecchi. If any person watches the OP, the ecchi light bulb should have lit up. There are six to seven distinguishable characters that should be sticking around to give us our fan service episode. In addition, “Thor” has to live with a female student named “Julie Sigtuna” thanks to wonderful anime-only school rules, or Duo system.I believe this wonderfully scaled simple to ridiculous anime will be a fun one to watch. There is fighting, over the top characters, ecchi, and hints on Absolute Duo being a revenge seeking based plot. I’m a little nervous because I can’t exactly see where the anime is going, but it looks like a fun ride, so I will continue watching Absolute Duo.Other Rating•\tAction 4/5 Fists•\tEcchi - AA had to fight one another until they beat somebody with their Blaze.The main character is “Thor Kokonoe” and he appears to be an average guy.

There is fighting, over the top characters, ecchi, and hints on Absolute Duo being a revenge seeking based plot. I’m a little nervous because I can’t exactly see where the anime is going, but it looks like a fun ride, so I will continue watching Absolute Duo.Other Rating•\tAction 4/5 Fists•\tEcchi - AA', ""To make it more simple I'll break it into sectionsPlot: The plot was interesting although there were a few spots where it was obviously lacking a bit, overall the plot seemed to lead on that there could be a second season (just my assumption).

It was obvious that it was a relatively new anime at first sight.

The reason for this decision was manly how bland it was to me. Again I want to reinstate that this is my opinion and you may not agree.Review:At first the show was real surprise they went away from the cliche of the MC being some huge badass that can take everyone down if they decided to try. But as I continue to watch some of the things the MC does pissed me off. And the fact that the MC can't hold his own in some of the fights irritated me. But eventually everything kinda worked out...and got it's groove back but then we get to know even more about the other side characters and man, have I never disliked side characters than some of these characers. It's not even that I disliked them but they are full of typical cliches that you would think we could get by. Granite this was released in 2012 so some of these ecchi, haremish cliches were awesome but still they didn't feel needed. All in all this was an average harem anime but as an anime itself it felt mediocre. Now after reading my review I want to say one more time this is my opinion so have at it if you wish. and got it's groove back but then we get to know even more about the other side characters and man, have I never disliked side characters than some of these characers.

It is an ecchi but has little to no nudity. It is a fighting anime set in a school setting but it doesn\'t do a single thing that is exceptional... this is your typical guy white nights main loli girl. On top of that add in the ""I want revenge but realize later that it makes me like the enemies so I become merciful"" toss in a deep and ominous underpinning that is never resolved and sprinkle in a bit of harem but not really because MC only loves his Duo partner and...you\'re almost there. Of course you need an ominous council of people whose purpose is never explained, a teacher who seems evil but turns out to be good in the end, a girl who loves MC and has her love go unrequited so she becomes evil, for a minute. I almost forgot new girl to school who is OP as hell but then somehow gets bested by the MC and becomes weak and useless later in the story... guess she didn\'t ""level up with maximum friendship"" like MC and his Duo partner. Last but not least you have the ""love conquers all"" and the ""things go back to normal"" ending. All in all this is painfully average. I will add that the girls are cute, the art is done well and the music is exceptional. The intro credits are one of the best I\'ve seen in an anime, the song and dance number is excellent.Questions you\'ll still have:Wonder who the person MC is trying to get revenge on?

With that said, Tōru is still a typical bland hero.Julie is a foreign girl with a very direct and non-aggressive attitude. Julie's backstory is equally tragic, and her general lack of shyness around Tōru is refreshing. My favorite aspect of Tōru and Julie's relationship is that, despite advances by nearly every female supporting character, Tōru is unwavering in...his oath of partnership (or rather dou-ship) to Julie. Also, unlike most other harems, Tōru and Julie actually need each other in the sense that they are both emotionally damaged characters. Unfortunately, all of this interesting subtext is pushed to the point of almost nonexistence in favor of fanservice, ecchi-ness, and a random bunny costume wearing teacher...Narratively, Absolute Duo is an Absolute mess (see what I did there?). Many episodes are disjointed and full of poor writing and plot holes. Conceptually, the story is more or less the same thing that we have seen time and time again with a high school for teenagers with magic powers.Surprisingly, the action sequences are a highlight of the series. Each character's Blaze offers a unique fighting style, and the action sequences rarely use CGI. A final mention should go to the opening sequence, which is one of the best of the winter season (you can watch it in the full post). The animation, editing, and choreography are stunning.With above average action and surprisingly likable main characters, Absolute Duo could have been great if not plagued by the distracting tropes of the ecchi harem genre.

The story is certainly really generic, being a standard battle school harem rom-com. However, I thought that it was a solid enough implementation. The tone of the school is different from most battle schools, being somewhat edgier...though not too crazy, in that there's a certain level of craziness that should come from being a school dedicated to making high school students fight each other that other shows sort of sidestep but this embraces to a degree. I also really liked the characters in that the personalities were interesting and the relationship setting a good dynamic that lead to a lot of good character interactions. Though ultimately, it only really fleshed out and gave development to a couple of them who got developed solidly enough, but left a lot really mysterious about most of them, of especial note being the protagonist about whom there are a lot of hints about but nothing that really fleshes them out at all, which made the characters a lot harder to get invested in. As for the larger plot itself regarding the school and absolute duo, that too felt that it was greatly being hampered by the sense of mystery. There some level of explanation given for why things are happening, but so much is left mysterious that it isn't clear at all what the overall goals are or where the story is headed in this regard, so while it does feel like the anime encompasses an entire arc, it isn't really clear what the purpose of the arc was or how it advanced things in any meaningful way.In terms of art style I really liked it and what they did with it, but it felt pretty lacking in terms of animation, especially during action. The CG was pretty bad. The OP was really solid in terms of visuals and audio, and all the EDs were amazing in terms of visuals being really pretty, and had good audio. though not too crazy, in that there's a certain level of craziness that should come from being a school dedicated to making high school students fight each other that other shows sort of sidestep but this embraces to a degree.

Too bad the anime didn't do so well. I would have liked another season to at least patch up all the plot holes. The sister killer on Tor. The father killer Julie. The confronting of the sick people in that room that make children fight to the death with grown brainwashed men in tech suits (most messed up part). The weird unexplained psycho killer teacher. I give it a 6/10 for making me feel unsatisfied on many fronts. Also, there was no duo to romance advancement between the two main characters and no kiss. Very disappointing. "", ""The harem and fanservice in this anime is cliche, and personally, I found it cringingly loveable in that respect. I couldn't help but laugh when your typical fanservice scenes came up, made even more classic by a clueless main character.The combat system of the Blazes is actually really interesting, and it's actually quite a shame that this is a short series, because the premise of Blazes could make for a great battle-series.Speaking of which, even though it is mostly a harem/fanservice anime, it does have some nice fight scenes which came as a bit of a surprise to me.I think it's definitely worth...the watch if you're a fan of cliche harem and fanservice. the watch if you're a fan of cliche harem and fanservice."", 'Absolute Duo is the kind of show that contains the very essence of ecchi harem action anime itself. This means that everything that happens is something you\'ve seen from another show, even it is not a copy of a particular one.I mean look at these:- The setting is in a secluded elite school/academy for super-powered high schoolers with the ability to summon magical weapons.- The phrases tsuyoku naritai and tsuyoku naru (""I want to get stronger"" and ""I will get stronger"") are said probably hundreds of times.- Among the most powerful characters are an old lab coat wearing scientist, a goth loli headmistress, and...a bunny suit+ears wearing teacher.- The main character always ""levels up"" (in this case, sometimes literally) when in peril, and his main motivation is to protect everyone due to the death of a family member (in what looks like a literal dojo). Various versions of ""I will protect you"" or ""I\'ll get stronger to protect you"" are said on average many times per episode.- Shameless ecchi fanservice with short schoolgirl skirts and other large bouncy assets abound.- A tea-sipping helicopter-riding rich blonde literal Ojousama with a maid falls for the protagonist.- The main grill is somehow living with the main character.- During fights, the villain harms a main and then just waits for them to recover because of reasons. The main character is able to not only survive but recover from severe wounds nearly instantly in some cases but not others.- The power gap between the protags and an enemy seems initially insurmountable but then is somehow just leveled after the main\'s victory.- Numerous girls fall for the main, and the other males around the main have zero interest in his girls.- The villains fight with an army of weak faceless and nameless robot-like minions (in other shows, they would be monsters or demons), yet inexplicably possess the ability to manufacture vastly more powerful suits but don\'t use more than one at a time.- Powerful abilities, moves, organizations, and events are given English names. Sometimes, a Japanese speaking character invents a name *on the spot IN ENGLISH* for something he/she just thought of.- The power of friendship, love, and caring overcomes the hateful, power-seeking bad guys.- The protagonist, multiple times, saves the life of an enemy who definitely should die, to his own detriment, by preventing a team-mate from killing them (to save the team-mate\'s conscience, presumably).- Despite events occurring that can only be described as on the level of a major terrorist attack or foreign military incursion, governmental or military responses are nowhere to be found, leaving literal schoolchildren to handle it.- The main accidentally gets into many situations involving various body parts pressed against him. There is a swim-suit beach episode. (No onsen episode BUT there is a classic onsen scene within an episode... guess you can\'t fit everything lol).Whew! Nevertheless, I didn\'t hate this show, and it did have its own unique aspects. In particular, even if some of the characters were cliches, I rather liked them and their interactions. I like the idea of characters fighting in close-knit duos, and I was surprised to see a harem member actually confess. Note also that, even though the main guy is not perfect, he is not a punk b!|ch, which I appreciated. The characters are not annoying or cringey.Also, to be honest, I find many anime cliches to be quite amusing, as opposed to irritating, so please, decide for yourself if you are ok with this. Constantly saying ""I will proteccc you!"" and ""I will grow stronger!"" is not one of them though, anime, so please, it\'s time to stop. Same for giving English names to moves/abilities that don\'t really need names in any language, let alone a foreign one.I\'d classify this one as follows:- Moe: medium-low- Comedy: medium-low- Drama: medium-low- Action: high- Romance: medium-low- Harem: high- Ecchi: mediumSeveral of the main grills, Miyabi, Julie, and even Lilith (though not at the start... give her a few episodes) are kawaii to some extent, so I give some moe points. The show has pretty continuous, decently animated action scenes, interspersed with slice-of-life-style comedic ecchi harem antics. There is also some pretty serious material (many characters are traumatized by memories of loved ones murdered in cold blood, for instance), something I often don\'t like mixing with more silly material, but I feel they did ok in not making the transition too jarring. Although this is a harem show, there isn\'t much romance or drama, except for a single confession and its fallout, and some light ""rivals bickering"" (which I classify under harem comedy rather than romantic drama).Overall though, you should only watch this show if you are not bothered by hilariously large plotholes (despite being an incredibly predictable plot), baffling character decisions, and ""y tho"" moments. For instance, the main character\'s ""weapon"" is a tiny shield on his forearm. The total lack of utility this tool possesses is only emphasized by his need to use his fists to actually do any fighting. But... why is it so small? How can it protect anything? How can he block slashes to his legs? How is he able to block multiple simultaneous ranged enemy projectiles? (spoiler: he usually can\'t). So why is he so powerful? I wish he could enlarge the shield or something. Another example: character motivations, such as the main ""bad guy"" Equipment Smith (yes, in English, of course) or the headmistress (constantly talking about Absolute Duo [again in English] yet never explaining it), are simply absent. At least the two mains have motivations, albeit simple ones. Actually, this show could use significantly more world-building in general, to be honest.Anyway, this review makes it sound like I didn\'t like the show, and sure it has problems, but I actually quite enjoyed it overall. I\'m 100% sure there are a lot of people thinking, ""man, this guy is the problem with modern anime"" *tips fedora*, but hey I don\'t criticize anyone else\'s tastes. Personally, even if ""the story/characters is cliche"", that doesn\'t make it bad or unenjoyable. In fact, I think it\'s important to take each show on its own, not only think about in comparison to other shows. Even if it was inspired by one or more other shows, the author has injected his own ideas into it: whether it is the magic weaponry mechanism, character designs (inward or... otherwise ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ), back-stories, world-building, etc...Just go in knowing what to expect: for me, as soon as I saw the first few minutes where the protag gazes in awe at the wind-swept hair of a white-haired twin-tailed girl under falling cherry blossoms, I knew what I was in for. You\'ll have super-powered fight scenes with panty shots and bouncing jello. You\'ll hear a character referring to the main as ""future husband"" and not even getting a reaction to this.

It's a sweet anime.  It has it's problems, and they tended to become worse as the series progressed, which is a shame.  But I do not understand the dismissiveness of the other reviewers.  There's a lot worse out there.  Like many anime, the ending was unsatisfying.If you'd like a sweet action-harem, you should watch Absolute Duo.  I never skip the opening.

I can enjoy Harem anime (though I prefer a standard romance) but for the love of everything, please please please make me give a damn about the characters.

Ok review time.Story: it's the basic fantasy school setting harem anime, the MC doesn't start off too over powered at the beginning and has a unique ability that no one else has. Also has a decent pace and doesn't have too much filler.Art: it's not bad, definitely seen better and worse but it just looks like a 100 other anime, doesn't really have it's own style. The animation is crisp and doesn't have any blow outs or goofy looking background characters or blurry faces in the distance.Sound: the...OP & ED wasn't very good, pretty forgettable to be honest. Voice acting and SFX were pretty good though in my opinion, if not for the OP & ED the sound would have had a better rating.Characters: pretty much your basic harem protagonist and group of girls, 3 big boobed girls with different hair colors and then the obligatory loli. The characters are drawn well and the back and foreground are not blurry and don't look rushed.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime when I was first starting to watch anime, it all depends on your taste but I'm sure most people could get enough enjoyment to make this anime worth watching once.Overall: it is a typical harem anime set in a fantasy world at a school for teenagers with special abilities, trying to create Absolute Duo. It's a fun watch and at only 12 episodes it's won't take long to watch. It also has a manga and light novel so if you did enjoy it and would like more content, try checking those out.Thanks for reading and I hope you find this review helpful in some way.

The characters are drawn well and the back and foreground are not blurry and don't look rushed.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime when I was first starting to watch anime, it all depends on your taste but I'm sure most people could get enough enjoyment to make this anime worth watching once.Overall: it is a typical harem anime set in a fantasy world at a school for teenagers with special abilities, trying to create Absolute Duo. It's a fun watch and at only 12 episodes it's won't take long to watch. It also has a manga and light novel so if you did enjoy it and would like more content, try checking those out.Thanks for reading and I hope you find this review helpful in some way."", ""Absolute Duo was a complete waste of time.Somehow, the first few episodes had my hopes up. The attitude was cute and it looked like things could get interesting. Don't be fooled though. The show gets worse and worse with every episode. The only thing this anime did well was the art. The story is just so boring. The characters are so boring. The fanservice is not worth it at all. The music is nothing special. It really feels like this anime jumped on the ecchi train with no real ideas. In the end, it's so hard to say anything good about this. Just please pass...on this one. on this one."", 'This is literally the most ""meh"" anime I\'ve ever watched, there\'s nothing special about it at all so I don\'t really have much to say about it. Based on the ending, I think it\'s pretty safe to say that this was supposed to be longer than 1 season. It seemed to me like Sakuya was supposed to be the stories actual villain, her motives and calculative actions reminded me of Alister Crowley from Torau, a villain operating in secret behind the scenes and manipulating all of the events going on around the protagonists, I strongly believe that is what the author was going for. IDK...what went wrong with the Light Novels but regardless, this is really just a normal magic harem anime with a beach episode at the worst possible time. I do strongly think that this is really over hated though, because I did like it to some extent. Or maybe I just have watched too much harem anime and I need a doctor, IDK. what went wrong with the Light Novels but regardless, this is really just a normal magic harem anime with a beach episode at the worst possible time.

Now the way I usually watch light-hearted shows like these is by listening to the dub and playing a game or doing some work while it\'s going on.  I ""watch"" shows this way because I had a general idea of what kind of show it would be and I could probably guess what was going on at any point. However, for this show I actually made an effort to keep my eyes on...the video itself. For the first 3 episodes, the buildup was quite nice and thought I might be in for something more. However, episode 4 onward (to when I dropped the show midway through episode 8) just felt depressing. I really disliked how the overall plot was hardly developed and how random ecchi moments were just scattered with seemingly no care. You would have serious battle situations that suddenly lost all tension because one of the girls thought he panties might be exposed to the male protag and panics. Now my gripes with this show primarily come down to my personal sense of humor and standards. I am sure that there are plenty of people who would enjoy a show like this. But as someone who has watched anime for many many years, I think this show has aged very poorly due to the overall rise in quality and harems in shows executed much ""better"".Story:The male Protag\'s intentions for coming to the blaze academy are revealed slowly but it suffices for a motivation. However, the other characters\' intentions are hardly explained. Julie allegedly has a reason similar to the male protag (:O SHOCKER). Gold hair apparently is just stuck up and was bored. Miyabe seems like she doesn\'t want to be here. Tomoe seems determined to learn what she can... whatever her reason may be. The real problem comes with how the overall plot is revealed, tiny tiny pieces of foreshadowing are given throughout the first few episodes but almost nothing of importance actually happens. To avoid spoilers: one character does something very very bad but then all is well the next day no questions asked. The plot after episode 3 just feels kind of pointless, nothing of much significance really happens. Basically the reason I don\'t like the story is because they mix foreshadowing with pointless drivel.Art:Not pretty not ugly, the animation is passable. Notably the camera is very frequently zoomed in onto one of the female characters\' breasts for some inexplicable reason. I\'m serious, there are so many boob shots in this show that I got bored every time there was an ecchi scene. By the way, there is no nudity as miraculous streaks of light and hair cover the body parts. I don\'t have much more to say about this.Sound:The dub voice acting was solid, but some of the lines were so unbearably corny. Neither the OP or ED is particularly memorable. Fights sounded like fights, I wasn\'t terribly engaged by the music or sound effects.Character:Male Protag: Same as every other ecchi harem showJulie: Flat-chested and naive (innocent) girlBlonde Hair: Not flat-chested and openly sexual girlBlack Hair: Not flat-chested and serious girlBrown Hair: Not flat-chested and shy girlIf most of these characters sound boring to you, then I think you should avoid this show. These general descriptions describe their entire personality throughout the entire show. And yes I\'m not kidding, their breast size is relevant enough to be considered a personality trait.Enjoyment:I got bored very very quicklyI\'m writing this past midnight because I just dropped the show and the game I wanted to play still hadn\'t loaded.

Absolute Duo, an anime that promises to be an epic, action-packed adventure, but falls short in so many ways. After watching this show, I've come to the conclusion that there are three unique things about it, and three annoying things as well. Let's start with the unique things:- The concept of wielding weapons made from one's soul is pretty cool.- The fight scenes are visually stunning.- Some of the character designs are interesting and memorable.But of course, where there's good, there's...bad:- The plot is predictable and lacking in originality.- The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable.- The fan service is cringe-worthy and unnecessary.Now, onto the more in-depth review:The story of Absolute Duo follows the adventures of Tooru Kokonoe, a high school student who enrolls in a special academy for those who can summon weapons from their souls. Along the way, he meets a variety of characters who become his friends and allies as they battle against evil forces.While the concept of soul weapons is intriguing, the execution of the plot leaves much to be desired. It follows a typical shonen anime formula, with predictable twists and turns that don't really add anything new or exciting to the genre.One aspect of the show that I did appreciate was the animation style. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and visually stunning, making them a joy to watch.As for the characters, there are a few that stand out, such as the spunky and confident Julie Sigtuna. However, for the most part, they fall flat and lack any real depth or development.The music in Absolute Duo is forgettable at best. While it's not terrible, it's nothing special either and fails to enhance the viewing experience.Despite its flaws, I did find myself somewhat enjoying Absolute Duo. It's not a show that I would rave about, but it's also not the worst anime I've ever seen.Now, onto the rating. I give Absolute Duo a 6,636 out of 10. This may seem like a strange number, but it's because the show has moments of greatness, but ultimately falls short due to its lackluster plot and unrelatable characters.Despite its flaws, I would still recommend Absolute Duo to those who are fans of the shonen anime genre. While it may not be groundbreaking, it still has some enjoyable moments and is worth a watch for those who are looking for a mindless action series to pass the time.--------------------------------------Baiklah, apa yang kita miliki di sini? Absolute Duo, sebuah anime yang menjanjikan petualangan yang epik dan penuh aksi, namun gagal dalam banyak hal. Setelah menonton acara ini, saya telah menyimpulkan bahwa ada tiga hal unik tentangnya, dan tiga hal yang menjengkelkan juga. Mari kita mulai dengan hal-hal unik:- Konsep senjata yang terbuat dari jiwa seseorang cukup keren.- Adegan pertarungan secara visual memukau.- Beberapa desain karakter menarik dan mudah diingat.Namun tentu saja, di mana ada yang baik, ada yang buruk:- Plotnya dapat ditebak dan kurang orisinal.- Karakternya satu dimensi dan sulit dihubungkan.- Fanservisnya sangat membingungkan dan tidak perlu.Sekarang, pada ulasan yang lebih mendalam:Kisah Absolute Duo mengikuti petualangan Tooru Kokonoe, seorang siswa SMA yang mendaftar di sebuah akademi khusus untuk orang-orang yang bisa memanggil senjata dari jiwa mereka. Sepanjang jalan, ia bertemu dengan berbagai karakter yang menjadi teman dan sekutunya saat mereka bertarung melawan kekuatan jahat.Meskipun konsep senjata jiwa menarik, pelaksanaannya dalam plot masih banyak kekurangan. Ini mengikuti formula anime shonen yang khas, dengan plot twist yang dapat ditebak dan tidak benar-benar menambahkan hal baru atau menarik ke dalam genre.Salah satu aspek dari acara tersebut yang saya hargai adalah gaya animasinya. Adegan pertarungan indah dikoreografi dan secara visual memukau, membuatnya menjadi kegembiraan untuk ditonton.Untuk karakter, ada beberapa yang menonjol, seperti Julie Sigtuna yang bersemangat dan percaya diri. Namun, sebagian besar dari mereka terlihat datar dan kurang memiliki kedalaman atau perkembangan yang nyata.Musik dalam Absolute Duo terlupakan. Meskipun tidak buruk, tidak ada yang spesial juga dan gagal meningkatkan pengalaman menonton.Meskipun memiliki kekurangan, saya masih menikmati Absolute Duo. Ini bukan acara yang akan saya puji, tetapi juga bukan anime terburuk yang pernah saya tonton.Sekarang, pada peringkatnya. Saya memberi Absolute Duo peringkat 6.636 dari 10. Ini mungkin terlihat seperti angka aneh, tetapi karena acara ini memiliki momen kehebatan, tetapi pada akhirnya gagal karena plot yang kurang memikat dan karakter yang tidak dapat dihubungkan.Meskipun memiliki kekurangan, saya masih akan merekomendasikan Absolute Duo kepada penggemar genre anime shonen. Meskipun tidak groundbreaking, masih ada beberapa momen yang menyenangkan dan layak ditonton bagi mereka yang mencari seri aksi yang sederhana untuk menghabiskan waktu. bad:- The plot is predictable and lacking in originality.- The characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable.- The fan service is cringe-worthy and unnecessary.Now, onto the more in-depth review:The story of Absolute Duo follows the adventures of Tooru Kokonoe, a high school student who enrolls in a special academy for those who can summon weapons from their souls.

I enjoyed the characters and the fighting sequences. What I hated was that it felt unfinished. We didn't get much background information of these guys. They didn't explain who Julie and Torr wanted revenge on, no information about who killed his sister, nothing. The romance really grinded my gears here also. Miyoby pretty much professed her love for Torr and he outright rejected her, which sucked because I felt no romantic feelings between him and Julie, just a sibling relationship. I did enjoy Lilith's character though. They could have delved more into her relationship with the principal though. I felt...like so much of the story was still missing, which, I wouldn't be mad if they decided to do a season 2. It just felt incomplete. Overall, it was a good time waster of an anime. like so much of the story was still missing, which, I wouldn't be mad if they decided to do a season 2. It just felt incomplete.

I still have no idea what this ""Absolute Duo"" thing is. For a show that repeatedly uses that tagline and dozens of exposition. One would imagine that I would know what the most important aspect of the anime is. However, Absolute Duo is absolutely garbage.I\'m someone who is very keen on Romantic-Comedy, Battle-Harems because I grew up around the harem genre, and love how cliche it can be. Absolute Duo literally checks all the boxes: Beach Episode, Battling Girlfriends, Non-Dense MC, Mall Episode. There literally is nothing more that I could want, but the anime is horrendous.The...story takes place in an unknown universe where people get injected with various ""serums"" (?) chemicals (?)... I don\'t even know. Nevertheless, they gain superhuman capabilities to crystallize their soul into equipment called ""Blazes"". It\'s nearly as bad as Hundred\'s naming for various pieces of equipment.Nothing really happens in this beyond the first couple of episodes. There is a bad guy that appears way too much after the 4 episode, and isn\'t given a proper backstory until he\'s unfortunately gutted. The story lacks any sort of build up or character motivations. The writers seem to have forgotten that motivations aren\'t only created through memories. The MCs get their melancholic, deeply rooted motivations from traumatizing events as a child. This would be a common vehicle to build motivations, but it doesn\'t work because IT\'S ONLY A FLASHBACK. No explanations beyond what can be seen in the flashback because that would make too much sense.From the lack of storytelling, it severely degrades the characters and world-building (just kidding there is no world-building) within the show. Everything about the world and its people are just cookie-cutter afterthoughts. The only love and care that was put into this show was lillith, but that\'s only because she showed some fire and tenacity to try to acheive things that she wanted. She was reactive. She felt like a human being I could meet. Unfortunate that she wasn\'t given a lot of screen.The sound and art are nothing to write home about either. The piano interludes while cutesy aren\'t special. It\'s the basic A-B-A movements that can be heard in every single anime created in the 2014-2016 of the same genre. It can be very repetitive and disheartening. The OPs and EDs aren\'t stellar either. The animation quality is interesting to say the least, but get old after the 2nd and 3rd watch. The only thing I cannot dismiss in this anime art-wise is K\'s character in the last episode of the show. That CG was mindblowingly horrific. It was only there for 6 seconds, but it looks like a clay monster that was painted with watercolors was in the frames. NOPE. Not good enough.Absolute Duo is a shallow, mixed bag of emotions. Most of those emotions being quite negative. There really isn\'t much to say. It started off like almost every battle harem between 2012-2016, and it ended very poorly like many of them did as well. Shallow characters. Poor writing. Middling execution make for a show that is absolute garbage.

So, the strong part of the series should have been the charachters and their motivations, and desires.Unfortunately this anime never capitalizes on that,  The writers had many intriguing back stories for their charachters, but didn't provide any sort of closure for any of them.  The story itself opened many plotlines, but in the end focused more on jiggle physics instead of charachter development.Ultimately thats what make this anime dissapointing.  It could have been much more than just a harem series, with unneccesary amounts...of ecchi.  If the series had put the same work into charachter development that they did into juggle physics, the series could have been top notch.On to the voice acting -  I am a person that prefers dubs over subs most of the time, but in the case of Absolute Duo the sub was far superior.  The Japanese VA's gave the charachters depth and emotion, whereas the English VA's felt pretty flat in comparison.  The English VA's take away the charachters depth and charachter development.Music - A big reason why I enjoy this series  was because of the music.  The OP is in my top 10, if not top 5 in the harem/ecchi genre.  The OP pumps you up, and the EDs are kinda forgettable, but they also mark the changes in the story arcs. That is something that I find admirable overall.  The background music throughout the series really shines in the battle scenes, and keeps you engaged in the story when the voice acting or art does not.Animation - I enjoyed the art style of this show.  The charachters were each unique and distinguishable from each other and all of them had a certain charm to their design.  Unfortunately, the series could not capitalize on the designs.  The art was anything, but fluid.  The movements were awkward, disjointed, and unnatural.  (Plus there was way too much attention put into the jiggle of each charachters breasts as they moved.    It felt like the director put all of the animation budget into the battle scenes.  The battke scenes were easily the best animated portion of the series, but they couldn't cover up how poor the rest of the animation really was.All of that being said - I really did enjoy this series for the potential that it gave.  The first 3 episodes hinted at something grand, and the rest of the series just couldn't compare.

In fact, if you were to read the premise, you would most likely dismiss it as just another run-of-the-mill magic school harem series and, well, that\'s actually pretty accurate. Nevertheless, it does do just enough things differently that allows it to stand above a typical example of the genre, with great music, good action scenes and a very likable pair of main characters, all of which manage to make the anime quite enjoyable in spite of itself.Story (6/10):""Absolute Duo"" follows two main characters- a young...Japanese boy named Tooru ""Tor"" Kokonoe and a strange Scandinavian girl named Julie Sigtuna, both of whom have recently enrolled in the prestigious Koruryu Academy, which trains teenagers in combat so that they can become future peacekeepers. For this, they are injected with a mysterious liquid that grants them the ability to manifest a weapon called a Blaze, which takes the form of a different type of weapon depending on the person, usually as a reflection of some aspect of their personality. However, Tor ends up being unique in that his Blaze manifests as a shield, making him something known as an ""Irregular"". After a rather brutal entrance ceremony, involving all of the students fighting each other and the losers being dismissed from the academy, Tor and Julie not only end up in the same class but get paired together as partners and roommates via the school\'s ""Duo"" system, hence the title ""Absolute Duo"".Yeah, as I said, it\'s almost definitely something you\'ve heard or seen before, and this isn\'t at all helped by the ridiculously fast pacing. Without warning and less than halfway through the first episode, we\'re thrown into a bunch of fights that happen all at the same time, with the only one that gets any real focus being the one between Tor and this girl called Imari. The series just doesn\'t seem to know how to slow down, which may have something to do with the fact that it tries to ram 4 light novels worth of content into only 12 episodes, when most light novel anime of the same length generally cover 2 or 3 volumes. As a result, some explanations to things are poor at best and non-existent at worst, and you will have to do a little digging outside the anime to get the full gist out of certain scenes or even characters. Furthermore, Kouryu Academy is shown frequently to be engaged in some pretty shady stuff, and yet aside from a few lines of dialogue, this is barely acknowledged and has no real bearing on the actual story, which I know will disappoint or even annoy some people.That being said, the story does have one thing that manages to keep it bearable, that being the growing relationship between the two main characters, Tor and Julie. Going into the series, I was concerned that the story wouldn\'t treat a teenage boy and girl sharing a room like it\'s a big deal, but it actually treats it precisely as awkward as it sounds, at least initially, with Tor being extremely adamant to the entire thing and Julie not having a problem with it only serving to highlight how innocent and weird she is. After some awkward tension, however, Tor decides to become Julie\'s permanent partner after her failure to find a different one, and from then on, the duo become pretty much inseparable, with it being made clear that they wouldn\'t break up their partnership even if the school didn\'t forbid it. Furthermore, they soon discover that, despite their vastly different backgrounds, the two have both suffered a very similar tragedy, which is their whole motivation for enrolling at the academy in the first place. Their empathic relationship is certainly sweet, as you see the two of them slowly bond over their mutually tragic pasts, and I love a good tragic past. Unfortunately, the relationship\'s status as a saving grace is ultimately quite limited, especially since the series ends right when certain things begin to come to light, and with no second season planned as of now, it is unlikely that we will ever see this continued.Art & Animation (8/10):The visuals are relatively hit-and-miss. On the surface, the series looks great, with the character models and environments being very detailed and well-drawn, and there are some great special effects too, the manifestation of a character\'s Blaze being a standout example. Look closer, however, and you will start to see some pretty big problems. For example, the animations during fight scenes are fairly lacklustre, with there being more than one occasion when a moving weapon looks as though it was etched onto the screen, which, while not a deal-breaker, really takes away from the experience. There\'s also a good bit of deranged animation here and there, but that\'s thankfully saved for when it actually makes sense to use.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):If there\'s one thing ""Absolute Duo"" does really well, it\'s the music, in particular the opening theme ""Absolute Soul"", which is a fantastic opening theme that I found myself listening to every time I started a new episode and is used brilliantly during the climax of the final episode. The three ending themes, ""BelievexBelieve"", ""Apple Tea"" and ""2x2"" are great as well, and perfectly fit the characters of each of the four main heroines, with the latter theme being sung by two of their seiyus. The voice acting is very good as well, with Ricco Fajardo and Bryn Apprill delivering great performances as the lead duo and the rest of the cast doing good jobs as well, though some are definitely better than others. Whitney Rodgers\' performance in particular really took me by surprise, as Tomoe is a far cry from the snarky tomboys she usually voices, yet she still managed to nail her character really well.Characters (7/10):For the most part, Tor manages to avoid the pitfalls you\'d normally expect from a male lead of this genre. For one thing, he\'s not stupid- far from it, in fact. He is very smart and tactical and acts as the strategist between him and Julie, which is very necessary since, with a shield for a Blaze, he can\'t contribute much in terms of overall strength. Additionally, while he\'s very polite to people in general, he\'ll occasionally make a comment that implies that he doesn\'t particularly like or think much of a certain person, which helps flesh out his personality and shows that while he may be a nice guy, he\'s not a pushover. He\'s also shown to be able to notice the affection of the girls surrounding him, but thinks he isn\'t good enough for any of them because he isn\'t strong enough to protect them, which is all but outright stated to stem from grief over not being able to prevent the death of his younger sister, something he\'s clearly traumatized by despite mostly acting quite cheerful. Don\'t get me wrong, though. He\'s not the most engaging male lead out there, and there are a couple of clichés associated with him, but these are obscure enough that he\'s nothing if not likeable.That being said, in true harem anime fashion, the real star of the show is not Tor, but the main heroine Julie. If you\'re tired of the main heroine always being a tsundere, then Julie will feel like a breath of fresh air, as of all the heroine archetypes, the closest she fits is dandere, being very shy, reserved and quiet, but also really sweet and gentle. She\'s very small with a doll-like appearance, which is noted in-universe, but is definitely not one to be underestimated, and does most of the heavy-lifting between herself and Tor. Basically, she\'s the muscle while he\'s the brains. As mentioned above, she can also be quite weird at times; for one, she has no problem being half-naked in front of Tor and doesn\'t seem to see anything wrong with sleeping in the same bed as him. She also occasionally says things with a clear innuendo behind them, though that\'s more due to the language barrier than not knowing any better, due to her being from Scandinavia. She also doesn\'t seem to be quite as affected by her past as Tor, with certain details not being revealed until the final episode of the series. Overall, however, Julie is just adorable, and I found myself being able to watch the series to the end for the simple fact that she was in it, let alone as the main heroine and of equal importance to Tor.My feelings regarding the rest of Tor\'s harem are rather mixed. First, there\'s Tomoe Tachibana, who I definitely liked, more so than any other character besides Julie and Tor. She generally acts like a traditional Japanese lady, which is reflected by her Blaze being a kusarigama, a traditional Japanese weapon, and while does have a habit of jumping to conclusions, she\'s willing to admit she\'s wrong if someone explains the situation to her, though she\'s a bit too eager to apologise in those incidents. Overall, she\'s a very kind and polite girl who cares a great deal for those around her, which is shown to the fullest in the last few episodes. Her partner, Miyabi Hotaka, is not as good a character, as while she\'s quite likable for most of the series, she, without spoiling anything, ends up doing a bunch of things in the last few episodes that are rather poorly-explained, making her one of those characters where you\'ll have to dig outside the anime to get the full gist of. Last and least, we have Lilith Bristol, a British transfer student and Blaze wielder known as an ""Exception"", which basically means that rules don\'t apply to her, which she exploits to no end. While some may appreciate her being more honest and straightforward in regards to her feelings, that unfortunately manifests in the form of her being very entitled and acting as though Tor belongs to her, with no real consideration for how he feels or what he wants, which can be very annoying, to say the least. Besides the main cast, there are other characters of note, like Tor\'s childhood friend Aoi Torasaki, but they\'re not all that important, and overall I think I\'ve said my piece on this category.Enjoyment (7.5/10):While the fight scenes are not particularly well-animated, they\'re still very entertaining, especially since it\'s a joy to see how well Tor and Julie work together as a team. The comedy is very good as well, and there was more than one occasion where I found myself laughing for a really long time. The fast pacing can put a dent in the enjoyment at times, but never enough that I found myself wanting to give up on the series.Overall:""Absolute Duo"" is the absolute definition of a guilty pleasure- a hackneyed series that manages to make the most out of its limited potential. The problem is that very fact is also what makes it difficult to recommend, and ultimately I wouldn\'t be able to blame you if you decided to give this one a pass. Unless, of course, you enjoy harem anime with most of the clichés you\'d expect. If that is the case, then by all means try it.Score:6+8+8.5+7+7.5=37/50=7.4/10 Japanese boy named Tooru ""Tor"" Kokonoe and a strange Scandinavian girl named Julie Sigtuna, both of whom have recently enrolled in the prestigious Koruryu Academy, which trains teenagers in combat so that they can become future peacekeepers. For this, they are injected with a mysterious liquid that grants them the ability to manifest a weapon called a Blaze, which takes the form of a different type of weapon depending on the person, usually as a reflection of some aspect of their personality. However, Tor ends up being unique in that his Blaze manifests as a shield, making him something known as an ""Irregular"". After a rather brutal entrance ceremony, involving all of the students fighting each other and the losers being dismissed from the academy, Tor and Julie not only end up in the same class but get paired together as partners and roommates via the school\'s ""Duo"" system, hence the title ""Absolute Duo"".Yeah, as I said, it\'s almost definitely something you\'ve heard or seen before, and this isn\'t at all helped by the ridiculously fast pacing. Without warning and less than halfway through the first episode, we\'re thrown into a bunch of fights that happen all at the same time, with the only one that gets any real focus being the one between Tor and this girl called Imari. The series just doesn\'t seem to know how to slow down, which may have something to do with the fact that it tries to ram 4 light novels worth of content into only 12 episodes, when most light novel anime of the same length generally cover 2 or 3 volumes. As a result, some explanations to things are poor at best and non-existent at worst, and you will have to do a little digging outside the anime to get the full gist out of certain scenes or even characters. Furthermore, Kouryu Academy is shown frequently to be engaged in some pretty shady stuff, and yet aside from a few lines of dialogue, this is barely acknowledged and has no real bearing on the actual story, which I know will disappoint or even annoy some people.That being said, the story does have one thing that manages to keep it bearable, that being the growing relationship between the two main characters, Tor and Julie. Going into the series, I was concerned that the story wouldn\'t treat a teenage boy and girl sharing a room like it\'s a big deal, but it actually treats it precisely as awkward as it sounds, at least initially, with Tor being extremely adamant to the entire thing and Julie not having a problem with it only serving to highlight how innocent and weird she is. After some awkward tension, however, Tor decides to become Julie\'s permanent partner after her failure to find a different one, and from then on, the duo become pretty much inseparable, with it being made clear that they wouldn\'t break up their partnership even if the school didn\'t forbid it. Furthermore, they soon discover that, despite their vastly different backgrounds, the two have both suffered a very similar tragedy, which is their whole motivation for enrolling at the academy in the first place. Their empathic relationship is certainly sweet, as you see the two of them slowly bond over their mutually tragic pasts, and I love a good tragic past. Unfortunately, the relationship\'s status as a saving grace is ultimately quite limited, especially since the series ends right when certain things begin to come to light, and with no second season planned as of now, it is unlikely that we will ever see this continued.Art & Animation (8/10):The visuals are relatively hit-and-miss. On the surface, the series looks great, with the character models and environments being very detailed and well-drawn, and there are some great special effects too, the manifestation of a character\'s Blaze being a standout example. Look closer, however, and you will start to see some pretty big problems.

The execution, however, falls short in a number of ways, making for a lackluster viewing experience despite its intriguing notion.Animations and Visuals:Absolute Duo\'s animations and graphics are passable but fall short of making an impression. The character designs are uninspired and unoriginal, sharing many of the same characteristics as those in other anime shows. Even though the action scenes are well orchestrated, they lack the power and flow necessary to be genuinely...captivating. The scenery and surroundings are comparatively unimpressive and lack the depth and richness required to provide an immersive visual experience.Characters:Absolute Duo\'s characters struggle with being flat and undeveloped. Tooru Kokonoe, the main character, is a stereotypically overpowering hero with a tragic backstory. His relationships with the other characters are superficial and don\'t make the audience feel anything. His peers and adversaries are equally one-dimensional, frequently adhering to formulaic character archetypes without any development or nuance. The audience\'s ability to empathize with them and get emotionally invested in their troubles is hampered by the absence of character development.Story and Themes:The plot of Absolute Duo adheres to the well-worn formula of a high school setting with paranormal components. It centers on Tooru and his fellow students at the Kouryou Academy, where they receive their training to become fighters known as ""Duos."" Unfortunately, the story doesn\'t have any noteworthy surprises or interesting plot turns. The series\' emphasis on fan service and formulaic romance subplots obscures the superficial exploration of topics like friendship, perseverance, and self-discovery. Absolute Duo doesn\'t stand out among other anime series since its topics and plot lack complexity and creativity.Sounds and Music:Absolute Duo features adequate but average sound and music. The background music suits the situation just right, yet it does nothing to intensify the mood or lift the emotions. With few exceptional performances that would make an enduring impression, the voice acting performances vary from acceptable to mediocre. Although the action scene sound effects are passable, they do not considerably enhance the overall experience.Conclusion:Despite its intriguing idea, Absolute Duo fails to produce an engaging and memorable anime series. The story\'s overall effect is hampered by the mediocre animations and graphics, as well as the undeveloped and bland characters. The plot lacks substance, and it relies too much on cliches to differentiate itself from similar works. Although the music and noises are adequate, they don\'t considerably improve the viewing experience. Absolute Duo ultimately falls short of realizing its promise and becomes a forgettable contribution to the wide world of anime. It could be appealing to people who enjoy the typical high school supernatural scenarios, but if you\'re looking for something more interesting and unique, you should look into other possibilities. captivating. The scenery and surroundings are comparatively unimpressive and lack the depth and richness required to provide an immersive visual experience.Characters:Absolute Duo\'s characters struggle with being flat and undeveloped. Tooru Kokonoe, the main character, is a stereotypically overpowering hero with a tragic backstory. His relationships with the other characters are superficial and don\'t make the audience feel anything. His peers and adversaries are equally one-dimensional, frequently adhering to formulaic character archetypes without any development or nuance. The audience\'s ability to empathize with them and get emotionally invested in their troubles is hampered by the absence of character development.Story and Themes:The plot of Absolute Duo adheres to the well-worn formula of a high school setting with paranormal components. It centers on Tooru and his fellow students at the Kouryou Academy, where they receive their training to become fighters known as ""Duos."" Unfortunately, the story doesn\'t have any noteworthy surprises or interesting plot turns. The series\' emphasis on fan service and formulaic romance subplots obscures the superficial exploration of topics like friendship, perseverance, and self-discovery. Absolute Duo doesn\'t stand out among other anime series since its topics and plot lack complexity and creativity.Sounds and Music:Absolute Duo features adequate but average sound and music. The background music suits the situation just right, yet it does nothing to intensify the mood or lift the emotions. With few exceptional performances that would make an enduring impression, the voice acting performances vary from acceptable to mediocre. Although the action scene sound effects are passable, they do not considerably enhance the overall experience.Conclusion:Despite its intriguing idea, Absolute Duo fails to produce an engaging and memorable anime series. The story\'s overall effect is hampered by the mediocre animations and graphics, as well as the undeveloped and bland characters. The plot lacks substance, and it relies too much on cliches to differentiate itself from similar works. Although the music and noises are adequate, they don\'t considerably improve the viewing experience. Absolute Duo ultimately falls short of realizing its promise and becomes a forgettable contribution to the wide world of anime.

Lots of smaller details are referenced and we have a good competitive view, but, why develop into reaching ""Absolute Duo"" if there isn\'t a big threat to the world? I haven\'t seen a good enough reasoning behind it yet. I\'m giving the anime an 8/10 because it has a good story and awesome animation. But, it definitely could be quite a bit better.

While this anime doesn't trend towards any of those things, it is fun to watch nonetheless without putting too much seriousness to the plot (potentially to its detriment). The heroes, a plucky Tor Koknoe and his partner, the ever reserved and regal Julie Sigtuna, are a loveable pairing whose partnership is the main focus of this series, and perhaps one that is detracted by the harem-leaning aspects of this series. Other notable characters include the ever energetic and psychopathic homeroom teacher Rito Tsukimi, whose alternating personalities...between bunny maid and demented sadist are always a joy to watch, and Miyabi Hotaka, whose realization of love towards Tor and inability to accept rejection leads her down to a villainous path, one that is always welcomed by this reviewer due to its ability to explore the emotional complexities through moral wrong. The production is standard for its kind of anime, but that doesn't mean it doesn't merit a watch, but if you're looking for something more engrossing, this won't be able to satisfy. 7/10 between bunny maid and demented sadist are always a joy to watch, and Miyabi Hotaka, whose realization of love towards Tor and inability to accept rejection leads her down to a villainous path, one that is always welcomed by this reviewer due to its ability to explore the emotional complexities through moral wrong.

Yes. The story is similar to some other shows, but still manages to keep you interested in the plotline. The soul weapons are very interesting, and they do a great job at giving each character a specific weapon that suits them. While some weapons seem weak, if used correctly can be on par with the rest of them. The characters themselves are a mixed bag, I enjoyed the main duo a lot. Lilith was also amazing though, and her weapon was probably my favorite from the show. If you like bunny girls then Riko Tsukimi, will probably be your favorite....The Opening for the show was good, the animation in it could have been better but the song was well song. The animation was well done though, it didn't seem to suffer from lack of animation like some shows do. The show didn't have a definitive ending, so if you are looking for a show where you wont have to read the source material for afterwards this isn't going to be the one for you. That being said it wasn't a terrible spot to end the show on, and if they did make another season for it in the future I would watch it.

""Absolute Duo"", ""The Asterisk War"" and ""Chivalry of a Failed Knight"". If you think it\'s weird, I\'d agree. 20015 and 2016 were when these titles appeared, all with the same basic plot.

And without exaggeration, I can confess that the actual opening of this adaptation was much better than the anime itself. No without a joke, the opening had better animation, better representation, and much smoother movements than the characters ever brought in the anime . This adaptation was felt with limitless clichés, a perfect ""0815""...setting, a bunch of monotonous characters, a plot that was hardly touched upon, and a protagonist who could simply drive you to the heat.

But then there were very serious problems. There were quite striking animation errors, both in the movement of characters and the proportions. Some characters looked like mutants at certain moments and also at certain distances. The other animation types were also quite an eyesore. You cannot animate anime while suddenly changing the animation style to 3D or various other types to save money. As a result, a lot of scenes were portrayed quite doll-like.
